 CONFIDENTIAL  Study Design  This is a phase 2, non -randomized, 6 -group, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_778153]. Tumor assessments will be made at the end of each treatment cycle.  
Extensive safety evaluations will occ ur on day 1 of each cycle; routine safety 
evaluations will be conducted at each cemiplimab dosing visit.  
Groups 1 and 2 patients:   Patients with metastatic CSCC are enrolled in 
Group 1 and patients with locally advanced CSCC are enrolled in Group  2 
to rec eive up to twelve 56 -day (8 -week cycles) treatment cycles for a total 
of up to 96 weeks of treatment.  Each patient will receive cemiplimab 
3 mg/kg Q2W.  
Group 3 patients :  This cohort enrolls patients with metastatic CSCC. 
Group  3 only begins enrollment after completion of enrollment to Group 1. 
Patients will receive cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W until the 54 -week 
treatment period (9 -week cycles) is complete, or until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.  No research biopsies are 
required.  
Group 4 patients :  The dose regimen in Group 4 is 600  mg IV Q4W for up 
to 48  weeks in patients with advanced CSCC.  
Group 5 patients : Patients in this cohort  will receive 1 dose of 
cemiplimab  438 mg SC, followed by [CONTACT_778181] 350 mg IV Q3W for up to 
54 weeks total treatment.  The bioavailability of cemiplimab SC will be 
assessed to determine a recommended dose of cemiplimab administered SC 
for future studies.  
Note on enrollment: Prior to the implementation of Group 6, Groups 4 and 
5 had completed enrollment.  
Group 6 patients :  This cohort enrolls patients with advanced CSCC.  The 
dose regimen is  for up to 108 weeks (9 week cycles).  
For Groups [ADDRESS_1068626] completed ≥ 27 weeks of IV study treatment 
(without disease progression) will be given the option to receive subsequent 
doses as cemiplimab SC  
 provided the criteria outlined in 
the protocol  are met.  Group 6 patients who opt to switch to SC cemiplimab 
will continue SC cemiplimab until the completion of 108 weeks of total 
planned therapy of cemiplim ab (IV + SC combined), disease progression, or 
unacceptable toxicity.

Secondary  • For patients with metastatic disease, RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_1068627] (such as 
may occur in patients with bone -only metastases).  
• For patients with unresectable locally advanced disease, clinical 
response criteria will be used to determine ORR, for externally 
visible tumor(s) use bi -dime nsional measurements according to 
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Composite 
response criteria will be used for patients who have both target 
lesions measurable by [CONTACT_778187] 
1.1 to determine ORR. In patients achievin g a CR, tumor 
biopsies will be used in the final determination of complete 
versus PR.  ORR will be calculated from time of enrollment.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• ORR for Groups [ADDRESS_1068628] 
1.1, the term “composite response assessment” is not 
applicable.  The investigator’s response assessment for such 
patients will be RECIST 1.1 assessment.  
- For unresectable loca lly advanced patients in which all 
response assessments are performed on photographs 
according to Clinical Response Criteria for Externally 
Visible Tumors, the term “composite response assessment” 
is not applicable.  The investigator’s response assessment 
for such patients will be according to Clinical Response 
Criteria for Externally Visible Tumors.  
- For patients in which target lesion response assessments are 
performed with both scans (according to RECIST 1.1) and 
photographs (according to Clinical Respons e Criteria for 
Externally Visible Tumors), the investigator’s response 
assessment will be according to Composite Response 
Criteria.  
• Duration of response (DOR) – measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR/ partial response 
(PR), whichever is recorded  first, until the first date of 
recurrent or progressive disease or death due to any cause in 
patients with best overall response (BOR ) of CR or PR.

recurrent or progressive disease, or death due to any cause  
• OS – measured from time of enrollment until death due to any 
cause  
• CR rate  
• Change in scores of patient -reported outcomes on EORTC

• AEs  
• Cemiplimab concentrations in serum  
• Anti-drug a ntibodies (ADA)  
• For Group 6 only:  To assess relationships between PD -L1 
status (by [CONTACT_4658]) and efficacy measures (ORR, DOR, PFS).  
Procedures and 
Assessments  Tumor imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI]) and digital medical photography (for externally visible 
lesions) will be performed to measure tumor burden and to characterize the 
efficacy profile of study treatments using response criteria.  
Physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), pregn ancy test for women of childbearing potential, and recording 
of AEs and concomitant medications will be performed to ensure patient 
safety and to characterize the safety profiles of study treatments.  
Other assessments will include:  
• Peripheral blood samples  for PK  
• Peripheral blood samples to assess anti -cemiplimab  antibodies   
• Tumor biopsies  
• Quality of life assessments  
• [18F]-FDG PET scans (Group 4, excluding patients enrolled at sites 
in [LOCATION_013])  
Statistical Plan  The sample sizes for each registrational group were selected such that the 
lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals of the estimated ORRs will be 
clinically meaningful. The non -clinically meaningful ORR of 15% for 
Groups  1, 3, and 4 will be excluded using the lower limit of 95% CI if the 
obser ved ORR is 28.0% or more.  For Groups 1 and 3, 50  patients (in each 
group) will be required to provide at least 85% power to reject a null 
hypothesis.  Although these groups have some statistical assumptions, 
efficacy in each group is analyzed independentl y.  For Group  2, [ADDRESS_1068629] 90% power to reject a null hypothesis. 
The non -clinically meaningful ORR of 25% for Group 2 will be excluded 
using the lower limit of 95% CI if the observed ORR is 36.1% or more.  For 
Group 4 (advanced CSCC), 60 patients will be required for 92% power to 
reject the null hypothesis.  The non -clinically meaningful ORR of 20% will 
be excluded using the lower limit of the 95% CI if the observed ORR is 
31.7% or more.  The sample sizes will be furt her increased by 5% to account

 CONFIDENTIAL  for patients who withdraw prematurely from the study.  Hence, the total 
planned sample sizes will be 53 patients for Group 1, 76  patients for 
Group  2, 53 patients for Group 3, and 63 patients for Group  4.   The 
statistical de sign for Group 6 will be capable of demonstrating a point 
estimate of ORR (per independent central review) in which the lower bound 
of the  95% confidence interval excludes the highest centrally reviewed ORR 
in the literature for any prospective study of sy stemic anticancer treatment 
(other than cemiplimab) for CSCC that enrolled at least 30  patients and 
included independent central review.  The statistical plan for Group 6 is 
capable of testing for an ORR (per independent central review) that excludes 
28% a t the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval.  
The total study will enroll up to approximately [ADDRESS_1068630] 1.1 or inevaluable b y the composite efficacy criteria will be 
considered as not reaching PR/CR for ORR.  
The primary analyses of efficacy are based on the exact binomial confidence 
interval approach, ie, whether the lower limit of 95% confidence interval 
will exclude a histori cal control ORR that is not deemed clinically 
meaningful for each group, respectively.  The secondary analyses of efficacy 
as measured by [CONTACT_109957], duration of disease control, PFS, and OS will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_109958] 95% confidence interval using the K aplan -
Meier method.  
For Groups 1 to 5, the quality of life of patients will be repeatedly measured 
by [CONTACT_20368] -C30 at the day 1 of each treatment cycle.  The change 
in scores of QLQ -C30 will be summarized descriptively at each postbaseline 
time point.  The summary scores of QLQ -C30 will also be graphically

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1. Introduction  
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common malignancy in the United 
States (US), with approximately 186,000 to 420,000 individuals diagnosed with CSCC each year 
(Karia 2013 ).  Precise incidence and mortality measurements are not available because these 
cancers are not included in the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and E nd Results (SEER) database.  A 
review of other national databases indicates that incidence of non -melanoma skin cancers, mostly 
basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and CSCC, approximately doubled between 1994  and 2006 in the 
context of an aging population ( Rogers 2010 ).  Most CSCC patients have a favorable prognosis, 
but annual mortality is approximately 3,900 to 8,800 deaths in the US ( Karia  2013 ).  Risk factors 
for CSCC include UV exposure, advanced age, and imm unosuppression ( Alam 2001 , 
Madan  2010 ).  Although the vast majority of individuals with diagnosis of CSCC or BCC have a 
very favorable prognosis, CSCC has a greater propensity for aggressive recurrences than BCC.  
Individuals diagnosed with CSCC, unlike those diagnosed with BCC, have an increased mortality 
compared with age -matched controls ( Rees 2015 ). 
In the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th Edition Staging System, tumor size les s than or 
greater than 2  cm is a key distinction between stage 1 and 2, and selected risk factors are also 
incorporated in the staging ( Farasat 2011 ).  Stage 3 designates CSCC with involvement of a single 
lymph node ≤3cm, and stage [ADDRESS_1068639] range of locally invasive tumors 
and/or distant metastatic disease ( Farasat 2011 ).  Limitations of this staging system include 
heterogeneity of outcomes in stage I and II tumors; alternative risk -adapted staging has been 
proposed but not externally validated ( Karia 2014 ).  
Surgical resection  is the centerpi[INVESTIGATOR_778156].  The primary goal is 
complete resection  of cancer, and acceptable cosmetic outcome is a  secondary goal ( Madan  2010 ).  
The choice of surgical intervention is influenced by a number of factors, including size and 
histology of the tumor, expertise of the local clinical team, and comorbidities of the patient.  
Factors ass ociated with poor prognosis in CSCC include tumor size >2  cm, tumor depth >2mm, 
perineural invasion, host immunosuppression, and recurrent lesions ( Madan 2010 , 
Schmults  2013 ). 
Efficacy for radiation thera py for CSCC has been described in the adjuvant setting in a large 
retrospective study of [ADDRESS_1068640] -operative radiation therapy had a lower rate of locoregional recurrence  
compared to those who underwent surgery only (20% vs. 43%), and superior 5 -year overall 
survival (OS) (73% vs. 54%) of CSCC ( Veness 2005 ).  In a small prospective phase [ADDRESS_1068641] -operative radiat ion (60 to 66 Gy for 6 weeks) with concurrent 
erlotinib, the 2 -year OS was 65% ( Heath 2013 ). 
For the small percentage of patients who develop unresectable locally recurrent or metastatic 
disease, treatment options are limited.  A phase [ADDRESS_1068642] form only, 
found that OS at 3 years was 54% ( Nottage 2012 ).  In a single institution retrospective case series 
of 12 patients with unresectable CSCC that were treated with radiation therapy (median dose 60  Gy 
in 30 fractions) and concurrent cetuximab, median OS was 8  months ( Samstein 2014 ).  Durable

 CONFIDENTIAL  disease control was achieved in some patients, and this retrospective study also reviewed other 
reports of CSCC treated with chemoradiotherapy (case reports, case series) in the literature, in 
which some patients experienced long term disease contr ol (Samstein 2014 ).  These results 
underscore that for patients with unresectable advanced CSCC, the malignancy is a life -threatening 
condition, but some patients may achieve durable disease control with radiation -based therapy.  As  
such, radiation -based therapy is appropriately considered for some patients with unresectable 
CSCC.  
Regarding systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], there have been single -arm studies that often contained 
heterogeneous groups of CSCC patients with different stages of diseas e, but none of these studies 
clearly demonstrated therapeutic advantage ( Maubec 2011 , Nakamura 2013 ).  As a result, there is 
a dearth of data to guide clinical decision -making for oncologists who take care of patients with 
advanced CSCC.  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not 
provide firm recommendations.  Cisplatin monotherapy, cisplatin plus 5 -fluororucacil (5 -FU), and 
cetuximab are discussed only as “possible options,” and par ticipation in clinical trials is 
recommended with the caveat that such trials are scarce ( Bichakjian 2015 ).  One factor that has 
prevented the adoption of a standard -of-care for advanced CSCC is the lack of an adequate 
demonstration  of safety of any regimen for this patient population.  Two frequently -cited studies 
of cisplatin + 5 -FU-based chemotherapy enrolled 14 and 7 advanced CSCC patients, respectively, 
and therefore were unable to provide a meaningful safety assessment ( Sadek 1990 , Khansur  1991 ).  
A more comprehensive description of the safety profile of cisplatin + 5 -FU was obtained in a large 
randomized clinical trial for a different patient population, h ead and neck squamous ce ll carcinoma  
(HNSCC).  Among 215  patients with a median age of 57  years who were treated with cisplatin + 
5-FU for advanced HNSCC, 76% experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicities.  Given that CSCC occurs 
in an older patient population ( Gray  1997 , Diffey  2005 , Karia  2014 ), the lack of optimization of 
dose and schedule of cisplatin and [ADDRESS_1068643] cycle of chemotherapy among patients with advanced solid tumors 
(Gajra  2015 ).  As such, platinum and/or 5 -FU-based chemotherapy is not an attractive option f or 
many CSCC patients due to safety and tolerability concerns associated with advanced age.  
Targeting of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) in CSCC has been explored by [CONTACT_778188]. In a phase 2 study of cetuximab monotherapy for patients with unresectable squamous cell 
carcinoma of the skin, median age was 79 years ( Maubec  2011 ).  The observed response rate was 
28% (10/36 patients), median progression -free survival (PFS) was 4.1  months, and median OS 
was 8.1 months ( Maubec  2011 ).  A phase 2 study of panitumumab enrolled 16  patients with 
advanced CSCC that was deemed incurable; 2  patients had metastatic disease ( Foote 2014 ). 
Overall response rate (ORR) was 31% (95% CI: 11 -59%).  These studies of EGFR -targeting 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) share some of the same limitations of the studies of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy that were noted above, including small sample size and lack of demonstration of 
benefit in quality of life.  
A review of the published literature for systemic therapy for CSCC demonstrates that response 
rates appear to be associated with extent of disease. Table  [ADDRESS_1068644]

tumors are generally higher than response rates for tumors that have metastasized to regional 
lymph nodes or distant visceral sites.  As such, in prospective clinical research for patients with 
advanced CSCC, it is appropriate to evaluate patients with locally advanced CSCC as a distinct

 CONFIDENTIAL  Additional Background for Amendment 6:   Designs for new Groups 4 and 5 will encompass all 
advanced CSCC (defined as either metastatic [nodal or distant] CSCC or locally advanced CSCC 
that is not appropriate for surgery) as one entity.  
Additional B ackground for Amendment 7:  As was done in  Groups 4 and 5,  Group  6 will be 
open to all advanced CSCC patients.  The intent of Group 6 is to provide additional efficacy and 
safety data for  IV for patients with advanced CSCC.  
Additional Background for Amendment 9:  Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_778157] 5 (n=9), a single 
SC dose was shown to be  well tolerated. The bioavailability of a single dose of cemiplimab SC 
was approximately 83% in Group 5 (Regeneron, data on file). Bas ed on the desirability of 
improving patient convenience factors for treatment, and our initial experience in Group 5, it is 
appropriate to explore repeat doses of cemiplimab SC. Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1068645] completed ≥27 weeks of IV cemiplimab treatment 
(which corresponds to the first 3 tumor assessments on treatment)  the option to receive subsequent 
doses  
 
Additional patients may be offered one of these options as available.    
1.2. Rationale  
1.2.1.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
For Groups 1 and 2:   In the Dose Escalation portion of the FIH study of cemiplimab (R2810 -
ONC -1423), no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  The dose escalation portion of the study 
established that cemiplimab 3  mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) intravenously (IV) administered over 
30 minutes (±10  minutes) is the recommended monotherapy dosi ng regimen for the agent in 
further studies for advanced cancer patients ( Papadopoulos ASCO [ADDRESS_1068646] 
3024).  
For Groups 3 and 6:   This cemiplimab dose of 350 mg Q3W was chosen for Group 3 based on 
the safety and preliminary anti -tumor activity observed in the ongoing FIH study R2810 -ONC -
1423 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and was supported by [CONTACT_778189].  Simulations of cemiplimab exposure in 1000  patients using 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses indicated that: 1) the variability in cemiplimab 
exposure (CV%) was similar with body weight adjusted as compared to fixed doses ; therefore, 
supporting the fixed dose selection, and 2) that a 350  mg Q3W dose resulted in similar 
(≤20%  difference) C trough, AUC 12W and C max as compared to a 3  mg/kg Q2W dose used in the FIH 
study.  These cemiplimab concentrations exceed those observed a t the 1 mg/kg Q2W dose and 
demonstrated clinical efficacy in the FIH study.  At the 350 mg Q3W dose, C trough values at steady 
state generally exceed concentrations of approximately 5 to 20 mg/L, above which (based on 
animal data) saturation of PD -1 target occupancy is expected to occur.  Therefore, cemiplimab 
 is being proposed in Group 3 and also in Group 6, and in new phase 2 and phase 3 
studies across the cemiplimab program.   
Text added for  implementation of Protocol Amendment 9 (PA9) :Based on  pi[INVESTIGATOR_778158] 5, a single SC dose was well tolerated and the bioavailability of cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W 
SC was approximately 83%. For this reason, it is appropriate to explore  of cemiplimab 
SC, as summarized at the end of this secti on (Group 6 Option for SC Cemiplimab ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  For Group 4 (cemiplimab IV Q4W):   Cemiplimab IV regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W) will be 
assessed in Group 4.  The dose of 600 mg IV Q4W is supported by [CONTACT_778190] o ther doses and schedules in this study and the FIH 
study of cemiplimab R2810 -ONC -1423.  While a 500 mg IV Q4W dose is predicted to provide 
similar cemiplimab exposure (AUC 12W) to that of a 3 mg/kg IV Q2W dose, a slightly higher dose 
is proposed to achieve cemiplimab trough concentrations (C trough) during the Q4W dosing that 
remain between those observed at 3 mg/kg IV Q2W and at 350 mg IV Q3W.  Based on this 
approach, a dosing regimen of 600 mg IV Q4W was selected, that is predicted to result in a steady 
state C trough value of 59 mg/L, while C max and AUC 12W would be slightly higher, by [CONTACT_2902] 51% for 
Cmax and about 29% for AUC 12W, than observed at a 350 mg IV Q3W dose.  Previous data from 
the FIH study R2810 -ONC -1423 demonstrate that the safety profile is flat  between 3  mg/kg Q2W 
and 10 mg/kg Q2W.  The predicted exposures and C max associated with the 600  mg Q4W regimen 
are less than that achieved with the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen.   
For Group 5 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_778159] 1 dose of cemiplimab SC):  A single dose of cemiplima b 438  mg 
SC (actual dose is 437.5 mg), followed by [CONTACT_778181] 350 mg IV Q3W will be administered to 
assess the bioavailability of SC cemiplimab and to determine the SC dose regimen to be used in 
the cohort based on population PK approaches.  As an indicati on, if the SC bioavailability of 
cemiplimab is confirmed to be around 0.7, which is generally the case for mAbs, simulated 
cemiplimab exposure at steady state after cemiplimab 438 mg SC Q3W would be around 54  mg/L 
for C trough, 89 mg/L for C max and 3036 mg/ L*day for AUC 12W, compared to 53 mg/L, 157  mg/L 
and 6950 mg/L*d after cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W, respectively.  
For Group 6 Option for SC cemiplimab  ( at or after  27 weeks):  Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1068647] completed ≥ 27 weeks of IV cemiplinab treatment the option 
to receive subsequent doses as cemiplimab SC. The timing (≥ 27 weeks) corresponds to the interim 
and primary efficacy analyses for Group 6. PA9 will only be implemented after the data cut for 
the primary analyses, when  all patients will have had the opportunity for at least 3 tumor 
assessments (≥ 27 weeks).   
Based on cemiplimab exposure data and SC bioavailability after a single SC dose in Group 5, 
modeling and simulation of cemiplimab concentrations in serum after sub cutaneous doses of 
 suggest that cemiplimab C trough,ss after 
350 mg Q3W IV will be maintained with any of these SC dosing regimens, while as expected 
Cmax,ss at  will be lower ( -48%) and at the  will be similar 
compared to the [ADDRESS_1068648] somatic mutations in CSCC tumors are C > T transitions, consistent with UV 
damage ( Durinck 2011 , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_778160] g 2014 , Li 2015 ).  The total mutation burden of CSCC is 
approximately [ADDRESS_1068649] mutation burden in The Cancer G enome Atlas 
(Durinck 2011 , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_11721] 2014 , Li 2015 ).  Preclinical studies suggest that UV light may also be 
carcinogenic due to incompletely understood immunosuppressive effects ( Fisher 1982 , 
Moodycliffe 2000 ), in addition to mutagenicity.

is appropriate for the clinical study of inhibition o f the PD -1 immune checkpoint: high mutation 
burden ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_11721] 2014 ), presence of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) ( Muhleisen 2009 ,

direct immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation ( Yu 2014 ), and some clinical efficacy with 
interferon α2a -based treatment ( Lippman  1992 ).  
The presence of high mutation burden appears to be a shared characteristic of other solid tumors 
for which inhibition of the PD -1/PD -L1 axis has been associated with therapeutic efficacy, 
including melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer ( Alexandrov 2013 ).  Among NSCLC patients 
treated with pembrolizumab, emerging clinical data suggest a direct correlation between mutation 
burden and clinical efficacy of PD -1 inhibition ( Rizvi  2015 ).  Preliminary clinical results from a 
phase 2 study of pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors that are hypermutated 
due to mismatch repair deficiency demonstrates that overall radiographic response rates are 
approximately 60% ( Le 2015).  
Libtayo® (cemiplimab) has received marketing authorization and is now approved in the US, EU, 
Canada, and Brazil for the treatment of patients with metastatic CSCC or patients with locally

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Study D escription and Duration  
This is a phase 2, non -randomized, 6 -group, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_778162].  After a screening period of up to 28  days, 
eligible patients will be enrolled in to 1 of 6 groups and receive cemiplimab treatment as below.  
Tumor assessments will be made at the end of each treatment cycle.  Extensive safety evaluations 
will occur on day 1 of each cycle; routine safety evaluations will be conducted at each cemiplimab  
dosing visit.  
Groups 1 and 2 patients :  Patients with metastatic CSCC are enrolled in Group 1 and patients with 
unresectable locally advanced CSCC are enrolled in Group 2 to receive up to twelve 56 -day (8 -
week) treatment cycles for a total of up to 96 wee ks of treatment.  Each patient will receive 
cemiplimab 3 mg/kg Q2W.   
Group 3 patients :  This cohort enrolls patients with metastatic CSCC.  Group 3 only begins 
enrollment after completion of enrollment to Group 1.  The dose regimen is 350 mg IV Q3W for 
up to 54 weeks.  
Group 4 patients :  This cohort enrolls patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic [nodal or distant] 
or locally advanced).  Group 4 only begins enrollment after completion of enrollment in Groups  1 
through 3.  The dose regimen is 600 mg IV Q4W for up to 48 weeks.  
Group 5 patients :  This cohort enrolls patients with advanced CSCC.  The regimen is [ADDRESS_1068653] 
3 patients in Group 5 will be dosed on 3 sepa rate days to monitor for injection site reactions (ISRs).  
If zero severe ISRs are observed in the first [ADDRESS_1068654] of the cohort may enroll without 
restrictions on enrollment day (ie, more than 1 patient may initiate treatment on the same day).  If 
1 or greater severe ISR is observed, enrollment will pause.  In that circumstance, resumption of 
enrollment in Group 5 may be permitted after review of all relevant data and consensus between 
the medical monitor and the designated Risk Management lead from the Pharmacovigilance & 
Risk Management department.  The investigators involved in care of these patients may also be 
consulted.   See Section  5.4.3  regarding ISRs.

Groups 1 through 5 : Patients who do not experience progressive disease (PD) at the completion of 
the planned treatment period will enter follow -up for approximately 6 months.  After completion 
of this follow -up period, patients will then  enter an extended follow -up period for approximately 
1 additional year with assessments every 4 months ( Table  9). Patients in Groups 1 to 5 who 
complete  treatment without disease progression and subsequently experience disease progression 
during the follow -up period without any intervening systemic anticancer therapy, are eligible for 
up to 2 years of retreatment with cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W.

3.1.1.  Study Groups  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Groups 1 to 4 and Group 6  
There will be 5  study groups for formal hypothesis testing:  
• Group 1 : Patients with metastatic CSCC. These patients are required to have CSCC 
metastases.  Group  1 includes patients with both nodal metastatic and distant metastatic 
disease.  
• Group 2 : Patients with unresecta ble locally advanced CSCC.  These patients are 
required to have disease that is considered inoperable or to have medical 
contraindication to surgery or radiation, or have not achieved disease control with these 
treatments (see Section  4.2.1 ). 
The study populations in Groups 1 and 2 include patients with both unresectable and metastatic 
CSCC, which is conceptually similar to the enrollment of patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma in immunotherapy trials ( Larkin 2015 ).  The decision to analyze separate cohorts for 
patients with locally advanced (Group 2) and metastatic (Group  1) disease is based on a literature 
review of the reported experiences with other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778163], which demonstrates 
that response rates for various chemotherapy regimens generally are higher against advanced 
primary tumors that are locally advanced than against tumors that have metasta sized to lymph 
nodes or distant visceral organs ( Nakamura 2013 ).  This observation of higher response rates in 
locally advanced versus metastatic patients is also seen in data from studies of Smoothened 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1068655] common non -melanoma skin cancer 
(Sekulic  2012 , Migden 2015 ).  
Note in clarification:  For patients with in -transit metastases ( Carucci 2004 ), if the baseline  
comprehensive work -up confirms that there are no nodal metastases or distant metastases, the 
patient will be deemed to have locally advanced disease and would be enrolled in Group 2.  Patients 
with in -transit metastases are typi[INVESTIGATOR_410290] a multidis ciplinary team ( Carucci  2004 ), and, 
therefore, the multidisciplinary review regarding potential surgery or radiation therapy options that 
is required prior to study enrolment for all Group 2 patients is appropriate for patients with  in-
transit metastases.  
• Group 3 :  This cohort opens after the completion of enrollment to Group [ADDRESS_1068656] metastatic disease).  As in Group  1, Gr oup 3 includes patients with 
both nodal metastatic and distant metastatic disease. Group 3 patients receive 
cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W for up to 54 weeks (whereas patients in Groups  1 and 2 
received cemiplimab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W for up to 96 weeks).   
• Group 4 :  This cohort enrolls patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic [nodal or 
distant] or locally advanced).  Group 4 only begins enrollment after completion of 
enrollment in Groups 1 through 3.  The dose regimen is cemiplimab 600 mg IV Q4W 
for up to 48  weeks.   
• Group 6 :  This cohort enrolls patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic [nodal or 
distant] or locally advanced).  The dose regimen is cemiplimab [ADDRESS_1068657] :  
− Have completed ≥27 weeks of study treatment and completed ≥3 tumor 
assessments  on treatment, without disease progression  
− Patients may switch to SC dosing  on Day 1  of next cycle, after completing 
Cycle 3 through Cycle 11 of IV dosing.   Switching to SC dosing prior to 
completion of Cycle 3 of  IV dosing is not permitted. Switching to SC 
cemiplimab after starting Cycle 11 Day 1 of IV dosing is not permitted.  
Switchi ng to SC dosing mid -cycle is not permitted in any cycle.  
− Note: It is possible that study treatment doses may be missed in clinical studies 
for a variety of reasons.  For patients who miss doses in Cycles 1 -3, the 
minimum IV exposure requirement is 7 doses  (of 9 planned in Cycles 1 -3) 
without disease progression prior to switching to SC cemiplimab.  
− Have provided written informed consent to switch to cemiplimab SC  
− Patients may sign the consent for SC dosing at -or-after the Cycle  3/Day 22 visit 
(ahead of the  C4D1 visit). The investigator must confirm there has not been

commences SC dosing.  
− Have not missed ≥[ADDRESS_1068658] 27  weeks.

schedule of events) . 
In view of the visit windows that are permitted in the protocol, “27 weeks” is understood to mean 
approximately [ADDRESS_1068659] of 
the patient to return to IV dosing (ie, a patient who experiences severe injection site reactions with 
SC dosing), the medical monitor must be notified before the patient  resumes cemiplimab 350  mg 
IV Q3W  dosing.  
Group 6 patients who do not take the option to switch to SC dosing may continue IV dosing, 
provided that the usual criteria for continued treatment in this study are met.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Group 5 (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116])  
There will be 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t study group:  
• Group 5 : This 10 -patient pi[INVESTIGATOR_778164]  3 and is for patients with advanced CSCC (defined as either metastatic CSCC 
or locally advanced) who will receive 1 dose of cemiplimab 438 mg SC.  Subsequently, 
patients will receive Q3W dosing of cemiplimab 350  mg IV for up to 54  weeks.  
Group  5 completed enrollment prior to the implementation of Amendment  7. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Considerations Regarding Prior Idelalisib  
Idelalisib was exclusionary for patients enrolled  into Groups 1 to 3 under Amendments 4 and 5.  
With the implementation of Amendment 6, patients with prior treatment with idelalisib are not 
excluded from enrolling into Groups 4, 5, or 6.  In tumor types in which cemiplimab has high 
efficacy (such as CSCC ) and for which other treatment options are limited, in the event that a 
patient had prior idelalisib, the decision on whether to treat with cemiplimab merits an 
individualized risk:benefit assessment by [CONTACT_778193] t.  See 
the Investigator’s Brochure for further details of the safety events in lymphoma patients receiving 
prior idelalisib.   
3.1.2.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study for Groups 1 to 5 is approximately 1.5  years after completion of the treatment at 
the end of extended follow -up (unless the patient enters retreatment, per Section  6.2.2 ).  For Group 
6, end of study is approximately 6 months after comp letion of the follow -up period.  The schedules 
of events for each group define when end of study would be after they enter retreatment (see 
Section  6.1).

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) composed of members who are independent 
from the sponsor and the study sites wi ll be established to monitor patient safety by [CONTACT_778194].  
The IDMC will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients  enrolled in the study, per IDMC 
charter.   
3.3.2.  Study Steering Committee  
A Study Steering Committee (SSC) will be appointed by [CONTACT_7361], Inc. 
(Regeneron), comprising approximately 3 to 7 investigators participating in the trial and 
Regeneron representatives from the study team.  The SSC will ensure transparent management of 
the study according to the protocol through recommending and approving modifications as 
circumstances require.  The SSC will review protocol amendments as appropriate.  Tog ether with 
the study team, the SSC will also develop recommendations for publications of study results 
including authorship rules.  The details of the role of the steering committee will be defined in a 
steering committee charter.  
3.3.3.  Independent Review Commit tees  
Three Independent Review Committees will be established to assess the primary endpoint of 
response rate by [CONTACT_9559]: independent radiologic response assessment committee, 
independent photographic response assessment committee, and independent c omposite response 
assessment committee.  Committee members will follow charters that are established for each of 
these committees.

 CONFIDENTIAL  4. SELECTION, WITHDRAWA L, AND REPLACEMENT O F 
PATIENTS  
4.1. Number of Patients Planned  
Up to 433 adult patients (Group 1, 53 patients  planned [actual enrolled, 59]; Group 2, 76  patients 
planned [actual enrolled, 78]; Group 3, 53 patients planned [actual enrolled, 56]; Group 4, 
63 patients  planned  (actual enrollment, 63 patients); Group 5 , 10 patients planned  (actual 
enrollment, 9 patien ts); Group 6, 167 patients are expected to be enrolled at approximately up to 
100 sites globally.  
4.2. Study Population  
The study will include eligible patients with metastatic (nodal and/or distant) CSCC (Groups 1 
and 3) and unresectable locally advanced CSCC  (Group 2).  Group 3 for metastatic CSCC opens 
only after enrollment to Group 1 is complete.  Groups 4, 5, and 6 enroll patients with advanced 
CSCC, a term that encompasses both metastatic (nodal or distant) CSCC and locally advanced 
CSCC.  See Section  3.[ADDRESS_1068663] meet the following criteria to be eligible for i nclusion in the study:  
1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive CSCC.  
Notes on tumor primary site:  Patients for whom the primary site of squamous cell 
carcinoma was the dry red lip (vermillion) are not eligible.  Patients with tumors arising on 
the cutaneous hairbearing (non -glabrous) lip with extension onto dry red lip (vermillion) 
may be eligible aft er communication with and approval from medical monitor.  Patients 
for whom the primary site of squamous cell carcinoma was the anogenital area (penis, 
scrotum, and perianal region) are not eligible.  Patients for whom the primary site is nose 
are only eli gible if the investigator is able to establish unambiguously that the primary site 
was skin, not nasal mucosa with outward extension to skin.  
Notes on tumor histology:  Patients with mixed histologies (eg, sarcomatoid, 
adenosquamous) generally will not be e ligible.  Patients with mixed histology in which the 
predominant histology is invasive CSCC (with only a minimal component of mixed 
histology) may be eligible, after communication with and approval from medical monitor.  
2. At least [ADDRESS_1068664] 1 other meas urable target lesion.  
For patients with metastatic (nodal or distant) CSCC:   
There must be at least 1 baseline measurable lesion ≥10 mm in maximal diameter (1.5  cm 
for lymph nodes) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
1.1 cr iteria ( Appendix  1; Eisenhauer 2009 )

 CONFIDENTIAL  Note: In the case of patients with metastatic disease that does not meet target lesion  criteria 
by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (eg, bone only lesions, perineural disease; Appendix  1) and with externally 
visible CSCC target lesion(s), Appendix  2 may be used, in which bi -dimensional 
measurements are required (at baseline, perpendicular diameters must both be ≥10 mm).  
The patient would then be enrolled with the plan to measure externally visible target 
lesion(s) by [CONTACT_778195] -dimensional measurem ents; the metastatic lesions that 
are not measurable by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria would be followed as non -target lesions on 
scans.  
For patients with locally advanced CSCC:   
There must be at least [ADDRESS_1068665] diameter (LD) and 
the perpendicular diameter are both ≥10 mm if followed by [CONTACT_778196] 
(see Appendi x 2).  Non -measurable disease for Group 2 is defined as either 
unidimensionally measurable lesions, tumors with margins that are not clearly defined, or 
lesions with maximum perpendicular diameters less than 10 mm.  Patients without 
measurable disease at baseline are not eligible for the study.  
3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 (ECOG PS 1 
definition: Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out 
work of  a light or sedentary nature, eg, light house work, office work; Appendix  7). 
Note:  Patients with ECOG PS >1 are ineligible.  
4. ≥18 years old  
5. Hepatic fu nction:  
a. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; if liver metastases ≤[ADDRESS_1068666]). 
Patients with Gilbert’s Disease and total bilirubin up to [ADDRESS_1068667] may be eligible after 
communication with and approval from the medical monitor.  
b. Transaminases ≤[ADDRESS_1068668] (or ≤5.[ADDRESS_1068669], if liver metastases)  
c. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤2.[ADDRESS_1068670] (or ≤5.[ADDRESS_1068671], if liver or bone metastases)  
Note for patients with hepatic metastases:   If transaminase levels (AST and/or ALT) are 
>3 x but ≤[ADDRESS_1068672] be ≤[ADDRESS_1068673].  If total bilirubin is >1.5 x but ≤[ADDRESS_1068674], both transaminases (AST and ALT) must be ≤[ADDRESS_1068675].  
6. Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤1.[ADDRESS_1068676] or estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) 
>30 mL/min  
7. Bone marrow function:

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. Patients with locally advanced CSCC:   
Surgery must be deemed contraindicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a Mohs dermatologic surgeon, 
a head and neck surgeon, or plastic surgeon.  A copy of the surgeon’s consultation note 
from a clinical visit within  [ADDRESS_1068677] be submitted.  
Acceptable contraindications in the surgeon’s note include:  
• CSCC that has recurred in the same location after 2 or more surgical procedures and 
curative resection  is deemed unlikely  
• CSCCs with significant local inv asion that precludes complete resection   
• CSCCs in anatomically challenging locations for which surgery may result in severe 
disfigurement or dysfunction (eg, removal of all or part of a facial structure, such as 
nose, ear, or eye; or requirement for limb a mputation)  
• Other conditions deemed to be contraindicating for surgery must be discussed with the 
medical monitor before enrolling the patient.  
12. Patients with locally advanced CSCC:   
Patients must be deemed as not appropriate for radiation therapy.  Specifically, patients 
must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
a. A patient previously received radiation therapy for CSCC, such that further radiation 
therapy would exceed the thresh old of acceptable cumulative dose, per the radiation 
oncologist.  A copy of the radiation oncologist’s consultation note, from a clinical visit 
within [ADDRESS_1068678]’s consultation note, from a clinical visit within [ADDRESS_1068679] be submitted.  
c. A clinic note from the investigator indicating that an individualized benefit:risk 
assessment was performed  by a multidisciplinary team (consisting of, at minimum, a 
radiation oncologist AND EITHER a medical oncologist with expertise in cutaneous 
malignancies OR a dermato -oncologist, OR a head and neck surgeon) within 60 days 
prior to enrollment in the proposed  study, and the radiation therapy was deemed to be 
contraindicated.  
Acceptable contraindications to radiation therapy in the investigator’s note for patients who 
have not received any prior radiation include:  
• CSCCs in anatomically challenging locations fo r which radiation therapy would be 
associated with unacceptable toxicity risk in the context of the patient’s overall medical 
condition in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_778165] (eg, a neck tumor for which 
radiation therapy would result in potential nee d for a percutaneous gastrostomy tube).  
A copy of the investigator’s consultation note documenting the multidisciplinary 
assessment must be submitted.  
• Other conditions deemed to be contraindicating for radiation therapy must be discussed 
with the medical monitor before enrolling the patient.

 CONFIDENTIAL  13. Groups 1 to 5:  All patients in either group must consent to provide archived or newly 
obtained tumor material (either formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded [FFPE] block or 
10 unstained or stained slides) for central pathol ogy review for confirmation of diagnosis 
of CSCC.  This material must be confirmed as received by [CONTACT_778197].  
14. Group 2 (locally advanced CSCC patients) and Group 4 (locally advanced CSCC patients 
and metastatic CSCC patients) only:  Patients must consent to undergo biopsies of CSCC 
lesions at baseline, cycle 1 day 29 (±3 business days), at time of tumor progression, and at 
other time points that may be clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
15.  For patients with locally  advanced CSCC:   An investigator note which states that the 
natural history of the patient’s advanced CSCC would likely be life -threatening within 
3 years with currently available management options outside of a clinical trial or 
cemiplimab.  
16. Group 6: Patie nts must consent to undergo biopsies of CSCC lesions at baseline (and at 
time of tumor progression, if possible), unless the investigator communicates to the 
medical monitor that there is unacceptable safety risk associated with tumor biopsy in a 
particula r patient, and at other time points that may be clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574].  
4.2.2.  Exclusion Criteria  
A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:  
1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of si gnificant autoimmune disease that 
required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk 
for immune -related adverse events (irAEs).  The following are not exclusionary: vitiligo, 
childhood asthma that has resolved, type 1 dia betes, residual hypothyroidism that required 
only hormone replacement, or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment.  
2. Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway.  
3. Prior treatment with other immune modulating agents that was (a)  within fewer than 
4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of cemiplimab, or (b) associated with immune -
mediated adverse events that were ≥ grade [ADDRESS_1068680] dose of 
cemiplimab, or (c) associated with toxicity that resulted in dis continuation of the immune -
modulating agent.  Examples of immune modulating agents include therapeutic anti -cancer 
vaccines, cytokine treatments (other than G -CSF or erythropoietin), or agents that target 
cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 4  (CTLA -4), 4-1BB (C D137), PI 3 -K-delta, or OX -40. 
4. Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active. (Note: patients with brain 
involvement of CSCC due to direct extension of invading tumor, rather than metastasis, 
may be allowed to enroll if they do not require g reater than 10 mg prednisone daily, after 
discussion and approval of the medical monitor).  Patients with previously treated brain 
metastases may participate provided that the lesion(s) is (are) stable (without evidence of 
progression for at least 6 weeks on imaging obtained in the screening period), and there is 
no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and the patient does not require any 
immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids for management of brain 
metastasis(es) within [ADDRESS_1068681] dose of cemiplimab.

 CONFIDENTIAL  5. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (>10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 
[ADDRESS_1068682] dose of cemiplimab.  
Note:  Patients who require brief course of steroids (eg, as prophylaxis for imaging studies 
due to  hypersensitivity to contrast agents) are not excluded.  
6. Active infection requiring therapy, including infection with human immunodeficiency 
virus, or active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).  
7. History of non -infectious pneumonitis within the last 5 years.  If pneumonitis was purely 
infectious in etiology, enrolling on protocol may be allowed after discussion with medical 
monitor.  
8. Grade ≥3 hypercalcemia at time of enrollment  
9. Any systemic antican cer treatment (chemotherapy, targeted systemic therapy, 
photodynamic therapy), investigational or standard of care, within 30 days of the initial 
administration of cemiplimab or planned to occur during the study period (patients 
receiving bisphosphonates o r denosumab are not excluded), radiation therapy within 
14 days of initial administration of cemiplimab or planned to occur during the study period.  
Note: For patients with multiple CSCCs at baseline that are not designated by [CONTACT_778198], treatment of these non -target CSCCs with surgery may be 
permitted but must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to any surgical procedure.  
10. History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to 
antibody trea tments.  
11. Patients with allergy or hypersensitivity to cemiplimab or to any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_778166].   
12. Breast feeding  
13. Positive serum pregnancy test (a false positive pregnancy test, if demonstrated by [CONTACT_778199], w ill not be exclusionary, upon communication 
with and approval from the medical monitor).  
14. Concurrent malignancy other than CSCC and/or history of malignancy other than CSCC 
within [ADDRESS_1068683], or low -risk early 
stage prostate adenocarcinoma (T1 -T2aN0M0 and Gleason score ≤6 and PSA ≤10  ng/m L) 
for which the management plan is active surveillance, or prostate adenocarcinoma with 
biochemical -only recurrence with documented PSA doubling time of >12 months for 
which the management plan is active surveillance ( D’Amico 2005 , Pham 2016 ). Patients 
with hematologic malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL) are excluded.  
15. Any acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], make the 
patient ineligible for participation.  
16. Continued sexual activity in men or women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)* who are 
unwilling to practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1068684] dose. Highly effective 
contraceptive measures include:  
a. stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implanta ble) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more 
menstrual cycles prior to screening  
b. intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS);  
c. bilateral tubal ligation  
d. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomiz ed partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained 
medical assessment of surgical success for the procedure)  
e. and/or sexual abstinence†,‡.  
* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile follow ing menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alte rnative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.  However, in the absence of 12  month s of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a 
postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women 
with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.  
† Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drugs.  The reliabi lity of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus) , spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are 
not acceptable methods of contraception.  Female condom and male condom should 
not be used together.  
17. Patients with a history of solid organ transplant (patients with prior corneal transplant( s) 
may be allowed to enroll after discussion with and approval from the medical monitor).  
18. Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor  
19. Any medical co -morbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic dysfunction, or 
clinical laboratory abnormality that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], renders the patient 
unsuitable for participation in a clinical trial due to high safety risks and/or potential to 
affect interpretation of results of the study.  
Note in clarification: The investigator must contact [CONTACT_212934]’s medical monitor 
regarding any patients that the investigator feels cannot provide the required baseline tumor 
biopsies.  
20. Inability to undergo any contrast -enhanced radiologic response assessment.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Notes regarding imaging options:  A patient who is unabl e to undergo CT with iodinated 
contrast (eg, due to contrast allergy) would not be excluded if his/her disease can be 
measured by [CONTACT_778200].  A patient who is unable to undergo MRI with 
gadolinium would not be excluded if his/her disease can be m easured by [CONTACT_778201].  
Note regarding locally advanced CSCC patients only: In selected cases, a locally 
advanced CSCC patient who is unable to undergo any contrast enhanced radiographic 
imaging (neither CT with iodinated contrast nor MRI with ga dolinium) may be eligible if 
the patient’s disease can be comprehensively assessed with digital medical photography, 
after communication with and approval from medical monitor.  
4.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study or from Study Treatment  
4.3.1.  Reasons for Prematu re Withdrawal or Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
A patient has the right to voluntarily discontinue study treatment or withdraw from the study at 
any time, for any reason, and without repercussion.  
The investigator and sponsor have the right to disconti nue a patient from study treatment or 
withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  
Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to:  
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time  
• Any medical cond ition that the investigator or sponsor determines may jeopardize the 
patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study or continues treatment with study 
drug 
• The investigator or sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
• Patient noncom pliance (eg, not complying with protocol required visits, assessments, 
and dosing instructions)  
• Pregnancy  
4.3.2.  Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
A patient who permanently discontinues study treatment will be followed as detailed in 
Section  6.2.2 .

 CONFIDENTIAL  4.3.3.  Withdrawal from Study Participation  
During the treatment period and follow -up period, a patient who withdraws consent to continue 
participation in the study will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  
An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterp retable; therefore, unnecessary 
withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
4.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patients prematurely discontinued from the study who had received at least 1 treatment with 
Cemiplimab will not be replaced.

 CONFIDENTIAL  5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1. Investigational Treatment  
Cemiplimab will be supplied as a liquid in sterile, single -use vials.  Each vial of cemiplimab will 
contain a concentration of 50 mg/mL (for IV infusion), or a concentration of 175  mg/mL (for SC 
injection).  
Instructions on dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
Cemiplimab will be administered in an outpatient setting as an approximately 30 -minute 
(±10  minutes) IV infusion.  Longer infusion durations are acceptable if interruption is required or 
if patient had a previous infusion r eaction during a prior treatment.  Group 1 and Group 2 patient’s 
dose will depend on individual body weight.  The dose of cemiplimab must be adjusted each cycle 
for changes in body weight of ≥10%.  Dose adjustments for changes in body weight of <10% will 
be at the discretion of the investigator.  Groups 3 to 6 will receive a fixed dose of cemiplimab.   
SC administration:   Group 5 will receive 1 fixed dose of SC cemiplimab followed by [CONTACT_778202]. For Group 6 patients who switch to cemiplima b , each dose 
will be administered as a single SC injection (2 mL) . For Group 6 patients assigned to receive 
cemiplimab , each dose will be administered as  
 (2 mL) each.  Administer SC injection i nto thigh or abdomen, except 2 inches (5  cm) from 
the navel.  The site of injection will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  Do not inject 
cemiplimab in tender, damaged, bruised or scarred skin.  Cemiplimab should not be directly 
injected into the tumor.  
5.2. Pretreatments  
Appropriate premedication for study treatments may be administered at the investigator’s 
discretion as per usual clinical practice and in accordance with institutional guidelines.  No 
premedications are to be administered for the firs t dose of cemiplimab.  
5.3. Dose Modification and Study Drug Discontinuation Rules  
5.3.1.  Dose Modification  
For Groups 1 and 2, the planned dose and schedule is cemiplimab 3 mg/kg IV over approximately 
30 minutes (±10  minutes)  every [ADDRESS_1068685] anned dose and schedule is 
cemiplimab 350 mg IV over approximately 30 minutes (±10  minutes) every 21  days.  For Group  4, 
the planned dose and schedule is cemiplimab 600 mg IV over approximately 30  minutes 
(±10  minutes) every 28  days.  For Group 5, the plan ned dose and schedule is 1 dose of cemiplimab 
438 mg SC.  After this, Group 5 patients will receive cemiplimab 350  mg IV over approximately 
30 minutes (±10  minutes)  every 21 days.  
Patients will generally remain on the assigned dosage of cemiplimab throughout the course of 
study treatment.  Dose reduction of cemiplimab may be allowed (Groups 1 through 3), based on 
the guidelines below, and only after discussion and agreement between the investigator and 
sponsor.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Groups 4, 5, and 6 :  In view of understanding that optimal toxicity management for this class of 
agents is dose interruption/dose delay and supportive measures (ie, immunosuppressive doses of 
steroids and/or other immunosupp ressant or hormone replacement therapy), dose reductions are 
not part of the AE management plan for Groups 4, 5, and 6.   
5.3.2.  General Guidance for Management of Adverse Events  
This subsection provides general guidance of treatment -related AEs that are not spe cifically 
addressed in guidelines for management of irAEs ( Appendix  4) or in management of acute 
infusion reactions (Section  5.4).  In the event of discrepancy between this section and a section 
that provides for detailed guidance (ie, Appendix  4), the section that provides the more detailed 
guidance will supersede the general guidance in this section.  
Note in clarification on scheduling after missed visits/assessments : The general approach 
regarding missed treatments of cemiplimab (eg, due to AEs or other reasons) is “time marches 
on.”  Missed doses of cemiplimab will not be made up, unless missed doses occur ≤3 calendar 
days from the scheduled date. Study visits cannot be performed outside of the scheduled visit.  As 
such, if a patient misses a dose by [CONTACT_726] 3 days for any reason, the next dose would be at the 
subsequent scheduled dose (which could be given 3 days early if need be).  If an investigator deems 
that re -scheduling a missed dose  of cemiplimab outside of the [ADDRESS_1068686] 
of the patient, this should be discussed with the medical monitor.  
Holding of treatment due to an AE or a missed visit if a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778167] a violation.  
If a patient is able  to come in for a study visit according to the visit schedule but does not receive 
cemiplimab the visit should be entered into the database.  The protocol assessments required at the 
visit (ie, labs, physical exam) should still be completed as far as possi ble and the data entered at 
the appropriate visit in the electronic CRF.  If the patient is not able to come in for a study visit, 
according to the study schedule, the visit should be skipped.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Identification of Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Investigators must be extremely vigilant and be ready to intervene early in the management of 
irAEs, as the onset of symptoms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle.  An irAE can occur at 
any time during treatment or several months after the last dose of treatment.  All AEs of unknown 
etiology associated with drug exposure sh ould be evaluated to determine possible immune 
etiology.  If an irAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an AE as an irAE.  
Based on the established  safety profile of cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the PD -1/PD -
L1 axis, working case definitions are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure to help investigators 
distinguish irAEs from non -immune AEs commonly associated with PD -1 inhibition 
(Naidoo,  2015 ) (Weber, 2015 ).  This is not exhaustive of all possible irAEs.  Clinical presentations 
of less common irAEs, including neurologic, musculoskeletal, cardiac, renal, and ocular events 
(Hoffman, 2016 )(Zimmer, 2016 ), should  be reviewed in patients with concerning presentations.  
The case definitions in the Investigator’s Brochure have not been validated and are intended only 
as guidance for inve stigators to help distinguish irAEs from non -immune AEs.  These definitions 
may evolve as clinical experience increases with cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the 
PD-1/PD -L1 axis.  Investigators’ clinical judgment may include other factors when det ermining 
immune relatedness .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Management of Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Adverse events that meet the criteria for irAEs, as noted above in the Investigator’s Brochure, 
should be reported as irAEs in the case report form (CRF).  If AEs corresponding to th e common 
terms for irAEs are attributed as NOT related to cemiplimab by [CONTACT_093], additional 
information should be provided to substantiate an alternative attribution (eg, infectious diarrhea).   
If not provided at the outset, this information may be requested by [CONTACT_778203].  The sponsor may request additional information for any AE that is of a type

 CONFIDENTIAL  known to be potentially immune -related (eg, rash, colitis, elevated transaminases, endocrine 
events), but is deemed  not an irAE by [CONTACT_778204]  [ADDRESS_1068687] (AESI) .  
The following general principles apply to management of irAEs, unless otherwise specified in 
Appendix  4: 
Grade 1 :  Continue study treatment with close monitoring and provide symptomatic management   
Grade 2:   Consider withholding study treatment  
Grade 3:   Withhold study treatment  
Grade 4:   Discontinue study treatment  
If cemiplimab is held for ≤ grade  3 irAE, consider resuming when symptoms and/or laboratory 
values revert to baseline or ≤ grade  1 after corticosteroid taper (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], to ≤10  mg/day 
prednis one or equivalent).  
Permanently discontinue study treatment for:  
• Recurrent grade  3 irAEs  
• Grade ≥3 or recurrent Grade 2 Pneumonitis  
• Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1068688]/ALT >5×ULN or total bilirubin >3×ULN  
• Grade ≥3 Nephritis with renal dysfunction  
• Grade ≥3 Uveiti s 
• Grade ≥3 Neurologic toxicity  
• Grade ≥3 Myocarditis or pericarditis  
• Grade ≥3 Infusion related reaction  
• Confirmed SJS,TEN or DRESS  
• Grade ≥3 or recurrent Grade 2 events in patients previously treated with idelalisib  
• Grade  2 or 3 irAEs persistent for ≥[ADDRESS_1068689] study treatment (excluding 
endocrinopathies)  
• Requirement for ≥10  mg per day prednisone or equivalent lasting ≥[ADDRESS_1068690] study treatment  
Further guidance regarding manage ment of selected irAEs is provided in Appendix  4.  Additional 
information about the safety profile of cemiplimab is in the Investigators Brochure and in the 
cemiplimab prescribing information.  Expert consensus guidelines regarding characterization and 
management of less common immune -related adverse events (irAEs) are also available 
(Brahmer,  2018 )(Haanen, 2017 )(Puzanov, 2017 )(Thompson, 2018 ) (Thompson , 2020 ).  The 
management considerations provided here should not supersede clinical judgment in the setting of 
an individual patient.  The investigator may choose to hold  study treatment at his/her clinical 
judgment regarding the safety of an individual patient, even if hold criteria are not formally met 
per protocol.

the primary endpoint of the study is captured.  
5.3.4.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Study treatment will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Severe a llergic reactions considered related to study drug  
• An infusion reaction of grade  ≥3 severity during or directly following infusion  
• Patient withdraws consent at any time  
• Unacceptable toxicity  
• The investigator or sponsor determines it is in the best interest  of the patient  
• Disease recurrence, unless patient meets criteria for Part  2 of study and opts for 
subsequent cemiplimab treatment.  
• Treatment delay of ≥[ADDRESS_1068692] dose of study drug due to 
toxicity  
• Any AEs that meet criteria for perm anent discontinuation described in Appendix  4. 
• Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he/she continues 
with study treatmen t in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335]  
• Patient noncompliance (eg, not complying with protocol required visits, assessments, 
and dosing instructions)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study treatment may be temporarily stopped due  to events that meet the criteria for treatment 
interruption described in Section  5.4.1  and Appendix  4. 
5.4. Management of Infusion/Allergic/Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Acute infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2  hours 
after the infusion is completed.  Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these 
potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, bronchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate use.  Infusion reactions must 
be re ported as AEs (Section  7.2.1 ) and graded according to the NCI -CTCAE version  4.03 grading 
scale (Section  7.3.1 ). 
In the event of an infusion reaction of grade [ADDRESS_1068693] be permanently

 CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.1.  Interruption of the Infusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed:  
• cough  
• rigors/chills  
• rash, pruritus (itching)  
• urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• diaphoresis (sweating)  
• hypotension  
• dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• vomiting  
• flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the 
original rate.  
If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other 
than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response 
according to typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896].  
For patients who experience in fusion -related hypersensitivi ty reactions th at are ≤ grade [ADDRESS_1068694] an to 
continue t reatment, premedication will be required for retreatment.  
For grade 1 symptoms  (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated), the following prophylactic medications are recommended for future infusions:  
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1068695] 30 minutes prior to subsequent cemiplimab infusions.  
For grade 2 symptoms  (moderate reaction that requires therapy or infusion interruption, but for 
which symptoms resolve promptly with appropriate treatment such as antihistamines, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, and/or IV fluids; prophylactic me dications 
indicated ≤24 hours), the following prophylactic medications are recommended for future 
infusions:  diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1068696] 30 minutes prior to subsequent cemiplimab infusions .  If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.

(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
5.4.3.  Injection Site Reactions  
Acute ISRs are defined as any AE that o ccurs during the injection or at any time until the end of 
the following day (in the absence of an alternative explanation).  Emergency equipment and 
medication for the treatment of these potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, bronchodilators, 
IV saline, corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate 
use. 
Injection site reactions should be reported in the CRF and graded as per the criteria below:  
The severity of ISRs will be graded according to the following scal e 
(semi -colon indicates “or” within description of grade):  
1. Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of 
erythema or induration that does not interfere with activity.  
2. Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non-narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with activity.  
3. Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents d aily activity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; 
requires ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis.  
5.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Each patient who signs the informed consent form  (ICF) will be assigned a patient number and 
tracked centrally as described in the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) manual.  
Eligible patients will be enrolled sequentially as confirmed and tracked by [CONTACT_456], until each 
group is filled per protoc ol criteria.  Details on treatment assignment can be found in the IWRS 
manual.  
Patients were enrolled in Group 3 only after enrollment in Group 1 was complete.

With the implementation of Group 6 in Amendment 7, Group  4 will be closed to enrollment (even 
if Group 4 is not yet fully enrolled).  
See Section  3.1 for rules regarding enrollment in Groups 4 and 5.  
5.5.1.  Blinding  
This is an open -label study; no blinding will be employed.  
5.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
5.6.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Open -label cemiplimab will be supplied as a liquid in sterile, single -use vials that will display the 
product lot number on the label.  Each vial of cemiplimab will contain a concentration of 
50 mg/mL (for all IV infusions), and a concentration of 175 mg/mL (for SC injection).  
Cemiplimab will be refrigerated at the site at a temperature of 2º to 8ºC, and refrigerator 
temperature will be logged daily.  Further storage instructions will be provided in the pharmacy 
manual.  
A pharmacist or other qualified individual will be identified at each site to prepare cemiplimab for 
admi nistration.  Detailed preparation and administration instructions will be provided to the sites 
in the pharmacy manual.  
5.6.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2º to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular  
intervals or as needed during the study.  At specified time points during the study (eg,  interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by [CONTACT_25007], all opened and unopened study d rug will be destroyed or  returned to the 
sponsor or designee.  
5.6.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened study drug.  These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study medication dispensed to each patient, returned from 
each patient (if applicable), and disposed of at the site or returned to the sponsor or designee.  
All accountability records must be made available for inspection by [CONTACT_778205]; photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_24897].  
5.6.4.  Treatment Compliance

treatment will be considered concomitant treatment.  This includes medications and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778168], as  well as any 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778169] -up period (approximately 6 months [ Table  9]) to treat a study -drug–
related AE.  All concomitant treatments must be recorded in the study CRF with the generic name, 
dose, dose unit, frequency, indication, and start/stop date, as appropriate.  
5.7.2.  Prohibited Medications and Concomitant Treatments  
While participating in this study, a patient may not receive any standar d or investigational agent 
for treatment of a tumor other than cemiplimab as mono therapy.  After communication with the 
sponsor, focal palliative treatment (eg, radiation) would be allowed for local control of a 
tumor once a patient has completed 24 weeks  of study treatment.   Any other medication which 
is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare, and which is not expected to interfere with the 
evaluation of the study drug, may be given at the discretion of the investigator.  
Patients using immunosuppr essive doses (>10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) of systemic 
corticosteroids other than for corticosteroid replacement will not be eligible for the study.  It is 
recommended that patients do not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortis one, 
prednisone, prednisolone (Solu -Medrol®) or dexamethasone (Decadron®) at any time throughout 
the study except in the case of a life -threatening emergency and/or to treat an irAE.  Physiologic 
replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted,  even if >10  mg/day prednisone 
equivalents.  A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg,  contrast dye allergy) or for 
treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by 
[CONTACT_13132]) is permitted.  
Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are not prohibited.  
5.7.3.  Surgery  
For patients with locally advanced target lesions that are considered unresectable at baseline but 
are subsequently deemed resectable during the course of the study due to tumor response to 
cemi plimab, curative intent surgery may be allowed but must be discussed with the medical 
monitor prior to any surgical procedure.  (This statement does not apply to patients in emergency 
life-threatening situations that require immediate surgery).  Patients w ith inoperable CSCC at 
baseline who are rendered operable with clear margins will be deemed to have experienced PR.  
If during the course of the study a patient develops new cutaneous lesions that are suspected to be 
a non -melanoma skin cancer other than CS CC (eg, BCC), removal of the lesion and continued 
treatment on study may be allowed after discussion with the medical monitor.  
5.7.4.  Radiation Therapy  
Radiation therapy is not part of the study regimen. Patients for whom radiation therapy is planned 
are not eli gible.  If during the course of the study, a patient develops a symptomatic lesion for 
which palliative radiation therapy is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093], this will be deemed

Section  5.7.2 ).  Such cases m ust be discussed with the medical monitor prior to any radiation 
therapy if the investigator feels that restarting cemiplimab after radiation is in the best interest of 
the patient.  The patient will be deemed to have experienced disease progression if rad iation 
therapy is instituted but will be followed for OS.

For patients with locally advanced CSCC, guidelines for digital photography are provided in  Appendix  6. Imaging requirements differ fo r patients in Group 1 
and Group 2; see Sections 6.3.1  and 6.3.2  for further detail s. On day 29, photos only for Group 2 patients need to be done.  The intent of the photography is to 
show locations of the biopsies; formal response assessments are not planned for day 29 photos.  
r. Concomitant medication recording will be done at the start of each cycle, at a minimum. Concomitant medications should be recorded from t he date of signing 
the ICF through follow -up visit 1 (posttreatment;  Table  9). 
s. Adverse event recording will be ongoing throughout the course of the study, using NCI -CTCAE v4.03.  See Section  7.2.  
t. (1) The EOS visit is for patients who experience PD requiring study discontinuation in cycles 1 through 12.  This visit shoul d occur 30 days (allowed window: 
21 to 42 days) after the last dose of cemiplimab .  The only posttreatment assessment that can occur outside of this timeframe is the posttreatment biopsy (required 
in Group 2) that can be obtained at any time within [ADDRESS_1068703] dose of cemiplimab. (2) Patients who complete the require d events in Table  3 (excluding the 
EOS visit) with any status other than PD (eg, CR, PR, or SD), or who discontinue treatment during cycles 1 through 12 for any  reason  other than PD, should go 
on to complete the assessments in Table  9 (unless not possible, due to factors such as clinical decline or withdrawal of consent ).  These patients do not need to 
complete the EOS visit at end of cycle 12 as they will be assessed per Table  9.  After treatment and follow -up are comp leted or patients prematurely discontinue 
treatment and follow -up, patients will be followed quarterly for survival and tumor treatment status, if available.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.2. Study Follow -Up and Treatment Discontinuation  
6.2.1.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule as specified in Table  4 through   
Table  9. Unscheduled visits may be necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory 
results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any other reason, as warranted.  
6.2.2.  Follow -up 
Patients who discontinue study treatment due to PD should return to the clinic 30 days (range: 
21 to 42 days) after the last study treatment to complete the EOS assessments indicated in Table  4 
through   Table  9.  After the EOS visit, patients should be followed for survival status until death, 
loss to fo llow-up, or study termination by [CONTACT_456].  
For all patients in Group 2, tumor biopsies ( Appendix  5) should be obtained at time of 
progression, w hether progression occurs in cycles 1 through 12 or during follow -up (after 
cycle  12). 
Patients who discontinue study treatment due to reasons other than PD (eg, toxicity, confirmed CR 
after 48 weeks) should enter the follow -up schedule in   Table  9.  (Note in clarification: Any 
patients who completed the posttreatment  Table  9 follow -up period of 6 months from previous 
amendments without disease progression will be asked to remain in follow -up.  Such patients will 
be re -consented and asked to return approximately every 4 months (±14 days) for 1  additional year 
to complete the e xtended follow -up assessments in   Table  9.) 
For patients in Groups [ADDRESS_1068722] be re -consented and repeat all 
screening activities (with the exception of provi ding new archived pathology material, or research 
biopsies), and the investigator must confirm that the patient still meets all eligibility criteria (other 
than the exclusion regarding prior treatment with anti -PD-1).  Such patients will resume 
cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W for up to 108 weeks (maximum 12  retreatment cycles).  The 
retreatment visit schedule will follow the study schedule in Table  4.  ADA sampl es will not be 
collected during retreatment.  Patients in Group 5 who enter retreatment will not receive an 
additional dose of cemiplimab SC.  For any patients who enter retreatment, the following are not 
required during retreatment:  PK samples, research blood samples, and research tumor biopsies 
(exploratory tumor biopsies in Groups 2and 4).   Note: Patients enrolled in Group  [ADDRESS_1068723] with the patient, a family member of the patient, or the physician.  Patients from  
Group 6 who discontinue cemiplimab early (before completing 108 weeks of treatment) for 
reasons other than disease progression will enter follow -up.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.3. Study Procedures  
6.3.1.  Procedures Required Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be  performed at screening for the purpose of determining study 
eligibility or characterizing the baseline population:  
• Serum β -HCG (result must be ≤[ADDRESS_1068724] dose).  
• HBV, HCV, and HIV screening.  The required serologies are:  hepatitis B surface 
antigen, hepatitis C antibody test (if positive, obtain hepatitis C RNA PCR to rule out 
active infection), HIV -1 and HIV -2 serum antibody  
• Documentation of pathologic confirmation of CSCC by a pathologist at the study site 
(see Section  4.2.1 , Inclusion Criterion 1).  The pathology report that documents the 
diagnosis of CSCC should be from the most recent biopsy that documented CSCC.  
Pathology material ( FFPE block or 10 unstained slides from the sample in the submitted 
pathology report) must be provided to the sponsor prior to enrollment.  
• Group 2 only: Baseline/screening research biopsy is required (see Appendix  5 for 
guidelines).  This baseline biopsy is intended for exploratory assessments but will only 
be used for this purpose after central pathology confirmation of diagnosis of CSCC is 
obtained on  archived material.  If the archived material is not sufficient for 
confirmation of diagnosis of CSCC by [CONTACT_9559], baseline biopsy material will be 
used for central pathologic confirmation; remaining baseline tumor material can only 
be used for explo ratory assessments after central pathology confirmation of diagnosis 
of CSCC has been established.  
• Group 4 and 6: Baseline/screening research biopsy is required for these patients 
(see Appendix  5 for guidelines).  In patients without externally accessible lesions, 
CT-guided biopsies are required.  If the investigator determines that biopsy would 
create an unacceptable safety risk for the patient or can not be performed without 
interfering with measurement of target lesions, the biopsy requirement may be waived 
for an individual patient after communication with the medical monitor.  
• Brain MRI ( except Group 6 ): Brain MRI is required at screening if not performed in 
the prior [ADDRESS_1068725] may be performed if an MRI is contraindicated.  
• For patie nts with metastatic CSCC  – Baseline imaging should include all known 
target lesions.  Baseline scans must evaluate extent of disease, including imaging of 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This may be accomplished with CT chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis with contras t, or CT chest with contrast and MRI abdomen/pelvis with 
gadolinium.  The imaging modality for metastatic lesions may be either CT with 
iodinated contrast or MRI with gadolinium, per investigator discretion.  MRI with 
gadolinium is generally preferred for bone lesions, perineural lesions, abdomen, pelvis, 
extremity, and head and neck.  CT with contrast is generally preferred for chest.  For 
Group  [ADDRESS_1068726] externally visible lesions, digital medical photography 
will be used, and these lesions  generally will be followed as non -target lesions.  Note: 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1068727] 
criteria (eg, bone only lesions, perineural disease) and with externally visible CSCC 
target lesions, digital medica l photography may be used to follow the externally visible 
lesions as target lesions.  
• Groups 2, 4, 5, and 6 –  
 
 
 
  Baseline radiologic assessment will also include CT chest, 
preferably with contrast (if CT chest identifies a metastatic lesion, the patient should 
be assigned to Group 1 if open for enrollment, Group 3, if open for enrollment, or 
Group 6).  For patients with locally advanced CSCC with deeply invasive target lesions  
that are not externally visible, baseline assessment should include photography of 
overlying normal appearing skin because this baseline image may provide useful 
clinical context for independent central review.  
6.3.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
For patients with disease that can be measured radiologically according to RECIST 1.1 criteria 
(Appendix  1; Eisenhauer 2009 ), a CT or MRI for tumor assessment will be performed as detailed 
in Table  [ADDRESS_1068728] scan 
or MRI has been made, subsequent assessments should be made using the same modality whenever 
possible.  For patients whose CSCC lesions are evaluable on the skin, composite response criteria 
(Appendix  2) should be used on the same schedule (every 8 weeks for Groups 1 and 2, every 
9 weeks for Group 3), in combination with radiologic imagin g if appropriate.  
• For patients with metastatic CSCC: Whole -body imaging, as performed at the 
baseline assessment, is strongly recommended at each response assessment.  At a 
minimum, all radiologically measurable target lesions (RECIST  1.1) should be imaged  
at each response assessment.  The same radiologic imaging modality should be used at 
each response assessment.  Additionally, radiologic imaging of anatomic area of 
externally visible target lesions should be performed at each response assessment (MRI 
with gadolinium is preferred for all anatomic sites except lung).  Externally visible 
CSCC lesions noted at baseline should be photographed at each response assessment 
(Appendix  6), and will generally be deemed non -target.  New externally visible lesions 
that are clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_778170] ( Appendix  6) and 
biopsied.  Note:   In the case of patients with metastatic disease that is not measurable 
by [CONTACT_13407] (eg,  bone only lesions, perineural disease) and with externally 
visible CSCC target lesions, digital medic al photography may be used to follow the 
externally visible lesions as target lesions.

To account for the possibility of unconventional immune responses, im mune -related response 
criteria (irRC) ( Nishino 2013 ) can inform the decision regarding whether to continue treatment for 
an individual patient if the investigator believes it is in the best clinical interest of the patient, after 
discussion and approval from the medical monitor .  Reasons for any such decision to treat 
beyond the protocol definitions of progression must be documented in the CRFs .  However, 
irRC are currently deemed a surrogate endpoint ( Postow 2015 ), and irRC data are not included in 
the primary endpoint of this study.  Any patient who experiences best response (PR or CR) after 
initial progression (per Appendix  1 or Appendix  2, as appropriate) in the context of continued 
treatment (according to principles of irRC in after sponsor appr oval) will not have that best 
response (partial or complete) counted towards the primary endpoint of this study.  
Patients with metastatic CSCC will generally be followed by [CONTACT_393]  1.1 criteria ( Appendix  1).  
It is possible that some patients may also have externally visible lesions that are measurable by 
[CONTACT_778196].  Generally, it will be clinically appropriate to follow these externa lly 
visible lesions as non -targets.  However, patients with externally visible lesions that are deemed 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], the clinical and composite response criteria in Appendix  [ADDRESS_1068729] patients in Groups 1 and 3 (and 
most metastatic patients in Groups 4, 5, and 6) will be followed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 only.  
For Group 2, response assessment is according to the clinical and composite response criteria in 
Appendix  2. 
For externally visible lesions that are indeterminate -appearing regarding presence of CSCC, see 
Appendix  5 for guidelines on tumor biopsies.  Annotation of tumor measurements and biopsies 
should adhere to the guidelines in Appendix  5.  If annotation of the full perimeter of a lesion is 
deemed not clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_32595] (eg, an ulcerated lesion), the priority 
annotation will be the axes delimiters.  The perimeter of the lesion should be annotated as fully as 
possible without causing undue discomfort to the patient.  
All radiology, photography, and biopsy results will b e independently reviewed.  A blinded central 
review committee will be formed to determine overall response based on the integration of these 
modalities.  For Group 5, central review of photographs and radiologic images may be performed.

6.3.4.  Pharmacokinetic and Antibody Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Drug Concentration Measu rements and Samples  
Cemiplimab PK parameters after IV administration will be determined by [CONTACT_778210] a validated assay at visits and time points indicated in , 
Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, Table  7, and Table  8 (as listed in Appendix  3).  Actual time of 
each blood draw must be recorded. “Predose” is defined as before the start of the first cemiplimab 
infusion.  Predose samples may be collected ≤72  hours prior to day  1 dosin g.  Subsequent sampling 
times for drug concentrations will be based on the cemiplimab dosing time that precedes the 
sampling collection.  Pre -infusion is defined as before the start of the cemiplimab  infusion and 
“0 hour” is defined as immediately (within 10 minutes) after the end of the cemiplimab infusion. 
For cemiplimab SC administration,  the ‘pre-infusion PK sample ’ refers to the PK sample  before 
the SC injection  (for patients receiving , the sample should be taken 
prior to the fir st of series of 3 injections) .  
Any unused samples collected for drug concentration measurements may be used for exploratory 
biomarker research or to investigate unexpected AEs.  
Cemiplimab PK parameters and absolute bioavailability by [CONTACT_778211] 5 after a single SC 
dose (C1D1) (time points are indicated in Appendix  3).  Actual dosing time and time of each blood

Subsequent sampling times for drug concentration will be based on the cemiplimab dosing time 
that precedes th e sampling collection.  Pre -infusion is defined as before the start of the 
cemiplimab  infusion and “0  hour” is defined as immediately (within 10 minutes) after the end of 
the cemiplimab infusion. For SC administration PK sample should be collected immediat ely before 
the SC injection, then at time points indicated in Appendix  [ADDRESS_1068731] dosing interval.

Samples for ADA assessment will be collected prior to dosing at time points listed in  Table  3, 
Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, Table  7, Table  8, and Table  9. 
Any unused samples collected for ADA assessment may be used for exploratory biomarker 
research or to investigate unexpected AEs.  
6.3.5.  Biomarker Measurements and Samples  
Speculated pharmacodynamic, predictive, and prognostic biomarkers related to 
cemiplimab  treatment exposure, clinical activity, or underlying disease will be investigated in 
tumor biopsy tissue collected at baseline, after  treatment with cemiplimab, and at progression, if 
available.  Correlative analyses between these biomarkers and clinical response to cemiplimab and 
disease progression may elucidate molecular mechanisms of action of cemiplimab and may 
identify biomarkers for patient stratification in future studies.  Additional biomarker analysis may 
be performed (tissue permitting) to gain better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and 
immune milieu.  Biomarker results will be reported separately from the clinical  study report.

The intent of Groups 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_1068732] completed planned treatment (54  weeks 
in Groups 3 and 5, and 48 weeks in Group 4) without PD will enter posttreatment follow -up.  The 
potential risks and benefits of continued treatment beyond pla nned treatment duration are not 
known, but risks may include cumulative toxicities with cytotoxic chemotherapy and late immune -
related toxicities with PD -1 inhibition.  The planned treatment for the patient's assigned group,

of PD.  
Patients are strongly encouraged to adhere to t he study plan.  However, it is anticipated that some 
Group 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_1068734] not experienced PD and who are 
unwilling to stop study treatment will be allowed to continue study treatment if the investigator 
deems that there are not unacceptable safety risks with continued treatm ent, after notification of 
medical monitor.  After completion of the planned treatment period for the group, such patients 
may continue on the same dose and schedule of study treatment (cemiplimab  350 mg IV Q3W for 
Groups 3 and 5, cemiplimab 600 mg IV Q4W for Group 4), unless there has been dose reduction.  
Patients with dose reduction would only be treated at the reduced dose.  
For Group 3 :  The schedule of events will follow Table  4 but cycles will be counted as 7 through 
12 (instead of 1 through 6).  The patient will not repeat screening assessments before beginning

7.1.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_25044].  Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_329126] (eg, regulators) might also be warranted (Se ction  7.2.3 ). 
7.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
7.2.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will seek information on AEs at each patient contact [CONTACT_778212] 105  days (5 half -lives) after the 
end of study treatment.  After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study 
treatment, only the following cate gories of AEs should be reported on the AE electronic CRF:  
• SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs associated with a protocol -mandated intervention (eg, AEs related to 
an invasive procedure such as a biopsy)  
(Other AEs that occur prior to first treatment should be reported on  the medical history CRF.)  
All AEs after initiation of study treatment and until 105  days (5 half -lives) after the last study 
treatment, regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be reported on the AE electronic CRF.  
Additionally, any SAE or other AE of concern that the investigator believes may be related to 
study treatment and that occurs later than 105  days (5 half -lives) after last study treatment should 
be reported.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  7.2.6 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Section  7.2.5 . 
Group 5 patients and Group 6 patients who opt to receive SC dosing only: any local ISRs will be 
reported as AEs in the CRF, as appropriate.  
7.2.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of c ausal relationship to study treatment must be reported to 
the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the safety reporting guidelines for the 
procedure to be followed.  
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1068738] reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE that occurs more than 105  days (5 half -lives) 
after the last dos e of study treatment, only those SAEs or other AEs of concern deemed by [CONTACT_778213].  The investigator 
should make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a treatm ent-related 
SAE until the event is considered resolved or chronic and/or stable.  
7.2.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to the Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24  hours of learning 
of the even t: 
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  
Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times the intended dose of study drug within the 
intended therapeutic window, if associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the  responsibility of the investigator to report to 
the sponsor (or designee), within [ADDRESS_1068739] ug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient or female partner of 
a male study patient, and/or fetus and/or newborn must be reported as an SAE.  Outcomes for all 
pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Specia l Interest:  
An AESI must be reported within [ADDRESS_1068740] for 
this study include:  
• Grade 2 or greater infusion -related reactions  
• Grade 2 or greater allergic/hypersensitivity reactions  
• Grade 3 or higher irAEs  
• Grade 3 or greater ISR for the SC route  
• An irAE of any grade in a patient previously treated with a PI 3 -K inhibitor  
Note: An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose 
of treatment.  All AEs of unknown etiology asso ciated with drug exposure should be 
evaluated to determine possible immune etiology.  If an irAE is suspected, efforts 
should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic 
causes prior to labeling an AE as an irAE.  
Refer t o the safety reporting guidelines for the reporting procedures to be followed.  
If any SAE or unusual AE is judged related to study treatment, and as possible and practical, obtain 
a blood sample from the patient to permit measurement of plasma drug levels.

All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from study treatment or from the study must be reported 
to the sponsor’s medical monitor within [ADDRESS_1068741] finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
• the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), and/or  
• the test result leads to discontinuation from the study, significant additional 
concomitant medication, or other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_109992], although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will b e assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  7.3.1 . 
7.2.6.  Follow -up 
Information for any nonserious AE that starts during the treatment period or  within 105 days 
(5 half-lives) after last treatment will be collected from the time of the event until resolution of the 
event, or until the patient’s last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the e vent is considered resolved or 
chronic and/or stable.  
7.3. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
7.3.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs (including test findings classified as AEs) will be graded using the current 
version of the NCI -CTCAE grading system.  Adv erse events not listed in the NCI -CTCAE will be 
graded according to the following scale:  
1 (Mild):  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 (Moderate):  Moderate; minimal, local or noninva sive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL*.

The grading criteria for ISRs in Section  5.4.3  are different than NCI -CTCAE version 4.03 grading 
of ISRs, because the criteria in Section  5.4.3  are more descriptive of potential local reactions to 
this class of drug.

The investigator will monitor the safety of study patients at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a  timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound.  The study monitor will be supported by [CONTACT_31599] (eg, Pha rmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  
Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on 
a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
7.5. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or des ignee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpecte d based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the medicinal/study drug).

8.2. Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
8.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoin t for this study is ORR according to central review during the 
12 treatment cycles (Groups 1, 2, and 6), or 6 treatment cycles (Groups 3 and 4).  Overall response 
rate will be assessed separately for patients with metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC:  
• For patients with metastatic disease, RECIST version 1.1 will be used to determine 
ORR ( Eisenhauer  2009 ) (Appendix  1).  Pati ents in which all response assessments are 
performed on radiologic scans according to RECIST 1.1, the determination of the 
independent radiologic response assessment committee will serve as the central 
response assessment.  Clinical or composite response c riteria ( Appendix  2) may be 
used for patients with externally visible target lesions, if all metastatic lesions are not 
measurable by [CONTACT_393] (such as  may occur in patients with bone -only metastases).  
• For patients with unresectable locally advanced disease, clinical response criteria 
(Appendix  1) will be used to determine ORR, for externally visible tumor(s) use bi -
dimensional measurements according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria .  
Composite response criteria will be used for patients who have both target lesions 
measurable by [CONTACT_778187] 1.1 to determine ORR 
(Appendix  2).  In patient s achieving a CR, tumor biopsies will be used in the final 
determination of complete versus PR.   
Patients who are deemed not evaluable (NE) by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1 (Groups 1, 3, 4, and 6; 
Appendix  1) or inevaluable by [CONTACT_778215] (Group 2; Appendix  2) 
will be consid ered as not reaching PR/CR for ORR.  ORR will be calculated from time of 
enrollment.  
8.2.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• ORR for Groups 1 through 6 by [CONTACT_78660]:  
− For patients with metastatic CSCC in which all response a ssessments are performed 
on radiologic scans according to RECIST  1.1, the term “composite response 
assessment” is not applicable.  The investigator’s response assessment for such 
patients will be RECIST 1.1 assessment.  
− For patients with locally advanced CS CC in which all response assessments are 
performed on photographs according to Clinical Response  Criteria for Externally 
Visible Tumors (in Appendix  2), the term “composite response assessment” is not 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  applicable.  The investigator’s response assessment for such patients will be 
according to Clinical Response  Criteria for Externally Visible Tumors.  
− For patients in which target lesion response assessments are performed with both 
scans (according to RECIST 1.1) and photographs (according to Clinical Response  
Criteria for Externally Visible Tumors) , the investigator’s response assessment will 
be accordi ng to Composite Response Criteria (in Appendix  3). 
• DOR  – measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR , 
whichever is recorde d first, until the first date of recurrent or progressive disease or 
death due to any cause in patients with best overall response (BOR ) of CR or PR   
• PFS – measured from time of enrollment  until the first date of recurrent or progressive 
disease, or death due to any cause   
• OS – measured from time of enrollment  until death due to any cause   
• CR rate  
• Change in scores of patient -reported outcomes on EORTC QLQ -C30 (except Group  6) 
• AEs  
• Cemipli mab concentrations in serum ( Appendix  3) 
• Anti-drug antibodies (ADA)  
• For Group 6 only:  To assess relationships between PD -L1 status (by [CONTACT_4658]) and 
efficacy measures (ORR, DOR, PFS).

8.2.4.  Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Serum concentration of cemiplimab will be assessed at multiple time points throughout the study 
treatment and follow -up periods, and the PK will be an alyzed.  
Pharmacokinetic variables may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Ceoi – concentration at end -of-infusion (IV)  
• Cmax – peak concentration (SC)  
• Ctrough – pre-infusion concentration  
• teoi – time of end -of-infusion  
• tmax – time to peak concen tration (SC)  
• AUC 3w – area under the plasma concentration -time curve after the first SC or IV dose  
• F – Absolute bioavailability after SC administration  
8.3. Anti -Drug Antibody Variables  
Regeneron plans to evaluate the impact of the immunogenicity of cemiplimab.  
Anti-drug antibody variables include ADA status and titer as follows:  
• Treatment emergent – defined as any positive postdose ADA assay response when 
baseline results are negative  
• Treatment boosted – defined as any postdose ADA response that is at least 9-fold over 
baseline titer levels  
• Titer values (Titer value category):  
− Low (titer <1,000)  
− Moderate (1,000≤ titer ≤10,000)  
− High (titer >10,000)  
The relationship between immunogenicity and PK of cemiplimab may be assessed, as appropriate.  
8.4. Exploratory Biomar ker Variables – Group 6  
Exploratory pharmacodynamic and biomarker variables for Group 6 include:

 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section  provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study.  The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make 
changes to adapt to u nexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned 
analyses.  The SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  8. 
9.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
For the primary endpoint of ORR, the following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for 
Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively.  
Group 1: H 0: ORR = 15% vs. H 1: ORR ≠ 15%  
Group 2: H 0: ORR = 2 5% vs. H 1: ORR ≠ 25%  
Group 3: H 0: ORR = 15% vs. H 1: ORR ≠ 15%  
Group 4: H 0: ORR = 20% vs. H 1: ORR ≠ 20%  
Group 6: H 0: ORR: = 28% vs. H 1: ORR ≠ 28%  
9.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Patients will be enrolled into [ADDRESS_1068744] had relatively small sample sizes and often 
include a wide range of disease stages ( Nakamura 2013 ).  Clinical studies of CSCC patients have 
been predominantly composed of patients with locally advanced disease (primary site).  The 
NCCN guidelines for CSCC, cisplatin monotherapy, cisplatin plus 5 -FU, and cetuximab are 
described as “possible options” ( Bichakjian 2015 ).  In the only study of cisplatin -based therapy 
for advanced CSCC reported in the last 15 years, the ORR was 34% ( Shin 2002 ).  Cetuximab 
yielded a response rate of 28% in a phase 2 study for patients with advanced CSCC ( Maubec  2011 ).  
Most patients in these studies had locoregionally advanced disease.  There hasn’t been a 
publication of a clinical study specifically for patients with metastatic CSCC.  The aggregate 
experience of patients enrolled i n trials of systemic therapy indicates that a clinically meaningful 
ORR for an investigational agent would be >15% for patients with metastatic disease or >25% for 
patients with unresectable locally/regionally advanced CSCC ( Khansur  1991 , Lippman 1992 , 
Nakamura  2013 , Shin 2002 ).   
Group 4 enrolls patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic or locally advanced).  The clinically 
meaningful ORR would range from 15% t o 25% for patients with advanced CSCC.  Assuming 
equal number of patients with metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC, the clinically 
meaningful ORR would be >20% for patients with advanced CSCC. (Note: With protocol 
Amendment 7, enrollment will begin fo r Group 6 and enrollment for Group 4 will close even if it 
is not fully enrolled.  If statistical hypothesis testing for Group 4 is not possible due to incomplete 
enrollment, descriptive statistics will be used for Group 4).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Hence, the sample sizes for Gro up 1 through 4 were selected such that the lower limit of the 95% 
confidence intervals of the estimated ORRs will be clinically meaningful.  The non -clinically 
meaningful ORR of 15% for Group 1 and Group 3 (evaluated independently) will be excluded 
using t he lower limit of 95% CI if the observed ORR is 28.0% or more; ie, the ORR for Group 1 
and/or Group 3 (evaluated independently) is significantly different from 15%.  The non -clinically 
meaningful ORR of 25% for Group 2 will be excluded using the lower limi t of 95% CI if the 
observed ORR is 36.1% or more (ie, the ORR for Group 2 is significantly different from 25%).  
The non -clinically meaningful ORR of 20% for Group 4 will be excluded using the lower limit of 
95% confidence interval if the observed ORR is 3 1.7% or more; ie, the ORR for Group  4 is 
significantly different from 20%.  In addition, if the observed ORR for Group 4  is 26.7% or 38.3% 
or more, the ORR for Group 4  is significantly different from 15% or 25% respectively, using the 
lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals (see  Table  10, Table  11, and Table  12).  
Group 6 enrolls patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic or locally advanced).  The statistical 
design for Group 6 will be capable of d emonstrating a point estimate of ORR (per independent 
central review) in which the lower bound of the  95% confidence interval excludes the highest 
centrally reviewed ORR in the literature for any prospective study of systemic anticancer treatment 
(other th an cemiplimab) that enrolled at least [ADDRESS_1068745] previous studies of advanced 
CSCC used investigator -based assessments of ORR ( William 2017 , Gold 2018 , Shin 2002 , 
Lippman 1992 , Khansur 1991 , Sadek 1990 , Cartei 2000 ) and therefore do not serve as comparators 
for ORR per independent central review in Study 1540.  Add itionally, some studies did not report 
results according to intention -to-treat ( Shin 2002 , Lippman 1992 , Sadek  1990 ).   However, the 
phase 2 study of cetuximab (N = 36 patients) in  advanced CSCC did report ORR of 28% per 
independent radiology review ( Maubec 2011 ).  As such, 28% is the highest reported ORR in any 
study in advanced CSCC patients that used independent radiology review and enrolled at least 
30 patients.  The statistical plan for Group 6 is capable of testing for an ORR (per independent 
central review) that excludes 28% at the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval.

95% confidence intervals using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
9.5.1.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summ arized descriptively for each group by 
[CONTACT_778217] (no prior systemic therapy versus having received any prior systemic 
therapy).  
9.5.2.  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint for efficacy analyses is the ORR, by [CONTACT_9559].  For Group [ADDRESS_1068751] 1. 1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ) 
analysis of radiologic scans, the independent radiology review is the central review.  For Group 2 
patients (and some Group 1 and Group 3 patient s), response assessments include photos and 
radiologic scans, and the independent composite review committee will serve as the central review.   
The primary analyses of efficacy are based on the binomial exact confidence interval approach, ie, 
whether the lower limit of 95% confidence interval will exclude a historical control ORR that is 
not deemed clinically meaningful.  The 95% binomial exact confidence intervals using Clopper -
Pearson method ( Clopper 1934 ) for observed  ORRs are li sted for Groups 1 and 3 ( Table  10), 
Group 2 ( Table  11), Group 4 ( Table  12), and Group 6 (Table 13).  
The investigator -assessed ORR will be considered as a secondary analysis.  Patients who are 
deemed as not evaluable according to RECIST 1.1 or inevaluable by [CONTACT_778218]/CR for ORR (see Section  6.3.2  ). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints as measured by [CONTACT_109957], PFS, and OS will be summarized by

CSCC in patients with locally advanced CSCC achieving a cli nical response to cemiplimab, as 
measured by [CONTACT_9559], will be summarized descriptively.  
On an exploratory basis, efficacy data between different groups may be described. Such analyses 
should be performed so that each group has a similar amount of fo llow up (for example, at time of 
primary analysis, which is pre -specified as last patient first dose (LPFD) plus approximately 6 
months for each group.)

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.5.6.  Analysis of Anti -Drug Antibody Data  
Formation of ADA will be assessed  in individual patients and per treatment group as follows:  
• Possible correlation between changes in PK profile and the presence/absence of anti -
cemiplimab antibodies will be evaluated to identify a potential impact of anti -
cemiplimab antibodies on drug exp osure.  
• Possible correlation between AEs and the presence/absence of anti -cemiplimab 
antibodies may be evaluated to identify a potential impact of anti -cemiplimab and/or 
antibodies on the incidence of Grade  [ADDRESS_1068756].  Correlative 
analysis with clinical response may be performed using correlation coefficient, box plot and scatter 
plot, and basic regression models.  Bot h comparative analysis and correlative analysis will be 
exploratory in nature and will be described in a separate report.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Size Justification for Biomarker Measurements in Tumor Tissue 
Biopsies  
Although many biomarkers may be assayed in tumor biopsy tissues, CD274 (PD -L1) was selected 
to illustrate the power analysis as an example.  PD -L1 expression level, as defined by [CONTACT_778223], was reported to be associated 
with clinical activity of Nivolum ab (Borghaei 2015 ).  The prevalence of PD -L1 expression levels 
≥1%, ≥5%, ≥10% were 53%, 41%, and 37%, respectively, and the ORRs were reported as 9% vs. 
31%, 10% vs. 36%, 11% vs. 37% for each categorization of PD -L1 expression level , respectively.  
In the following power analysis, the following variations are considered ( Table  14):  
1. Actual number of tumor biopsy obtained and deemed evaluable are 60, 50, or 40.  
2. The PD -L1 expression level categorization results in PD -L1 negative / positive ratio as 1:1 
or 3:2.  
3. Objective  response rates of 10% (PD -L1 negative) vs. 30% (PD -L1 positive) results an 
odds ratio of 3.857 and 10% (PD -L1 negative) vs. 25% (PD -L1 positive) results an odds 
ratio of 3.[ADDRESS_1068757] with type I error o f 20% due to the 
exploratory nature of biomarker analysis, performed in nQuery Advisor 7.0 ( Elashoff , 2007 ).  The 
power may be overestimated for some configurations as the large sample approximation may not 
be adequate for a Chi -square test with small sample sizes.  
In summary, requiring each patient enrolled in this study to provide tumor biopsy provides 
moderate power for exploratory biomarker analysis.

9.6. Multiplicity Considerations  
Adjustments to the significance level for the purposes of multiple testing are not applicable for this 
study.  Statistical analyses for Group 1 and Group 2 will be conducted and reported separately; ie, 
efficacy results and clinical conclusions from Group [ADDRESS_1068758] those of Group 3.   
Groups 4 and 5 are added in protocol amendment after the completion of enrollment in  Groups 1 
through 3 (See Section  3.1).  Efficacy results and clinical conclusions from Group [ADDRESS_1068759] those of the other groups.  
Group 6 is added to provide additional efficacy and safety for cemiplimab monotherapy in patients 
with advanced CSCC (metastatic or unresectable locally advanced) treated with cemipli mab 
[ADDRESS_1068760] those 
of the other groups.  
9.7. Interim Analysis  
Interim Analysis fo r Group 2  
For regions where, alpha spending is not required:  For this planned interim analysis, the ORR and 
associated 95% confidence interval will be summarized.  As the primary objective of this the 
interim analysis is point estimation on ORR and chara cterizing the precision of point estimation, 
there is no hypothesis testing associated with this interim analysis.  Also, no decisions will be made 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1068761] associated with the interim analysis.  Therefore, Type I error adjustment 
is not app licable for this planned interim analysis.  
For regions where, alpha spending is required:  For this interim analysis on Group 2 patients, 2 -
sided alpha of 0.0001 will be allocated for interim analysis, and 2 -sided alpha of 0.0499 will be 
preserved for the final analysis.  Correspondingly, for the interim analysis of the primary endpoint 
of ORR in Group 2 patients, the precision of ORR will be estimated by [CONTACT_778224] 2 -sided 
99.99% exact confidence interval.  The un -adjusted and 2 -sided 95% exact confidenc e interval 
will also be reported at the time of interim analysis.  At the time of the final analysis for Group 2 
patients, both adjusted 95.01% and un -adjusted 95% exact confidence interval will be reported.  
For other efficacy endpoints in Group 2 patients , only 2 -sided 95% exact confidence interval will 
be presented both at the interim and at the final analysis.  
Interim Analysis for Group [ADDRESS_1068762] 50% of patients have had the opportunity to be followed up for a minimum 
of 28 weeks (27 weeks for 3  tumor assessments + 1 -week assessment window) or have reach ed 
the end of study .  The interim analysis will include a minimum of [ADDRESS_1068763] 28 weeks 
will be included in the interim analysis.  
For regions where alpha spending is not required:  For this planned interim analysis, the ORR and 
associated 95% confidence interval will be summarized.  As the primary objective of this the 
interim analysis is point estimation on ORR and charact erizing the precision of point estimation, 
there is no hypothesis testing associated with this interim analysis.  Therefore, Type I error 
adjustment is not applicable for this planned interim analysis.  
For regions where alpha spending is required:  The ove rall type I error rate for analyses of the 
primary endpoint of ORR is controlled at a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 using the O’Brien -Fleming 
spending function.  Table 15 demonstrates the bound and boundary properties for ORR hypothesis 
testing at interim and final analyses, assuming interim analysis was performed at 50% of 
enrollment. The table will be updated using the actual number of patients included in the inte rim 
and final ORR analysis.

9.8. Additional Statistical Data Handling Conventions  
The following analysis and data conventions will be followed:  
Definition of baseline:  
• Unless otherwise specified, the last assessment before the initial administration of 
cemiplimab will be considered the baseline evaluation  
General rules for handling missing data:  
• Unless otherwise specified, there will be no imputations for the missing data  
• If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incomplete or missing, it will 
be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication except if an 
incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to 
treatment.  If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intak e of study 
medication date, then the start date by [CONTACT_197521], 
otherwise, the missing day or month by [CONTACT_197522].  
• Patients who are deemed NE by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1 (Group 1; Appendix  1) or 
inevaluable by [CONTACT_778226] (Group 2; Appendix  2) will be 
considered as not reaching PR/CR for ORR.  Their disease progression will be censored 
at the date of baseline tumor assessment + [ADDRESS_1068765] tumor assessment date for patients  without disease progression.  
• Missing data in quality of life analysis will be presented as missing in changes scores.  
Visit windows:  
• Assessments taken outside of protocol allowable windows will be displayed according 
to the case report form (CRF) assessment recorded by [CONTACT_093].  
9.9. Statistical Considerations Surrounding the Premature Termination 
of a Study  
If the study is terminated prematurely, only those parameters required for the development 
program and/or reporting to regulatory authoriti es will be summarized.  Investigator and sponsor 
responsibilities surrounding the premature termination of a study are presented in Section  15.1.

The ICF used by [CONTACT_778230].  A copy of the IRB - or EC -approved ICF and 
documentation of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to 
the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by  [CONTACT_427]) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the patient in 
language that he/she can understand.  The ICF should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_405527].  
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_20616] r as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study pati ents must be informed of the new 
information and provide their written consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original 
signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to 
the patient.  
13.3. Patient Confide ntiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient will be maintained.  Patients should be identified by a patient identification number, only, 
on CRFs or other documents subm itted to the sponsor.  Documents that will not be submitted to 
the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.  
The patient’s and investigator’s personal data, which may be included in the sponsor database, will 
be treated in compliance with  all applicable laws and regulations.  The sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by [CONTACT_13159].

 CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  1. RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS: RECIST GUIDE LINE (VERSION 1.1)  
This appendix applies to all patients with metastatic disease that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_102675].  They should receive response assessments according to the treatment schedule of their 
cohort.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_778233] d Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1; 
Eisenhauer  2009 ).  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.  
Selection of Lesions  
• Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm 
(≥2 cm) by [CONTACT_13190] x -ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1  cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_119382]. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions 
of centimeters).  
Note:   
• Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5  cm) in short a xis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] 
(CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5  cm]). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
• Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), includ ing small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm [<1  cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to 
<15 mm [≥1 to <1.5  cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangit is 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignan t lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic 
metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
measurability described above. Ho wever, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same 
patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
• Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 
5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that l end themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selec ted. A sum of the diameters (longest for 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 140 of 185 
 CONFIDENTIAL  non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesio ns over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, 
but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be  
noted throughout follow -up.  
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of t reatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation i s 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
• Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1  cm) diameter 
as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
• Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
• Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the ass umption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5  cm) or less. If 
CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5  cm), the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situation.  
• PET -CT: At pre sent, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagno stic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions 
over time. Note, however, that th e PET portion of the CT introduces additional data 
which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
• Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
                                        VV-RIM-00165169-2.0 Approved - 09 Sep 2021 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1068776] in selected instances.  
• Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  The utilization of these t echniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in 
trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or sur gical resection  is an 
endpoint.  
• Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
• Cytology, Histolo gy: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confi rmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease  
• FDG -PET :  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New 
lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline an d a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans ar e needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Les ions 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm (<1  cm). 
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of  target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the s mallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5  cm). (Note: the appearance 
of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither s ufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalizati on 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
[<1 cm] short axis).  
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] t reating 
physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Overall Response Criteria  
The best overall response is the best response r ecorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement  of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Revised Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) are summarized in the table:

These patients will be followed by [CONTACT_778196]. They will also undergo radiologic 
imaging (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], MRI with gadolinium) at baseline, and this will als o be performed serially at 
each response assessment unless the investigator deems that baseline radiologic imaging was 
uninformative.  Radiologic imaging (preferably, MRI with gadolinium) will be essential in the 
evaluation of tumors that have subdermal co mponents that cannot be adequately assessed by [CONTACT_778234].  See protocol Section  6.3.1  and 6.3.2  for further information on imaging 
requirements.  
Response assessments to be performed depends on the group and their stage of 
treatment/retreatment/follow -up.  Standardized digital p hotographs of the externally visible 
component of all target lesions must be obtained at baseline and at the time of each subsequent 
tumor assessment.    
Investigators will also provide a clinical description of the externally visible target lesion(s) at 
baseline and at each tumor assessment, as well as comments on any changes in the  lesion(s) since 
the previous assessment.  
SPECIAL ISSUES FOR EXTERNALLY VISIBLE TUMORS:  
1. Anatomic Defects  
Regarding tumor around a surgical cavity/anatomic defect (eg, rhinectomey), such lesions should 
be considered non -measurable unless there is a nodular lesion measuring ≥[ADDRESS_1068778] should not be 
considered in measuring the lesion.  
2. Indeterminate -Appearing Tissue  
If there is uncertainty about whether a given lesion or are a of a lesion represents malignancy versus 
benign process (eg, scarring, fibrosis), biopsies should be obtained. Indeterminate -appearing areas 
(eg, scarring, fibrosis) are included in the tumor measurements unless biopsies are obtained to 
establish benign status.  
To reduce risk of sample error, biopsy of only a single area on the tumor is not allowed. Biopsy of 
at least two separate areas of the lesion are required when biopsy is indicated. Each biopsy will be 
performed in a pairwise manner (approximately a djacent) so that there will be one sample for local 
review and one for central review for each biopsy, as per Appendix  5.  
As such, when the decisio n is made to perform biopsy, at least 4 biopsy samples are obtained 
(biopsy of two separate areas, with two biopsies in each area: one for central, one for local from 
each area).  Biopsy samples will not be bisected or split in half for local and central r eview; rather, 
separate adjacent samples will be obtained.  See Appendix  5 for biopsy details.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Note on timeline for finalization of measurement/resp onse assessment:  Generally, baseline 
disease measurements and response assessments should be completed on the day of the visit at 
which digital medical photography was performed. However, for visits in which tumor biopsies 
are performed, it is understood t hat the local pathology report may not be available for up to 
5 business days after the biopsy.  
When biopsies are performed to distinguish between benign versus malignant tissue, the annotated 
photograph for that visit should clearly indicate the region o f the tumor that was biopsied to 
distinguish benign versus malignant tissue. Within one week of the date of biopsies, the 
investigator should finalize the tumor measurements for that visit with the benefit of the local 
pathology report.  
For circumstances in which the intent of the biopsy is to distinguish between disease stability and 
response, it is not necessary to hold study treatment while the local pathology report is pending. 
For circumstances in which the biopsy, if positive, would result in discont inuation of study 
treatment due to progression, treatment should be held until biopsy results are finalized and 
progression has been ruled out.  
3) Local Versus Central Review  
An independent photographic review committee, with access to de -identified digit al medical 
photography results and biopsy results, will provide response assessments as required by [CONTACT_778235] (Section  2). Independent photographic reviews will be 
scheduled by [CONTACT_778236] “real -time.” Clinical 
management decisions generally will be as per investigator response assessments and local 
pathology review. In the unli kely event that independent review yields major differences with the 
local response assessment that could have implications for the ongoing management of an active 
patient on study, the situation will be discussed between the sponsor and the investigator i n order 
to determine patient management.  
4) Confirmation of Responses  
After any objective response, confirmatory digital photography (and radiologic imaging, if 
performed as part of the initial response assessment) will be obtained at least 4 weeks followi ng 
initial documentation of objective response.  
For any complete responses observed in digital medical photography of externally visible target 
lesions, confirmatory biopsies are required to establish status of complete response.  
5) For all Patients being  followed with Externally Visible Tumors  
Patients with metastatic CSCC will generally be followed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria ( Appendix  1). 
It is possible that some patients in may also have externally visible lesions that are measurable by 
[CONTACT_778196]. In such circumstances, the externally visible lesions generally will 
be followed as non -target lesions. The exception to this rule w ould be a patient with externally 
visible lesions in whom the only M1 lesions are not measurable by [CONTACT_393] (eg, a patient with 
bone -only metastases), in which case the externally visible lesions (lesion size ≥10 mm in baseline 
dimensional perpendicular axe s) would be target lesions and followed as per clinical response 
criteria in this appendix, and the non -measurable metastatic lesions (eg, bone metastases) would

 CONFIDENTIAL  be followed as non -target lesions. For any target lesions that are measured by [CONTACT_778237], measurements will be bi -dimensional.  
6) Patients with unresectable locally advanced CSCC with Deeply Invasive Tumors  
Regarding patients with unresectable locally advanced CSCC, tumor measurements for these 
patients will generally be performed  with digital medical photography (bi -dimensional 
measurements).  However, some patients may have deeply invasive target lesions in which tumor 
measurements can better be obtained with cross -sectional imaging (eg, MRI with gadolinium or 
CT with contrast).  For any target lesions that are measured by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging (MRI 
gadolinium or CT with contrast), measurements will unidimensional according to RECIST 1.1.  
Clinical Response  Criteria for Externally Visible Tumors  (for Groups 2, 4, 5, and 6 
patient s with locally a dvanced CSCC, and selected Groups 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 patients in which 
target lesions are followed by [CONTACT_778196])  
A. External ly Visible Tumor  Dim ension  
The externally visible component of target lesion(s) will be measured using  bi-dimensional WHO 
criteria as the sum of the products (of individual target lesions) in the longest dimension and 
perpendicular second longest dimension at each tumor assessment and will be documented using 
   
 
 
. 
Clinical response criteria for externally visible tumor(s) require bi -dimensional measurements 
according to WHO  criteria (reference), and are as follows:  
• Complete response of externally visible disease (vCR): all target lesion (s) and non -
target lesion(s) no longer visible, maintained for  at least 4 weeks.  Documentation of 
vCR requires confirmation by [CONTACT_778238] s ite(s) of externally visible target lesion(s) 
with histologic confirmation of no residual malignancy, per central pathology review 
(Appendix  5).  In  the absence of such histologic confirmation, a patient cannot be 
deemed to have experienced vCR and the best response would be partial response.  
• Partial response of externally visible disease (vPR):  decrease of  50% (WHO criteria) 
or greater in the sum the  products of perpendicular longest dimensions of  target 
lesion(s), maintai ned for  at least 4 weeks  
• Stable externally visible disease (vSD):  not meeting c riteria for  vCR, vPR,  or 
progressive disease  
• Progression of visible disease (vPD):  increase of  ≥ 25% ( WHO criteria) in the sum of 
the products of perpendicular longest dimensions of  target lesion( s). In rare cases, 
unequivocal progression of a non -target lesion may be accepted as vPD.

RESEARCH AND TREATEM ENT  OF CANCER 
POSITRON -EMISSION TO MOGRAPHY CRITERIA 
(FOR GROUP 4)  
Reporting of results of [18F]-FDG measurements is adapted from EORTC 1999 Criteria 
(Young  1999 ). 
1. Progressive metabolic disease to be classified as an increase in [18F]-FDG tumour SUV of 
greater than 25% within the tumour region defined on the baseline scan, visible increase in the 
extent of [18F]-FDG tumour uptake or the appearance of new [18F]-FDG uptake in metastatic 
lesions.  
2. Stable metabolic disease would be clas sified as an increase in tumour [18F]-FDG SUV of less 
than 25% or a decrease of less than 15% and no visible increase in extent of [18F]-FDG tumour 
uptake (>20% in the longest dimension).  
3. Partial metabolic response would be classified as a reduction of a minimum of 25% in tumour 
[18F]-FDG SUV after one cycle of chemotherapy, and greater than 25% after more than one 
treatment cycle. Reporting would need to be accompanied by [CONTACT_778242]. An empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477]  25% was found to be a useful cutoff 
point, but there is a need for a reproducibility analysis to determine the appropriate cutoffs for 
statistical significance. A reduction in the extent of the tumour [18F]-FDG uptake is not a 
requirement for partial meta bolic response.  
4. Complete metabolic response would be complete resolution of [18F]-FDG uptake within the 
tumour volume so that it was indistinguishable from surrounding normal tissue.

 CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  10. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
ESTIMANDS  
For Group 6 primary analysis, the statistical methods for the primary and secondary endpoints will 
be consistent with that which was done for Groups 1 to 3.  This will facilitate a meaningful 
comparison of Group 6 with the previous groups.  Additional statistical analyses will also be 
performed, including sensitivity analyses for DOR and PFS assuming informative censoring for 
intercurrent event.  
Attributes for ORR per Central Review and Investigator Assessment  
1. The study population is defined as CSCC patients who are enrolled on the protocol.  
2. The endpoint is ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with BOR of CR or PR.  ORR 
per central review is the primary endpoint, and ORR per investigator assessment is a 
secondary endpoint.  
3. Intercurrent events and how to account for these events are described in Table  16. 
4. Estimated ORR will be provided, along with the 2 -sided 95% exact binomial confidence 
interval using the Clopper -Pearson method.  
Table  16: Intercurrent Events for Analysis of ORR per Central Review and 
Investigator Assessment  
Intercurrent events  Rules of imputing data in  primary analysis  
Initiation of palliative radiation 
therapy  Patient will be considered to have PD at time of initiation of 
radiation (Section  5.7.4  of protocol).  
Surgical removal of target 
lesion  BOR will be considered as PR if no prior PD is observed 
(Section  5.7.3  of protocol).  
Unconventional responses (eg, 
a patient first experience PD 
and then CR or PR)  BOR will be considered as PD.  
No evaluable postbaseline 
tumor assessment  BOR will be deemed NE. Patient with BOR of NE will be 
included in the ORR analysis as a non -responder.  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed for ORR where the intercurrent events of “initiation of 
palliative radiation therapy” and “surgical removal of target lesion” will be ignored.  Patients with 
unconventional responses will be considered as responders.  Patients with BOR of NE will be 
excluded from this analysis.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Attributes for DOR per Central Review and Investigator Assessment  
1. The study population is defined as CSCC patients who are enrolled on the protocol and had 
a CR/PR response.  
2. The endpoint is DOR, measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date of recurrent or progressive disease or death 
due to any cause in patients wi th BOR of CR or PR.  
3. Intercurrent events and how to account for these events are described in Table  17. 
4. DOR will be summarized by [CONTACT_109958] 95% confidence interval by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier

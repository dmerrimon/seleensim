Title of Study: A Phase 2a, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 in the Treatment of 
Subjects with Essential Tremor (ET)  
Study center(s):  Up to 25  centers  
Phase of development: 2a 
Methodology:  
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK ) of SAGE -217.  
Subjects who consent prior to the approval  of Protocol Amendment #3 by [CONTACT_7155] l receive the 
oral solution formulation for the duration of the study.  Subjects who consent after Amendment #3 is 
approved by [CONTACT_7156]. 
There are three  parts:  
Part A : Open -label with morning dosing (7 days). 
A screening period to determine subject eligibility will occur between Day -28 to Day -1.  All eligible  
subjects will start on a 10-mg dose of study drug administered with food on Day 1.  Subjects will 
receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 an d 30 mg with food daily on Days 3 to 7.   
Part B : Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal with morning dosing (7 days). 
In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a dose of at least [ADDRESS_5986] responded to SAGE-217, defined as a 30% reduction from 
baseline in the TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) kinetic tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4 c scores from both sides of the body) predose on Day 8. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to SAGE -217 or placebo and will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part  A in the morning with food.  Subjects randomized to the 
placebo arm will represent randomized withdrawal (withdrawal from treatment  they received in 
Part A). 
Subjects will be exposed to study drug (SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_5987] dose.   
Part C:  Open -label with evening dosing (14 days).  Subjects in Part C will not have participated in 
Part A or Part B.   
A screening period to determine subject eligibility will occur between Day -28 to Day - 1. All eligible 
subjects will start on a 10 -mg dose of study drug administered with food in the evening (8:00pm ±30 
min) on Day 1.  Subjects will receive 20 mg with food in the evening on Day 2, and 30 mg with food 
in the evening on Day 3. Beginning on Day 4 and continuing through Day 14, subjects will receive a 
40-mg total daily dose (administered as 10 mg with  food in the morning [8:00am ±30 min] and 30 mg 
Protocol 217- ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #4, Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
6 with food in the evening [8:00pm ±30 min]). Study drug will be self -administered by [CONTACT_7157] 14-day Treatment Period. Compliance with study drug administration 
will be mo nitored via a follow-up call from the site each evening (within approximately 1 hour 
following the scheduled evening dose) on Days 1-14.  
Subjects will be exposed to study drug (SAGE-217) for up to [ADDRESS_5988] dose.   
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open- label phases of the study (Parts A and C). See 
Section  9.3  for dose adjustment criteria.    
Assessments will be perf ormed periodically during Parts A, B, and C, as outlined in the Schedule of 
Events (Table 2, Table  3, and Table  4, respectively ). 
Objectives  and Endpoints : 
Primary  Efficacy : 
oFor Parts A and B, the primary efficacy objective is to compare the effect of 7 days
administration of SAGE -217 Capsules to placebo on the change in tremor severity, as measured
by [CONTACT_7158] (D ay 8) in the accelerometer- based Kinesia™ kinetic tremor
combined score (ie, the sum of Kinesia kinetic tremor scores from both sides of the body) at Day
14.
oFor Part C, the primary efficacy objective is to assess the effect of 14 days administration of
SAGE 217 Capsules on tremor severity, as measured by [CONTACT_7159] (Day 1) in the
accelerometer- based Kinesia™ upper limb tremor combined score (ie, the sum of accelerometer -
based Kinesia forward outstretched postural tremor, lateral "wing beating" postural tremor, and
kinetic tremor item scores from both sides of the body) at Day 15.
Secondary  Efficacy : 
oFor Parts A and B, the secondary efficacy objectives  are to compare the effect of 7 days
administration of SAGE -217 Capsules to placebo (Part A) and to assess the effect of 14 days
administration of SAGE -217 Capsules (Part B) on the following endpoints:
oTremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the Kinesia
upper limb total score (ie, the sum of accelerometer- based Kinesia forward outstretched
postural tremor, lateral "wing beating" postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores
from  both sides of the body) and individual item scores at Day 14.
oTremor severity, as measured by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the TETRAS
upper limb total score (ie, the sum of TETRAS Performance Subscale item 4 scores [4a,
4b, and 4c] from both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS Performance Subscale
upper limb item scores at Day 14.
oTremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in other
TETRAS Performance Subscale scores measured at Day 14.
The above endpoints may also be assessed for SAGE -[ADDRESS_5989] of 14 days administration of
SAGE -217 Capsules on the following endpoints:

Screening Duration: up to  28 days; Treatment Period: 14 days; Follow-up: [ADDRESS_6004]: up to  56 days  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Tremor severity will be measured by [CONTACT_6317] -based Kinesia  and clinician -rated TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores.  The following measures will be exploratory measures.  Quality -of-life 
will be evaluated using the TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording of subjects performing three 
everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) and tremor oscillation 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_7165] E4 Wristband .   
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma will be collected to assay for concentrations of SAGE -217 and may be assayed for  SAGE -217 
metabolites, if deemed necessary .  The following PK parameters will be derived from the plasma 
concentrations (where evaluable): AUC
0-t, AUC 0-∞, C max, tmax, and t ½.   
Safety  and Tolerability : 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical labo ratory 
measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage,  C-SSRS, and adverse event 
reporting.  The Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale and a DEQ -5 will be used to assess mood and 
perception of drug effects , respectively .   
Statistical methods:  
Study Populations 
The safety population is defined as all subjects who are administered at least one dose of study drug.   
The efficacy population will consist of all subjects in the safety population who complete at least one 
dose and have at least one post -dose efficacy evaluation  (Kinesia assessment) .   
The PK population will consist of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma 
concentrations for PK evaluations.   
Efficacy Analysis  
Analyses will be done separately for each part.  
Effica cy data (including change from randomization or baseline values for accelerometer -derived 
Kinesia and clinician -rated TETRAS scores) will be summarized using appropriate descriptive 
statistics and listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
The change from randomization or baselin e in the Kinesia kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum 
of Kinesia kinetic tremor scores from both sides of the body) at Day [ADDRESS_6005].  Wherever necessary and appropriate, PK parameter s will be dose-adjusted to account for 
individual differences in dose.

 28  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Essential Tremor and Unmet Medical Need  
Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common neurological diseases, with an overall 
prevalence of 0.9%.  Prevalence increases with age and is estimated to be 4.6% in people over 
65 years of age (Louis 2010, Deuschl 2011).  Essential tremor is largely a bilateral, symmetrical 
postural or kinetic tremor involving hands and f orearms that is visible and persistent.  Additional 
or isolated tremor of the head or lower limbs may occur, but in the absence of abnormal posturing ( Deuschl 1998, Habib -ur-Rehman 2000).  The onset of tremor has a bimodal 
distribution, with onset between [ADDRESS_6020] plays a key role in ET ( McAuley 2000, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]  2003, 
Elble  2009, Schnitzler 2009, Deuschl 2009).  Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the 
ventral intermediate nucleus and of the subthalamic nucleus improve ET ( Deuschl 2011, 
Zappia 2013, Rajput 2014) .  Microscopic cerebellar pathology has been identified, including 
gliosis, Purkinje cell loss, and increased torpedoes (swellings) in the Purkinje cell axons 
(Louis 2007, Axelrad 2008, Shill 2008, Louis 2009).  Activation studies with positron emission 
tomography indicate abnormally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the cerebellum both at rest and when tremor is provoked by [CONTACT_7172] ( Boecker  1994, Wills  1996).   
Essential tremor is associated with impaired γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)ergic function (and 
consequent hyperactivity) in the cerebellum ( Málly 1996, Bucher 1997, Louis 2007, Louis 2008, 
Paris -Robidas 2012).  γ-aminobutyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system (CNS), is released from GABAergic neurons and binds to several types of 
GABA receptors ( γ-aminobutyric acid -ligand gated chloride channel [ GABA
A] and 
γ-aminobutyric acid-G protein-coupled [ GABA B]) on target neurons.  γ- aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel r eceptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, 
are macromolecular proteins that form a chloride ion channel complex and contain specific 
binding sites for GABA and a number of allosteric regulators, including barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.   
Drugs acting on GABA
A receptors, such as primidone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], or ethanol decrease 
tremor amplitude , suggesting that altered GABAergic neurotransmission is involved in ET.  
Postmortem analysis revealed a 35% reduction of GABA A receptors and a 22% to 31% reduction 
of GABA B receptors in the dentate nucleus of cerebella of ET subjects ( Paris -Robidas 2012).  
Reduced levels of G ABA in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_7112] 
(Málly  1996 ).  Moreover, toxins such as aflatrem, penitrem A , or harmaline have been proposed 
to induce tremor in rodents by [CONTACT_7173] ( Cavanagh 1998, Miwa 2007), 
and targeted deletion of the α1 subunit of GABA A receptor in knockout mice exhibits a 
15 to  19 Hz action tremor, similar to ET in humans ( Kralic 2005).    
Consistent with the role of GABA , the majority of therapeutics for ET act by [CONTACT_7174] t ransmission ( Louis 2012, Benito-Leon 2007, Pahapi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 1999).  First-line treatments 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #4, Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 29  for ET include the anticonvulsant primidone and the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol 
(Gorman  1986).  Like primidone, gabapentin is an anticonvulsant found to be effective in the 
treatment of ET (O’Brien 1981, Gironell 1999).   The oldest treatment for ET is ethanol, which 
temporarily ameliorates tremor  and is freq uently used by [CONTACT_7175]- medicate; however, 
chronic use of ethanol for tremor management carries the known risks of alcohol dependence and 
overuse ( Pahwa 2003).    
These treatments are moderately effective, reducing, though not resolving, tremor amplitudes in 
about 50% of the subjects ( Schmouth 2014).  In addition, one out of three patients  abandon 
treatment becau se of side  effects or poor efficacy ( Louis 2010), illustrating that with few feasible  
treatment options and a range of handicaps in daily living makes ET an area of high unmet 
medical need.    
5.2. SAGE -217  
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA A receptor and thus is expected to be 
of benefit for the treatment of ET.  Unlike benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_7113] γ -subunit-
containing subset of GABA A receptors ( Pritchett 1989, Esmaeili 2009 ), SAGE -[ADDRESS_6021] a wider range of activity 
(Belelli 2002).  
Two dosage forms of SAGE-217 for oral administration will be used in this study (SAGE -217 
Oral Solution and SAGE-217 Capsules). 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution 6 mg/mL (40% w/w aqueous h ydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin [ HPβCD] 
with 0.025 mg/mL sucralose) is a nonviscous, clear solution.   
SAGE -[ADDRESS_6022] gelatin capsules containing a white to off -white 
powder. In addition to SAGE-217 Drug Substance, the active, SAGE-217 capsules contain 
croscarmellose sodium, mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium stea ryl 
fumarate as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . 
5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Experience with SAGE -217 
5.3.1. Nonclinical Studies with SAGE -217 
In nonclinical studies of SAGE-217, sedative- hypnotic effects were consistently observed at 
higher doses in both in vivo pharmacology studies as well as in toxicology studies.  The sedative- hypnotic impairments seen with SAGE -217 were typi[INVESTIGATOR_7114]
A positive 
modulators, ranging from hyperexcitability and ataxia at the lower doses through deep sedation 
and ultimately anesthesia at hig her doses.  Depth and duration of sedation demonstrated a clear 
dose response over the range tested, with evidence of tolerance occurring with continued exposure.  Tolerance to the effects of SAGE -217 on motor incoordination was  not observed after

The compound has been assessed in 14-day rat and dog toxicology studies with daily

5.3.2. Clinical Experience 
To date, two clinical studies employing SAGE -217 Oral Solution are clinically complete  and 
final clinical s tudy reports are pending.  Discussions of pharmacokinetic (PK) data are limited to 
the single -ascending dose, food, and essential tremor cohorts from Study 217- CLP-101 and the 
multiple -ascending dose and drug-drug interaction (DDI) cohorts from Study 217-C LP-102.  
Discussions of safety data are limited to the single -ascending dose cohorts in Study 217- CLP-
101 and the multiple -ascending dose cohorts in Study 217- CLP-102.  In addition, one clinical 
study of the safety, tolerability, PK, and relative bioavaila bility  SAGE -217 Capsules is clinically 
complete and the final study report is pending.  The results of this study (217- CLP-103) are 
briefly described below. 
Study 217- CLP-[ADDRESS_6024] -in-human, four- part study that assessed the effects of a single 
dose of SAGE -217 Oral Solution .  The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-
ascending dose design in healthy adult volunteers, with the objective of identifying the maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) and PK profiles of SAGE-217 Oral Solution.  Subjects in each of the 
single -ascending dose cohorts received a single dose of study drug, either SAGE -217 Oral 
Solution (six subjects) or placebo (two subjects), with SAGE-217 Oral Solution doses of 0.25 mg , 0.75 mg, 2 mg, 5.5 mg, 11 mg, 22 mg, 44 mg, 55 mg, and 66 mg.  Escalation to the 
next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7176] ( SRC) and agreement reached that it was safe to increase the dose.  The MTD was 
determined to be 55 mg.  Two cohorts, 6 subjects e ach received SAGE -217 Oral Solution in an 
open-label manner (one cohort received 50% of the MTD [22 mg] to study the food effects and 
the other cohort received the MTD [55 mg] to study the effects on subjects with essential 
tremor ).  SAGE -[ADDRESS_6025] ( 0.25 mg ) through the highest (66 mg ) dose , and supported once daily oral dosing 
with food.   
Study 217- CLP-102 was a two- part study that assessed the effects of multiple -ascending doses of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution .  The study was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -ascending 
dose study in healthy adult volunteers.  Subjects in each of the multiple-ascending dose cohorts 
received study drug, either SAGE -217 Oral Solution  (nine subjects) or placebo (three subjects), 
once daily for 7 days, with SAGE-217 Oral Solution  doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 35 mg.  
Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7177].  The MTD was determined to be 30 mg.  It was observed that subjects receiving the drug in the evening  did better in terms of 
tolerability compared to when they received the drug in the morning.  A fourth cohort of 12 subjects receiv ed 30 mg of SAGE-217 Oral Solution in an open- label manner to study drug -drug 
interactions.  SAGE -217 Oral Solution is not likely to induce the metabolism of CYP2B6 or 
CYP3A4 substrates.  SAGE -217 Oral Solution was orally bioavailable and suitable for once 
daily oral dosing at night time with food.   
SAGE -217 Oral Solution was generally well tolerated.  In both Phase 1 studies (217- CLP-101 
and 217- CLP-102), doses were escalated until the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7115].  Most adverse 
events were reported as mild  or moderate in intensity, and there were no serious adverse events 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #4, Version 5.[ADDRESS_6026] dose group (66 mg ).  Some changes in 
mean blood pressure and heart rate were observed after single doses of 44 mg and greater.  After 
multiple doses of 30 mg (AM or PM) or 35 mg (PM) over [ADDRESS_6027] single dose in the single -ascending dose study.  Subjects seemed to tolerate 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution better when given as night time dosing.   
The safety, tolerability, PK , and relative bioavailabilit y of the SAGE -217 Capsules were 
assessed in a Phase 1 randomized, open- label, cross -over study (Study 217- CLP-103). In the 
fasted state, SAGE -217 Capsules demonstrated reduced exposure in terms of maximum (peak) 
plasma concentration  (C max) and area under t he curve from zero to the time of the last 
quantifiable concentration ( AUC last) compared to SAGE-217 Oral Solution.  SAGE -217 Capsules 
administered in the fed state (with standard and high- fat meal) showed increased exposure 
compared to the fasted state an d approximately equivalent exposure in terms of geometric mean 
AUC last compared to SAGE-217 Oral Solution; however, the C max for SAGE -217 Capsules was 
reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50% when compared with SAGE-[ADDRESS_6028] of sedation .  Second, an apparent diminution of 
TETRAS response was observed at th e end of the dosing interval; therefore, in Part C, an 
additional 10 mg dose will be given in the morning with the intention of elevating plasma concentrations of SAGE- 217 to levels associated with beneficial effects, but where sedation is 
unlikely. 
The divided dose regimen will prolong plasma concentrations of SAGE -217, and will increase 
the C
max by [CONTACT_3450] 11% at steady -state compared to dosing once per day.  Model 
predictions are dose-proportional and, as such , the 24- hour AUC is expected to increase by  
1.33-fold based on the increase in total daily dose from 30 to 40 mg  in Part C.  Figure 1 
compares PK profiles of the dose regimen used in Part s A and  B and the proposed 30+10mg 
regimen  in Part C .

 33  likely to be similar to those mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure .  Many compounds that 
target the GABA A receptors exhibit clinical efficacy in ET, validating this receptor as a 
therapeutic target.  Given the promising SAGE-[ADDRESS_6030] vs tolerability (adverse events), 
specifically sedation.  Given the high medical need and potential for benefit in ET, there is a 
favorable benefit- risk evaluation to investigate SAGE -[ADDRESS_6031] frequent AE observed was sedation that was mild, transient, and occurred within 1 to 4 hours and generally 
dissipated by 8 hours.  The clinical portion of this study has rece ntly completed; the final report 
is in progress. 
In conclusion, selection criteria for the proposed study take into account the potential safety 
risks. Safety monitoring, and the implementation of a formal dose-reduction and study drug 
discontinuation sche me also have the potential to mitigate risk.  From a benefit/risk perspective, 
the appropriate measures are being taken in order to ensure the safety of the subjects who will be enrolled.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is a three -part, multicenter, Phase 2a study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, and PK of SAGE-217 in approximately  60 adult subjects with ET.  Subjects who 
consent prior to the approval of Protocol Amendment #3 by [CONTACT_7180].  Subjects who consent after Amendment #3 is approved by [CONTACT_7156]. 
Part A of the study is an open-label design with morning dosing for 7 days.  Part B of the study is 
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design.  Subjects will be exposed to 
study drug (SA GE-217 or placebo) for up to 14 days .  Part C of the study is an open- label design 
with evening dosing (and morning and evening dosing beginning on Day 4) for up to [ADDRESS_6034] dose.   
During the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), after signing the informed consent form (ICF), 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and the severity of each subject’s ET will be 
evaluated using TETRAS.   Eligible subjects will return  to the clinical study unit on Day -1.   
The study will be conducted in t hree parts : 
• Part A:  Beginning on Day 1, a ll subjects will receive open -label SAGE -217 in the 
morning with food (as outlined in Section  9.2) for 7 days.  Subjects will receive 
SAGE -217 10 mg on Day 1, SAGE-217 20 mg on Day 2, and SAGE-217 30 mg from 
Day 3 to Day 7 , with dose adjustm ents for severe adverse events judged by [CONTACT_7181] ( Section  9.3). 
• Part B:  In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a dose of 
≥[ADDRESS_6035] responded to SAGE-217, defined as 
a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor (item 4c) combined score 
predose on Day 8.  E ligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive 
SAGE -217 or placebo for 7 days beginning on Day 8.  All doses of study drug will be 
administered with food as outlined in Section  9.2.  Subjects randomized to SAGE-217 
or placebo will receive their maximum dose  as determi ned in Part A in the morning

source documents.   
8.3.1. Study Drug Withdrawal  
P
articipation in the study is strictly voluntary.  Subjects are free to discontinue the study at any 
time without giving their reason(s).   
A subject must be withdrawn from the study treatment in the event of any of the following: 
•Withdrawal of the subject’s consent;
•New onset of a condition that  would have met exclusion criterion, is clinically
relevant and affects the subject’s safety, and discontinuation is considered necessary
by [CONTACT_7183]/Sponsor;
•Occurrence of intolerable adverse event s at the lowest dose ;
•Occurrence of pre gnancy;
•Intake of nonpermitted concomitant medication;
•Subject noncompliance;
•Significant protocol deviation determined in consultation with the Medical Monitor.
If a subject failed  to attend scheduled assessments during the course of the study, the 
Investigators must determine the reasons and the circumstances as completely and accurately as 
possible and document this in the subject’s source documents.   
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will be replaced only if they withdraw 
prior to  dosing.  Subjects who are withdrawn from the study, fail to return or are no longer 
qualified will not be replaced.   
8.3.2. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons, including the occurrence of adverse events or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to subjects, or for administrative reasons.  In the event of study termination, Sage

9.4. Prior/Concomitant Medications and Restrictions  
9.4.1. Prior/ Concomitant Medications 
Any concomitant medication determined necessary for the welfare of the subject may be given at 
the discretion of the Investigator at any time during the study under the guidance outlined in Section  9.4.2.   
Record the name, start date (if known), indication for use and whether ongoing or stopped of medications/treatments taken within 2 weeks prior to informed consent and throughout the study.   
The charts of all study participants will be reviewed for new concomitant medications through 
discharge from the unit.  Chart reviews will include examination of nursing and physician progress notes, vital signs, and medication records in order to identify adverse events  that may be 
associated with new concomitant medications.  New concomitant medications, ongoing concomitant medications with a change in dose and medical procedures ordered (eg, laboratory

Amendment #4, Version 5.[ADDRESS_6059] symptom response by a measurement of 
Kinesia , TETRAS upper limb items , and TETRAS Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8).  
Quality -of-life assessments include TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording of subjects 
performing three everyday tasks.  Physiolog ical activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as 
measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring) and 
tremor oscillation as assessed by [CONTACT_7192] (ie, raw 
accelerometer values) will be assessed by [CONTACT_7165] E4 Wristband .  All efficacy assessments 
will be performed at the scheduled time points as outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Table 4 ). 
11.1. Kinesia  
In order to measure tremor amplitude, subjects will wear a wireless ring motion sensor (Kinesia,  Great Lakes Neuro Technologies).  The motion sensor uses three orthogonal 
accelerometers and three orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three- dimensional motion.  Data are 
then transmitted from the sensor to a computer using Bluetooth technology.  These measures of three-dimensional motion for each maneuver are then converted to Kinesia scores, which have been shown to correlate with corresponding clinician- rated TETRAS scores (Giovanni 2010).  
Each Kinesia score ranges from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate more severe tremor.   The Kinesia  
assessment is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 assessment . 
11.2. TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) 
Performance Scale  
Item #4 (upper limb tremor) of the TETRA S Performance Subscale wi ll be completed using both 
the Kinesia device and clinician assessment.  Testing should be completed within ±10 minutes of the planned questionnaire time points.  All three maneuvers  in the upper limb assessments 
(items  4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the RIGHT arm and then for the 
LEFT.  Predose assessments can be done any time within [ADDRESS_6060] be ≥2 on each side (left and right) for kinetic tremor and ≥2 on 
each side (left and right) for either wing beating or forward outstretched postural tremor.  A copy 
of the TETRAS is provided in Appendix 3.   
11.3. Empatica E4 Wristband  
Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) will be  assessed by [CONTACT_7162] E4 Wristband.  The Empatica E4 Wristband is a wearable device that captures  
motion -based activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal .  Data from the Empatica E4 
Wristband will not be presented in the study report; instead, they will be part of a separate report.   
In Part C, t he Empatica E4 Wristband will be worn at all times (except while bathing) during the 
three 5 -day intervals  outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Table 4) .  The Empatica E4 Wristband

The QUEST is a brief, 30 -item, ET -specific QOL scale in which subjects rate the extent to which 
tremor i mpacts a function or state, tremor severity in various body parts, perceived health, and 
overall QOL (Tröster 2005) .  A copy of the QUEST is provided in Appendix 4.   
11.5. Video Recording  
Videos of subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, 
and one additional task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis) will be taken .

Amendment #4, Version 5.[ADDRESS_6062]-
dosing sampling times are relative to this time.  Sample s are to be collected within ±[ADDRESS_6063] the plasma 
samples processed, stored, and transported as directed for bioanalysis.   
An additional PK sample may be collected at any time if clinically indicated and at the discretion 
of the Investigator (eg, for unusual or severe adverse events).   
Each sample will be marked with unique identifiers such as the study number, subject number, 
and the nominal sample time.  The date and actual time that the blood sample was taken will be 
recorded on the CRF or electronically with a bar code or other method.   
12.2. Storage and Shipment of P harmacokinetic Samples  
The plasma samples should be kept frozen at approximately -70°C to -80°C until analyzed.  At 
sites where a -70°C to -80°C freezer is not available, plasma samples may be stored at -15°C 
to -30°C prior to being transported for bioanal ysis.  They should be packed as directed to avoid 
breakage during transit and with sufficient dry ice to prevent thawing for at least [ADDRESS_6064] the plasma samples transported as directed for bioanalysis as detailed in the PK instructions.

laboratory measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage, C- SSRS, and 
adverse event reporting.  The Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale and a DEQ-5 will be used to 
assess mood and perception of drug effects, respectively.   
13.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Age, gender, race, and ethnic origin will be recorded at the Screening visit.  A full medical 
history including medication history will be recorded at the Screening visit.   
13.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature , and supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_7116] l east 
5 minutes prior to the measurement) and standing (for at least 2 to 3 minutes) systolic and

Screening visit.   
13.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes prior to the measurement ) 12-lead ECG will be performed 
at the times specified below and the standard intervals recorded as well as any abnormalities.  All 
ECG results will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7193], Abnormal; not clinically significant (NCS), or Abnormal; clinically significant (CS).  
All time points are relative to the time of dosing.  ECGs will be performed within ±[ADDRESS_6065] results outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7194], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant 
(CS).  Screening results considered abnormal, CS recorded at the Screening visit may make the 
subject ineligible for the study pending review by [CONTACT_7195].  Clinical laboratory 
results that are abnormal, CS during the study but within normal range at baseline and/or indicate 
a worsening from baseline will be considered adverse events, assessed according to Section  13.2.1, and recorded in the eCRF.

 54  [IP_ADDRESS]. Genetic Testing  
Where consent is given, an optional genetic sample for biomarker testing will be collected at the 
Screening visit.   
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variat ion may influence response 
(ie, distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE-217.  Spe cific genetic variations of 
interest include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 supra-family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of 
SAGE -217 (eg, AKR1C4 [3α-hydroxysteroid dehyd rogenase]), genes associated with the 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (eg, GABRA1- A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, 
GABRG1 -3), and genes associated with the production and degradation of GABA.   
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to SAGE -217 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be 
evaluated.  Thus, the genetic research m ay involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene 
categories, but only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action.   
13.1.7. Columbi a-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) 
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011).  This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subj ect with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit.  The C-SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for sev erity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_6067] severe).   
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the subject is showing any suicidal tendency, no further 
study drug will be administered and the subject will be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation.  This information will be tracked.   
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening  (lifetime history and past 
24 months) and the “Since Last Visit” version should be used on all subsequent time points.  The 
C-SSRS is provided in Appendix 5.   
13.1.8. Bond- Lader VAS Mood Scale 
Mood will be assessed using the Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale (Bond 1974) .  This is a 16- part 
self-administered questionnaire that employs  a 100-mm VAS to explore different aspects of self -
reported mood.  The Bond-Lader Mood Rating Scale is provided in Appendix 6.   13.1.9. Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ -5) 
A DEQ-5 ( Morean 2013 ) will be administered as follows: 
1. Do you FEEL a drug effect right now? 
2. Are you HIGH right now? 
3. Do you DISLIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now? 
4. Do you LIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now?

Amendment #4, Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 55  5. Would you like MORE of the drug you took, right now? 
The an swers are recorded on a 100- mm VAS , with the answer for each being “Not at all” and 
“Extremely” at the extremes.  There will be options to record “Not applicable” for 
questions 3 and 4 if no drug effects are felt and for question 5 prior to administration of study medication.   The DEQ -5 is provided in Appendix 7. 
13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected after the ICF has been signed.  Medical conditions that occur after the ICF has been signed will be captured on the adverse event eCRF. 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system (version 18.1 or higher ).  
13.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally  related to the product.  In clinical studies, an adverse event  
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event .  Suspec ted adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event o ccurring during any study phase and at any  dose of 
the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• It results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All serious adverse event s that occur after any subject has been enrolled, whether or not they are 
related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_7197] 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #4, Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 56  the duration of the study (from the signing of the ICF through the D ay 28 visit [or early 
termination]) . 
13.2.2. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring during this study will be reported within [ADDRESS_6068]’s spouse/partner (if the subject is male and his spouse/partner becomes pregnant) or the obstetrician for information about the outcome of the pregnancy, and in the case of a live birth, 
about any congenital abnormalities.  If a congenital abnormality is reported, then it should be 
recorded in the source documents and reported a s a serious adverse event .   
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each adverse event (unrelated, possibly related or probably related).  
The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “unrelated.”  If 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event , then the 
adverse event should be considered “related.”    
Not 
Related:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the  subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probably 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  
clinical state or other modes  of therapy  administered  to the  subjec t. 
If the relationship between the adverse event /serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered to be related 
to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited re gulatory reporting.   
13.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7200].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as adverse event s unless they prompt corrective medical action by [CONTACT_3786], constitute a serious adverse event  or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
study drug.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #4, Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 57  Information about adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF through the 
Day 28 visit (or early termination).  Adverse events that occur after the first administration of 
study drug will be denoted TEAEs.   
All adverse events will be followed until they are resolved or have reached a clinical plateau with 
no expectation of future change.   
The adverse event term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For 
each adverse event , the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution 
or clinical plateau (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and whether or not 
it caused the subject to discontinue the study .   
Intensity will be assessed according to  the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
13.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Eve nts 
All serious adverse event s (regardless of causality) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF 
until the Day  28 visit ([ADDRESS_6069] dose of study drug) or early termination.  Any 
serious adverse event s considered possibly or probably related to the investigational product and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  All serious adverse 
event s must be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee immediately by [CONTACT_7202] [ADDRESS_6070] complete, sign 
and date the serious adverse event pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the 
serious adverse event pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee.    
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be sent to Sage Therapeutics or designee within 24 hours of receipt; a follow-up serious adverse event  form should be 
completed and placed with the origi nal serious adverse event  information and kept with the 
appropriate section of the study file.   
Sage Therapeutics or designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events.  It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all serious 
adverse event s that occur at his or her site if applicable per the IRB’s requirements.  Investigators 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during t he clinical study.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB of these 
additional serious adverse event s.

14.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data.  All subjects will be used in the analyses, as per the analysis populations, using all non- missing d ata available.  No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data.  No sensitivity analysis of missing data will be performed.   
14.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristic s, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized.   
Categorical summaries, such as race and ethnicity, will be summarized by [CONTACT_7203].  Continuous summaries, such as age, height, weight, BMI, and baseline vital signs, 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

Title of Study : A Phase 2a, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 in the Treatment of 
Subjects with Essential Tremor (ET)  
Study center(s):  Up to 25  centers  
Phase o f development: 2a 
Methodology:  
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of SAGE -217.  
Subjects who consent prior to the approval  of Protocol Amendment #3 by [CONTACT_7217].  Subjects who consent after Amendment #3 is 
approved by [CONTACT_7156]. 
There are two parts:  
Part A : Open -label with morning dosing (7 days). 
All subjects will start o n a 10-mg dose of study drug administered with food on Day 1.  Subjects will 
receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 and 30 mg with food daily on Days 3 to 7.   
Part B : Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal with morning dosing (7 days). 
In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a dose of at least [ADDRESS_6087] responded to SAGE-217, defined as a 30% reduction from 
baseline in the TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) kineti c tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4 c scores from both sides of the body) predose on Day 8. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to SAGE -217 or placebo and will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part  A in the morning wi th food.  Subjects randomized to the 
placebo arm will represent randomized withdrawal (withdrawal from treatment they received in 
Part A). 
Protocol 217- ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 6  Methodology:  
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open-label phase of the study (Part A).  If at any 
time the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7185], the dose on the next day will be reduced to the next lowest 
dose and continued for the remainder of the open- label dosing period (ie, subjects who are unable to 
tolerate the 30 -mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who are unable to tolerate 
20 mg will be given a 10 -mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6088].  Subjects who require dose 
adjustments on Days 5, 6, or  7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
Subjects will be exposed to study drug (SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6089] dose.   
Assessments will be performed periodically during the study as outlined in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 2).   
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• The p rimary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Capsules to placebo on the change in tremor severity , as measured by [CONTACT_7218] (Day 8) in the accelerometer- based Kinesia™ kinetic tremor combi ned score 
(ie, the sum of Kinesia kinetic tremor scores from both sides of the body ) at Day 14 .   
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE -217 Capsules to placebo on the following endpoints: 
• Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the Kinesia upper limb total score (ie, the sum of accelerometer- based Kinesia forward outstretched postural tremor, 
lateral "wing beating" postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores from  both sides of the 
body) and individual item scores at Day 14.   
• Tremor severity, as measured by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the TETRAS upper 
limb total score (ie, the sum of TETRAS Performance Subscale item 4 scores [4a, 4b , and 4c] 
from both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS Performance Subscale upper limb item 
scores at Day 14.   
• Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in other TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores measured at Day 14.   
• Safety and  tolerability, as assessed by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and suicidal ideation using the Columbia- Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS), and adverse event reporting.   
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008],  as assessed b y the St anford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS).  
• Mood, as assessed by [CONTACT_7219]- Lader visual analogue scale (VAS) Mood Scale scores.   
• How the subject feels after taking the study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_7220] (DEQ-5) ratings.   
The above endpoints m ay also be assessed for SAGE -[ADDRESS_6090] 
time point (AUC 0-t), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞),

Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 7  maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to reach maximum concentration (t max), and terminal 
half- life (t 1/2), will be derived, where appropri ate. 
Exploratory: 
The exploratory objectives  of the study are to compare the effect of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Capsules to placebo on:  
• Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin tempera ture monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ), as assessed by [CONTACT_7221] E4.  Tremor oscillation, as assessed by [CONTACT_7163]- dimensional accelerometer 
measurements (ie, raw accelerometer values) using the Empatica Wristband E4 . 
• Quality of life (QOL), a s assessed by [CONTACT_7164] (ADL), Quality of Life in 
Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST), and video recording assessment of subjects 
performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, and one additional 
task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis).   
In addition, PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling assessment of the relationship between plasma 
exposure of SAGE-217 and change from baseline in Kinesia scores may be assessed . 
The above endpoints may also be assessed for SAGE -217 Oral Solution if sufficient data are  
available.

capsule excipi[INVESTIGATOR_7108].  Subjects randomized to placebo treatment will be administered 
2 placebo capsules per day.   
Duration of treatment:  
Screening Duration: up to  28 days; Treatment Period: 14 days; Follow-up: [ADDRESS_6107]: up to  56 days  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Tremor severity will be measured by [CONTACT_6317] -based Kinesia  and clinician -rated TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores.  Quality -of-life will be evaluated using the TETRAS ADL, QUEST, 
and v ideo recording of subjects performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, 
sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, 
and heart rate monitoring ) and tremor oscillation will be assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma will be collected to assay for concentrations of SAGE -217 and may be assayed for  SAGE -217 
metabolites, if deemed necessary.  The following PK parameters will be derived from the plasma 
concentrations (where evaluable): AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, C max, tmax, and t ½.   
Safety  and Tolerability : 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory 
measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage,  C-SSRS, SSS , and adverse 
event reporting.  The Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale and a DEQ-5 will be used to assess mood and 
perception of drug effects, respectively .

Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 10  Statistical methods:  
Study Populations 
The safety population is defined as all subjects who are administered study drug.   
The efficacy population will consist of all subjects in the safety population who complete at least one 
dose in Part B and have at least one post-randomization efficacy evaluation.   
The evaluable population will consist of all randomized subjects with at least one post -randomization 
Kinesia assessment.   
The PK population will consist of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma 
concentrations for PK evaluations.   
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data (includin g change from randomization values for accelerometer -derived Kinesia and 
clinician -rated TETRAS scores) will be summarized using appropriate descriptive sta tistics and listed 
by [CONTACT_1130]. 
The change from randomization (Day 8) in the Kinesia kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum of 
Kinesia kinetic tremor scores from both sides of the body) at Day [ADDRESS_6108].  Wherever necessary and appropriate, PK parameters will be dose-adjusted to account for 
individual differences in dose.  
Safety A nalysis  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities™.  The overall 
incidence of adverse events will be displayed by [CONTACT_1196], preferred term, and dose group.  
Incidence of adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_7223].  Data from vital signs, clinical laboratory measures, ECG, and C -SSRS will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_7169], where applicable.  Continuous endpoints will be 
summarized with n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  In addition, change 
from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and will be summarized using the same 
summary statistics.  Out -of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where 
applicable.  For all categorical endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.   
Sample Size  
Up to [ADDRESS_6109] 40 randomized subjects for Part B.  A 
total sample size of 34 evaluable subjects (ie, 17 per group) will have 80% power to detect a 
difference in means of 3.[ADDRESS_6110] with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.  Assuming a 15% non- evaluability 
rate, 20 subjects per group will be randomized.  The number of subjects in each treatment group is 
also thought to be sufficient to assess preliminary safety and tolerability following multiple doses of 
SAGE -217.

 24  5. INTRODUCTI ON 
5.1. Background of Essential Tremor and Unmet Medical Need  
Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common neurological diseases, with an overall 
prevalence of 0.9%.  Prevalence increases with age and is estimated to be 4.6% in people over 
65 years of age (Louis 2010, Deuschl 2011).  Essential tremor is largely a bilateral, symmetrical 
postural or kinetic tremor involving hands and forearms that is visible and persistent.  Additional 
or isolated tremor of the head or lower limbs may occur, but in the absence of abnormal 
posturing (Deuschl 1998, Habib -ur-Rehman 2000).  The onset of tremor has a bimodal 
distribution, with onset between [ADDRESS_6123] pla ys a key role in ET ( McAuley 2000, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]  2003, 
Elble  2009, Schnitzler 2009, Deuschl 2009) .  Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the 
ventral intermediate nucleus and of the subthalamic nucleus improve ET ( Deuschl 2011, 
Zappia 2013, Rajput 2014) .  Micr oscopic cerebellar pathology has been identified, including 
gliosis, Purkinje cell loss, and increased torpedoes (swellings) in the Purkinje cell axons 
(Louis 2007, Axelrad 2008, Shill 2008, Louis 2009).  Activation studies with positron emission 
tomography indicate abnormally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the cerebellum both at rest and when tremor is provoked by [CONTACT_7224] ( Boecker  1994, Wills  1996).   
Essential tremor is associated with impaired γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)ergic function (and 
consequent hyperactivity) in the cerebellum ( Málly 1996 , Bucher 1997, Louis 2007, Louis 2008, 
Paris -Robidas 2012).  γ-aminobutyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system (CNS), is released from GABAergic neurons and binds to several types of 
GABA receptors ( γ-aminobutyric acid -ligand gated chloride channel [ GABA
A] and 
γ-aminobutyric acid-G protein-coupled [ GABA B]) on target neurons.  γ- aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel r eceptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, 
are macromolecular proteins that form a chloride ion channel complex and contain specific 
binding sites for GABA and a number of allosteric regulators, including barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.   
Drugs acting on GABA
A receptors, such as primidone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], or ethanol decrease 
tremor amplitude , suggesting that altered GABAergic neurotransmission is involved in ET.  
Postmortem analysis revealed a 35% reduction of GABA A receptors and a 22% to 31% reduction 
of GABA B receptors in the dentate nucleus of cerebella of ET subjects ( Paris -Robidas 2012).  
Reduced levels of G ABA in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_7112] 
(Málly  1996 ).  Moreover, toxins such as aflatrem, penitrem A , or harmaline have been proposed 
to induce tremor in rodents by [CONTACT_7173] ( Cavanagh 1998 , Miwa 2007), 
and targeted deletion of the α1 subunit of GABA A receptor in knockout mice exhibits a 
15 to  19 Hz action tremor, similar to ET in humans ( Kralic 2005).    
Consistent with the role of GABA , the majority of therapeutics for ET act by [CONTACT_7225] ( Louis 2012, Benito-Leon 2007, Pahapi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 1999).  First-line treatments 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 25  for ET include the anticonvulsant primidone and the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol 
(Gorman  1986).  Like primidone, gabapentin is an anticonvulsant found to be effective in the 
treatment of ET (O’Brien 1981, Gironell 1999).   The oldest treatment for ET is ethanol, which 
temporarily amelio rates tremor  and is freq uently used by [CONTACT_7175]- medicate; however, 
chronic use of ethanol for tremor management carries the known risks of alcohol dependence and 
overuse ( Pahwa 2003).    
These treatments are moderately effective, reducing, though no t resolving, tremor amplitudes in  
about 50% of the subjects ( Schmouth 2014).  In addition, one out of three patients  abandon 
treatment because of side  effects or poor efficacy ( Louis 2010) , illustrating that with few feasible  
treatment options and a range of handicaps in daily living makes ET an area of high unmet 
medical need.    
5.2. SAGE -217  
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA A receptor and thus is expected to be 
of benefit for the treatment of ET.  Unlike benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_7135] e for the γ-subunit-
containing subset of GABA A receptors ( Pritchett 1989 , Esmaeili 2009 ), SAGE -[ADDRESS_6124] a wider range of activity (Belelli 2002).  
Two dosage forms of SAGE-217 for oral administration will be used in this study (SAGE -217 
Oral Solution and SAGE-217 Capsules). 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution 6 mg/mL (40% w/w aqueous h ydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin [ HPβCD] 
with 0.025 mg/mL sucralose) is a nonviscous, clear solution.   
SAGE -[ADDRESS_6125] gelatin capsules containing a white to off -white 
powder. In addition to SAGE-217 Drug Substance, the active, SAGE-217 capsules contain 
croscarmellose sodium, mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium stearyl 
fumarate as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . 
5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Experience with SAGE -217 
5.3.1. Nonclinical Studies with SAGE -217 
In nonclinical studies of SAGE-217, sedative- hypnotic effects were consistently observed at 
higher doses in both in vivo pharmacology studies as well as in toxicology studies.  The 
sedative- hypnotic impairments seen with SAGE -217 were typi[INVESTIGATOR_7114] A positive 
modulators, ranging from hyperexcitability and ataxia at the lower doses through deep sedation 
and ultimately anesthesia at higher doses.  Depth and duration of sedation demonstrated a clear 
dose response over the range tested, with evidence of tolerance occurring with continued 
exposure.  Tolerance to the effects of SAGE -217 on motor incoordination was  not observed after 
7 days of dosing.   
The compound has been assessed in 14-day rat and dog toxicology studies with daily 
administration of SAGE -217 as a solution in HPβCD in dogs and Labrasol® in rats.  The no 
observed adverse effect level was 3 mg/kg (females) and 22. 5 mg/kg (males) in rats a nd 
2.5 mg/kg in dogs.  There were no adverse effects in dogs or rats in the main toxicology studies.  A single observation of mortality occurred in one female rat at the high dose in a toxicokinetic 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6126] been related to exagger ated pharmacology.  Additional 
toxicology and pharmacology information is provided in the  Investigat or’s Brochure .   
5.3.2. Clinical Experience 
To date, two clinical studies employing SAGE -217 Oral Solution are clinically complete  and 
final clinical study reports  are pending .  Discussions of pharmacokinetic (PK) data are limited to 
the single -ascending dose, food, and essential tremor cohorts from Study 217- CLP-101 and the 
multiple -ascending dose and drug-drug interaction (DDI) cohorts from Study 217- CLP-102.  
Discussions of safety data are limited to the single -ascending dose cohorts in Study 217- CLP-
101 and the multiple -ascending dose cohorts in Study 217- CLP-102.  In addition, one clinical 
study of the safety, tolerability, PK, and relative bioavailability SAGE -217 Capsules is clinically 
complete and the final study report is pending.  The results of this study (217- CLP-103) are 
briefly described below. 
Study 217- CLP-[ADDRESS_6127] -in-human, four- part study that assessed the effects of a single 
dose of SAGE-217 Oral Solution .  The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-
ascending dose design in healthy adult volunteers, with the objective of identifying the maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) and PK profiles of SAGE-217 Oral Solution.  Subjects in each of the 
single -ascending dose cohorts received a single dose of study drug, either SAGE -217 Oral 
Solution (six subjects) or placebo (two subjects), with SAGE-217 Oral Solution doses of 0.25 mg , 0.75 mg, 2 mg, 5.5 mg, 11 mg, 22 mg, 44 mg, 55 mg, and 66 mg.  Escalation to the 
next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7176] ( SRC) and agreement reached that it was safe to increase the dose.  The MTD was 
determined to be 55 mg.  Two cohorts, 6 subjects each received SAGE -217 Oral Solution in an 
open-label manner (one cohort received 50% of the MTD [22 mg] to study the food effects and 
the other cohort received the MTD [55 mg] to study the effects on subjects with essential 
tremor ).  SAGE -[ADDRESS_6128] ( 0.25 mg ) through the highest (66 mg ) dose , and supported once daily oral dosing 
with food.   
Study 217- CLP-102 was a two- part study that assessed the effects of multiple -ascending doses of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution .  The study was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -ascending 
dose study in healthy adult volunteers.  Subjects in each of the multiple-ascending dose cohorts 
received study drug, either SAGE -217 Oral Solution  (nine subjects) or placebo (three subjects), 
once daily for 7 days, with SAGE-217 Oral Solution  doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 35 mg.  
Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7226] e the dose.  The MTD was determined to 
be 30 mg.  It was observed that subjects receiving the drug in the evening  did better in terms of 
tolerability compared to when they received the drug in the morning.  A fourth cohort of 12 subjects received 30 mg of SAGE -217 Oral Solution in an open- label manner to study drug -drug 
interactions.  SAGE -217 Oral Solution is not likely to induce the metabolism of CYP2B6 or 
CYP3A4 substrates.  SAGE -217 Oral Solution was orally bioavailable and suitable for once 
daily oral dosing at night time with food.   
SAGE -217 Oral Solution was generally well tolerated.  In both Phase 1 studies (217- CLP-101 
and 217- CLP-102), doses were escalated until the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7115].  Most adverse 
events were reported as mild or moderate in intensity, and there were no serious adverse events 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6129] dose group (66 mg).  Some cha nges in 
mean blood pressure and heart rate were observed after single doses of 44 mg and greater.  After 
multiple doses of 30 mg (AM or PM) or 35 mg (PM) over [ADDRESS_6130] single dose in the single -ascending dose study.  Subjects seemed to tolerate 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution better when given as night time dosing.   
The safety, tolerability, PK , and relative bioavailability of the SAG E-217 Capsules were 
assessed in a Phase 1 randomized, open- label, cross -over study (Study 217- CLP-103). In the 
fasted state, SAGE -217 Capsules demonstrated reduced exposure in terms of maximum (peak) 
plasma concentration  (C max) and area under the curve from zero to the time of the last 
quantifiable concentration ( AUC last) compared to SAGE-217 Oral Solution.  SAGE -217 Capsules 
administered in the fed state (with standard and high- fat meal) showed increased exposure 
compared to the fasted state and approximately equivalent exposure in terms of geometric mean 
AUC last compared to SAGE-217 Oral Solution; however, the C max for SAGE -217 Capsules was 
reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50% when compared with SAGE-[ADDRESS_6131].  Thus, the potential benefits in this population are unknown, although the risks are 
likely to be similar to those mentioned in the  Investigator’s Brochure .  Many compounds that 
target the GABA A receptors exhibit clinical efficacy in ET, validating this receptor as a 
therapeutic target.  Given the promising SAGE-[ADDRESS_6132] vs tolerability (adverse events), 
specifically sedation.  Each subject will start with an initial dose  of [ADDRESS_6133] the 10 -mg dose for a 
minimum of 3 days will qualify for the randomization phase (Part B).  Given the high medical 
need and potential for benefit in ET, there is a favorable benefit- risk evaluation to in vestigate

 28  observed was sedation that was mild, transient, and occurred within 1 to 4 hours and generally 
dissipated by 8 hours.  The clinical portion of this study has recently completed; the final report 
is in progress. 
In conclusion, selection criteria for the proposed study take into account the potential saf ety 
risks.  Continuous safety monitoring, and the implementation of a formal dose-reduction and 
study drug discontinuation scheme also have the potential to mitigate risk.  From a benefit/risk 
perspective, the appropriate measures are being taken in order to ensure the safety of the subjects 
who will be enrolled.

 31  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is a two-part, multicenter, Phase 2a study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and PK of SAGE -217 in approximately  60 adult subjects with ET.  Subjects who consent prior to 
the approval of Protocol Amendment #3 by [CONTACT_7231].  Subjects who consent after Amendment #3 is approved by [CONTACT_7156]. 
Part A of the study is an open-label design with morning dosing for 7 days.  Part B of the study is 
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design.  Subjects will be exposed to 
study drug (SA GE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6139] dose.   
During the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), after signing the informed consent form (ICF), 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and the severity of each subject’s ET will be 
evaluated using TETRAS.   Eligible subjects will return  to the clinical study unit on Day -1.   
The study will be conducted in two parts: 
• Part A:  Beginning on Day 1, a ll subjects will receive open -label SAGE -217 in the 
morning with food (as outlined in Section  9.2) for 7 days.  Subjects will receive 
SAGE -217 10 mg on Day 1, SAGE-217 20 mg on Day 2, and SAGE-217 30 mg from 
Day 3 to Day 7 , with dose adjustments for severe adverse events judged by [CONTACT_7181] ( Section  9.3). 
• Part B:  In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a dose of 
≥[ADDRESS_6140] responded to SAGE-217, defined as 
a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor (item 4c) combined score 
predose on Day 8.  E ligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_6141] dose and continued for the remainder of the open -label dosing period (ie, subjects 
who are unable to tolerate SAGE -217 30 mg will receive SAGE -217 20 mg and subje cts who are 
unable to tolerate SAGE -217 20 mg will receive SAGE -217 10 mg).  The dose tolerated on 
Days  5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6142].  Subjects who 
require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, or 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
7.2. Blinding and Randomization  
Part A is open- label with no control group; therefore , there will be no randomization or blinding.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 32  Part B of the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design .  
Subjects who to lerate a dose of ≥10 mg of SAGE-217 in Part A and respond to SAGE-217, 
defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score predose on 
Day 8, will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_6143] may reveal actual 
study drug contents to the investigator, who should also alert Sage of the emergency (see 
Section  13.6 for more details related to unblinding).  In all cases where the study drug allocation 
for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for unblinding) must be 
documented in the subject’s records and on the electronic case report fo rm (eCRF) .  If the 
subject or study center personnel (other than pharmacist) have been unblinded, the subject will 
be terminated from the study.   
Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive their maximum dose as determined in Part A  in 
the morning with food.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent randomized 
withdrawal (withdrawal from treatment they received in Part A).

Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6171] symptom response by a measurement of 
Kinesia , TETRAS upper limb items , and TETRAS Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8).  
Quality -of-life assessmen ts include TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording of subjects 
performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as 
measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring) and 
tremor oscillation as assessed by [CONTACT_7192] (ie, raw 
accelerometer values) will be assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
11.1. Kinesia  
In order to measure tremor amplitude, subjects will wear a wireless ring motion sensor (Kinesia, Great Lakes Neuro Technologies).  The motion sensor uses three orthogonal 
accelerometers and three orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three- dimensional motion.  Data are 
then transmitted from the sensor to a computer using Bluetooth technology.  These measures of three-dimensional motion for each maneuver are then converted to Kinesia scores, which have 
been shown to correlate with corresponding clinician- rated TETRAS scores (Giovanni 2010).  
Each Kinesia score ranges from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate more severe tremor.   The Kinesia  
assessment is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 assessment . 
In Part A, Kinesi a will be performed on Day - 1 (three assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
30 minutes) ; a single assessment will be performed  predose and 2 and 8 hours (±30  minutes)
 
postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7.  In Part  B, a single Kinesia reading will be performed pre dose 
and 2 and 8 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14, and anytime  during the visit on 
Day 21. 
11.2. TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) 
Performance Scale  
Item #4 (upper limb tremor) of the TETRAS Performance Subscale will be completed using both the Kinesia device and clinician assessment.  Testing should be completed within ±10 minutes of the planned questionnaire time points.  All three maneuvers  in the upper limb assessments 
(items  4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the RIGHT arm and then for the 
LEFT.  Predose assessments can be done any time within 2 hours prior to the start of administration of study drug .  The Day 21 follow-up visit assessments can be done at any time 
during the visit. 
In Part A, the TETRAS upper limb items  will be performed at screening  and on Day - 1 (three 
assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 m inutes) ; a single assessment of TETRAS upper limb items  
will be performed predose and 2 and 8 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7.  In 
addition, the TETRAS upper limb items  will be performed , while wearing the Empatica 
Wristband E4, on Day -1 and 3 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7. 
The TETRAS ADL  Subscale and Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8) will be performed 
on Day -1 and predose (±30  minutes) on Day 7.  On days when the TETRAS ADL and 
Performance Subscale are performed, Item # 4 will not be repeated.

 43  In Part B, the TETRAS upper limb items  will be performed  predose and 2 and 8 hours 
(±30  minutes) postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14, and anytime  during the visit on Day 21.  In 
addition, the TETRAS upper limb items will be performed , while wearing the Empatica 
Wristband E4, 3 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14, and anytime during the visit 
on Day 21.  The TETRAS ADL  Subscale and Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8) will be 
performed predose (±30  minutes) on Day 14 and anytime  during the visit on Day 21.  On days 
when the TETRAS ADL Subscale and Performance Subscale are performed, Item # [ADDRESS_6172] be ≥2 on each side (left and right) for kinetic tremor and ≥2 on 
each side (left and right) for either wing beating or forward outstretched postural tremor.  A copy 
of the TETRAS is provided in Appendix 3.   
11.3. Empatica Wristband E4 
Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) will be  assessed by [CONTACT_7229] E 4.  The Empatica Wristband E4  is a wearable device that captures  
motion -based activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal .  In Part A,  the Empatica 
Wristband E4 will be worn during the study visits while in clinic on  Days -1, 1, 2, 3, and 7.  In 
Part B, the Empa tica Wristband  E4 will be worn during the study visits while in clinic on Days 8, 
9, 14, and anytime during the visit on Day 21.  With the exception of during the TETRAS upper 
limb assessments, the Empatica Wristband E4 will be worn on the wrist that, of the two arms, 
exhibits more severe tremor symptoms.  During the TETRAS upper limb assessments (Part A:  
Day -1 and 3 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 1, 2, 3 and 7; Part B:  3 hours (±30  minutes)  
postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14 and 21), the Empatica Wristband E4 will be worn on the wrist corresponding to the side of the body being assessed .  Data from the Empatica Wristband E4 will 
not be presented in the study report; instead, they will be part of a separate report.   
11.4. Quality of Life in Essentia l Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST)  
The QUEST is a brief, 30 -item, ET -specific QOL scale in which subjects rate the extent to which 
tremor impacts a function or state, tremor severity in various body parts, perceived health, and overall QOL (Tröster 2005).  The  QUEST w ill be administered on Day -1, Day  7, and on 
Day 14.  A copy of the QUEST is provided in Appendix 4.

 46  13.1.6. Laboratory Assessments 
In Part A, blood and urine samples will be collected for hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis at the Screening visit, on Day -1, predose on Day 1, and predose on Day 2.  In Part  B, 
blood and urine samples will be collected predose on Day 8 and Day 9 and anytime  during the 
visit on Day 21.   
Serum and urine samples for pregnancy tests (females only) will also be collected.  These 
assessments should be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Events ( Table 2 and 
Table 3) and as outlined individually below.   
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7194], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS).  Screening results considered abnormal, CS recorded at the Screening visit may make the 
subject ineligible for the study pending review by [CONTACT_7195].  Clinical laboratory results that are abnormal, CS during the study but within normal range at baseline and/or indicate a worsening from baseline will be considered adverse events, assessed according to Section  13.2.1, and recorded in the e CRF.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology 
Hematology tests will include complete blood count, including red blood cells, white blood cells with differentiation, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and platelets.  The coagulation panel 
will include activated partial thromboplastin tim e, prothrombin time , and international 
normalized ratio .   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blood Chemistry  
Serum chemistry tests will include serum electrolytes, renal function tests, including creatinine, 
blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide, liver function tests, including total bilirubin, AST, and ALT , total protein, and albumin.   
Thyroid -stimulating hormone, thyroxine ( T4), and triiodothyronine ( T3) will be performed at 
screening to confirm subject eligibility.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, glucose, ketones, bile, urobilinogen, hemoglobin, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, color, turbidity, pH, and specific gravity.

 47  [IP_ADDRESS]. Virus Serology  
Subjects will be screened for hepatitis (HBsAg and anti -HCV) an d HIV prior to being enrolled in 
the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_7233] -1, predose on Day 8, and at the follow -up 
visit on Day 28 in Part B.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Biochemistry 
Optional blood samples will be collected at screening and on Days [ADDRESS_6177] other 
biochemical markers as candidates for influencing not only response to SAGE-217 but also 
susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be evaluated.  Thus, the biochemical 
research m ay involve study of additional unnamed biochemical biomarkers, but only as related to 
disease susceptibility and drug action.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Genetic Testing  
Where consent is given, an optional genetic sample for biomarker testing will be collected at the Screening visit.   
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA ext raction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variat ion may influence response 
(ie, distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE-217.  Specific genetic variations of 
interest include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 supra-family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of SAGE -217 (eg, AKR1C4 [3α- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]), genes associated with the 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (eg, GABR A1-A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, 
GABRG1 -3), and genes associated with the production and degradation of GABA.   
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to SAGE -217 but also susceptibility to  disorders for which SAGE -217 may be 
evaluated.  Thus, the genetic research m ay involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene 
categories, but only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action.   
13.1.7. Columbi a-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) 
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011).  This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit.  The C-SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_6178] severe).   
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the subject is showing any suicidal tendency, no further 
study drug will be administered and the subject will be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation.  This information will be tracked.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 48  The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening  (lifetime history and past 
24 months).  In Part A, t he “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed on Day -1, 
8 hours postdose (± 1 hour) on Day 1, predose on Day 4, and on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, the 
“Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed 8 hours (± 1 hour) postdose on Days 8, 11, 
12, 13, and 14, and anytime during the visits on Days [ADDRESS_6179] Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS) 
The SSS is subject -rated scale designed to quickly assess how alert a subject is feeling  
(Hoddes 1972).  Degrees of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7138] a scale of [ADDRESS_6180] score of ‘1’ indicates the subject is ‘feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake’ and the 
highest score of ‘7’ indicates the subject is ‘no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream -like thoughts’.   
In Part A, the SS S will be administered predose a nd at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, an d 8 hours postdose on 
Days  1, 2, 3, and 4, and predose only on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, t he SSS will be 
administered predose and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose on Days 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, 
and anytime  during the visit on Day 21.  All time points are relative to the time of dosing.  The 
SSS is to be performed within ±10 minutes of the scheduled times.  The SSS is provided in Appendix 6.  
13.1.9. Bond- Lader VAS Mood Scale 
Mood will be assessed using the Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale ( Bond 1974).  This is a 16- part 
self-administered questionnaire that employs a 100-mm VAS to explore different aspects of self -
reported mood.  In Part A, the mood scale will be administered predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes)  postdos e on Days 1, 2, and 7.  In Part B, the mood scale will be administered 
predose and 2 hours (± 10 minutes)  postdose on Days 8, 9, 14, and anytime  during the visit on 
Day 21.  The Bond-Lader Mood Rating Scale is provided in Appendix 7.   
13.1.10. Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ -5) 
A DEQ-5 ( Morean 2013 ) will be administered as follows: 
1. Do you FEEL a drug effect right now? 
2. Are you HIGH right now? 
3. Do you DISLIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now? 
4. Do you LIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now? 
5. Would you like MORE of the drug you took, right now? 
The answers are recorded on a 100- mm VAS , with the answer for each being “Not at all” and 
“Extremely” at the extremes.  There will be options to record “Not  applicable” for 
questions 3 and 4 if no drug effects are felt and for question 5 prior to administration of study medication.   The DEQ -5 will be performed 2 hours (±10  minutes) postdose on Days 1 and 7 in 
Part A and 2  hours (±10  minutes) postdose on Days 8 and 14 in Part B.  The DEQ-5 is provided 
in Appendix 8.

 49  13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected after the ICF has been signed.  Medical conditions that occur 
after the ICF has been s igned will be captured on the adverse event eCRF. 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system (version 18.1 or higher ).  
13.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An adverse event is the devel opment of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally  related to the product.  In clinical studies, an adverse event 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a r easonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event .  Suspect ed adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event o ccurring during any study phase and at any dose of 
the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• It results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All serious adverse events that occur after any subject has been enrolled, whether or not they are 
related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_7234] (from the signing of the ICF through the Day 28 visit [or early 
termination]) . 
13.2.2. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring during this study will be reported within 24 hours of notification of the Investigator.  The Investigator will promptly notify the Medical Monitor and withdraw the 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6181]’s spouse/partner (if the subject is male and his spouse/partner becomes pregnant) or the 
obstetrician for information about the outcome of the pregnancy, and in the case of a live birth, about any congenital abnormalities.  If a congenital abnormality is reported, then it should be recorded in the source documents and reported a s a serious adverse event .   
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the investigational product for each adverse event (unrelated, possibly related or probably related).  
The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “unrelated.”  If 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event , then the 
adverse event should be considered “related.”    
Not 
Related:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical state.  
Possibly 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the  subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probably 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  
clinical state or other modes  of therapy  administered  to the  subject . 
If the relationship between the adverse event /serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered to be related 
to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited reg ulatory reporting.   
13.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as adverse event s unless they prompt corrective medical action by [CONTACT_3786], constitute a serious adverse event  or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
study drug.   
Information about adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF through the 
Day 28 visit (or early termination).  Adverse events that occur after the first administration of 
study drug will be denoted TEAEs.   All adve rse events will be followed until they are resolved or have reached a clinical plateau with 
no expectation of future change.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6182] medical terminology when possible.  For 
each adverse event , the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution 
or clinical plateau (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and whether or not 
it caused the subject to discontinue the study .   
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
13.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse event s (regardless of causality) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF 
until the Day  28 visit ([ADDRESS_6183] dose of study drug) or early termination.  Any 
serious adverse event s considered possibly or probably related to the investigational product and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  All serious adverse 
event s must be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee immediately by [CONTACT_7202] [ADDRESS_6184] complete, sign 
and date the serious adverse event pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the 
serious adverse event pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy t o Sage 
Therapeutics or designee.    
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be sent to Sage Therapeutics 
or designee within 24 hours of receipt; a follow-up serious adverse event  form should be 
completed and placed with the original serious adverse event  information and kept with the 
appropriate section of the study file.   
Sage Therapeutics or designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events.  It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibi lity to notify the IRB of all serious 
adverse event s that occur at his or her site if applicable per the IRB’s requirements.  Investigators 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical study.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB of these 
additional serious adverse event s.   
13.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug (Part B)  
Part B is a double-blind study.  The pharmacist responsible for preparing the study drug will be  
unblinded and will retain an official paper copy of the randomization schedule. 
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received.  Unless a subject  is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_7236] a subject.  Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be disc ussed with the Sponsor.  If the unblinding occurs 
without the Sponsor’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible 
and no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature 
unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  Unless a subject is at immediate 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6185]’s records and on the eCRF.  If the subject or study center personnel (other than pharma cist) have been unblinded, the subject will be terminated from the study.

Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6186] of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma concentrations for PK evaluations.   
14.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data.  All subjects will be used in the an alyses, as 
per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available.  No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data.  No sensitivity analysis of missing data will be performed.   
14.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics, such as age, race, and ethnicity , and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized.   
Categorical summaries, such as race and ethnicity, will be summarized by [CONTACT_7237].  Continuous summaries, such as age, height, weight, BMI, and baseline vital signs, will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Hepatitis, HIV, d rug, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not summarized as they 
are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
Medical history will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].

The change from randomization (predose on Day 8) in the accelerometer -based Kinesia  kinetic 
tremor combined score (ie, the sum of Kinesia kinetic tremor scores  from both sides of the bod y) 
at Day 14  will be summarized by [CONTACT_7238] B . 
Change from randomization to each assessment in Kinesia kinetic tremor  combined score will be 
analyzed using a  mixed effects repeated measures model , including center, treatment, 
randomization Kinesia kinetic tremor combined score, assessment time point, and time point- by-
treatment.  All explanatory variables will be treated as  fixed effects.  
14.5. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The change from randomization (predose on Day 8) in the Kinesia  upper limb t otal and 
individual item scores, TETRAS upper limb total and individual upper limb item scores, and 
other TETRAS Performance Subscale scores at Day 14 will be summarized by [CONTACT_7239]  B. 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 54  A mixed effects repeated measures model  similar to those  described in Section  14.4 will be used 
for the analysis of change from randomization in the following:  Kinesia upper limb total score, 
Kinesia individual item scores, TETRAS upper limb total score, and TETRAS individual upper limb item scores.  
14.6. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The change from randomization (predose on Day 8) in TETRAS ADL scores at Day [ADDRESS_6187] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  Out-of- range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where 
applicable.  For all categorical endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.   
14.7.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding system (version 18.1 or higher).  The 
analysis of adverse event s will be based on the concept of TE AEs.  A TEAE is defined as an 
adverse event with onset after the start of open- label study drug , or any worsening of a pre-
existing medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of open- label study drug and 
until [ADDRESS_6188] dose.  The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized overall and by 
[CONTACT_7204] , preferred term , and dose group.  Incidences will be presented in 
order of decreasing frequency.  In addition, summaries will be  provided by [CONTACT_7205] (see  Section  13.3).    
TEAEs leading to discontinuation and serious adverse events (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for definition) 
with onset after the first dose of open- label study drug will also be summarized.  
All adverse events and serious adverse events (including those with onset or worsening before 
the signing of the ICF ) through the Day [ADDRESS_6189] and timing of collection.  Mean changes from 
randomization in vital signs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7206].

difference in means of 3.[ADDRESS_6195] with a 0.05 two- sided significance level.  Assuming a 15% non -
evaluability rate, 20 subjects per group will be randomized.  The number of subjects in each 
treatment group is also thought to be sufficient to assess preliminary safety and tolerability following multiple doses of SAGE-217. 
14.10.  Changes From Protocol Specified Analyses  
Any changes from the analytical methods outlined in the protocol will be documented in the final statistical analysis plan.  
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #3, Version 4.[ADDRESS_6196] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
15.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics or designee will visit the investigational study site to:   
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities ; and  
• Discus s with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or designee or its 
representatives.  This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between 
Sage Therapeutics and the Investigator.    
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or designee will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s); 
• Confirm that facilities r emain acceptable; 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRF s, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed ; 
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF s 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  (eg, clinic charts);  
• Record and rep ort any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics or 
designee; and  
• Confirm adverse event s and serious adverse event s have been properly documented 
on CRFs and confirm any serious adverse event s have been forwarded to Sage 
Therapeutics or  designee and those serious adverse event s that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.   
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. 
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized r epresentatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee ( IEC) or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source 
data verification.  The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics or designee audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the International Council on 
Harmonis ation  (ICH) , and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The Investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_7240] a regulatory agency about an  inspection.

Sage Therapeutics  
[ADDRESS_6206]:  
SAGE -217 Oral Solution 
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  
SAGE -217 
Title of Study: A Phase 2a, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 Oral Solution in the 
Treatment of Subjects with Essential Tremor (ET)  
Study center(s):  Up to 25 centers  
Phase of development: 2a 
Methodology:  
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK ) of SAGE -217 Oral 
Solution.   
There are two parts:  
Part A : Open -label with morning dosing (7 days). 
All subjects will start on a 10-mg dose of study drug administered with food on Day 1.  Subjects will 
receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 and 30 mg with food daily on Days 3 to 7.   
Part B : Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal with morning dosing (7 days). 
In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a dose of at least [ADDRESS_6207] respon ded to SAGE -217, defined as a 30% reduction from 
baseline in the TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) kinetic tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4 c scores from both sides of the body) predose on Day 8. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to SAGE -217 or placebo and will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part  A in the morning with food.  Subjects randomized to the placebo 
arm will represent randomized withdrawal (withdrawal from treatment they received in Part A).  
Protocol 217- ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 6  Methodology:  
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open-label phase of the study (Part A).  If at any time 
the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7185], the dose on the next day will be reduced to the next lowest dose 
and continued for the remainder of the open-label dosing period (ie, subjects who are unable to tolerate 
the 30- mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who are unable to tolerate 20 mg will 
be given a 10-mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6208].  Subjects who require dose adjustments on 
Days  5, 6, or 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
Subjects will be exposed to study drug (SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6209] dose.   
Assessments will be perfor med periodically during the study as outlined in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 2 ).   
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE-217 
Oral Solution to placebo on the change in tremor severity , as measured by [CONTACT_7218] (Day 8) in the accelerometer- based Kinesia™ kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the 
sum of Kinesia kinetic tremor scores from both sides of the body) at Day 14 .   
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives of the study are  to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE-217 
Oral Solution to placebo on the following endpoints: 
• Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the Kinesia upper limb 
total score (ie, the sum of accelerometer- based  Kinesia forward outstretched postural tremor, lateral 
"wing beating" postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores from  both sides of the body) and 
individual item scores at Day 14.   
• Tremor severity, as measured by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8)  in the TETRAS upper 
limb total score (ie, the sum of TETRAS Performance Subscale item 4 scores [4a, 4b, and 4c] from 
both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS Performance Subscale upper limb item scores at 
Day 14.   
• Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in other TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores measured at Day 14.   
• Safety and tolerability, as assessed by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and suicidal ideation using the Columbia- Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS), and adverse event reporting.   
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008],  as assessed by [CONTACT_7242][INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS).  
• Mood, as assessed by [CONTACT_7219]- Lader visual analogue scale (VAS) Mood Scale scores.   
• How the subject feels after taking the study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_7220] (DEQ-5) ratings.   
In addition, plasma concentrations of SAGE-[ADDRESS_6210] 
time point (AUC
0-t), area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), 
maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to reach maximum concentration (t max), and terminal half-
life (t 1/2), will be derived , where appropriate.

Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 7  Exploratory:  
The exploratory objectives  of the study are to compare the effect of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on: 
• Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7166], 
skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ), as assessed by [CONTACT_7222] 
E4.  Tremor oscillation, as assessed by [CONTACT_7163]- dimensional accelerometer measurements (ie, raw 
accelerometer values) using th e Empatica Wristband E4 . 
• Quality of life (QOL), as assessed by [CONTACT_7164] (ADL), Quality of Life in 
Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST), and video recording assessment of subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a but ton, and one additional task that the 
subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis).   
In addition, PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling assessment of the relationship between plasma 
exposure of SAGE-217 and change from baseline in Kinesia scores may be assessed . 
Number of subjects (planned):  
Up to [ADDRESS_6211] 40 randomized subjects for Part B.   
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Subject has signed an informed consent form before any study -specific procedures are performed.  
2. Subject must be between [ADDRESS_6212] a diagnosis of ET, defined as bilateral postural tremor and kinetic tremor, involving hands and forearms, that is visible and persistent and the duration is >[ADDRESS_6213] two on each side (left and right) for kinetic 
tremor and at least two on each side (left and right) for either wing beating or forward outstretched 
postural tremor.   
5. Subject must be willing to discontinue medications taken for the treatment of ET, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine through Day [ADDRESS_6214] -menopausal, permanently sterile (eg , bilateral tubal occlusion , 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy), or of childbearing poten tial with a negative pregnancy test, 
non- breastfeeding, and using two highly effective methods of birth control prior to screening  
through completion of the last follow -up visit (as defined in Section  8.1).  If a subject discontinues 
early after receiving a dose of study drug, they must continue this method of birth control for at 
least [ADDRESS_6215] dose of study drug.  Highly effective m ethods of birth control are 
defined as follows:  hormonal (ie, established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of conception); placement of an intrauterine device; placement of an intrauterine 
system; and mechanical/barrie r method of contraception (ie, condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administra tion:  
SAGE -217 Oral Solution is available as a 6 mg/mL stock aqueous solution of SAGE-217 Drug 
Substance containing 40% HP βCD and 0.0025% sucralose, which is further diluted with Sterile Water 
for Injection and administered as an approximate 40 mL solution with a 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg dose 
given once daily in the morning with food. 
Duration of treatment:  
Screening Duration: approximately 28 days ; Treatment Period: 14 days ; Follow-up: [ADDRESS_6226]: approximately 56 days 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Placebo is available as a solution of 40% HPβCD and 0.0025% sucralose, which is further diluted with 
Sterile Water for Injection and administered as an approximate 40 mL solution given once daily in the 
morning with food in Part B. 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Tremor severity will be measured by [CONTACT_6317] -based Kinesia  and clinician -rated TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores.  Quality -of-life will be evaluated using the TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and 
video recording of subjects performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic 
nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring,  and heart rate 
monitoring ) and tremor oscillation will be assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma will be collected to assay for concentrations of SAGE -217 and may be assayed for  SAGE -217 
metabolites, if deemed necessary .  The fo llowing PK parameters will be derived from the plasma 
concentrations (where evaluable): AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, C max, tmax, and t ½.   
Safety  and Tolerability : 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory 
measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage,  C-SSRS, SSS, and adverse 
event reporting.  The Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale and a DEQ-5 will be used to assess mood and 
perception of drug effects, respectively .   
Statistical methods:  
Study Populations 
The safety population is defined as all subjects who are administered study drug.   
The efficacy population will consist of all subjects in the safety population who complete at least one 
dose in Part B and have at le ast one post -randomization efficacy evaluation.   
The evaluable population will consist of all randomized subjects with at least one post-randomization Kinesia assessment.   
The PK population will consist of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma 
concentrations for PK evaluations.   
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data (including change from randomization values for accelerometer -derived Kinesia and 
clinician -rated TETRAS scores) will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and listed 
by [CONTACT_1130]. 
 
Protocol 217- ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 10  The change from randomization (Day 8) in the Kinesia kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum of 
Kinesia kinetic tremor scores from both sides of the body) at Day [ADDRESS_6227].  Wherever necessary and appropriate,  PK parameters will be dose-adjusted to account for 
individual differences in dose.  
Safety Analysis  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities™.  The overall incidence of adverse events will be displayed by [CONTACT_7243] n Class, preferred term, and dose group.  
Incidence of adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_7168].  
Data from vital signs, clinical laboratory measures, ECG, and C -SSRS will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_7169], where applicable.  Continuous endpoints will be summarized with 
n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  In addition, change from baseline 
values will be calculated at each time point and will be summarized using the same summary statistics.  
Out-of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where applicable.  For all categorical 
endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.   
Sample Size  
Up to [ADDRESS_6228] 40 randomized subjects for Part B.  A total 
sample size of 34 evaluable subjects (ie, 17 per group) will have 80% power to detect a difference in 
means of 3.[ADDRESS_6229] with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.  Assuming a 15% non- evaluability rate, 
20 subjects per group will be randomized.  The number of subjects in each treatment group is also thought to be sufficie nt to assess preliminary safety and tolerability following multiple doses of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution.

 24  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Essential Tremor and Unmet Medical Need  
Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common neurological diseases, with an overall 
prevalence of 0.9%.  Prevalence increases with age and is estimated to be 4.6% in  people over 
65 years of age (Louis 2010, Deuschl 2011).  Essential tremor is largely a bilateral, symmetrical 
postural or kinetic tremor involving hands and forearms that is visible and persistent.  Additional or isolated tremor of the head or lower limbs may occur, but in the absence of abnormal posturing (Deuschl 1998, Habib -ur-Rehman 2000).  The onset of tremor has a bimodal 
distribution, with onset between [ADDRESS_6243] plays a key role in ET ( McAuley 2000, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]  2003, 
Elble  2009, Schnitzler 2009, Deuschl 2009).  Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the 
ventral intermediate nucleus and of the subthalamic nucleus improve ET ( Deuschl 2011, 
Zappia 2013, Rajput 2014) .  Microscopic cerebellar pathology has been identified, including 
gliosis, Purkinje cell loss, and increased torpedoes (swellings) in the Purkinje cell axons (Louis 2007, Axelrad 2008, Shill 2008, Louis 2009).  Activation studies wit h positron emission 
tomography indicate abnormally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the cerebellum both at 
rest and when tremor is provoked by [CONTACT_7224] ( Boecker  1994, Wills  1996).   
Essential tremor is associated with impaired γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)ergic function (and 
consequent hyperactivity) in the cerebellum ( Málly 1996, Bucher 1997, Louis 2007, Louis 2008, 
Paris -Robidas 2012).  γ-aminobutyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system (CNS), is released from GABAergic neurons and binds to several types of 
GABA receptors ( γ-aminobutyric acid -ligand gated chloride channel [ GABA
A] and 
γ-aminobutyric acid-G protein-coupled [ GABA B]) on target neurons.  γ- aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel re ceptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, 
are macromolecular proteins that form a chloride ion channel complex and contain specific 
binding sites for GABA and a number of allosteric regulators, including barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.   
Drugs acting on GABA A receptors, such as primidone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], or ethanol decrease 
tremor amplitude , suggesting that altered GABAergic neurotransmission is involved in ET.  
Postmortem analysis revealed a 35% reduction of GABA A receptors and a 22% to 31% reduction 
of GABA B receptors in the dentate nucleus of cerebella of ET subjects ( Paris -Robidas 2012).  
Reduced levels of G ABA in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_7112] 
(Málly  1996 ).  More over, toxins such as aflatrem, penitrem A, or harmaline have been proposed 
to induce tremor in rodents by [CONTACT_7173] ( Cavanagh 1998, Miwa 2007), 
and targeted deletion of the α1 subunit of GABA A receptor in knockout mice exhibits a 
15 to 19 Hz action tremor, similar to ET in humans ( Kralic 2005).    
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6244] by [CONTACT_7225] ( Louis 2012, Benito-Leon 2007, Pahapi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 1999).  First-line treatments 
for ET incl ude the anticonvulsant primidone and the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol 
(Gorman  1986).  Like primidone, gabapentin is an anticonvulsant found to be effective in the 
treatment of ET (O’Brien 1981, Gironell 1999).   The oldest treatment for ET is ethanol, which 
temporarily ameliorates tremor  and is freq uently used by [CONTACT_7175]- medicate; however, 
chronic use of ethanol for tremor management carries the known risks of alcohol dependence and 
overuse ( Pahwa 2003).    
These treatments are moderately effective, reducing, though not resolving, tremor amplitudes in about 50% of the subjects ( Schmouth 2014).  In addition, one out of three patients  abandon 
treatment because of side  effects or poor efficacy ( Louis 2010) , illustrating that with few feasible  
treatment options and a range of handicaps in daily living makes ET an area of high unmet 
medical need.    
5.2. SAGE -217 Oral Solution  
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA A receptor and thus is expected to be 
of benefit for the treatmen t of ET.  Unlike benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_7113] γ -subunit-
containing subset of GABA A receptors ( Pritchett 1989, Esmaeili 2009 ), SAGE -[ADDRESS_6245] a wider range of activity 
(Belelli 2002).  
SAGE -217 Oral Solution 6 mg/mL (40% w/w aqueous h ydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin [ HPβCD] 
with 0.025 mg/mL sucralose) is a nonviscous, clear solution.   
5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Experience with SAGE -217 
5.3.1. Nonclinical Studies with SAGE -217 
In nonclinical studies of SAGE-217, sedative- hypnotic effects were consistently observed at 
higher doses in both in vivo pharmacology studies as well as in toxicology studies.  The 
sedative- hypnotic impairments seen with SAGE -217 were typi[INVESTIGATOR_7114] A positive 
modulators, ranging from hyperexcitability and ataxia at the lower doses through deep sedation 
and ultimately anesthesia at higher doses.  Depth and duration of sedation demonstrated a clear 
dose response over the range tested, with evidence of tolerance occurring with continued exposure.  Tolerance to the effects of SAGE -217 on motor incoordination was  not observed after 
7 days of dosing.   
The compound has been assessed in 14-day rat and dog toxicology studies with daily 
administration of SAGE -217 as a solution in HPβCD in dogs and Labrasol
® in rats.  The no 
observed adverse effect level was 3 mg/kg (females) and 22. 5 mg/kg (males) in rats and 
2.5 mg/kg in dogs.  There were no adverse effects in dogs or rats in the main toxicology studies.  A singl e observation of mortality occurred in one female rat at the high dose in a toxicokinetic 
study which was suspected to have been related to exaggerated pharmacology.  Additional toxicology and pharmacology information is provided in the Investigat or’s Broc hure.

 26  5.3.2. Clinical Experience 
To date, two clinical studies employing SAGE -217 are clinically complete  and final clinical 
study reports are pending.  Discussions of pharmacokinetic (PK) data are limited to the single -
ascending dose, food, and essential tremor cohorts from Study 217- CLP-101 and the multiple -
ascending dose and drug-drug interaction (DDI) cohorts from Study 217- CLP-102.  Discussions 
of safety data are limited to the single -ascending dose cohorts in Study 217- CLP-[ADDRESS_6246] -in-human, four- part study that assessed the effects of a single 
dose of SAGE-217.  The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose 
design in healthy adult volunteers, with the objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD ) and PK profiles of SAGE -217 Oral Solution.  Subjects in each of the single -ascending 
dose cohorts received a single dose of study drug, either SAGE-217 (six subjects) or placebo 
(two subjects), with SAGE-217 doses of 0.25 mg , 0.75 mg, 2 mg, 5.5 mg, 11 mg, 22 mg, 44 mg, 
55 mg, and 66 mg.  Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data 
were reviewed by [CONTACT_7244] ( SRC) and a greement reached that it was safe to 
increase the dose.  The MTD was determined to be 55 mg.  Two cohorts, 6 subjects each 
received SAGE -217 in an open-label manner (one cohort received 50% of the MTD [22 mg] to 
study the food effects and the other cohort received the MTD [55 mg] to study the effects on 
subjects with essential tremor ).  SAGE -[ADDRESS_6247] ( 0.25 mg ) through the highest ( 66 mg ) dose, and supported once daily oral 
dosing with food.   
Study 217- CLP-102 was a two- part study that assessed the effects of multiple -ascending doses of 
SAGE -217.  The study was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -ascending dose study in 
healthy adult volunteers.  Subjects in each of the multiple- ascend ing dose cohorts received study 
drug, either SAGE-217 (nine subjects) or placebo (three subjects), once daily for 7 days, with 
SAGE -217 doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 35 mg.  Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only 
after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7245].  The MTD was determined to be 30 mg.  It was observed that subjects 
receiving the drug in the evening  did better in terms of tolerability compared to when they 
received the drug in the morning.  A fourth cohort of 12 subjects received 30 mg of SAGE-217 
in an open-label manner to study drug-drug interactions.  SAGE -217 is not likely to induce the 
metabolism of CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates.  SAGE -217 was orally bioavailable and suitable 
for once daily oral dosing at night time with food.   
SAGE -217 was generally well tolerated.  In both Phase 1 studies (217- CLP-101 and  
217-CLP-102), doses were escalated until the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7115].  Most adverse events 
were reported as mild or m oderate in intensity, and there were no serious adverse events reported 
in either study.  In addition, none of the observed adverse events resulted in discontinuation of 
the study drug.  At doses planned for further study, the observed sedation was mild, transient, and associated with daily peak exposure.  The most common treatment- emergent adverse events 
were sedation, somnolence, dizziness, euphoric mood, fatigue, tremor, and muscle twitching, reported most frequently in the highest dose group (66 mg).  Some changes in mean blood pressure and heart rate were observed after single doses of 44 mg and greater.  After multiple 
doses of 30 mg (AM or PM) or 35 mg (PM) over [ADDRESS_6248].  Thus, the potential benefits in this population are unknown, although 
the risks are likely to be similar to those mentioned in the  Investigator’s Brochure .  Many 
compounds that target the GABA A receptors exhibit clinical efficacy in ET, validating this 
receptor as a therapeutic target.  Given the promising SAGE-[ADDRESS_6249] vs tolerability 
(adverse events), specifically sedation.  Each subject will start with an initial dose of [ADDRESS_6250] the 10 -mg 
dose for a minimum of 3 days will qualify for the randomization phase (Part B).  Given  the high 
medical need and potential for benefit in ET, there is a favorable benefit-risk evaluation to 
investigate SAGE -[ADDRESS_6251] the potential to mitigate risk.  From a benefit/risk 
perspective, the appropriate measures are being taken in order to ensure the safety of the subjects 
who will be enrolled.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is a two-part, multicenter, Phase 2a study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and PK of SAGE -217 Oral Solution in up to 60 adult subjects with ET.  Part A of the study is an 
open-label design with morning dosing for 7 days.  Part B of the study is a double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal design.  Subjects will be exposed to study drug 
(SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6256] dose.   
During the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), after signing the informed consent form (ICF), 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and the severity of each subject’s ET will be 
evaluated using TETRAS.   Eligible subjects will return  to the clinical study unit on Day -1.   
The study will be conducted in two parts: 
• Part A:  Beginning on Day 1, a ll subjects will receive open -label SAGE -217 in the 
morning with food (as outlined in Section  9.2) for 7 days.  Subjects will receive 
SAGE -217 10 mg on Day 1, SAGE-217 20 mg on Day 2, and SAGE-217 30 mg from 
Day 3 to Day 7 , with dose adjustments for severe adverse events judged by [CONTACT_7181] ( Section  9.3). 
• Part B:  In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a dose of 
≥[ADDRESS_6257] responded to SAGE-217, de fined as 
a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor (item 4c) combined score 
predose on Day 8.  E ligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_6258] dose and continued for the remainder of the open -label dosing period (ie, subjects 
who are unable to tolerate SAGE -217 30 mg will receive SAGE -217 20 mg and subjects who are 
unable to tolerate SAGE -217 20 mg will receive SAGE -217 10 mg).  The dose tolerated on 
Days  5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6259].  Subjects who 
require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, or 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
7.2. Blinding and Randomization  
Part A is open- label with no control group; therefore , there will be no randomization or blinding.   
Part B of the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal des ign.  
Subjects who tolerate a dose of ≥10 mg of SAGE-217 in Part A and respond to SAGE-217, 
defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score predose on 
Day 8, will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_6260] may reveal actual solution contents to the 
investigator, who should also al ert Sage of the emergency (see Section  13.6 for more details 
related to unblinding).  In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s 
records and on the electronic case report fo rm (eCRF) .  If the subject or study center personnel 
(other than pharmacist) have been unblinded, the subj ect will be terminated from the study.   
Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive their maximum dose  as determined in Part A  in 
the morning with food.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent randomized 
withdrawal (withdrawal from treatme nt they received in Part A).

negative pregnancy test, non- breastfeeding, and using two highly effective methods of birth control prior to screening through completion of the last follow -up visit.  If a subject 
discontinues early after receiving a dose of study drug , they must continue this method of 
birth control for at least [ADDRESS_6265] dose of study drug.  Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as follows:  hormonal (ie, established use of oral, 
implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of conception); placement of an intrauterine device; placement of an intrauterine system; and mechanical/barrier 
method of contraception (ie, condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [foam, gel, film, cream or suppository]).   
8. Male subject s must agree to practice a highly effective method of birth control while on 
study drug  and for [ADDRESS_6266] dose of study drug.  Effective 
methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, vasectomy, or a condom with spermicide (men ) in combination with their  partner’s highly effective method. 
9. Males must be willing to abstain from sperm donation and females from donating eggs while on study through [ADDRESS_6267] Exclusion Criteria

The following entrance criteria will be applied prior to administration of blinded study drug in Part B; subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, or [ADDRESS_6276] tolerate a dose of ≥[ADDRESS_6277] responded to SAGE-217, defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum of item 4 c scores from both sides of 
the body) predose on Day 8.   
8.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
If there is an adverse event or medical reason for the withdrawal, the subject should be followed medically until the condition has either resolved itself or is stable.  Details of the reason for 
withdrawal should be recorded in the subject’s case report form ( CRF ).   
Subjects who withdraw should, if possible, have a follow-up examination, including a physical examination, the appropriate investigations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests, as outlined for the Day 21 visit ( Table 3) .  If the subject can not return on Day 21 ( Early Termination visit), 
their visit can be scheduled at an alternative time, at the discretion of the Investigator and subject.   All details of this follow -up examination should be recorded in the subject’s medical 
source documents.   
8.4.1. Study Drug Withdrawal  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary.  Subjects are free to discontinue the study at any 
time without giving their reason(s).   
A subject must be withdrawn from the study treatment in the event of any of the following: 
• Withdrawal of the subject’s consent; 
• New onset of a condition that  would have met exclusion criterion, is clinically 
relevant and affects the subject’s safety, and discontinuation is considered necessary 
by [CONTACT_7183]/Sponsor; 
• Occurrence of intolerable adverse event s at the lowest dose ;  
• Occurrence of pregnancy;  
• Intake of nonpermitted concomitant medication; 
• Subject noncompliance;  
• Significant protocol deviation determined in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6278]’s source documents.   
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will be replaced only if they withdraw 
prior to dosing.  Subjects who are withdrawn from the study, fail to return or are no longer 
qualified will not be replaced.   
8.4.2. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate t his study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons, including the occurrence of adverse events or other findings suggesting unacceptable 
risk to subjects, or for administrative reasons.  In the event of study termination, Sage 
Therapeutics will provide written notification to the Investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify their Institutional Review Board (IRB) and initiate withdrawal procedures for 
participating subjects.

9.2. Treatment Assignment  
Study drug will be administered in the morning with food during Part A and Part B.  
9.2.1. Part A  
Subjects participating in Part A of the study will take study drug (SAGE -217) in an open- label 
manner.  All subjects will start on a [ADDRESS_6280].   
9.2.2. Part B  
Subjects participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal portion of 
the study (Part B) will be randomized to SAGE -217 or placebo  on Day 8.  Subjects randomized 
to SAGE -217 will receive the maximum dose of SAGE -217 from Part A of the study.  Following 
randomization, subjects will receive 7  days of study drug starting on Day 8.   
9.3. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during t he open-label phase of the study (Part A).  If at 
any time the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7185], the dose on the next day will be reduced to 
the next lo west dose and continued for the remainder of the open-label dosing period (ie, subjects 
who are unable to tolerate the 30 -mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who 
are unable to to lerate 20 mg will be given a 10 -mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6281].  
Subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, or 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
9.4. Prior/Concomit ant Medications and Restrictions  
9.4.1. Prior/ Concomitant Medications 
Any concomitant medication determined necessary for the welfare of the subject may be given at 
the discretion of the Investigator at any time during the study under the guidance outlined in 
Section  9.4.2.   
Record the name, start date (if known), indication for use and whether ongoing or stopped of 
medications/treatments taken within 2 weeks prior to informed consent and throughout the study.

discharge from the unit.  Chart reviews will include examination of nursing and physician 
progress notes, vital signs , and medication records in order to identify adverse events  that may be 
associated with new concomitant medications.  New concomitant medications, ongoing 
concomitant medications with a change in dose and medical procedures ordered (eg, labora tory 
assessments,  computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans ) will be reviewed to 
determine if they are associated with an adverse event not previously identified.

Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6286] symptom response by a measurement of 
Kinesia , TETRAS upper limb items , and TETRAS Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8).  
Quality -of-life assessments include TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording of subjects 
performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as 
measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring,  and heart rate monitoring) and 
tremor oscillation as assessed by [CONTACT_7192] (ie, raw accelerometer values) will be assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
11.1. Kinesia  
In order to measure tremor amplitude, subjects will wear a  wireless ring motion sensor 
(Kinesia,  Great Lakes Neuro Technologies).  The motion sensor uses three orthogonal 
accelerometers and three orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three- dimensional motion.  Data are 
then transmitted from the sensor to a computer using Bluetooth technology.  These measures of three-dimensional motion for each maneuver are then converted to Kinesia scores, which have 
been shown to correlate with corresponding clinician- rated TETRAS scores (Giovanni 2010).  
Each Kinesia score ranges from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate more severe tremor.  The Kinesia  
assessment is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 assessment . 
In Part A, Kinesi a will be performed on Day - 1 (three assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
30 minutes) ; a single assessment will be performed  predose and 2 and 8 hours (±30  minutes)
 
postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7.  In Part  B, a single Kinesia reading will be performed pre dose 
and 2 and 8 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14, and anyti me during the visit on 
Day 21. 
11.2. TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) 
Performance Scale  
Item #4 (upper limb tremor) of the TETRAS Performance Subscale will be completed using both the Kinesia device and clinician assessment.  Testing should be completed within ±10 minutes of 
the planned questionnaire time points.  All three maneuvers  in the upper limb assessments 
(items  4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the RIGHT arm and then for the 
LEFT.  Predose assessments can be done any time within 2 hours prior to the start of administration of solution .  The Day 21 follow-up visit assessments can be done at any time 
during the visit. 
In Part A, the TETRAS upper limb items  will be perfo rmed at screening  and on Day - 1 (three 
assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes); a single assessment of TETRAS upper limb items  
will be performed predose and 2 and 8 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7.  In 
addition, the TETRAS upper l imb items  will be performed , while wearing the Empatica 
Wristband E4, on Day -1 and 3 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7. 
The TETRAS ADL  Subscale and Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8) will be performed 
on Day -1 and predose (±30  minutes) on Day 7.  On days when the TETRAS ADL and 
Performance Subscale are performed, Item # 4 will not be repeated.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 42  In Part B, the TETRAS upper limb items  will be performed  predose and 2 and 8 hours 
(±30  minutes) postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14, and anytime  during the visit on Day 21.  In 
addition, the TETRAS upper limb items will be performed , while wearing the Empatica 
Wristband E4, 3 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14, and anytime during the visit 
on Day 21.  The TETRAS ADL  Subscale and Performance Subscale (items 4, 6, 7, and 8) will be 
performed predose (±30  minutes) on Day 14 and anytime  during the visit on Day 21.  On days 
when the TETRAS ADL Subscale and Performance Subscale are performed, Item # [ADDRESS_6287] be ≥2 on each side (left and right) for kinetic tremor and ≥2 on 
each side (left and right) for either wing beating or forward outstretched postural tremor.  A copy 
of the TETRAS is provided in Appendix 2.   
11.3. Empatica Wristband E4 
Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) will be  assessed by [CONTACT_7229] E4.  The Empatica Wristband E4  is a wearable device that captures  
motion -based activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal.  In Part A,  the Empatica 
Wristband E4 will be worn during the study visits while in clinic on  Days -1, 1, 2, 3, and 7.  In 
Part B, the Empa tica Wristband  E4 will be worn during the study visits while in clinic on Days 8, 
9, 14, and anytime during the visit on Day 21.  With the exception of during the TETRAS upper 
limb assessments, t he Empatica Wristband E4 will be worn on the wrist that, of the two arms, 
exhibits more severe tremor symptoms.  During the TETRAS upper limb assessments (Part A:  
Day -1 and 3 hours (±30  minutes) postdose on Days 1, 2, 3 and 7; Part B:  3 hours (±30  minutes)  
postdose on Days 8, 9, and 14 and 21), the Empatica Wristband E4 will be worn on the wrist 
corresponding to the side of the body being assessed .  Data from the Empatica Wristband E4 will 
not be presented in the study report; instead, they will be part of a separate report.   
11.4. Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST)  
The QUEST is a brief, 30 -item, ET -specific QOL scale in which subjects rate the extent to which 
tremor impacts a function or state, tremor severity in various body parts, perceived health, and overall QOL (Tröster 2005).  The QUEST w ill be administered on Day -1, Day  7, and on 
Day 14.  A copy of the QUEST is provided in Appendix 3.   
11.5. Video Recording  
Videos of subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, 
and one additional task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis) will be taken 
on Day -[ADDRESS_6288]- dosing sampling times are relative to this 
time.  Sample s are to be collected within ±[ADDRESS_6289] the plasma samples processed, stored, and 
transported as directed for bioanalysis.   
An additional PK sample may be collected at any time if clinically indicated and at the discretion 
of the Investigator (eg, for unusual or severe adverse events).   
Each sampl e will be marked with unique identifiers such as the study number, subject number, 
and the nominal sample time.  The date and actual time that the blood sample was taken will be 
recorded on the CRF or electronically with a bar code or other method.   
12.2. Stora ge and Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
The plasma samples should be kept frozen at approximately -70°C to -80°C until analyzed.  
They should be packed as directed to avoid breakage during transit and with sufficient dry ice to prevent thawing for at le ast [ADDRESS_6290] the plasma samples transported as directed for bioanalysis as detailed in the PK instructions.   
12.3. Sample Analysis 
Bioanalysis of plasma samples for the determination of SAGE-217 will be performed utilizing a validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry method at a qualified laboratory.

Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical 
laboratory measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage, C- SSRS, SSS, 
and adverse event reporting.  The Bond -Lader Mood Rating Scale and a DEQ -5 will be used to 
assess mood and perception of drug effects, respectively.   
13.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Age, gender, race, and ethnic origin will be recorded at the Screening visit.  A full medical 
history including medication history will be record ed at the Screening visit.   
13.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature , and supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919]

Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 45  13.1.6. Laboratory Assessments 
In Part A, blood and urine samples will be collected for hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis at the Screening visit, on Day -1, predose on Day 1, and predose on Day 2.  In Part  B, 
blood and urine samples will be collected predose on Day 8 and Day 9  and anytime  during the 
visit on Day 21.   
Serum and urine samples for pregnancy tests (females only) will also be collected.  These 
assessments should be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Events ( Table 2  and 
Table 3)  and as outlined individually below.   
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant 
(CS).  Screening results considered abnormal, CS recorded at the Screening visit may make the 
subject ineligible for the study pending review by [CONTACT_7195].  Clinical laboratory 
results that are abnormal, CS dur ing the study but within normal range at baseline and/or indicate 
a worsening from baseline will be considered adverse events, assessed according to 
Section  13.2.1, and recorded in the e CRF.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology 
Hematology tests will include complete blood count, including red blood cells, white blood cells with differentiation, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and platelets.  The coagulation panel will include activated partial thromboplastin time, p rothrombin time , and international 
normalized ratio .   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blood Chemistry  
Serum chemistry tests will include serum electrolytes, renal function tests, including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide, liver function tests, including total 
bilirubin, AST, and ALT , total protein, and albumin.   
Thyroid -stimulating hormone, thyroxine ( T4), and triiodothyronine ( T3) will be performed at 
screening to confirm subject eligibility.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, glucose, ketones, bile, urobilinogen, hemoglobin, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, color, turbidity, pH, and specific gravity.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drugs Screen and Alcohol Test  
A urine sample for assessment of se lected drugs (sedative/hypnotics [eg, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]], cotinine, and 
caffeine) and a breath sample for alcohol screen will be collected at screening  and on Day -1.  
Results may be obtained through subject history.  Subjects who use concomitant 
sedative/hypnotics will be excluded from the study.  Use of alcohol, caffeine, or cotinine is not 
allowed through Day 21. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Virus Serology  
Subjects will be screened for hepatitis (HBsAg and anti -HCV) and HIV prior to being enrolled in 
the study.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 46  [IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of chi ld-bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_7233] -1, predose on Day 8, and at the follow -up 
visit on Day 28 in Part B.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Biochemistry 
Optional blood samples will be collected at screening and on Days [ADDRESS_6292] other 
biochemical markers as candidates for influencing not only response to SAGE-217 but also 
suscep tibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be evaluated.  Thus, the biochemical 
research m ay involve study of additional unnamed biochemical biomarkers, but only as related to 
disease susceptibility and drug action.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Genetic Testing  
Where consent is giv en, an optional genetic sample for biomarker testing will be collected at the 
Screening visit.   
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic va riation may influence response 
(ie, distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE-217.  Specific genetic variations of 
interest include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 supra- family genes), genes enco ding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of 
SAGE -217 (eg, AKR1C4 [3α- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]), genes associated with the 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (eg, GABRA1- A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, 
GABRG1 -3), and genes associated with t he production and degradation of GABA.   
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to SAGE -217 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be 
evaluated.  Thus, the genetic research m ay involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene 
categories, but only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action.   
13.1.7. Columbi a-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) 
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011).  This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit.  The C- SSRS includes ‘yes ’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_6293] severe).   
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the subject is showing any suicidal tendency, no further 
study drug will be administered and the subject will be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation.  This information will be tracked.   
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening  (lifetime history and past 
24 months).  In Part A, t he “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed on Day -1, 
8 hours postdose (± 1 hour) on Day 1, predose on Day 4, and on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, the 
“Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed 8 hours (± 1 hour) postdose on Days 8, 11, 
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6294] Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS) 
The SSS is subject -rated scale designed to quickly assess how alert a subject is feeling  
(Hoddes 1972) .  Degrees of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7138] a scale of [ADDRESS_6295] score of ‘1’ indicates the subject is ‘feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake’ and the 
highest score of ‘7’ indicates the subject is ‘no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having 
dream -like thoughts’.   
In Part A, the SS S will be administered predose a nd at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose on 
Days  1, 2, 3, and 4, and predose only on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, t he SSS will be 
administered predose and 1, 2,  4, 6, and 8 hours postdose on Days 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, 
and anytime  during the visit on Day 21.  All time points are relative to the time of dosing.  The 
SSS is to be performed within ±10 minutes of the scheduled times.  The SSS is provided in Appendix 5.  
13.1.9. Bond- Lader VAS Mood Scale 
Mood will be assessed using the Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale ( Bond 1974).  This is a 16- part 
self-administered questionnaire that employs a 100-mm VAS to explore di fferent aspects of self -
reported mood.  In Part A, the mood scale will be administered predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes)  postdose on Days 1, 2, and 7.  In Part B, the mood scale will be administered 
predose and 2 hours (± 10 minutes)  postdose on Days 8, 9, 14, and anytime  during the visit on 
Day 21.  The Bond-Lader Mood Rating Scale is provided in Appendix 6.   
13.1.10. Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ -5) 
A DEQ-5 ( Morean 2013 ) will be administered as follows: 
1. Do you FEEL a drug effect right now? 
2. Are you HIGH right now? 
3. Do you DISLIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now? 
4. Do you LIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now? 
5. Would you like MORE of the drug you took, right now? 
The answers are recorded on a 100- mm VAS , with the answer for each being “Not at all” and 
“Extremely” at the extremes.  There will be options to record “Not applicable” for questions 3 and 4 if no drug effects are felt and for question 5 prior to administration of study medication.   The DEQ -5 will be performed 2 hours (±10  minutes) postdose on Days 1 and 7 in 
Part A and 2  hours (±10  minutes) postdose on Days 8 and 14 in Part B.  The DEQ-5 is provided 
in Appendix 7.  
13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected after the ICF has been signed.  Medical conditions that occur 
after the ICF has been signed will be captured on the adverse event eCRF.  
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 48  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
coding system (version 18.1 or higher ).  
13.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally  related to the product.  In clinical studies,  an adverse event 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event .  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious advers e event is an adverse event o ccurring during any study phase and at any dose of 
the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• It results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All serious adverse event s that occur after any subject has been enrolled, whether or not they are 
related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_7249] f or 
the duration of the study (from the signing of the ICF through the Day 28 visit [or early 
termination]) . 
13.2.2. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring during this study will be reported within [ADDRESS_6296]’s spouse/partner (if the subject is male and his spouse/partner becomes pregnant) or the 
obstetrician for information about the outcome of the pregnancy, and in the case of a live birth, 
about any congenital abnormalities.  If a congenital abnormality is reported, then it should be 
recorded in the source documents and reported a s a serious adverse event .   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6297] for each adverse event (unrelated, possibly related or probably related).  
The Investigator should decide wh ether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “unrelated.”  If 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event , then the 
adverse event should be considered “related.”    
Not 
Related:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the  subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probably 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other modes  of therapy  administered  to the  subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event /serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered to be related 
to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.   
13.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the s tudy personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as adverse event s unless they prompt corrective me dical action by [CONTACT_3786], constitute a serious adverse event  or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
study drug.   
Information about adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF through the 
Day 28 visit (or early termination) .  Adverse events that occur after the first administration of 
study drug will be denoted TEAEs.   All adverse events will be followed until they are resolved or have reached a clinical plateau with 
no expectation of future change.   The advers e event term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For 
each adverse event , the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution 
or clinical plateau (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken,  outcome, and whether or not 
it caused the subject to discontinue the study .   
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3.0 27 January 2017 
 50  • Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with  normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
13.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse event s (regardless of causality) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF 
until the Day  28 visit ([ADDRESS_6298] dose of study drug) or early termination.  Any 
serious adverse event s considered possibly or probably related to the investigational product and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  All serious adverse 
event s must be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee immediately by [CONTACT_7202] [ADDRESS_6299] complete, sign 
and date the serious adverse event pages, verify the accurac y of the information recorded on the 
serious adverse event pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee.    
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be sent to Sage Therapeutics 
or designee within 24 hours of receipt; a follow-up serious adverse event  form should be 
completed and placed with the original serious adverse event  information and kept with the 
appropriate section of the study file.   
Sage Therapeutics or designee is resp onsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events.  It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all serious 
adverse event s that occur at his or her site if applicable per the IRB’s requirements.  Investigators 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) 
that occur during the clinical study.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB of these 
additional serious adverse event s.   
13.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug (Part B)  
Part B is a double-blind study.  The pharmacist responsible for preparing the solutions will be unblinded and will retain an official paper copy of the randomization schedule. 
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received.  Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_7250] a subject.  Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be discussed with the Sponsor.  If the unblinding occurs 
without the Sponsor’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature 
unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, any request for the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to the Sponsor and approved by [CONTACT_7251], according to standard operating procedures.  
The blinding of the study will be broken after the database has been locked.  Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_7142].

concentrations for PK evaluations.   
14.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data .  All subjects will be used in the analyses, as 
per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available.  No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data.  No sensitivity analysis of missing data will be performed.   
14.3. Demographics an d Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics, such as age, race, and ethnicity , and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized.   
Categorical summaries, such as race and ethnicity, will be summarized by [CONTACT_7252] e.  Continuous summaries, such as age, height, weight, BMI, and baseline vital signs, 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Hepatitis, HIV, d rug, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not summarized as they 
are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
Medical history will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].

change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  Out-of- range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where 
applicable.  For all categorical endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.   
14.7.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding system (version 18.1 or higher).  The 
analysis of adverse event s will be based on the concept of TEAEs.  A TEAE is defined as an 
adverse event with onset after the start of open- label study drug , or any worsening of a pre-
existing medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of open- label study drug and 
until [ADDRESS_6303] dose.  The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized overall  and by 
[CONTACT_7204] , preferred term , and dose group.  Incidences will be presented in 
order of decreasing frequency.  In addition, summaries will be  provided by [CONTACT_7253] s tudy drug (see  Section  13.3).    
TEAEs leading to discontinuation and serious adverse events (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for definition) 
with onset after the first dose of open- label study drug will also be summarized.  
All adverse events and serious adverse events (including those with onset or wors ening before 
the signing of the ICF ) through the Day [ADDRESS_6304] and timing of collection.  Mean changes from 
randomization in vital signs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7206].   
14.7.3. Physical Examinations 
Screening physical examination s will be documented as done/not done; these results will be 
listed by [CONTACT_1130].  Any clinically significant physical examination findings will be recorded as  
medical history.   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6305]: heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTc, 
and QTcF.  Any clinically significant abnormalities or changes in ECGs should be listed as an 
adverse event.  E lectrocardiogram findings will be listed by [CONTACT_3598].   
14.7.5. Clinical Labo ratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory results will be listed by [CONTACT_7208].  Mean changes from 
baseline and randomization in clinical laboratory measures will be evaluated.

15.1. Study M onitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics or designee will visit the investigational study site to:   
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities ; and  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) an d other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or designee or its representatives.  This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between 
Sage Therapeutics and the Investigator.    
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or designee will have regular contacts with the investigational site for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s); 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable ; 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRF s, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed ; 
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF s 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  (eg, clinic charts);  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics or 
designee; and  
• Confirm adverse event s and serious adverse event s have been properly documented 
on CRFs and confirm any serious adverse event s have been forwarded to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee and thos e serious adverse event s that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.   
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
15.2. Audits and Inspections

Title of Study: A Phase 2a, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SAGE -217 Oral Solution in the 
Treatment of Subjects with Essential Tremor (ET)  
Study center(s):   Up to 30 centers  
Phase of development: 2a 
Methodology:  
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of SAGE -217 Oral Solution.   
There are two parts:  
Part A : Open -label with morning  dosing (7 days).  
All subjects will start on a 10 mg dose of study drug administered with food in the morning on Day 1.  
Subjects will receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 and 30 mg with food daily on Days 3 to 7.   
Part B : Double -blind, placebo -controlled, ra ndomized withdrawal with morning  and evening dosing 
(7 days).  
In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a maximum dose of at least [ADDRESS_6325] responded to SAGE -217, defined as a 30% reduction fro m 
baseline in the TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) kinetic tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) predose on Day 8.   
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_6326] awal 
(withdrawal from treatment they received in Part  A).  Subjects will be administered study drug with 
meals in the morning and in the evening for 7 consecutive days.   
  
Protocol 217-ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 6  Methodology:  
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open -label phase of  the study (Part A).  If at any time 
the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7258], the dose on the next day will be reduced to the next lowest dose 
and continue d for the remainder of the open -label dosing period (ie, subjects who are unable to tolerate 
the 30 mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who are unable to tolerate 20 mg will 
be given a 10 mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, an d [ADDRESS_6327].  Subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 
5, 6, and 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
Subjects will be exposed to study drug (SAGE -217 or placebo)  for up to [ADDRESS_6328] dose.   
Assessments will be performed periodically during the study as outlined in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 2).   
Objectives:  
Primary:  
 The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE -217 
Oral Solution to placebo on the change in tremor severity.   
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives  of the study are to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE -217 
Oral Solution to placebo on the following endpoints:  
 Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the accelerometer -based 
Kinesia upper limb total score (ie, the sum of forward outstretched postural tremor, lateral "wing 
beating" postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores across both sides of the body) and 
individual item scores at Day 14.   
 Tremor severity, as mea sured by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the TETRAS upper 
limb total score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS 
upper limb item scores at Day 14.   
 Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7259] (Day 8) in TETRAS Performance 
Subscale scores measured at Day 14.   
 Safety and tolerability, as assessed by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and suicidal ideation using the Columbia -Suicide Sev erity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS), and adverse event reporting.   
 Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/sedation, as assessed by [CONTACT_7242][INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS) and Modified Observer's 
Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores.   
 Mood, as assessed by [CONTACT_7219] -Lader visual anal ogue scale (VAS) Mood Scale scores.   
 How the subject feels after taking the study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_7220] 
(DEQ -5) ratings.   
In addition, plasma concentrations of SAGE -217 and SAGE -217 metabolites  may be measured.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, such as area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to 
last time point (AUC 0-t), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), 
maximum plasma concentration (C max), tim e to reach maximum concentration (t max), and terminal half -
life (t 1/2), will be derived , where appropriate .

Duration of treatment:  
Screening Duration: approximately 28 days ; Treatment Period: 14 days ; Follow -up: [ADDRESS_6343]: approximately 56 days  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Placebo will be matched to study drug  in Part B.   
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Transducer measurement of tremor amplitude using an accelerometer and TETRAS Performance 
Subscale.  Quality -of-life will be evaluated using the TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording of 
subjects performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie,  sympathetic nervous system tone 
as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma will be collected to assay for concentrations of SAGE -217 and may be assayed for  SAGE -217 
metabolites , if deemed necessary .  The following PK parameters will be derived from the plasma 
concentrations (where evaluable): AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, Cmax, tmax, and t½.   
Safety  and Tolerability : 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory 
measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage,  C-SSRS, SSS, MOAA/S 
scores , and adverse event reporting .  The Bond -Lader Mood Ratin g Scale and a DEQ -5 will be used to 
assess mood and perception of drug effects , respectively .   
Statistical methods:  
Study Populations  
The safety population is defined as all subjects who are administered study drug.   
The efficacy population will consist of all subjects in the safety population who complete at least one 
dose in Part B and have at least one post -randomization efficacy evaluation.   
The evaluable population will consist of all randomized subjects with at least one post -randomization 
Kinesia assessment.   
The PK population will consist of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma 
concentrations for PK evaluations.   
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data (including change from randomization valu es for accelerometer -derived Kinesia and 
clinician -rated TETRAS scores) will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and listed 
by [CONTACT_1130].   
The change from randomization (Day 8) in the accelerometer -based Kinesia kinetic tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) at Day [ADDRESS_6344].  Wherever necessary and appropriate, PK parameters will be dose -adjusted to account for 
individual differences in dose.   
  
Safety Analysis  
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities™.  The overall 
incidence of adverse events will be displayed by [CONTACT_1196], preferred term, and dose group.  
Incidence of adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_7260].  
Data from vital signs, clinical laboratory measures, ECG, and C -SSRS will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_7169], where applicable.  Continuous endpoints will be summarized with 
n, mean, standa rd deviation, median, minimum, and  maximum.  In addition, change from baseline 
values will be calculated at each time point and will be summarized using the same summary statistics.  
Out-of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where ap plicable.  For all categorical 
endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.   
Sample Size  
Up to [ADDRESS_6345] 60 randomized subjects for Part B.  A total 
sample size of 51 evaluable subjects (ie, 17 per group) will have 80% power to detect a difference in 
means of 3.[ADDRESS_6346] with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.  Assuming a 15% non -evaluability rate, 
20 subjects per group will be randomized.  The number of subjects in each treatment group is also 
thought to be sufficient to assess preliminary safety and tolerability following multiple doses of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution.

 24  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Essential Tremor and Unmet Medical Need  
Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common neurological diseases, with an overall 
prevalence of 0.9%.  Prevalence increases with age and is estimated to be 4.6% in people over 
65 years of age (Louis 2010 , Deuschl 2011 ).  Essential tremor is largely a bilateral, symmetrical 
postural or kinetic tremor involving hands and forearms that is visible and persistent.  Additional 
or isolated tremor of the head or lower limbs may occur, but in the absence of abnormal 
posturing ( Deuschl 1998 , Habib -ur-Rehman 2000 ).  The onset of tremor has a bimodal 
distribution, with onset between [ADDRESS_6362] plays a key role in ET ( McAuley 2000 ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]  2003 ; 
Elble  2009, Schnitzler 2009 , Deuschl 2009 ).  Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the 
ventral intermediate nucleus and of the subthalamic nucleus improve ET ( Deuschl 2011 , 
Zappia  2013 , Rajput 2014 ).  Microscopic cerebellar pathology has been identified, includ ing 
gliosis, Purkinje cell loss, and increased torpedoes (swellings) in the Purkinje cell axons 
(Louis  2007 , Axelrad 2008 , Shill 2008 , Louis 2009 ).  Activation studies wit h positron emission 
tomography  indicate abnormally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the cerebellum both at 
rest and when tremor is provoked by [CONTACT_7224] ( Boecker  1994 , Wills  1996 ).   
Essential tremor is associated with impaired γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA )ergic function (and 
consequent hyperactivity) in the cerebellum  (Málly 1996 , Bucher 1997, Louis 2007, Louis 2008 , 
Paris -Robidas 2012 ).  γ-aminobutyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system (CNS), is released from GABAergic neurons and binds to several types of 
GABA receptors ( γ-amin obutyric acid -ligand gated chloride channel [ GABA A] and 
γ-aminobutyric acid -G protein -coupled [ GABA B]) on target neurons.  γ -aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, 
are macromolecular proteins that form a chloride ion channel complex and contain specific 
binding sites for GABA and a number of allosteric regulators, including barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.    
Drugs acting on GABA A receptors, such  as primidone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] , or ethanol decrease  
tremor amplitude , suggesting that altered GABAergic neurotransmission is involved in ET.  
Postmortem analysis revealed a 35% reduction of GABA A receptors and a 22% to 31% reduction 
of GABA B receptors in t he dentate nucleus of cerebella of ET subjects ( Paris -Robidas 2012 ).  
Reduced levels of G ABA in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_7145] 
(Málly  1996 ).  Moreover, toxins such as aflatrem, penitrem A , or harmaline have been proposed 
to induce  tremor in rodents by [CONTACT_7173] ( Cavanagh 1998 ; Miwa 2007 ), 
and targeted deletion of the α1 subunit of GABA A receptor in knockout mice exhibits a 
15 to 19 Hz action tremor, similar to ET in humans ( Kralic 2005 ).   
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6363] by [CONTACT_7225] ( Louis 2012, Benito -Leon 2007, Pahapi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 1999 ).  First-line treatments 
for ET include the anticonvulsant primidone and the β -adrenergic blocker propranolol 
(Gorman  1986 ).  Like primidone, gabapentin is an  anticonvulsant found to be effective in the 
treatment of ET (O’Brien 1981 ; Gironell  1999 ).  The oldest treatment for ET is ethanol, which 
temporarily ameliorates tremor  and is freq uently used by [CONTACT_7175] -medicate; however, 
chronic use of ethanol for tremor  management carries the known risks  of alcohol dependence and 
overuse ( Pahwa 2003 ).   
These treatments are moderately effective, reducing, though not resolving, tremor amplitudes in  
about 50% of the subjects  (Schmouth 2014 ).  In addition, one out of three patients  abandon  
treatment because of side  effects or poor efficacy ( Louis 2010 ), illustrating that with few feasible  
treatment options and a range of handicaps in daily living  makes ET an area of high unmet  
medical need.    
5.2. SAGE -217 Oral Solution  
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA A receptor and thus is expected to be 
of benefit for the treatment of ET.  Unlike benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_7113] γ -subunit -
containing subset of GABA A receptors ( Pritchett 1989 , Esmaeili 2009 ), SAGE -[ADDRESS_6364] a wider range of activity 
(Belelli 2002 ). 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution 6 mg/mL (40% w/w aqueous hydroxy propyl -β-cyclodextrin [ HPβCD] 
with 0.025 mg/mL sucralose) is a nonviscous, clear solution.   
5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Experience with SAGE -217 
5.3.1.  Nonclinical Studies with SAGE -217 
In nonclinical studies of SAGE -217, sedative -hypnotic effects were consistently observed at 
highe r doses in both in vivo pharmacology studies as well as in toxicology studies.  The 
sedative -hypnotic impairments seen with SAGE -217 were typi[INVESTIGATOR_7114] A positive 
modulators, ranging from hyperexcitability and ataxia at the lower doses through deep sedat ion 
and ultimately anesthesia at higher doses.  Depth and duration of sedation demonstrated a clear 
dose response over the range tested, with evidence of tolerance occurring with continued 
exposure.   Tolerance to the effects of SAGE -217 on motor incoordina tion was not observed after 
7 days of dosing.   
The compound has been assessed in 14 -day rat and dog toxicology studies with daily 
administration of SAGE -217 as a solution in HP βCD in dogs and Labrasol® in rats.  The no 
observed adverse effect level was 3 mg/kg (females) and 22. 5 mg/kg (males) in rats and 
2.5 mg/kg in dogs.  There were no adverse effects in dogs or rats in the main toxicology studies.  
A single observation of mortality occurred in one female rat at the high dose in a toxicokinetic 
study whi ch was suspected to have been related to exaggerated pharmacology.  Additional 
toxicology and pharmacology information is provided in the Investigat or’s Brochure .

 26  5.3.2.  Clinical Experience  
To date, two clinical studies employing SAGE -217 are clinically complete  and final clinical 
study reports are pending .  Discussions of pharmacokinetic (PK) data are limited to the single -
ascending dose , food, and essential tremor cohorts from Study 217 -CLP-101 and the multiple -
ascending dose and drug -drug interaction ( DDI) cohorts from Study [ADDRESS_6365]-in-human, four-part study t hat assessed the effects of a single 
dose of SAGE -217.  The study was a double -blind, placebo -controlled, single -ascending dose 
design in healthy adult volunteers, with the objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD ) and PK profiles of SAGE -217 Oral Solution.  Subjects in each of the single -ascending 
dose cohorts received a single dose of study drug, either SAGE -217 (six subjects) or placebo 
(two subjects), with SAGE -217 doses of 0.25 mg, 0.75 mg, 2 mg, 5.5  mg, 11 mg, 22 mg, 44 mg, 
55 mg , and 66 mg.  Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data 
were reviewed by [CONTACT_7244] ( SRC ) and agreement reached that it was safe to 
increase the dose.  The MTD was determined to be 55 mg.  Two cohorts, 6 subjects e ach 
received SAGE -217 in an open -label manner (one cohort received 50% of the MTD [22 mg] to 
study the food effects and the other cohort received the MTD [55 mg] to study the effects on 
subjects with essential tremor ).  SAGE -[ADDRESS_6366] ( 0.25 mg) through the highest ( 66 mg) dose , and supported  once daily oral 
dosing  with food .   
Study 217 -CLP-102 was a two -part study that assessed the effects of multiple -ascending doses of 
SAGE -217.  The study was a double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple -ascending dose study in 
healthy adult volunteers.  Subjects in each of the multiple -ascending dose cohorts received study 
drug, either SAGE -217 (nine subjects) or placebo (three subjects), on ce daily for 7 days, with 
SAGE -217 doses of 15  mg, 30 mg, and 35  mg.  Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only 
after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7245].  The MTD was determined to be 30 mg.  It was observed that subjects 
receiving the drug in the evening  did better in terms of tolerability compared to when they 
received the drug in the morning .  A fourth cohort of 12 subjects received 30 mg of SAGE -217 
in an open -label manner to stu dy drug -drug interactions.  SAGE -217 is not likely to induce the 
metabolism of CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates.  SAGE -217 was orally bioavailable and suitable 
for once daily oral dosing at night time with food.   
SAGE -217 was generally well tolerated.  In both  Phase 1 studies ( 217-CLP-101 and  
217-CLP-102), doses were escalated until the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7115].  Most adverse events 
were reported as mild or moderate in intensity, and there were no serious adverse events reported 
in either study.  In addition , none of the observed adverse events resulted in discontinuation of 
the study drug.  At doses planned for further study, the observed sedation was mild, transient, 
and associated with daily peak exposure.  The most common treatment -emergent adverse events  
were sedation, somnolence, dizziness, euphoric mood, fatigue, tremor, and muscle twitching, 
reported most frequently in the highest dose group (66 mg).  Some changes in mean blood 
pressure and heart rate were observed after single doses of 44 mg and great er.  After multiple 
doses of 30 mg (AM or PM) or 35 mg (PM) over [ADDRESS_6367] .  Thus, the potential benefits in this population are unknown, although 
the risks are likely to be similar to those mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure .  Many 
compounds that target the GABA A receptors exhibit clinical efficacy in ET, validating this 
receptor as a therapeutic target.  Given the promising SAGE -[ADDRESS_6368] vs tolerability 
(adverse events), specifically sedation.  Each subject will start with an initial dose of [ADDRESS_6369] the 10 mg 
dose for a minimum of 3 days will qualify for the randomization phase (Part B).  Given the high 
medical need and potential for benefit in ET, there is a favorable benefit -risk evaluation to 
investigate SAGE -[ADDRESS_6370] t he potential to mitigate risk.  From a benefit/risk 
perspective, the appropriate measures are being taken in order to ensure the safety of the subjects 
who will be enrolled.    
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6371] of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on the change in tremor severity.    
The primary endpoint of this study is the change from randomization (Day 8) in the 
accelerometer -based Kinesia  kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from 
both sides of the body) at Day 14.    
6.2. Secondary O bjectives  
The secondary obje ctives of the study are to compare the effect of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on th e following endpoints:  
1. Tremor severity as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day  8) in the 
accelerometer -based Kinesia  upper limb total score (ie, the sum of forward outstretched 
postural tremor, lateral “wing beating” postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores 
across both sides of the body) and individual item scores at Day 14.  
2. Tremor severity as measured by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in TRG  
Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) upper limb total score (ie, the sum 
of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS upper limb item 
scores at Day 14.  
3. Tremor severity as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores measured at Day 14.  
4. Safety and tolerability as as sessed by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters, and suicidal ideation using the Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ), and adverse event reporting.    
5. Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/sedation as assessed by [CONTACT_7261]/S scores.  
6. Mood as assessed by [CONTACT_7219] -Lader visual analogue score ( VAS ) Mood Scale.  
7. How the subject feels after taking the study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_7228] (DEQ -5) ratings.  
In addition, plasma concentrations of SAGE -[ADDRESS_6372] time point (AUC 0-t), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity 
(AUC 0-∞), maximum plasma concentrat ion (C max), time to reach maximum concentration (t max), 
and terminal half -life (t 1/2), will be derived, where appropriate.   
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6373] of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on:  
1. Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) as assessed by [CONTACT_7229] E 4.  Tremor oscillation as assessed by [CONTACT_7230] (ie, raw accelerometer values).  
2. Quality of life (QOL) as assessed by [CONTACT_7164] (ADL), Quality of 
Life in Essenti al Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) , and v ideo recording assessment of 
subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, 
and one additional task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis).  
In addition, PK and pharmacodynamic modelling asse ssment of the relationship between plasma 
exposure of SAGE -[ADDRESS_6374] awal  design.  Subjects will be exposed to study drug 
(SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6375] dose.   
During the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), after signing the info rmed consent form (ICF), 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and the severity of each subject’s ET will be 
evaluated using TETRAS.   Eligible s ubjects will be admitted to the clinical study unit on Day -1.   
The study will be conducted in two parts : 
 Part A:  Beginning on Day 1, a ll subjects will receive open -label SAGE -217 in the 
morning with food (as outlined in Section  9.2) for 7 days.  Subjects will receive 
SAGE -217 10 mg on Day 1, SAGE -217 20 mg on Day 2, and SAGE -217 30 mg from 
Day 3 to Day 7 , with dose adjustments for severe adverse events judged by [CONTACT_7181]  (Section  9.3).  Subjects will be confined on 
Day -1 through Day 3.   
 Part B:  In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a maximum 
dose of ≥[ADDRESS_6376] responded to SAGE -217, 
defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score 
predose on Day 8.  Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 
SAGE -217 in the m orning or in the  evening or to receive placebo  for 7 days 
beginning on Day 8 .  All doses of study drug will be administered with food  as 
outlined in Section  9.2.  Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part A.   In order to preserve the blind, those 
randomized to SAGE -217 in the morning will receive placebo in the evening, those 
randomized to receive SAGE -217 in the evening will receive placebo in the morning, 
and those randomized to receive placebo will receive placebo in both morning and 
evening.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent randomiz ed 
withdrawal (ie, withdrawal from treatment they received in Part  A).  Subjects will be 
confined on Day [ADDRESS_6377] dose and continued for the remainder of th e open -label dosing period (ie,  subjects 
who are unable to tolerate SAGE -217 30 mg will receive SAGE -217 20 mg and subjects who are 
unable to tolerate SAGE -217 20 mg will receive SAGE -217 10 mg).  The dose tolerated on 
Days  5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6378].  Subjects who 
require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, and 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.

 31  7.2. Blinding and Randomization  
Part A is open -label with no control group ; therefore , there will be no randomization or blinding.   
Part B of  the study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal study.  Subjects 
who tolerate a maximum dose of ≥10 mg of SAGE -217 in Part A and respond to SAGE -217, 
defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score predose on 
Day 8, will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_6379] of the site number (eg,  “01”) followed by [CONTACT_7262] (eg , 01-001, 01 -002, 01 -003, etc.).   
A randomization schedule will be generated prior to the start of the study.  The randomization 
schedule will be generated using SAS V9.[ADDRESS_6380] may reveal actual solution contents to the 
investigator, who should also al ert Sage of the emergency (see  Section  13.6 for more details 
related to unblinding).  In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, 
pertinent information (including the reason for unblinding) must be document ed in the subject’s 
records and on the electronic case report fo rm (eCRF) .  If the subject or study center personnel 
(other than pharmacist) have been unblinded, the subject will be terminated from the study.   
In order to preserve the blind  in Part B , those randomized to SAGE -217 morning  dosing will 
receive placebo for the evening  dose, those randomized to SAGE -217 evening  dosing will 
receive placebo for the morning  dose, and those randomized to placebo will receive placebo for 
both morning  and evening  dosing.  Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part A.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent 
randomized withdrawal (withdrawal from treatment they received in Part A).

Part B; subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6396] tolerate a maximum dose of ≥[ADDRESS_6397] responded to SAGE -217, defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in 
TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of 
the body) predose on Day 8.   
8.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
If there is an adverse event or medical reason for the withdrawal, the subject should be followed 
medically until the condition has either resolved itself or is stable.  Details of the reason for 
withdrawal shoul d be recorded in the subject’s case report form ( CRF ).   
Subjects who withdraw should, if possible, have a follow -up examination, including a physical 
examination, the appropriate investigations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests , as outlined 
for the Day 21 visit ( Table  3).  All details of this follow -up examination should be recorded in 
the subject’s medical source documents.   
8.4.1.  Study Drug Withdrawal  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary.  Subjects are free to discontinue the study at any 
time without giving their reason(s).   
A subject must be withdrawn from the study treatment in the event of any of the following:  
 Withdrawal of the subject’s consent;  
 New onset of a condition that would have met exclusion criterion, is clinically 
relevant and affects the subject’s safety, and discontinuation is considered necessary 
by [CONTACT_7183]/Sponsor;  
 Occurrence of intolerable advers e event s;  
 Occurrence of pregnancy;   
 Intake of nonpermitted concomitant medication;  
 Subject noncompliance;  
 Significant protocol deviation determined in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6398]’s source documents.    
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if there is concern for the subj ect’s safety or it is 
determined that the subject is no longer a qualified participant.  Any subject who is withdrawn 
from the study for any reason is to have the final visit assessments performed.   
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study wi ll be replaced only if they withdraw 
prior to dosing.  Subjects who are withdrawn from the study, fail to return or are no longer 
qualified will not be replaced.    
8.4.2.  Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons, including the occurrence of adverse events or other findings suggesting unacceptable 
risk to subjects, or for administrative reasons.  In the event of study termination, Sage 
Therapeutics will provide written notif ication to the Investigator. Investigational sites must 
promptly notify their Institutional Review Board (IRB) and initiate withdrawal procedures for 
participating subjects.

evening (every 12 hours) with food during Part B.  Food in take was standardized as specified by 
[CONTACT_1034].   
9.2.1.  Part A  
Subjects participating in Part A of the study will take study drug (SAGE -217) in an open -label 
manner.  All subjects will start on a 10 mg dose of study drug administered with food in the 
morning on Day  1.  Subjects will receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 and 30 mg with food daily 
on Days 3 to 7.  Dose adjustments will only be allowed any time the dose is not tolerated, 
assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7263] ( Section  9.3).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6400].   
9.2.2.  Part B  
Subjects participating in the double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal portion of 
the study (Part B) will be randomized to SAGE -217 morning  dosing , SAGE -217 evening  dosing , 
or placebo.  Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive the maxim um dose of SAGE -217 
from Part A of the study.  Following randomization, subjects will receive 7  days of study drug 
starting on Day  8.   
9.3. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open -label phas e of the study (Part A).  If at 
any time the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event 
judged by [CONTACT_7185], the dose on the next day will be reduced to 
the next lowest dose and cont inued for the remainder of the open -label dosing period (ie, subjects 
who are unable to tolerate the 30 mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who 
are unable to tolerate 20 mg will be given a 10 mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, [ADDRESS_6401].  
Subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, and 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.

medications/treatments taken within 2 weeks prior to informed consent and throughout the study.   
The charts of all study participants will be reviewed for new concomitant medications through 
discharge from the unit.  Chart reviews will include examination of nursing and physician 
progress notes, vital signs , and medication records in order to identify adverse events  that may be 
associated with new concomitant medications.  New concomitant medications, ongoing 
concomitant medications with a change in dose and medical procedures ordered (eg, laboratory 
assessments,  computed to mography  or magnetic resonance imag ing scans ) will be reviewed to 
determine if they are associated with an adverse event not previously identified.    
9.4.2.  Prohibited Medications  
The drug classes listed in Appendix  1 are not permitted in the 14 days prior to the admission visit 
and for the duration of the study (up to the Day 2 8 visit).  The list provides non-exhaustive 
examples of each drug class.   
Subjec ts are not permitted to use alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine within [ADDRESS_6403].  The Investigator(s) or designee 
will record the time and dose of study drug administration in the source documents.  Any reasons 
for non -compliance will also be documented, including:  
 Missed visits;  
 Interruptions in the schedule of administration; and 
 Nonpermitted medications.

While confined in the clinical unit  (Day -1 through Day 3) , subjects in Part A will receive a 
10 mg dose of study drug administered in the morning on Day  1, 20 mg on Day 2 , and 30  mg on 
Day 3.   
While confined in the clinical unit in Part B  (Day 7 through Day 10) , subjects will receive 
randomized study  drug in the morning and in the evening on Days 8, 9, and 10.   
For non -confinement days (Days 4 through 6 [Part A ] and Day s 11 through 14  [Part B ]), dosing 
will be done at the clinical site or, if suitable arrangements can be made , via home administration  
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6406] the 
study drug was intended (ie, record subject initials and birth date or other unique identifier).   
At the end of the study, any unused study drug will be retained or returned to the Sponso r for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the Sponsor’s directions; disposition of study drug will be 
documented.    
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6407] symptom response by a measurement of 
tremor amplitude, TETRAS upp er limb subscale , and TETRAS Performance Subscale (items 4, 
6, 7, and 8).  Quality -of-life assessments include TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording 
of subjects performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous 
system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate 
monitoring ) and tremor oscillation as assessed by [CONTACT_7192] 
(ie, raw accelerometer values) will be assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
11.1. Measurements of Tremor Amplitude  
In order to measure essential tremor amplitude, subjects will wear a wireless ring motion sensor.  
The motion sensor measures linear acceleration and angular velocity (the Kinesia  score).  
Amplitudes from the motion sensor  data are collected for three upper limb maneuvers (postural 
tremor, wing beating, kinetic tremor) on each side of the body, for a total of six amplitude 
measures per assessment.  Data are transmitted from the sensor to a computer using Bluetooth 
technolog y.  Information from the motion sensor data correlates to symptoms of tremor. The 
Kinesia  score ranges from 0 to 4 in 0.5 step increments.  Higher scores indicate more tremor s.  
The accelerometer assessment is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Perfo rmance 
Subscale Item 4.    
In Part A, Kinesia will be performed at screening  and on Day -1 (Admission; three assessments 
separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes) ; a single assessment will be performed  predose and 2, 12, and 
14 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, and 7.  In Part  B, a single Kinesia reading will be performed 
before morning  dose, after morning  dose ([ADDRESS_6408] morning  dose), before evening  dose 
([ADDRESS_6409] morning  dose), and after evening  dose ([ADDRESS_6410] morning  dose) on Days 8, 9, 
and 14, and on Da y 21.   
11.2. TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) 
Performance Scale  
Item #4 (upper limb tremor) of the TETRAS Performance Subscale will be completed using both 
the accelerometer and clinician assessment.  Testing should be completed within ±10 minutes of 
the planned questionnaire time points.  All three tests in the upper limb tremor series of 
assessments (Item 4) will be completed for both arms, first for the RIGHT arm and then for the 
LEFT.  For each test, the maximum score is four, with a res ulting maximum score of 24.   
Predose assessments can be done any time within 2 hours prior to the start of administration of 
solution .  The Day 21 follow -up visit assessments can be done at any time during the visit.  
Subjects will complete the TETRAS Perf ormance Subscale, Item #4 (upper limb tremor) while 
wearing the accelerometer.  Simultaneous clinician assessment of Item #4 will occur.  The 
accelerometer assessment is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Performance Subscale 
at the same time points during the study.    
In Part A, t he TETRAS upper limb subscale will be performed at screening  and on Day  -1 
(Admission; three assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes) ; a single assessment of 
TETRAS upper limb subscale will be performed predose and 2, 12, and 14  hours postdose on 
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 42  Days 1, 2, and 7.  The TETRAS (all ADL  and Performance Subscale [Items 4, 6, 7, and 8] ) will 
be performed on Day -1 (Admission)  and predose on Day 7.  On days when the TETRAS all 
ADL and Performance Subscale are performed, Item # 4 will not be repeated.   
In Part B, the TETRAS upper limb subscale will be before morning  dose, after morning dose 
([ADDRESS_6411] morning  dose), before evening  dose ([ADDRESS_6412] morning  dose), and after 
evening  dose ([ADDRESS_6413] morning  dose) on Days 8, 9, and 14, and on Day 21.  Item 4c 
(kinetic tremor) of the TETRAS upper limb subscale will be performed after morning dose 
([ADDRESS_6414] morning dose) on Days 8 and 9.  The TETRAS (all ADL and Performance 
Subscale [Items 4, 6, 7, a nd 8]) will be performed predose (morning and evening doses) on Day 
14 and on Day 21.  On days when the TETRAS all ADL and Performance Subscale are 
performed, Item # [ADDRESS_6415] be ≥2 on each side  (left and right) for kinetic tremor and ≥2 on 
each side (left and right) for either wing beating or forward outstretched postural tremor .  A copy 
of the TETRAS is provided in Appendix  2.   
11.3. Empatica Wristband E4  
Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperat ure monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) will be  assessed by [CONTACT_7229] E4.  The Empatica Wristband E4  is a wearable device that captures  
motion -based activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal .  In Part A,  the Empatica 
Wristband E4 will  be wor n during the Confinement Period .  In Part  B, the Empa tica 
Wristband  E4 will be worn during the Confinement Period and will be removed prior to 
discharge from the unit on Day 10.  The Empatica device will be worn during the corresponding 
3-hour postdose TETRAS upper limb subscale (Item 4c [kinetic tremor]) assessments.  Data 
from the Empatica Wristband E4 will not be presented in the study report; instead, they will be 
part of a separate report.   
11.4. Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST)  
The QUEST is a brief, 30 -item, ET -specific QOL scale in which subjects rate the extent to which 
tremor impacts a function or state, tremor severity in various body parts, perceived health, and 
overall QOL (Tröster 2005 ).  The QUEST will be administered on Day -1 (Admission) , Day  7, 
and on Day 14.  A copy of the QUEST is provi ded in Appendix  3.   
11.5. Video Recording  
Videos of subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, 
and one addit ional task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis ) will be taken 
on Day -1 (Admissio n) and  predose on Day 7  in Part A  and predose (morning and evening 
doses) on Day 14 and on Day 21  in Part B .

Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical 
laboratory measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage, C -SSRS, SSS, 
MOAA/S scores, and adverse event reporting.  The Bond -Lader Mood Rating Scale and a 
DEQ -5 will be used to assess mood and perception of drug effects, res pectively.   
13.1.1.  Demographic/Medical History  
Age, gender, race, and ethnic origin will be recorded at the Screening Visit.  A full medical 
history including medication history will be recorded at the Screening Visit.   
13.1.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ( supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes prior to the measurement) and standing 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7146].   
In Part A, v ital signs and pulse oximetry will be performed at screening (vital signs only) and 
Day -1 (Admission), predose on Day 1 and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 24 hours postdose on 
Days 1, 2, and 3, and predose on Days 5, 6, and 7 .  In Part B, for morning dose, vital signs (both

Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 45  13.1.6.  Laboratory Assessments  
In Part A, b lood and urine samples will be collected for hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis at the Screening Visit, on Day -1 (Admis sion), predose on Day 1, and pre dose on 
Day 2.  In Part  B, blood and urine samples will be collected predose (morning and evening 
doses) on Day 8, Day 9, and on Day 21.   
Serum and u rine samples for pregnancy tests (females only) will also be collected.  These 
assessments should be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Events ( Table 2 and 
Table  3) and as outlined individually below.   
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7194], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal,  clinically significant 
(CS).  Screening results considered abnormal, CS recorded at the Screening Visit may make the 
subject ineligible for the study pending review by [CONTACT_7195].  Clinical laboratory 
results that are abnormal, CS during the stud y but within normal range at baseline and/or indicate 
a worsening from baseline will be considered adverse event s, assessed according to 
Section  13.2.1 , and recorded in the eCRF.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hematology  
Hematology tests will include complete blood count, including red blood cells, white blood cells 
with differentiation, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and platelets.   The coagulation panel 
will include activated partial thromboplastin tim e, prothrombin time , and international 
normalized ratio .   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Blood Chemistry  
Serum chemistry tests will include serum electrolytes, renal function tests, including creatinine, 
blood urea nitrogen , bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide , liver function tests, including total 
bilirubin, AST, and ALT , total protein, and albumin.    
Thyroid -stimulating hormone, thyroxine  (T4), and triiodothyronine  (T3) will be performed at 
screening to confirm subject eligibility.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, glucose, ketones, bile, urobilinogen, 
hemoglobin , leukocyte esterase, nitrites, color, turbidity, pH, and specific gravity.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Drugs Screen and Alcohol Test  
A urine sample for assessment of selected drugs (s edative/hypnotics [eg, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]], cotinine, and 
caffeine) and a breath sample for alcohol screen will be collected at screening  and on Day -1.  
Results may be obtained through subject history.  Subjects who use concomitant 
sedative/hypnotics will be excluded from the study.  Use of alcohol, caffeine, or cotinine was not 
allowed for the duration of the study.    
[IP_ADDRESS].  Virus Serology  
Subjects will be screened for hepatitis (HBsAg and anti -HCV) and HIV prior to being enrolled in 
the study.   
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 46  [IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Test 
Fema les of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_7266] -1 (Admission), predose (morning dose) on 
Day 8, and at the follow -up visit on Day 28 in Part B.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hormones and Ex ploratory Biochemistry  
Optional blood sample s will be collected at screening and on D ays [ADDRESS_6419] other biochemical markers as candidates for influencing not only response 
to SAGE -217 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be evaluated.  Thus, 
the biochemical research m ay involve study of additional unnamed biochemical biomarkers, but 
only as related to diseas e susceptibility and drug action.    
[IP_ADDRESS].  Genetic Testing  
Where consent is given, an optional genetic sample for biomarker testing will be collected at the 
Screening Visit.   
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA e xtraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variat ion may influence response 
(ie, distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -217.  Specific genetic variations of 
interest include but are not limited to: classes of m etabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 
supra -family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of 
SAGE -217 (eg, AKR1C4 [3α -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]), genes associated with the 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (eg, GA BRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, 
GABRG1 -3), and genes associated with the production and degradation of GABA.   
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to SAGE -217 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be 
evaluated.  Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene 
categories, but only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action.   
13.1.7.  Columbi a-Suicide Severi ty Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) 
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011 ).  This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post -basel ine evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit.  The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_6420] severe).   
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the subject is showing any suicidal tendency, no further 
study drug will be administered and the subject will be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist 
for further evaluation.  This information  will be tracked.   
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening  (lifetime history and past 
24 months).  In Part A, t he “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed on Day -1 
(Admission), 12 hours postdose on Day 1, predose on Da y 4, and on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, 
the “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed 12 hours postdose (morning and evening 
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 47  doses) on Day  8, predose (morning and evening doses)  on Day 11, and on Days 12, 13, 14, 21, 
and [ADDRESS_6421] Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] ( SSS) 
The SSS is subject -rated scale designed to quickly assess how alert a subjec t is feeling.  Degrees 
of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7138] a scale of [ADDRESS_6422] score of ‘1’ indicates 
the subject is ‘feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake’ and the highest score of ‘7’ indicates the 
subject is ‘no longer fightin g sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream -like thoughts’.    
In Part A, the SS S will be administered predose on Day 1 a nd 1, 2,  3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 
24 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, and 3, and predose only on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, t he SSS 
will be administered predose (morning dose) on Day 8 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 24 hours 
postdose (morning dose) and 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose (evening dose) on Days 8, 9, and 
10, predose (morning and evening doses) only on Days 12, 13, and 14, and on Day 21 .  All time 
points are relative to the time of dosing.  The SSS is to be performed within ±10 minutes of  the 
scheduled times through the 4 -hour time point and within ±15  minutes of the scheduled times 
thereafter.  The SSS is provided in Appendix  5.  The SSS should be performed prior to the 
MOAA/S score.  
13.1.9.  Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ( MOAA/S ) 
The MOAA/S allows exploration of deeper sedation states than the SSS.  If a MOAA/S score of 
3 or less was observed, the score was to be confirmed by [CONTACT_7267] 10 minutes and 
re-administering the MOAA/S assessment.   In Part A, t he MOAA/S assessm ent should be 
conducted after other assessments that are scheduled at the same time point.   In Part A, t he 
MOAA/S will be performed predose on Day 1 and 1, 2,  3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 24  hours postdose 
on Days 1, 2, and 3, predose only on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, t he MOAA/S will be 
performed predose (morning dose) on Day 8 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 24 hours postdose 
(morning dose) and 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose (evening dose) on Days 8, 9, and 10, predose 
(morning and evening doses) only o n Days 12, 13, and 14, and on Day 21 .  The MOAA/S 
assessments will be performed within ±10 minutes of the scheduled times through the 4 -hour 
time point and within ±15 minutes of the scheduled times for the 6 -hour through 24 -hour time 
points.  The MOAA/S is  provided in Appendix  6.   
13.1.10.  Bond -Lader VAS Mood Scale  
Mood will be assessed using the Bond -Lader Mood Rating Scale.  This is a 16 -part self -
administered questionnaire that employs a 100-mm VAS to explore different as pects of self -
reported mood.  In Part A, t he mood scale will be administered predose on Days 1, 2, and 7.  In 
Part B, the mood scale will be administered predose (morning and evening doses) on Days 8, 9, 
14 and 21.  The Bond -Lader Mood Rating Scale is prov ided in Appendix  7.   
13.1.11.  Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ -5) 
A DEQ -5 will be administered as follows:  
1. Do you FEEL a drug effect right now?  
2. Are you HIGH right now?  
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 48  3. Do you DISLIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now?  
4. Do you LIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now?  
5. Would you like MORE of the drug you took, right now?  
The answers are recorded on a 100 -mm VAS , with the answer for e ach being “Not at all” and 
“Extremely” at the extremes.  There will be options to record “Not applicable” for questions 3 
and 4 if no drug effects are felt and for question 5 prior to administration of study medication.   
The DEQ -5 will be perfo rmed 2 hours  postdose on Days 1 and  7 in Part A and 2 hours postdose 
(morning and evening doses) on Days 8 and 14 in Part B.  The DEQ -5 is provided in 
Appendix  8.   
13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected after the ICF has been signed.  Medical conditions that occur 
after the ICF has been signed will be captured on the adverse event eCRF.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
coding system (version 18.1 or higher ).  
13.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medic al condition or the deterioration of 
a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally  related to the product.  In clinical studies, an adverse event 
can include an undesirable med ical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or 
washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of Investigational  New Drug safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event .  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event o ccurring during any study phase  and at any dose of 
the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the following:  
 It results in death  
 It is immediately life -threatening  
 It requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 49   It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed a bove.  
All serious adverse event s that occur after any subject has been enrolled, whether or not they are 
related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_7268]  (from the signing of the ICF through the Day  28 visit [or early 
termination]) . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Recording Sedation as an Adverse Event  
Sedation will be assessed using protocol -specified rating scales.  In order to standardize the 
reporting of sedation as adverse events, Investigators need not record sed ation as an adverse 
event unless there is a score of >5 on the SSS and/or a score of ≤2 on the MOAA/S.  
Consideration should be given to the most appropriate term to describe the sedation 
characteristics.   
13.2.2.  Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring during this stu dy will be reported within [ADDRESS_6423]’s s pouse/partner (if the subject is male and his spouse/partner becomes pregnant) or the 
obstetrician for information about the outcome of the pregnancy, and in the case of a live birth, 
about any congenital abnormalities.  If a congenital abnormality is repo rted, then it should be 
recorded in the source documents and reported a s a serious adverse event .   
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each adverse event (unrelated, possibly related or probably related).  
The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid rea son 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “unrelated.”  If 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the o ccurrence of the adverse event , then the 
adverse event should be considered “related.”    
Not 
Related:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical state.  
Possibly 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the  subject,  but this is not known  for sure.  
Probably 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7269]’s  clinical  
state or other modes  of therapy  administered  to the  subject.  
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 50  If the relationship between the adverse event /serious adverse event  and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable” , the event will be considered to be related 
to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.    
13.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory val ues, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as adverse event s unless they prompt corrective medical action by [CONTACT_3786] , constitute a  serious adverse event  or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
study drug.   
Information about adver se events will be collected from the signing of the ICF through the 
Day 28 visit (or early termination) .  Adverse events that occur after the first administration of 
study drug will be denoted TEAE s.   
All adverse events will be followed until they are res olved or have reached a clinical plateau with 
no expectation of future change.    
The adverse event term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For 
each adverse event , the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and  time), resolution 
or clinical plateau (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and whether or not 
it caused the subject to discontinue the study .   
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
 Mild (awareness of sign o r symptom, but easily tolerated)  
 Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
 Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
13.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse event s (regardless of c ausality) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF 
until the Day  28 visit ([ADDRESS_6424] dose of study drug) or early termination .  Any 
serious adverse event s considered possibly or probably related to the investigational product and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  All serious adverse 
event s must be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee immediately by [CONTACT_7270] [ADDRESS_6425] complete, sign 
and date the serious adverse event  pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the 
serious adverse event pages with the corresponding  source documents, and send a copy to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee.    
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should be sent to Sage Therapeutics 
or designee within 24 hours of receipt ; a follow -up serious adverse event  form should be 
completed and placed with the original serious adverse event  information and kept with the 
appropriate section of the study file.    
Sage Therapeutics or designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events.  It is the  Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all serious 
Protocol 217-ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
Version 2.0 28 October 2016  
 51  adverse event s that occur at his or her site if applicable per the IRB’s requirements.  Investigators 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) 
that occur during the clinical study .  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB of these 
additional serious adverse event s.   
13.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug (Part B)  
Part B is a double -blind study.  The pharmacist responsible for preparing the solutions will be 
unblinded and will retain an official paper copy of the randomization schedule.  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study tr eatment received.  Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_7236] a subject.  Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administ ered to study subjects must be discussed with the Sponsor.  If the unblinding occurs 
without the Sponsor’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible 
and no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a  premature 
unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, any request for the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to the Sponsor 
and approved by [CONTACT_7251], according to standard operating procedures .  
The blinding of the study will be broken after the database has been locked.  Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_7147] t o allow for limited analysis of samples from subjects receiving placebo.    
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information must 
be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF.  If the subject or study center personnel 
(other than pharmacist) have been unblinded, the subject will be terminated from the study.   
Protocol 217-ETD -[ADDRESS_6426] of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma 
concentrations for PK evaluations.   
14.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data .  All subjects will be used in the analyses, as

15.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a repres entative of Sage 
Therapeutics or designee will visit the investigational study site to:   
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities ; and  
 Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the r esponsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or designee or its 
representatives.  This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between 
Sage Therapeutics and the Investigator.    
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or designee will have regul ar contacts with 
the investigational site for the following:  
 Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) ; 
 Confirm that facilities remain acceptable ; 
 Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accuratel y recorded in the CRF s, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed ; 
 Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF s 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and oth er records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
subject  (eg, clinic charts);  
 Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics or 
designee ; and 
 Confirm adverse event s and serious adverse event s have been properly documented 
on CRFs and confirm any serious adverse event s have been forwarded to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee and those serious adverse event s that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.    
The m onitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.

SAGE -217 
Title of Study: A Phase 2a, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 Oral Solution in the 
Treatment of Subjects with Essential Tremor (ET)  
Study center(s):  Up to 30 centers  
Phase of development: 2a 
Methodology:  
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of SAGE -217 Oral Solution.   
There are two parts:  
Part A : Open -label with morning dosing (7 days). 
All subjects will start on a 10 mg dose of study drug administered with food in the morning  on Day 1.  
Subjects will receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 and 30 mg with food daily on Days 3 to 7.   
Part B : Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal with morning and evening dosing 
(7 days).  
In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a subject must tolerate a maximum dose of at least [ADDRESS_6449] responded to SAGE-217, defined as a 30% reduction from 
baseline in the TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale  (TETRAS ) kinetic tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) on Day 7.    
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to SAGE -217 morning dosing, SAGE-217 
evening dosing, or placebo.  In order to preserve the blind, those randomized to SAGE-217 morning 
dosing will receive placebo for the evening dose, those randomized to SAGE-217 evening dosing will 
receive placebo for the morning dose, and those randomized to placebo will receive placebo for both 
morning an d evening dosing.  Subjects randomized to SAGE- 217 will receive their maximum dose  as 
determined in Part A.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent randomized withdrawal 
(withdrawal from treatment they received in Part A).  Subjects will be administered study drug with 
meals in the morning and in the evening for 7 consecutive days.   
  
Protocol 217- ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics

Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open-label phase of the study (Part A).  If at any time 
the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7185], the dose on the next day will be reduced to the next lowest dose 
and continued for the remainder of the open-label dosing period (ie, subjects who are unable to tolerate 
the 30 mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who are unable to tolerate 20 m g will 
be given a 10 mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6450].  Subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 
5, 6, and 7 of Part A will not progress to Pa rt B.   
Subjects will be exposed to study drug (SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6451] dose.   
Assessments will be performed periodically during the study as outlined in th e Schedule of Events 
(Table 2 ).   
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE-217 
Oral Solution to placebo on the change in tremor severity.   
Secon dary:  
The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the effect of 7 days administration of SAGE-217 
Oral Solution to placebo on the following endpoints: 
• Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the accelerometer -based  
Kinesia upper limb total score (ie, the sum of forward outstretched postural tremor, lateral "wing 
beating" postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores across both sides of the body) and 
individual item scores at Day 14.   
• Tremor severity, as measured  by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in the TETRAS upper 
limb total score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS 
upper limb item scores at Day 14.   
• Tremor severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in TETRAS Performance Subscale scores measured at Day 14.   
• Safety and tolerability, as assessed by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and suicidal ideation using the Columbia- Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS), and adverse event reporting.   
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/sedation, as assessed by [CONTACT_7242][INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS) and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores.

Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Transducer measurement of tremor amplitude using an accelerometer and TETRAS Performance 
Subscale.  Quality -of-life will be evaluated using the TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording of 
subjects performing three everyday tasks.  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone 
as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring,  and heart rate monitoring ) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.   
Pharmacokinetics : 
Plasma will be collected to assay for concentrations of SAGE -217 and may be assayed for  SAGE -217 
metabolites, if deemed necessary.  The following PK parameters will be derived from the plasma concentrations (where evaluable): AUC
0-t, AUC 0-∞, C max, tmax, and t ½.   
Safety  and Tolerability : 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory 
measures, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication usage,  C-SSRS, SSS, MOAA/S 
scores, and adverse event reporting.  The Bond-Lader Mood Rating Scale and a DEQ -5 will be used to 
assess mood and perception of drug effects, res pectively .   
Statistical methods:  
Study Populations 
The safety population is defined as all subjects who are administered study drug.   
The efficacy population will consist of all subjects in the safety population who complete at least one 
dose in Part B and have at least one post-randomization efficacy evaluation.   
The evaluable population will consist of all randomized subjects with at least one post-randomization 
Kinesia assessment.    
The PK population will consist of all subjects in the safety population with sufficient plasma 
concentrations for PK evaluations.   
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data (including change from randomization values for accelerometer -derived Kinesia and 
clinician -rated TETRAS scores) will be summarized using appropriate descriptiv e statistics and listed 
by [CONTACT_1130].   
The change from randomization (Day 8) in the accelerometer- based Kinesia kinetic tremor combined 
score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) at Day [ADDRESS_6467].  Wherever necessary and appropriate, PK parameters will be dose-adjusted to account for 
individual differences in dose.   
  
Protocol 217- ETD -201 Sage Therapeutics  
 10  Safety Analysis  
Adver se events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities™.  The overall 
incidence of adverse events will be displayed by [CONTACT_1196], preferred term, and dose group.  
Incidence of adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_7276].  
Data from vital signs, clinical laboratory measures, ECG, and C -SSRS will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_7169], where applicable.  Continuous endpoints will be summarized with 
n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  In addition, change from baseline 
values will be calculated at each time point and will be summarized using the same summary statistics.  Out-of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where applica ble.  For all categorical 
endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.    
Sample Size  
Up to [ADDRESS_6468] 60 randomized subjects for Part B.  A total sample size of 51 evaluable subjects (ie, 17 per g roup) will have 80% power to detect a difference in 
means of 3.[ADDRESS_6469] with a 0.05 two- sided significance level.  Assuming a 15% non- evaluability rate, 
20 subjects per group will be randomized.  The number of subjects in each treatment group is also 
thought to be sufficient to assess preliminary safety and tolerability following multiple doses of SAGE -217 Oral Solution.

 23  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Essential Tremor and Unmet Medical Need  
Essential tremor  (ET)  is among the most common neurological diseases, with an overall 
prevalence of 0.9%.  Prevalence increases with age and is estimat ed to be 4.6% in people over 
65 years of age (Louis 2010, Deuschl 2011).   Essential tremor is largely a bilateral, symmetrical 
postural or kinetic tremor involving hands and forearms that is visible and persistent.  Additional 
or isolated tremor of the head or lower limbs may occur, but in the absence of abnormal posturing ( Deuschl 1998, Habib -ur-Rehman 2000) .  The onset of tremor has a bimodal 
distribution, with onset between [ADDRESS_6483] plays a key role in ET (McAuley 2000; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]  2003; 
Elble  2009, Schnitzler 2009, Deuschl 2009).  Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the 
ventral  intermediate nucleus and of the subthalamic nucleus improve ET ( Deuschl 2011, 
Zappia 2013, Rajput 2014).  Microscopic cerebellar pathology has been identified, including 
gliosis, Purkinje cell loss, and increased torpedoes (swellings) in the Purkinje cell axons (Louis 2007, Axelrad 2008, Shill 2008, Louis 2009).  Activation studies with positron emission 
tomography indicate  abnormally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the cerebellum both at 
rest and when  tremor is provoked by [CONTACT_7224] (Boecker  1994, Wills  1996).   
Essential tremor is associated with impaired γ-aminobutyric acid  (GABA)ergic function (and 
consequent hyperactivity) in the cerebellum ( Málly 1996, Bucher 1997, Louis 2007, Louis 2008, 
Paris -Robidas 2012).   γ-aminobutyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system (CNS), is released from GABAergic neurons and binds to several types of GABA receptors ( γ-aminobutyric acid -ligand gated chloride channel [ GABA
A] and 
γ-aminobutyric acid -G protein-coupled [ GABA B]) on target neurons.  γ- aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel  receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain , 
are macromolecular proteins that form a chloride ion channel complex and contain specific 
binding sites for GABA and a number of allosteric regulators, including barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.   
Drugs acting on GABA A receptors, such as primidone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], or ethanol decrease 
tremor amplitude , suggesting that altered GABAergic neurotransmission is involved in ET.  
Postmortem analysis revealed a 35% reduction of GABA A receptors and a 22% to 31% reduction 
of GABA B receptors in the dentate nucleus of cerebella of ET subjects ( Paris -Robidas 2012).   
Reduced levels of G ABA in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_7112] 
(Málly 1996 ).  Moreover, toxins such as aflatrem, penitrem A , or harmaline have been proposed 
to induce tremor in rodents by [CONTACT_7173] ( Cavanagh 1998; Miwa 2007), 
and targeted deletion of the α1 subunit of GABA A receptor  in knockout mice exhibits a 
15 to  19 Hz action tremor, similar to ET in humans (Kralic 2005).    
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6484] by [CONTACT_7225] ( Louis 2012, Benito-Leon 2007, Pahapi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 1999).   First -line treatments 
for ET include the anticonvulsant primidone and the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol (Gorman 
1986).  Like primidone, gabapentin is an anticonvulsant found to be effective in the treatment of 
ET (O’Brien 1981; Gironell 1999).   The oldest treatment for ET is ethan ol, which temporarily 
ameliorates tremor  and is freq uently used by [CONTACT_7175]- medicate; however, chronic use of 
ethanol for tremor management carries the known risks of alcohol dependence and over use 
(Pahwa 2003).    
These treatments are moderately ef fective, reducing, though not resolving, tremor amplitudes in 
about 50% of the subjects ( Schmouth 2014).  In addition, one out of three patients  abandon 
treatment because of side  effects or poor efficacy (Louis 2010) , illustrating that with few feasible  
treatment options and a range of handicaps in daily living makes ET an area of high unmet 
medical need.    
5.2. SAGE -217 Oral Solution  
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA A receptor and thus is expected to be 
of benefit for the treatment of ET.  Unlike benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_7113] γ -subunit-
containing subset of GABA A receptors ( Pritchett 1989, Esmaeili 2009) , SAGE -[ADDRESS_6485] a wider range of activity 
(Belelli 20 02). 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution 6 mg/mL (40% w/w aqueous h ydroxyl propyl -β-cyclodextrin [HPβCD] 
with 0.025 mg/mL sucralose) is a nonviscous, clear solution.   
5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Experience with SAGE -217 
5.3.1. Nonclinical Studies with SAGE -217 
In nonc linical studies of SAGE -217, sedative- hypnotic effects were consistently observed at 
higher doses in both in vivo pharmacology studies as well as in toxicology studies.  The 
sedative- hypnotic impairments seen with SAGE -217 were typi[INVESTIGATOR_7114] A positive 
modulators, ranging from hyperexcitability and ataxia at the lower doses through deep sedation 
and ultimately anesthesia at higher doses.  Depth and duration of sedation demonstrated a clear 
dose response over the range tested, with evidence of tolerance occurring with continued exposure.  Tolerance to the effects of SAGE -217 on motor incoordination was  not observed after 
7 days of dosing.   
The compound has been assessed in 14-day rat and dog toxicology studies with daily 
administration of SAGE -217 as a solution in HPβCD in dogs and Labrasol
® in rats.  The no 
observed adverse effect level was 3 mg/kg (females) and 22. 5 mg/kg (males) in rats and 
2.5 mg/kg in dogs.  There were no adverse effects in dogs or rats in the main toxicology studies.  A sin gle observation of mortality occurred in one female rat at the high dose in a toxicokinetic 
study which was suspected to have been related to exaggerated pharmacology.  Additional toxicology and pharmacology information is provided in the  Investigat or’s Brochure.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
 
 25  5.3.2. Clinical Experience 
To date, two clinical studies employing SAGE -217 are clinically complete  and final clinical 
study reports are pending.  Discussions of pharmacokinetic (PK) data are limited to the single -
ascending dose, food, and essential tremor cohorts from Study 217- CLP-101 and the multiple -
ascending dose and drug-drug interaction (DDI) cohorts from Study 217- CLP-102.  Discussions 
of safety data are limited to the single -ascending dose cohorts in Study 217- CLP-[ADDRESS_6486]-in-human, four-part study that assessed the effects of a single 
dose of SAGE-217.  The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose 
design in healthy adult volunteers, with the objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD ) and PK profiles of SAGE -217 Oral Solution.  Subjects in each of the single -ascending 
dose cohorts received a single dose of study drug, either SAGE-217 (six subjects) or placebo 
(two subjects) , with SAGE -217 doses of 0.25 mg , 0.75 mg, 2 mg, 5.5 mg, 11 mg, 22 mg, 44 mg, 
55 mg, and 66 mg.  Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only after safety and PK data 
were reviewed by [CONTACT_7244] ( SRC) and agreement reached that it was safe to 
increase the dose.  The MTD was determined to be 55 mg.  Two cohorts, 6 subjects each 
received SAGE -217 in an open-label manner (one cohort received 50% of the MTD [22 mg] to 
study the food effects and the other cohort received the MTD [55 mg] to study the effects on 
subjects with essential tremor ).  SAGE -[ADDRESS_6487] ( 0.25 mg ) through the highest ( 66 mg ) dose, and supported once daily oral 
dosing with food.   
Study 217- CLP-102 was a two- part study that assessed the effects of multiple -ascending doses of 
SAGE -217.  The study was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -ascending dose study in 
healthy adult volunteers.  Subjects in each of the multiple -ascend ing dose cohorts received study 
drug, either SAGE -217 (nine subjects) or placebo (three subjects), once daily for 7 days, with 
SAGE -217 doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 35 mg.  Escalation to the next dose was undertaken only 
after safety and PK data were reviewed by [CONTACT_7245].  The MTD was determined to be 30 mg.  It was observed that subjects 
receiving the drug in the evening  did better in terms of tolerability compared to when they 
received the drug in the morning.  A fourth cohort of 12 subjects received 30 mg of SAGE-217 
in an open- label manner  to study drug-drug interactions.  SAGE -217 is not likely to induce the 
metabolism of CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates.  SAGE -217 was orally bioavailable and suitable 
for once daily oral dosing at night time with food.   
SAGE -217 was generally well tolerated.  In both Phase 1 studies (217- CLP-101 and  
217-CLP-102), doses were escalated until the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7115].  Most adverse events 
were reported as mild or m oderate in intensity, and there were no serious adverse events reported 
in either study.  In addition, none of the observed adverse events resulted in discontinuation of 
the study drug.  At doses planned for further study, the observed sedation was mild, transient, 
and associated with daily peak exposure.  The most common treatment- emergent adverse events 
were sedation, somnolence, dizziness, euphoric mood, fatigue, tremor, and muscle twitching, reported most frequently in the highest dose group (66 mg).  Some changes in mean blood pressure and heart rate were observed after single doses of 44 mg and greater.  After multiple 
doses of 30 mg (AM or PM) or 35 mg (PM) over [ADDRESS_6488].  Thus, the potential benefits in this population are unknown, although 
the risks are likely to be similar to those mentioned in the  Investigator ’s Brochure.  Many 
compounds that target the GABA A receptors exhibit clinical efficacy in ET, validating this 
receptor as a therapeutic target.  Given the promising SAGE-[ADDRESS_6489] vs tolerability 
(adverse events), specifically sedation.  Each subject will start with an initial dose of [ADDRESS_6490] the 10 mg 
dose for a minimum of 3 days will qualify for the randomization phase (Part B).  Given the high 
medical need and potential for benefit in ET, there is a favorable benefit-risk evaluation to 
investigate SAGE -[ADDRESS_6491] the potential to mitigate risk.  From a benefit/risk 
perspective, the appropriate measures are being taken in order to ensure the safety of the subjects 
who will be enrolled.   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6492] of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on the change in tremor severity.   
The primary endpoint of this study is the change from randomization (Day 8) in the 
accelerometer -based Kinesia  kinetic tremor combined score (ie, the sum of item 4c scores from 
both sides of the body) at Day 14.   
6.2. Secondary O bjectives  
The secondary obje ctives of the study are to comp are the effect of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on the following endpoints: 
1. Tremor severity as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day  8) in the 
accelerometer -based Kinesia  upper limb total score (ie, the sum of forward outstretched 
postural tremor, lateral “wing beating” postural tremor, and kinetic tremor item scores 
across both sides of the body) and individual item scores at Day 14. 
2. Tremor severity as measured by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in TRG  
Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) upper limb total score (ie, the sum 
of item 4c scores from both sides of the body) and individual TETRAS upper limb item scores at Day 14.  
3. Tremor severity as assessed by [CONTACT_7158] (Day 8) in TETRAS 
Performance Subscale scores measured at Day 14.  
4. Safety and tolerability as assessed by [CONTACT_7167] s measurement s, clinical laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters, and suicidal ideation using the Columbia- Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS), and adverse event reporting.   
5. Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/sedation as assessed by [CONTACT_7277]/S scores.  
6. Mood as assessed by [CONTACT_7219]- Lader visual analogue score ( VAS ) Mood Scale.  
7. How the subject feels after taking the study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_7278] (DEQ- 5) ratings.  
In addition, plasma concentrations of SAGE-[ADDRESS_6493] time point ( AUC
0-t), area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to infinity  
(AUC 0-∞), maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to reach maximum concentration ( tmax), 
and terminal half -life (t 1/2), will be derived , where appropriate.   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6494] of 7 days administration of 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution to placebo on: 
1. Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) as assessed by [CONTACT_7229] E4 .  Tremor oscillation as assessed by [CONTACT_7230] (ie, raw accelerometer values).  
2. Quality of life (QOL) as assessed by [CONTACT_7164] (ADL), Quality o f 
Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) , and video recording assessment of 
subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, 
and one additional task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily bas is). 
In addition, PK  and pharmacodynamic modelling assessment of the relationship between plasma 
exposure of SAGE- 217 and change from baseline in accelerometer -based Kinesia scores may be 
assessed.

 29  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is a two-part, multicenter, Phase 2a study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and PK of SAGE -217 Oral Solution in up to 80 adult subjects with ET.  Part  A of the study is an 
open-label design with morning dosing for 7 days.  Part B of the stud y is a double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal design.  Subjects will be exposed to study drug 
(SAGE-217 or placebo) for up to [ADDRESS_6495] dose.    
During the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1), after signing the informed consent form (ICF), 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and the severity of each subject’s ET will be 
evaluated using TETRAS.   Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical stu dy unit on Day -1.   
The study will be conducted in two parts: 
• Part A:  Beginning on Day 1, a ll subjects will receive open -label SAGE -217 in the 
morning with food (as outlined in Section  9.2) for 7 days.  Subjects will receive 
SAGE -217 10 mg on Day 1, SAGE-217 20 mg on Day 2, and SAGE-217 30 mg from 
Day 3 to Day 7 , with dose adjustments for severe adverse event s judged by [CONTACT_7181] ( Section  9.3).  Subjects will be confined on 
Day -1 through Day 3.   
• Part B:  In order to qualify for Part B of the study, a s ubject must tolerate a maximum 
dose of ≥[ADDRESS_6496] responded to SAGE-217, 
defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score on Day 7.  E ligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive 
SAGE -217 in the morning or in the evening or to receive placebo  for 7 days 
beginning on Day 8.  All doses of study drug will be administered with food  as 
outlined in Section  9.2.  Subjects randomized to SAGE- 217 will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part A.   In order to preserve the blind, those 
randomized to SAGE-217 in the morning will receive placebo in  the evening, those 
randomized to receive SAGE -217 in the evening will receive placebo in the morning, 
and those randomized to receive placebo will receive placebo in both morning and 
evening.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent randomized withdrawal (ie, withd rawal from treatment they received in Part  A).  Subjects will be 
confined on Day [ADDRESS_6497] dose and continued for the remainder of the open -label dosing period (ie, subjects 
who are unable to tolerate SAGE -217 30 mg will receive SAGE -217 20 mg and subjects who are 
unable to tolerate SAGE -217 20 mg will receive SAGE -217 10 mg).  The dose tolerated on 
Days  5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6498].  Subjects who 
require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, and 7 of Part A will not progress to Part B.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
 
 30  7.2. Blinding and Randomization  
Part A is open- label with no control group; therefore , there will be no randomization or blinding.   
Part B of the st udy is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study.  S ubjects 
who tolerate a maximum dose of ≥10 mg of SAGE-217 in Part A and respond to SAGE-217, 
defined as a 30% reduction from baseline in TETRAS kinetic tremor combined score on Day 7, 
will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_6499] of the site number (eg, “01”) followed by [CONTACT_7279] (eg , 01-001, 01-002, 01-003, etc.).   
A randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_7280].  This schedule will be prepared prior to the start of the study.  The randomization schedule 
will be generated using SAS V9.[ADDRESS_6500] may reveal actual solution contents to the investigator, who 
should also al ert Sage of the emergency (see Section  13.6 for more details related to unblinding).  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the 
electronic case report fo rm (eCRF) .  If the subject or study center personnel (other than 
pharmacist) have been unblinded, the subject will be terminated from the study.   
In order to preserve the blind in Part B , those randomized to SAGE-217 morning dosing will 
receive placebo for the evening dose, those randomized to SAGE-217 evening dosing will 
receive placebo for the morning dose, and those randomized to placebo will receive placebo for 
both morning and evening  dosing.  Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive their 
maximum dose  as determined in Part A.  Subjects randomized to the placebo arm will represent 
randomized withdrawal (withdrawal from treatment they received in Part A) .

the body) on Day 7.   
8.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
If there is an adverse event or med ical reason for the withdrawal, the subject should be followed 
medically until the condition has either resolved itself or is stable.  Details of the reason for withdrawal should be recorded in the subject ’s case report form ( CRF ).   
Subject s who withdraw should, if possible, have a follow-up examination, including a physical 
examination, the appropriate investigations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests, as outlined for the Day 21 visit ( Table 3).  All details of this follow -up examination should be recorded in 
the subject’s medical source documents.   
8.4.1. Study Drug Withdrawal  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary.  Subjects are free to discontinue the study at any 
time without giving their reason(s).   
A subject  must be withdrawn from the study treatment in the event of any of the following: 
• Withdrawal of the subject’s consent; 
• New onset of a  condition that  would have met e xclusion criterion , is clinically 
relevant and affects the subject ’s safety, and discontinuation is considered necessary 
by [CONTACT_7183]/Sponsor; 
• Occurrence of intolerable adverse event s;  
• Occurrence of pregnancy;  
• Intake of nonpermitted concomita nt medication; 
• Subject  noncompliance;  
• Significant protocol deviation determined in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
If a subject  failed  to attend scheduled assessments during the course of the study, the 
Investigator s must determine the reasons and the circumstances as completely and accurately as 
possible and document this in the subject ’s source documents.   
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if there is concern for the subject’s safety or it is determined tha t the subject is no longer a qualified participant.   Any subject who is withdrawn 
from the study for any reason is to  have the final visit assessments performed.    
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will be replaced only if they withdraw prior to dosing.  Subjects who are withdrawn from the study, fail to return  or are no longer 
qualified  will not be replaced.

9.2. Treatment Assignment  
Study drug will be administered in the morning with food during Part A and in the morning and 
evening (every 12 hours) with food during Part B.  Food intake was standardized as specified b y 
the Sponsor.   
9.2.1. Part A  
Subjects participating in Part A of the study will take study drug (SAGE -217) in an open- label 
manner.  All subjects will start on a 10 mg dose of study drug administered with food in the 
morning on Day  1.  Subjects will receive 20 mg with food on Day 2 and 30 mg with food daily  
on Days 3 to 7.  Dose adjustments will only be allowed any time the dose is not tolerated, 
assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event judged by [CONTACT_7281] ( Section  9.3).  The dose tolerated f or Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6519].   
9.2.2. Part B  
Subjects participating in the double-blind, placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal portion of 
the study ( Part B ) will be randomized to SAGE -217 morning dosing, SAGE -217 evening  dosing, 
or placebo.  Subjects randomized to SAGE -217 will receive the maximum dose of SAGE -217 
from Part A of the study.  Following randomization, s ubjects will receive 7  days of study drug 
starting on Day  8.   
9.3. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustments will only be allowed during the open-label phase of the study (Part A).  If at any time the dose is not tolerated in Part A, assessed by [CONTACT_7184] a severe adverse event 
judged by [CONTACT_7185], the dose on the next day will be reduced to 
the next lowest dose and continued for the remainder of the open-label dosing period (ie, subjects who are unable to tolerate the 30 mg dose will receive a lower dose of 20 mg, and subjects who 
are unable to tolerate 20 m g will be given a 10 mg dose).  The dose tolerated for Days 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_6520].  
Subjects who require dose adjustments on Days 5, 6, and 7 of Part A will not progress to Pa rt B.

9.4.1. Prior/ Concomitant Medications 
Any concomitant medication determined necessary for the welfare of the subject may be given at 
the discretion of the Investigator at any time during the study under the guidance outlined in 
Section  9.4.2.   
Record the name, start date (if known), indication for use and whether ongoing or stopped of 
medications/treatme nts taken within 2 weeks prior to study entry as well as any medications 
taken during the study.   
The charts of all study participants will be reviewed for new concomitant medications through 
discharge from the unit.  Chart reviews will include examinatio n of nursing and physician 
progress notes, vital signs, and medication records in order to identify adverse events  that may be 
associated with new concomitant medications.  New concomitant medications, ongoing concomitant medications with a change in dose and medical procedures ordered (eg, laboratory 
assessments,  computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan s) will be reviewed to 
determine if they are associated with an adverse event not previously identified.   
9.4.2. Prohibited Medications  
The drug classes listed in  Appendix 1 are not permitted in the 14 days prior to the admission visit 
and for the duration of the study (up to the Day 21 visit).  The list provides non- exhaustive 
examples of each drug class.   
Subjects are not permitted to use alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine within [ADDRESS_6521].  The Investigator (s) or designee 
will record the time and dose of study drug administration in the source documents.  Any reasons for non-compliance will also be documented, including: 
• Missed visits;  
• Interruptions in the schedule of administration; and 
• Nonpermitted medications.  
The time at which study procedures are conducted should follow the protocol timelines as

Day 3.   
While confined in the clinical unit in Part B  (Day 7 through Day 10), subjects will receive 
randomized study drug in the morning and in the evening on Days 8, 9, and 10.   For non-confinement days (Days 4 through 6 [ Part A ] and D ays 11 through 14 [ Part B ]), dosing 
will be done at the clinical site or, if suitable arrangements can be made, via home administration 
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6524]  the 
study drug was intended (ie, record subject initials and birth date or other unique identifier).   
At the end of the study, any unused study drug will be retained or returned to the Sponsor for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the Sponsor’s directions; disposition of study drug will be 
documented.   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6525] symptom response by a measurement of 
tremor amplitude, TETRAS upper limb subscale, and TETRAS Performance Subscale (items 4, 
6, 7, and 8).  Quality -of-life assessments include TETRAS ADL, QUEST, and video recording 
of subjects performing three everyday tasks .  Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous 
system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7166], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate 
monitoring) will be  assessed by [CONTACT_7222] E4.    
11.1. Measurements of Tremor Amplitude  
In order to measure essential tremor amplitude, subjects will wear a wireless ring motion sensor.  
The motion sensor measures linear acceleration and angular velocity (the Kinesia  score).  
Amplitudes from the motion sensor data are collected for three upper limb maneuvers (postural 
tremor, wing beating, kinetic tremor) on each side of the body, for a total of six amplitude 
measures per assessment.  Data are transmitted from the sensor to a computer using Bluetooth 
technology.  Information from the motion sensor data correlates to symptoms of tremor. The 
Kinesia  score ranges from 0 to 4 in 0.5 step increments.  Higher scores indicate more tremors.  
The accelerometer assessment  is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Performance 
Subscale Item 4.    
In Part A, Kinesia will be performed predose on Day -1 (Admission; three assessments separated 
by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes) and predose and 2, 12, and 14 hours postdose (three assessments 
separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes) on Days 1, 2, and 7.  In Part B, Kinesia will be performed 
before morning dose, after morning dose ([ADDRESS_6526] morning dose), before evening  dose 
([ADDRESS_6527] morning dose), and after evening  dose ([ADDRESS_6528] morning dose) ( three 
assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30  minutes) on Days 8, 9, and 14, and on Day 21.   
11.2. TRG Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) 
Performance Scale  
Item #4 (upper limb tremor) of the TETRAS Performance Subscale will be completed using both 
the accelerometer and clinician assessment.  Testing should be completed within ±10 minutes of 
the planned questionnaire time points.  All three tests in the upper limb tremor series of assessments (Item 4) will be completed for both arms, first for the RIGHT arm and then for the 
LEFT.  Predose assessments can be done any time within 2 hours prior to the start of 
administration of solution .  The Day 21 follow- up visit assessments can be done at any time 
during the visit.   
Subjects will complete the TETRAS Performance Subscale, Item #4 (upper limb tremor) while 
wearing the accelerometer.  Simultaneous clinician assessment of item #4 will occur.  The 
accelerometer assessment is completed in conjunction with the TETRAS Performance Subscale 
at the same time points during the study.    
In Part A, the TETRAS upper limb subscale will be performed at Screening, predose on Day -1 
(Admission; three assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes), and predose and 2, 12, and 
14 hours postdose (three assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 minutes) on Days 1, 2, and 7.  The 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
 
 41  TETRAS  (all ADL  and Performance Subscale [Items 4, 6, 7, and 8] ) will be performed on 
Day -1 (Admission) and on Day 7 .   
In Part B, the TETRAS upper limb subscale will be before morning dose, after morning dose 
([ADDRESS_6529] morning dose), before evening  dose ([ADDRESS_6530] morning dose), and after 
evening  dose ([ADDRESS_6531] morning dose) (three assessments separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30  minutes) 
on Days 8, 9, and 14, and on Day 21.  The TETR AS (all ADL and Performance Subscale [Items 
4, 6, 7, and 8]) will be performed on Day [ADDRESS_6532] be ≥2 on each side (left and right) for kinetic tremor and ≥2 on 
each side (left and right) for either wing beating or forward outstretched postural tremor.  A copy 
of the TETRAS is provided in Appendix 2.   
11.3. Empatica Wristband E4 
Physiological activity (ie, sympathetic nervous system tone as measured by [CONTACT_7161], skin temperature monitoring, and heart rate monitoring ) will be  assessed by [CONTACT_7229] E4.  The Empatica Wristband E4  is a wearable motion device that captures  
motion -based activity and sympathetic nervous system arousal, even when the wearer is not 
moving.  The Empatica Wristband E4 will be worn during the Confinement Periods and on Day 14.  D ata from the Empatica Wristband E4 will not be presented in the study report; instead, 
they will be part of a separate report.   
11.4. Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire ( QUEST) 
The QUEST is a brief, 30 -item, ET -specific QOL scale in which subjects rate the extent to which 
tremor impacts a function or state, tremor severity in various body parts, perceived health, and 
overall QOL (Tröster 2005).  The QUEST will be administered predose on Day -1 (Admission), 
Day 7, and on Day 14.  A copy of the QUEST is provided in Appendix 3.   
11.5. Video Recording  
Videos of subjects performing three everyday tasks (drinking a glass of water, fastening a button, 
and one additional task that the subject experiences difficulty with on a daily basis) will be taken 
on Day - 1 (Admissio n) and predose on Day [ADDRESS_6533] the plasma samples processed, stored, and transported as directed for bioanalysis.   
An additional PK sample may be collected at any time if clinically indicated and at the discretion 
of the Investigator (eg, for unusual or severe adverse events).   
Each sample w ill be marked with unique identifiers such as the study number, subject number, 
and the nominal sample time.  The date and actual time that the blood sample was taken will be 
recorded on the CRF or electronically with a bar code or other method.   
12.2. Storage and Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
The plasma samples should be kept frozen at approximately -70°C to -80°C until analyzed.  
They should be packed as directed to avoid breakage during transit and with sufficient dry ice to 
prevent thawing for at least  [ADDRESS_6534] e Analysis 
Bioanalysis of plasma samples for the determination of SAGE-217 will be performed utilizing a validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry method at a qualified laboratory .

urinalysis at the Screening visit, on Day -1 (Admission ), Day 1, and predose on Day 2.  In 
Part B, blood and urine samples will be collected predose on Day 8, Day 9, and on Day 21.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
 
 44  Serum and urine samples for pregnancy tests (females only) will also be collected.  These 
assessments should be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Events ( Table 2  and 
Table 3)  and as outlined individually below.   
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant 
(CS).  Screening results considered abnormal, CS recorded at the Screening visit  may make the 
subject ineligible for the study pending review by [CONTACT_7195].  Clinical laboratory 
results that are abnormal, CS during the study but within normal range at baseline and/or indicate 
a worsening from baseline will be considered adverse events, assessed according to 
Section  13.2.1, and recorded in the e CRF.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology 
Hematology tests will include complete blood count, including red blood cells, white blood cells 
with differentiation, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and platelets.  The coagulation panel will include activated partial thromboplastin time, p rothrombin time , and international

the study.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_7282] v isit and by [CONTACT_7283] -1 (Admission), and at the follow-up visit on 
Day 28 in Part B.   13.1.7. Columbi a-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) 
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011) .  This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit.  The C- SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_6535] severe).   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6536] 
for further evaluation.  This information will be tracked.   
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed on Day -1 ( Admission ) (lifetime 
history and past 24 months).  In Part A, t he “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed 
12 hours postdose on Day 1, predose on Day 4, and on Days 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, the “Since 
Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed on Days 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14, on Day 21, and on 
Day 28.  The C -SSRS is provided in Appendix 4.   
13.1.8. Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS) 
The SSS is subject -rated scale designed to quickly assess how alert a subject is feeling.  Degrees 
of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7138] a scale of [ADDRESS_6537] score of ‘1’ indicates 
the subject is ‘feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake’ and the highest score of ‘7’ indicates the 
subject is ‘no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream-like thoughts’.   
In Part A, t he SSS will be administered predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 24 hours 
postdose on Days 1, 2, and 3, and predose only on Days 4, 5, 6, and 7.  In Part B, t he SSS will be

MOAA/S score.  
13.1.9. Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S ) 
The MOAA/S allows exploration of deeper sedation s tates than the SSS.  If a MOAA/S score of 
3 or less was observed, the score was to be confirmed by [CONTACT_7267] 10 minutes and re-administering the MOAA/S assessment.  In Part A, the MOAA/S assessment should be 
conducted after other assessments that are scheduled at the same time point.   In Part A, t he 
MOAA/S will be performed predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 24 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, and 3, predose only on Days 4, 5, 6, and 7.  In Part  B, the MOAA/S will be performed 
predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 24 hours postdose on Days 8, 9, and 10, predose only 
on Days 11, 12, 13, and 14, and on Day 21.  The MOAA/S is provided in Appendix 6.   
13.1.10. Bond- Lader VAS Mood Scale 
Mood will be assessed using the Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale.  This is a 16- part self -
administered questionnaire that employs a 100-mm VAS to explore different aspects of self -
reported mood.  In Part A, t he mood scale will be administered predose on Days 1, 2, and 7.  In 
Part B, t he mood scale will be administered predose on Days 8, 9, and 14 and on Day 21.  The 
Bond- Lader Mood Rating Scale is provided in Appendix 7.

A DEQ- 5 will be administered as follows:  
1. Do you FEEL a drug effect right now? 
2. Are you HIGH right now? 
3. Do you DISLIKE any of the effects that you are fe eling right now? 
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
 
 46  4. Do you LIKE any of the effects that you are feeling right now? 
5. Would you like MORE of the drug you took, right now? 
The answers are recorded on a 100- mm VAS , with the answer for each being “Not at all” and 
“Extremely” at the extremes.  There will be options to record “Not applicable” for questions 3 
and 4 if no drug effects are felt and for question 5 prior to administration of study medication.  
The DEQ -5 wil l be perfo rmed 2 hours postdose on Days 1 and 7 in Part A and 2 hours postdose 
on Days 8 and 14 in Part B.  The DEQ -5 is provided in Appendix 8.   
13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected after the ICF has been signed.  Medical conditions that occur after the ICF has been signed will be captured on the adverse event eCRF.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
coding system (version 18.1 or higher ).  
13.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre- existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally  related to the product.  In clinical studies, an adverse event 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or 
washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event .  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring during any study phase and at any dose of 
the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or more of the follow ing: 
• It results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6538] be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_7234]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Sedation as an Adverse Event  
Sedation will be assessed using protocol- specified rating scales.  In order to standardize the 
reporting of sedation as adverse events, Investigators need not record sedation as an adverse 
event unless there is a score of >5 on the SSS and/or a score of ≤2 on the MOAA/S.  
Consideration should be given to the most appropriate term to describe the sedation characteristics.    
13.2.2. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy occurring during this study will be reported within [ADDRESS_6539]’s spouse/partner (if the subject is male and his spouse/partner becomes pregnant) or the 
obstetrician for information about the outcome of the pregnancy, and in the case of a live birth, about any congenital abnormalities.  If a congenital abnormality is reported, then it should be 
recorded in the source documents and reported a s a serious adverse event .   
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each adverse event (unrelated, possibly related or probably related).  
The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classif ied as “unrelated.”  If 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event , then the 
adverse event should be considered “relat ed.”   
Not 
Related : No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the  subject,  but this is not known  for sure.  
Probably 
Related:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible temporal  sequence from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response pattern to the suspected  study  drug.  
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other modes  of therapy  administered  to the  subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event /serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered to be related 
to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6540] and/or in response to an open question 
from the s tudy personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].   Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as adverse event s unless they prompt corrective me dical action by [CONTACT_3786], constitute a serious adverse event  or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
study drug.   
Information about adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the final 
visit of the study for that su bject.   Adverse events that occur after the first administration of study 
drug will be denoted TEAE s.   
All adverse events will be followed until they are resolved or have reached a clinical plateau with 
no expectation of future change.   
The adverse event  term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For 
each adverse event , the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution 
or clinical plateau (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and whether or not 
it caused the subject  to discontinue the study .   
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal  activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
13.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse event s (regardless of causality) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF 
until [ADDRESS_6541] be reported to the 
Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee immediately by [CONTACT_7284] [ADDRESS_6542] complete, sign and date the serious adverse event  
pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the serious advers e event pages with 
the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage Therapeutics or designee.   
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be sent to Sage Therapeutics 
or designee within 24 hours of receipt; a follow-up s erious adverse event  form should be 
completed and placed with the original serious adverse event  information and kept with the 
appropriate section of the CRF and/or study file.   
Sage Therapeutics or designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regul atory authorities of 
certain events.   It is the Principal Investigator ’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all serious 
adverse event s that occur at his or her site if applicable per the IRB’s requirements .  Investigator s 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) 
that occur during the clinical study.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB of these 
additional serious adverse event s.   
Protocol 217- ETD -201  Sage Therapeutics  
 
 49  13.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug (Part B ) 
Part B is a double-blind study.  The pharmacist responsible for preparing the solutions will be 
unblinded and will retain an official paper copy of the randomization schedule. 
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received.  Unless a subject is at immediate risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_7236] a subject.  Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be discussed with the Sponsor.  If the unblinding occurs without the Sponsor’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as poss ible 
and no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to the Sponsor 
and approved by [CONTACT_7251], according to standard operating procedures.  
The blinding of the study will be broken after the database has been locked.  Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_7152].   
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information must 
be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF.  If the subject or study center personnel 
(other than pharmacist) have been unblinded, the subject will be terminated from the study.

categorized as low or high, where applicable.  For all categorical endpoints, summaries will include counts and percentages.   
14.7.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding system (version 18.1 or higher).  The 
analysi s of adverse event s will be based on the concept of TEAEs.  A TEAE is defined as an 
adverse event with onset after the start of open- label study drug , or any worsening of a pre-
existing medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of open- label study drug and 
until [ADDRESS_6545] dose .  The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized overall  and by 
[CONTACT_7204] , preferred term , and dose group.  Incidences will be presented in 
order of decreasing frequency.  In addition, summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_7205] (see  Section  13.3).    
TEAEs leading to discontinuation and serious adverse events (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for definition) 
with onset after the first dose of open- label study drug will also be summarized.  
All adverse events and serious adverse events (including those with onset or worsening before 
the start of open-label study drug) through the Day [ADDRESS_6546]: heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTc, 
and QTcF .  Any clinically significant abnormalities or changes in ECGs should be listed as an 
adverse event.  E lectrocardiogram findings will be listed by [CONTACT_3598].

evaluability rate, [ADDRESS_6552] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
15.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics or designee will visit the investigational study site to:   
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities ; and  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or designee or its 
representatives.   This will be do cumented in a Clinical Study Agreement between 
Sage Therapeutics and the Investigator.   
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or designee will have regular contacts with the investigational site for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator (s); 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable ; 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRF s, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed ; 
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF s 
with the subject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records  for each 
subject  (eg, clinic charts);  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics or designee; and  
• Confirm adverse event s and serious adverse event s have been properly documented 
on CRFs and confirm any serious adver se event s have been forwarded to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee and those serious adverse event s that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.   
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator (s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC) or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source 
data verification.   The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics or designee audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the International Council on 
Harmonis ation  (ICH) , and any applicable regulatory requirements.   The Investigator  should 
contact [CONTACT_7240] a regulatory agency about an  inspection.   
Protocol 217- ETD -[ADDRESS_6553] (IRB)  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_7118].  Initial IRB approval,

CRF s.   
Quality assurance and quality -control systems with written standard operating procedures will be 
followed to ensure this study will be conducted and data will be generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicabl e regulatory 
requirements.    
The site’s dedicated study monitor will arrange to visit the Investigator at regular intervals during 
the study. The monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH and GCP 
guidelines to ensure protocol adhe rence, quality of data, drug accountability, compliance with 
regulatory requirements, and continued adequacy of the investigational site and its facilities. 
During these visits, eCRFs and other data related to the study will be reviewed and any 
discrepanci es or omissions will be identified and resolved. The study monitor will be given 
access to study -relevant source documents (including medical records) for purposes of source 
data verification.  
During and/or after completion of the study, quality- assurance officers named by [CONTACT_7215]- site audits.  The Investigator is 
expected to cooperate with any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including source data) as requested.  
Quality control wi ll be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable 
and have been processed correctly.

 58  18. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_7121] (including electronic data) used in this protocol will be documented 
in a Data Management Plan.   
Electronic CRFs will be completed for each study subject.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s eCRF.  Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indica te the subject’s participation in the 
study and should document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and subject status.   
The Investigator will have access to the electronic data capture system and will receive a copy of 
the subject eCRF data at the end of the study.  For subjects who discontinue or terminate from 
the study, the eCRFs will be completed as much as possible, and the reason for the 
discontinuation or termination clearly and concisely specified on the appropriate eCRF. 
18.1. Inspection of Records  
Sage Therapeutics or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities 
for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study.  The Investigator agrees to allow the 
monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subject 
charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.   
18.2. Retention of Records 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7122] a period of 
[ADDRESS_6555] number.  The  Investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) 
from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority(ies) access to the subject’s original medical records for  verification of data gathered on the eCRFs  and to audit the data collection 
process.   The subject’s  confidentiality  will be maintained and will not be made publicly available 
to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913].   
Subjects will be notified that registration information, results, and other information about this study will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, a publicly  available trial registry  database; 
however, protected health information of individual subjects will not be used.

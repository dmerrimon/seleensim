 
[ADDRESS_1223397] edited : 9/25/2019  Detailed Protocol: Denosumab and High -dose Teriparatide Administration Study (DATA 2)  
 
I. Background and Significance  
 
As our population ages, osteoporotic fractures are expected to have an increasing impact on the 
health of our population. Today, osteopor osis is estimated to affect over [ADDRESS_1223398] devastatin g consequence of osteoporosis, is 
estimated to be 17% 2. In most patients with osteoporosis, the occurrence of a hip fracture is a 
devastating consequence, conveying 24% excess mortality within [ADDRESS_1223399], de crease hip and non -spi[INVESTIGATOR_875956] 50% and 30%, respectively 4,5. At present, the mainstay of osteo porosis treatment is 
the use of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates (BPs).  These drugs act by [CONTACT_875973] (as well as formation) and have been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and 
reduce fracture rates in certain populations 6. Teriparatide (TPTD - hPTH 1 -34) has also been shown 
to increase BMD and reduce fractures, but acts by a different mechanism that involves stimulating 
new bone for mation (along with resorption), and reconstituting internal bone microarchitecture 7-14. 
The effects of TPTD are dose dependant both with regard to increases in bone mass and stimulation 
of osteoblast activity 13. Specifically, biochemical markers of bone formation increase more in women 
treated with 40 -μg of TPTD daily comp ared to women treated with 20 -μg (the FDA approved dose) 
and this greater stimulation of bone formation is associated with greater BMD increases, particularly in 
trabecular bone 14,15.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_875957], TPTD 40 mcg/day reduces 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_92648] -spi[INVESTIGATOR_875958] 20 mcg/day in humans. We hypothesize that this 
paradox arises because 40 -mcg/day increases bone resorption more than 20 -mcg/day, a difference 
revealed by [CONTACT_875974] 14,16. Unique among osteoporosis medications, 
TPTD has also been shown to stimulate periosteal expansion in animal models though a similar 
property in human studies has yet to be unequivocally shown 8,17-19. 
 
While both TPTD and BPs increase BMD and reduce fracture risk, their beneficial effects are limited 
and neither drug is able to com pletely normalize BMD or restore skeletal integrity in most patients. 
Initially thought to be a promising approach, trials of combination therapy with anabolic agents and 
BPs have demonstrated minimal or no advantage over monotherapy 20-26. In these combination 
studies, the antiresorptive agent inhibited TPTD or PTH -stimulated increases in bone formation and 
resorption but did not suppress turnover to the degree  observed with the antiresorptive agent alone 22-
26. Together, these studies suggest that co -administration of BPs with TPTD blunts the TPTD -
associated stimulation of bone formation in a dose -dependent fashion, particularly in predominately 
trabecular sites such as the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The reasons that the combination of BPs and TPTD do not 
stimulate greater gains in BMD are unclear.  BPs presumably interfere with one or more of the 
mechanisms via which TPTD exerts its anabolic effect on bone: increased secretion of IGF -I, bFGF, 
or other paracrine growth factors by [CONTACT_766899], decreased production of sclerostin by [CONTACT_816347], 
and/or increased osteoclastic resorption of bone wi th resultant release of these and other pre -formed 
growth factors 23,27,28.  
 
Rodent models have suggested that TPTD in combination with OPG (a molecule aimed at the same 
molecular target as denosumab – see below) has superior skeletal effects compared to TPTD alone 
29,30. Denosumab (DMAB) is an FDA -approved fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds 
to receptor activator of nuclear factor -κB ligand (RANKL)31. It inhibits bone resorption by [CONTACT_875975] -osteoclasts and osteoclasts, the final common 
pathway leading to osteoclast activation and bone resorption 32,33. DMAB suppresses bone turnover 
more than intravenous and oral BPs 34,35. DMAB’s potent antiresorptive properties are best 
demonstrated in iliac crest biopsy specimens from postmenopausal osteoporotic women who had 
been taking the drug for 24 -36 months. These biopsies revealed  an 80% reduction in eroded surface 
 
[ADDRESS_1223400] edited : 9/25/2019  and the complete absence of osteoclasts in more than 50% of the specimens. Furthermore, 
histomorphometric indices of bone turnover were significantly lower in the patients taking DMAB than 
those taking alendronate 36. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_875959], however, bone 
turnover rapi[INVESTIGATOR_875960] 31. Like other antiresorptive agents, DMAB 
increases BMD at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_35632], but unlike most of these agents also increases BMD at 
diaphyseal sites such as the wrist 37-42. Furthermore, DMAB reduces the risk of vertebral and hip 
fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, and increases indices of bone strength when 
measured by [CONTACT_84888] -pQCT 43,44. Taken together, the unique mechanism of action of DMAB and the 
suggestive animal studies led us to hy pothesize that the combination of DMAB and TPTD would 
increase BMD, bone quality, and estimated bone strength more than either drug alone.  
 
This hypothesis was tested and confirmed in The DATA Study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 45,46 that compared teriparatide and denosumab monotherapy to the combination of 
both drugs in postmenopausal osteoporotic  women . As shown below , the results not only showed that 
the combination increased hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_875961], but also that i n the 
presence of DMAB, the pro -resorptive effects of TPTD are completely blocked (unlike combinations of 
TPTD and BPs).  
 
 
The combination group is statistically different from both other groups at all sites (P<0.02). TPTD group is 
statistically different from DMAB at total hip only  
 
 
For clarity, changes are shown for combination and DMAB groups only (*P=0.05 f or between -group 
comparison). In the TPTD alone group, typi[INVESTIGATOR_875962], P1NP  (bone formation markers) , and CTX  
(bone resorption marker)  were observed.  
 
 
These results suggest that even greater gains in BMD, bone quality, and bone strength could be 
achieved if DMAB could be combined with a more potent stimulant of osteoblast function and bone 
formation. Thus, we plan to conduct 15 -month study  that compares TPTD 40 -μg plus DMAB (60 -mg 
every six months) to TPTD [ADDRESS_1223401] edited : 9/25/2019  In performing this clinical trial, we will be able to better understand the mechanisms by [CONTACT_875976]. Furthermore, if our hypothesis is 
confirmed, the findings of this study could define a novel approach to the treatment of high -risk 
osteoporosis patients.  
 
A known limitation of both teriparatide and denosumab therapy is t he rapid loss of bone that occurs 
when these drugs are discontinued.49,50 Moreover, both teriparatide and denosu mab are expensive 
and administered by [CONTACT_22666] (daily and every 6 -months, respectively). If combination 
teriparatide/denosumab therapy is to become part of a widely used treatment approach, we must 
develop strategies to maintain and expand th e unprecedented improvement in bone density and 
microarchitrecture observed, and do so with acceptable risk of serious adverse effects. Zoledronic 
acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate that has been shown to reduce the risk of both vertebral and 
non-verte bral fractures when given as a yearly [ADDRESS_1223402] previously received combination denosumab and 
teriparatide is not defined, we believe that is useful and important to look at how our study su bjects’ 
bone mineral densities have changed a year or more after completion of their participation in our 
study.  
 
II. Specific Aims  
The Specific Aim of this protocol is to test the following hypothesis:  
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the combi nation of DMAB and high -dose TPTD (which 
will be started 3 -months prior to denosumab) will increase BMD, improve bone microarchitecture, and 
increase estimated bone strength more than the combination of DMAB and standard dose TPTD.  
 
The Specific Aim of the  Extension trial (DATA -2-EX): 
The extension trial described (DATA -2-EX) will test the hypothesis that the large increases in cortical 
and trabecular BMD, bone quality, and estimated bone strength achieved with combined DMAB and 
high-dose TPTD therapy can b e extended for up to 27 -months by a single 5 -mg dose of zoledronic 
acid. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will represent a significant advance in the rational development 
of comprehensive treatment strategies, especially for those with severe disease in  whom single -agent 
therapy does not adequately reduce fracture risk. Additionally, positive results from DATA -2-EX would 
support the initiation of a larger trial assessing the anti -fracture efficacy of this approach.  
 
The Specific Aim of the Observational visit: 
This optional observational visit is specific to subjects who completed the month -[ADDRESS_1223403] with institution al guidelines for clinical studies. Recruitment flyers will be posted in approved 
locations throughout the MGH (including the MGH Bone Mineral Density Center) and email 
announcements will be sent through the Partners Clinical Research Program Network .  Letters will be 
sent to subjects identified through RSVP for Health. Additionally, advertisements w ill be published in 
local newspapers and a mailing will be sent to targeted populations, including subjects who have 
expressed an interest in one of our researc h group’s previous studies.

IV. Subject Enrollment  
 
This outpatien t study will either be conducted at one or more of the following sites:  the General 
Clinical Research Center (GCRC), the Osteoporosis Research Center or the Endocrine Unit Clinical 
Space (all within t he [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
The general desig n is a randomized, [ADDRESS_1223409] a medical history and interview 
with a study investigator. Those who remain eligible will be formally accepted i nto the study by a study 
investigator, assigned to one of 4 strata based on age (above or below 65) and previous 
bisphosphonate use (previous use or none) and then randomly assigned  within each strata to one of 
the 2 treatment groups by [CONTACT_22123] -generated cards.  (1:1: ratio).  Within each of the four strata, the 
randomization block size will vary randomly to minimize the predictability of treatment assignments.

study subjects.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: (Optional one -time observational visit for only DXA may occur between month 27 and month 39 for 
subjects who do not receive zoledronic acid.)  
 
All subjects who report dietary intake of less than 1200mg of calcium daily will be given calcium 
supplementation (600mg elemental calcium) with Vitamin D (400IU). Subjects with a dietary intake > 
1200 mg will receive Vitamin D only.  
 
V. Study Procedures  
 
Telephone screening and Screening Visit : 
Members of research staff will screen all interested subjects over the telephone.  If subjects meet 
initial criteria and are interested in the study, a member of the study staff will schedule a screening 
visit wherein the subject will sign  a separate “screening only” consent form.  This consent form will 
allow for a blood draw and bone mineral density testing.  
 
Prior to signing this screening only consent form, subjects will be offered the option to speak with a 
physician investigator if th ey wish or if they have questions that can't be answered by [CONTACT_21118].  
 
At this visit, bone mineral density of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_875964]:  
• PTH 
• 25-(OH) Vitamin D  
• Routine chemistries (Calcium, Phospha te, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, ALT)  
• Complete Blood Count  
• FSH (if necessary because of prior hysterectomy)  
 
Visit 1: 
If the subject meets the above BMD and laboratory criteria, she will then be scheduled for  visit  1.  At 
this visit, a study physician will obtain written informed consent for participation in the complete study.  
If subjects require more time to consider participating after reading the consent form the screening  

 
[ADDRESS_1223415] edited : 9/25/[ADDRESS_1223416] is ready to sign the consent form, the study physician will then 
perform a history and physical on her. If all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, subjects will then 
continue visit 1 and the subsequent visits.  
 
Visit 1 -6: 
These visits will occur at the following times:  
Visit 1 (month 0)  
Visit 2 (month 3 +/ - 2 weeks)  
Visit 3 (month 9 +/ - 2 weeks)  
Visit 4 (month 15 + 6/- 2 weeks)  
Visit 5 (month 27 +/ -2 weeks)  
Visit 6 (month 42 +/ -2 weeks)  
 
If enrolled in optional observational study, these visits will occur at the following times:  
Visit 1 ( month 0)  
Visit 2 (month 3 +/ - 2 weeks)

VI. Study Endpoint and Statistical Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint is the change in PA spi[INVESTIGATOR_9210] (DXA) between treatment groups at [ADDRESS_1223421], and the (group)X(time) interaction term. The 
inference of the regression coefficient associated with the interaction term (difference in slopes) will 
determine differ ences between treatment groups. The model will allow us to include all available 
partial observations for the non -completers and this approach will provide more valid estimates (with 
increased efficiency) of the time effects than the last value carried for ward method.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_1223422] edited : 9/25/[ADDRESS_1223423] that 30 subjects in each group will complete the study. This 
represents an 86% completion rate, a conservative estimate based on our current with drawal rate of 
less than 6% in DATA.  With this group size, the table below shows our estimated power calculations 
using the Hsu (With Best) multiple comparison test at a 5% significance level and assuming 80% 
power. The Hsu completers -based power analysis  is conservative, and the actual analysis will likely 
attain greater power as the full analysis set can be utilized.  
 
These detectable between -group differences are at the lower lim it of what is considered clinically 
important and generally correspond to the between -group difference that we observed in the DATA 
study.  
 
VII. Risk and Discomforts  
 
Denosumab  
DMAB is an FDA approved medication used to treat osteoporosis in various popul ations, including 
postmenopausal women. More than 13,[ADDRESS_1223424] been treated with DMAB in clinical studies, 
and it is generally well tolerated. In clinical studies, it has been reported that DMAB may uncommonly 
produce the following side -effects: ec zema, serious skin infections, low blood calcium (which can 
cause tingling in the fingers or around the mouth, muscle cramps, or abnormal heart rate), pain in the 
joints or extremities, high blood cholesterol, dizziness, cough, difficulty emptying the blad der, and 
decreased skin sensation. Hypocalcemia has been very rarely reported in absence of renal failure. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in the oncology clinical trial program in patients treated 
with DMAB but its relative incidence compared t o placebo is unclear . Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], low -energy, or low 
trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported patients who received DMAB. The incidence 
of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_662315] -defined but appears to be extremely rare. If a study subject 
prese nts with thigh or groin pain, she will be immediately evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur

[ADDRESS_1223425] edited : 9/25/[ADDRESS_1223426] comm only reported side effects of TPTD are overall pain, 
asthenia, nausea, headache, leg cramps, sinus tachycardia, arthralgia, rhinitis), and dizziness. TPTD 
can cause transien t hypercalcemia, which is generally mild, even with the 40 -μg dose 13. Repeated 
daily administration of TPTD in high doses to rodents causes dose -dependent osteoscle rosis, bony 
obliteration of the marrow space, and extra -medullary hematopoiesis, followed by [CONTACT_167676].   
The relevance of these findings to humans is unclear and will remain so for many years, because 
osteosarcoma is rare in adults (4 cases/million/ye ar). Eli Lilly and the FDA are monitoring the 
incidence of osteosarcoma in TPTD treated patients and have not reported a linkage thus far.  
 
The dose of TPTD cho sen (40 -μg) is higher than that currently approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (20 -μg once daily) but the same as doses used in other clinical studies, including our 
own. Studies from our group were performed under an IND to [CONTACT_875984] (co -investigator) and 
include the following:

JCEM 2010 23 postmenopausal 
women  62 24 months  <2% 
 
In the largest study of the 40 -μg dose of teriparatide 13, 541 women received the 20 -μg dose and 544 
women received the 40 -μg dose for a mean if 19 months. In this study, both doses were generally well 
tolerated and differences in side effects between doses were small. Side effects included nausea (40 -
μg 18%, 20 -μg 8%, placebo 8%), headache (40 -μg 13%, 20 -μg 8%, placebo 8%), dizziness (40 -μg 
6%, 20 -μg 9%, placebo 6%), and leg cramps (40 -μg 1%, 20 -μg 3%, placebo 1%). Additionally, the [ADDRESS_1223428] common side effects associated with zoledronic acid include flu -like symptoms (e.g., fever, 
chills, muscle/joint aches) occurring after the infusion. The majority of these symptoms occur within 
the first 3 days following drug administr ation and usually resolve within 3 days of onset but resolution 
can take up to 7 -14 days. Taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen after the infusion can mitigate these 
symptoms. Other common side effects include nausea, tiredness, dizziness, headache, or

Renal toxicity: Zoledronic acid, has been associated with renal impairment and in rare cases, acute 
renal failure. There is a transient increase in serum creatinine within 10 days of dosing in 1.8% of 
zoledronic -acid treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo -treated patients.  Renal function is being 
monitored closely in both DATA -[ADDRESS_1223429] an estimated 
GFR > 50 (mL/min) to receive zoledronic acid  5mg. Subjects with GFR [ADDRESS_1223430] 
15 minutes and will be followed by a 10 mL normal saline flush of the intravenous line.  
 
Hypocalcemia:  In clinical trials of zol edronic acid without Vitamin D pre -treatment, approximately 0.2% 
of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels to values less than 7.5 mg/dL after each 
zoledronic acid administration. No symptomatic cases of hypocalcemia were observed in clinica l trials 
 
[ADDRESS_1223431] edited : 9/25/[ADDRESS_1223432] a pre -treatment 25-(OH) Vitamin -D level ≥20 (ng/mL).  Patients who are administered the renal 
dose of zoledronic acid  (2mg)  will be asked to return for bloodwork 10 days (+/ - 3 days) post -infusion 
to assess calcium and creatinine levels.  
 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw:  Osteonecrosis of the jaw is an extr emely rare side effect of zoledronic acid 
when given at the doses recommended for osteoporosis treatment. Subjects will not be enrolled in 
DATA -2-EX if they have any major dental work planned during the projected course of the study 
(extractions or implant s). An oral examination will be performed by a study doctor prior to 
administration of zoledronic acid.  
 
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_875967]:  Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], low -energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have 
been reported in bisphosphonate -treated patients. Aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_875968] a complete fracture occurs. The incidence of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_662315] -defined but 
appears to be extremely rare and at least somewhat dose -dependent. If a study subject presents with 
thigh or groin pain, she will be immediately evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture.   
 
 
Imaging studies  
Over the 15-month  study period, subjects will recei ve the following imaging studies:  
 
Study Type  DATA -2 DATA -2-EX Radiation 
exposure per 
scan  
DXA of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip, 
and radius.  5 (including 
screen)  [ADDRESS_1223433] of the distal tibia 
and radius  4 2 <0.[ADDRESS_1223434] of the hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  2 1 510 mrem  
 
The total dose for the  DATA -2 15-month study is therefore ~1000 mrem . The total dose for DATA -2-
EX (months 15 -42)  is ~500 mrem..  This amount of radiation is equal to the background radiation one 
is exposed from the earth and sky over 3.25 years (for DATA -2) and 1.5 years (for DATA -2-EX).  
 
The total dose for the observational visit alone is 0.[ADDRESS_1223435]'s choosing. Hypercalc emia is a well -described complication of 
teriparatide treatment.  Elevated blood calcium levels will be handled in the manner recently 
 
[ADDRESS_1223436] edited : 9/25/2019  recommended by [CONTACT_167677] (see below)  57.  
 
 
 
If serum calcium concentration is above 11.2 mg/dl, teriparatide will be stopped and serum calcium 
measured at least daily until normal.  Thereafter teriparatide will be resumed every other day and the 
above algorithm followe d, starting at "Reduce PTH to every other day".  
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that is currently monitoring DATA 1 will monitor DATA 2. 
This DSMB is comprised of experienced clinical investigators: [CONTACT_875985] (Chair), [CONTACT_875986], an d Douglass Hayden (biostatistician).  Adverse events and serious adverse events will be 
reported to all appropriate regulatory bodies as required by [CONTACT_167683].  
 
A NIAMS -appointed DSMB will provide safety oversight for DATA -2-EX. This DSMB will me et as per 
NIAMS/KAI guidelines. As per NIAMS reporting requirements, all adverse events will be reported in 
the routine safety reports and all serious adverse events regardless of relatedness will be reported to 
the DSMB Safety Officer and the NIAMS, throu gh KAI (NIAMS Executive Secretary), within 48 hours 
of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_875969].  
 
Adverse events or other unanticipated problems will be reported to the Partners Human Research 
Committee (PHRC) within 7 calendar days/[ADDRESS_1223437] edited : 9/25/2019

Objectives : Primary objective:  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of D iazepam 
Buccal Film (DB F) at the recommended dose regimen (range 10 mg to  
17.5 mg according to body weight) compared with Diastat® (DRG) at 
the labeled  dose regimen  (range 10 mg to 20 mg  according to  body 
weight) in adult male and female subjects on a stable concomitant 
regimen of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AED) for the treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , 
following a moderate -fat meal .  
Secondary objectives : 
• Evaluate the PK of single doses of DBF following a high -fat meal 
compared  with DRG following a moderate -fat meal at the 
recommended dose regimen in adult male and female subjects on a 
stable concomitant regimen of AED  for the t reatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] . 
• Assess the safety -tolerability of single doses of DB F and DRG 
administered to adult male and female subjects on a stable concomitant regimen of AEDs under fed  conditions . 
Study Design:  Randomized, multiple centers, single -dose, open -label, three -period, 
three -treatment, two-sequence crossover study  under fed conditions .  
Periods 1 and 2: E ach subject will receive both DBF and DRG in a randomized 
sequence fo llowing a moderate- fat meal administered according to weight 
category. DBF will be administered according to the currently recommended 
dose regimen (derived by [CONTACT_671954]). DRG will be administered depending on weight category according 
to the current product labeling for Diastat®.  
Period 3: Subjects may be asked to participate in period 3.  Subjects who 
volunteer to participate in Period 3 will receive a second dose of DBF 
administered in exactly the same manner as the earlier dose of DBF  with the 
exception that DBF in Period 3 will be administered following a high -fat meal.  
Subjects:  No more than 32  male and female volunteers, ≥  18 and ≤  65 years of age, 
smoker and/or non -smoker , with body weight between 38 and 134  kg  (83 - 294 
lbs.) on a concomitant stable regimen including one or more AED.  
A stable regimen of AED is defined as no change in the prescribed AED regimen 
during the [ADDRESS_907830] 
16 subjects with representation of both genders, representation across the five weight categories of subjects taking one or more AED known to induce 
diazepam metabolism, and representation o f subjects taking sodium 
divalproex/valproic ac id. Subjects who are eligible may be enrolled without 
regard to weight category.
 Since only explorator y PK  data will be gathered 
from  treatment period  3, no more than  50% of the subjects who complete 
Period 1 and Period 2 will p articipate in Period 3.   
Screening Procedures:  Demographic data, medical and medication histories, physical examination, brief 
neurologic examination, body measurements,  oral cavity  examination,  
electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs  (blood pressure [ BP], heart rate [ HR], and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR]), oral temperature , digital oxygen monitoring , hematology,

biochemistry, HIV, hepatiti s B and C tests, urinalysis,  baseline AED level s*, 
alcohol breath test, urine pregnancy test,  and urine drug screen.  
*Unless baseline  levels of concomitant AED  were obtained within one year prior 
to the first dosing and show levels within an  acceptable therapeutic range.  
Confinements , Visits,  and 
Washout:  For each period, subjects will be confined from approximately  [ADDRESS_907831] the blood sample collected at 
home by a home care nurse.   
There will be a washout period of 28  days between doses.  
Drug Administration:  In Period 1 and Period 2, s ubjects  will receive T reatment  A and Treatment  B 
following a moderate -fat meal,  in a randomized sequence . Subjects who 
volunteer to participate in Period 3 will receive DBF following a high -fat meal. 
In each p eriod, s ubjects will receive a single dose according to body weight, as 
described  in the following table:

Data from nordiazepam will be reported and presented as supportive data.  
Statistical Analyses:  Pharmacokinetics:  
For diazepam and nordiazepam, using GLM procedures in SAS, ANOVA will be 
performed on untransformed T max, K el, and T ½ el and on ln- transformed  AUC 0-t, 
AUC 0-inf, Cmax, Cl/F, Cl/F/kg, V d/F, and V d/F/kg at the alpha level of 0.05. 
Factors incorporated in the model will include: Sequence, Subject(Sequence), 
Period, and Treatment. T max will be analyzed using an additional non parametric 
test (Wilcoxon signed -rank test).  
Treatment Comparison Following a Moderate -Fat Meal:  
The ratio of geometric means will be calculated for AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max  
for the Test product versus the Refer ence product ( A/B) irrespective of weight 
category . The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means, based on 
least-squares means from the ANOVA of the ln transformed data will also be 
calculated. Intra and inter -subject coefficient of variati on will be estimated.  
Treatment Comparison Following Different Meal Conditions:   
An e xploratory pair -wise analys is comparing DBF following a high -fat meal 
(Treatment C) with DRG following a moderate -fat meal  (Treatment B) will also 
be conducted and reported.  
Additional analys es may be performed.   
Details of the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Safety and tolerability:  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148]. Changes from b aseline 
values in vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory parameters will be evaluated. 
Safety and tolerability data will be reported using descriptive statistics.  Details of 
the safety and tolerability analyses will be provided in the SAP.

72, 96, 120, 144, 192, and [ADDRESS_907857] of these effects are thought to result from a facilitation of the action 
of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous 
system.2 
Diazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance approved for  the treatment of anxiety, acute 
alcohol withdrawal, skeletal muscle spasm, and convulsive disorders. Diazepam is used as 
adjunctive treatment of seizures other than status epi[INVESTIGATOR_671925], refractory patients with partial seizures or generalized t onic-clonic seizures who require intermittent use of diazepam to 
control bouts of increased seizure activity .
2 It is used off -label for numerous other conditions 
including insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and pre -/post -operative sedation.  
Diazepam  can be taken by [CONTACT_1966], inserted into the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected 
intravenously. When given intravenously, effects begin in one  to five  minutes. When diazepam is 
taken orally, effects may b e delayed as long as [ADDRESS_907858] that diazepam acts to suppress 
seizures through an interaction with γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors of the A -type 
(GABA A).3 GABA A receptors mediate the sedative, anterograde amnesic, anticonvulsive, 
anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and temporal/spatial memory effects of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].1 It is 
believed that diazepam enhances the actions of GABA by [CONTACT_671957] A receptors located within the limbic system, including areas of the thalamus and 
hypothalamus.  
GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, acts at these 
receptors to open the membrane channel, and allows chloride ions to flow into neurons. Excessive neuronal depolarization is implicated in the generation and spread of seizures.
3 Entry 
of chloride ions causes an inhibitory potential that reduces the ability of neurons to depolarize to 
the threshold potential necessary to produce action potentials, ultimately  leading to membrane 
hyperpolarization and a decrease in neuronal excitability.  
5.2.2 Metabolism and Elimination  
Diazepam is extensively metabolized to one major active metabolite (N -desmethyldiazepam 
[nordiazepam]) and two minor active metabolites, 3- hydroxydia zepam (temazepam) and 3 -
hydroxy -N-diazepam (oxazepam) in plasma. At therapeutic doses, under steady state conditions, 
desmethyldiazepam is found in plasma at concentrations equivalent to those of diazepam, while 
oxazepam and temazepam are not usually detectable. Both diazepam and desmethyldiazepam bind extensively to plasma proteins (95- 98%) .
3 
The volume of distribution of Diastat  rectal gel is calculated to be approximately 1 L/kg. 
Following rectal administration of a 15 mg dose of Diastat, the mean elimination half -life was 
reported to be about 46 hours (CV=43%) for diazepam and 71 hours (CV=37%) for desmethyldiazepam .
3 After oral administration, the initial distribution phase is followed by a 
prolonged terminal elimination phase, with a half -life up to 48 hours, and the ter minal 
elimination half -life of the active metabolite N -desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours.4 
The metabolism of diazepam is primarily hepatic and involves demethylation (involving primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) and 3- hydroxylation (involving primarily CYP3A4), 
followed by [CONTACT_12075]. The marked inter -individual variability in the clearance of 
diazepam reported in the literature is probably attrib utable to variability of CYP2C19 (which is 
known to exhibit genetic polymorphism; about 3- 5% of Caucasians have little or no activity and 
are “poor metabolizers”) and CYP3A4. No inhibition was demonstrated in the presence of inhibitors selective for CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, indicating that these enzymes are not significantly involved in metabolism of diazepam .
3 
Diazepam and its meta bolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates.4

5.2.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Following rectal administration, diazepam is well absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations 
in 1.5 hours,3 and the absolute bioavailability of Diastat rectal gel relative to Va lium injectable is 
90%.  
After Valium oral administration, the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 –
1.5 hours, with a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours, and more than 90% of diazepam is absorbed. Valium 
absorption is delayed and decreased when diazepam is administered with a moderate -fat meal. In 
the presence of food, mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hour s in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C
max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve (AUC; range 15% to 50%) when administered with food.4 
5.3 Diastat® AcuDialTM  
Diazepam rectal gel administered after the onset of acute repetitive and prolonged seizures has been shown to significantly reduce seizure recurrence and emergency department admissions. Nonetheless, social objections to and legal concerns about rectal administration have limited its 
use.
[ADDRESS_907859] demonstrated that the effectiveness of anticonvulsant medication to terminate seizures rapi[INVESTIGATOR_671926]. Further, it has been demonstrated that if seizures are not terminated quickly, escalating doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_671927].

5.4 Diazepam Buccal Film  (DBF) 
One new route of diazepam administration is via buccal soluble film. Buccal soluble diazepam 
(DBF) may be particularly well -suited for administration in outpatient settings. The study drug is 
administered by [CONTACT_80351], where it adheres, and 
allows for transbuccal absorption of diazepam. There is no need to position or disrobe the subject. Additionally, there is less potential for delay in initial treatment and greater subject and 
caregiver acceptance with improved compliance may also be expected.  
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_907860] focused  on assessing its relative bioavailability to the 
reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel, dose proportionality, assessment of food effect, and the pharmacokinetics in subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Overall safety and tolerability have 
been assessed in cl inical trials conducted with DB F.  
Aquestive Therapeutics initiated development of DBF , specifically intended for buccal delivery 
for subjects who require control of intermittent bouts of seizure activity. DBF  contains the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA ) approved active ingredient diazepam, a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], as a 
treatment for the management of selected, refractory subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], on stable regimens 
of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_283180]. The study drug, with a planned dose range of 5 mg to 17.5 mg, is expected to 
achieve peak plasma concentrations of diazepam equivalent to the reference therapy, Diastat
® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel. The DBF  product is intended for submission as a 505(b)(2) New Drug 
Application (NDA) using Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel as the reference therapy.  
5.5 Background on Diazepam Buccal Film ( DBF ) 
Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel is prescribed for increased seizure activity as defined by a marked 
increase in seizure activity, sometimes heralded by [CONTACT_105] -convulsive symptoms that are 
characteristic for each subject and deemed by [CONTACT_671958] a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_671930].
3 Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel has been marketed in the 
US since 1997 and currently is the only FDA approved drug in the US for this indication.  
Though the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel formulation is co nsidered safe and effective, the route 
of administration is less than ideal. The mechanics of administering a rectal gel can be a difficult, time-consuming, and embarrassing experience for both subject and care -givers alike. For 
example, the subject or car egiver must first remove articles of clothing and then place the subject 
in an appropriate position. The Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal gel syringe tip is inserted into the 
rectum to a specific depth and the gel expressed into the rectal vault. However, improper  
technique can lead to subject injury, and leakage of gel from the rectum can result in incomplete dosing. Additionally, some subjects have a negative view of the rectal route of administration, and this may reduce compliance to treatmen t. Each of these fa ctors has a potential influence on 
subject morbidity. Persistent seizure activity is associated with less favorable outcomes across a spectrum of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_80303]. Further, it has been demonstrated that if seizures are not terminated quickly, escal ating doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_671931] y to anticonvulsant therapy.  
The DB F is intended for application to the inner aspect of the cheek where it adheres, dissolves, 
and releases the drug into the buccal mucosa. Though buccal absorption is expected as the primary route of absorption of the drug, some absorption through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
may be possible due to swallowing of some dissolved drug substance in the saliva. It is exp ected 
that that timing of use of the buccal film will be similar to the use of Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal 
gel, i.e., the film would be administered after a seizure with characteristics for which the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) would be indicated.

5.5.1 Nonclinical Studies  
Mechanism of Action:  Diazepam is a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_671932] -anxiety, 
sedative, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties. Although the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_671959] -seizure effects is unknown, animal and in vitro studies suggest that 
diazepam acts to suppress seizures through an interaction with γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
receptors of the A -type (GABA A).3 GABA A receptors mediate the sedative, anterograde amnesic, 
anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and temporal/spatial memory effects of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].
1 It is believed that diazepam enhances the actions of GABA by [CONTACT_671960] A receptors located within the limbic system, including areas of 
the thalamus and hypothalamus.  
GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, acts at these 
receptors to open the membrane channel, and allows chloride ions to flow into neurons. 
Excessive neuronal depolarization is implicated in the generation and spread of seizures.3 Entry 
of chloride ions causes an inhibitory potential that reduces the ability of neurons to depolarize to 
the threshold potential necessary to produce action potentials, ul timately leading to membrane 
hyperpolarization and a decrease in neuronal excitability.  
Metabolism and Elimination:  It has been reported in the literature that diazepam is extensively 
metabolized to one major active metabolite (desmethyldiazepam) and two minor active 
metabolites, 3 -hydroxydiazepam (temazepam) and 3 -hydroxy -N-diazepam (oxazepam). With 
steady state dosing, desmethyldiazepam is found in plasma at concentrations equivalent to those 
of diazepam while oxazepam and temazepam are not usually detect able. The metabolism of 
diazepam is primarily hepatic and involves demethylation (involving primarily CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4) and 3- hydroxylation (involving primarily CYP3A4), followed by [CONTACT_12075]. The 
marked inter -individual variability in the clearanc e of diazepam reported in the literature is 
probably attributable to variability of CYP2C19 (which is known to exhibit genetic 
polymorphism; about 3- 5% of Caucasians have little or no CYP2C19 activity and are “poor 
metabolizers”) and CYP3A4. No inhibition was demonstrated in the presence of inhibitors 
selective for CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, indicating that these enzymes 
are not significantly involved in metabolism of diazepam.[ADDRESS_907861]. These comprise two bioavailability pi[INVESTIGATOR_671933]® (1899 and 1900), a dose -proportionality study (162013), a bioavailability study in 
comparison with Diastat® gel (162021), and two food effect studies. A two -arm food effect study 
investigated the effect of a high fat meal (Study 162022). A four -arm food effect study compared 
the pharmacokinetics of diazepam (A) fasting in an upright position after dosing (B) fasting in a 
reclining position after dosing (C) Following a high fat meal in a reclining position after dosing  (D) Following a mo derate fat meal in a reclining position after dosing (Study172018).

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety in Clinical Studies  
It is anticipated that the adverse event (AE) profile from systemic exposure observed with study drug will resemble the already well -known profile for diazepam in general and the reference 
therapy, Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal gel, in particular. Diazepam rectal gel AE data were collected 
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_907862] frequent AE reported with diazepam rectal gel in the two double -blind, placebo- controlled 
studies was somnolence (23%). Less frequent AEs were headache (≤5%), diarrhea (≤4%), ataxia 
(≤3%), dizziness (≤3%), euphoria (≤3%), incoordination (≤3%), rash (≤3%), vasodilatation 
(≤2%), and asthma (≤2%).[ADDRESS_907863] been a total of 154 subjects enrolled, with  132 
subjects (65.9% male, 34.1% female; age range 19 -64) having received at least one dose of study 
drug.  A total of 268 doses of DBF and 119 doses of Diastat® AcuDial™ were administered.1 
Sixty -five percent of all administrations of DBF (n = 1 75) and 63.9% (n=78) of Diastat 
administrations were followed by [CONTACT_541974] (TEAE). A 
total of 252 TEAEs were reported following administrations of DBSF; the majority were mild 
(90.9%) or moderate (8.3%) in severity.  80.1% were deemed to be possibly or probably related 
to study drug. Of 103 TEAEs reported following Diastat doses, 98%were mild and 2% were 
moderate. 75.7% were possibly or probably related.1   
There was 1 serious adverse event (SAE) reported and [ADDRESS_907864] and fed conditions. Adverse events were 
primarily mild to moderate in severity, short- lasting and consistent with the known 
pharmacologic effects of diazepam. There were few SAEs reported and no events associated 
with death or lasting impairment were observed.1 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics in Clinical Studies  
Pharmacokinetics:  A 15 mg dose of Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel following rectal 
administration  produces peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours, with absolute bioavailability of 
90% relative to Valium® injectable. The volume of distribution of diazepam rectal gel is 
calculated to be approximately 1 L/kg. The mean elimination half -life of diazepam and 
desmethyldiazepam following administration of a 15 mg dose of diazepam rectal gel was found 
to be about 46 hours ( CV=43% ) and 71 hours (CV=37%), respectively. Both diazepam and its 
major active metabolite desmethyldiazepam bind extensively to plasma pro teins (9 5-98%).3

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4287] 1899 and 1900 
The Sponsor conducted two randomized, open label, single -dose, fasting condition, crossover 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_671934]® AcuDial™ rectal gel. The planned enrol lment 
was 12 subjects in both studies. 
Study 1899 compared study drug 5 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel [ADDRESS_907865] t o area under the curve (AUC t and AUC inf), i.e., the 90% confidence interval (CI) 
for the ratio of geometric means was within the acceptable range of 80% -125%. For C max, the 
ratio of geometric means was 1.07 with the 90% CI 87.1 -131.5%. The median T max was 0.67 
hours for the DBF (range 0.33- 1.50 hours) and 0.25 hours for the Diastat rectal gel (range 0.15-
1.00 hours). The difference in T max values was not statistically significant.1 
Study 1900 compared DB F 20 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 20 mg. Evaluable data from 
10 subjects who completed both treatments showed that the extent of the absorption of DBF 
20 mg was comparable to Diastat® AcuDial™ 20 mg rectal gel, with the ratio of geometric 
means for AUC t and AUC ∞ within the acceptable range of 80 -125%. For C max, the ratio of 
geometric means was 158.72% (90% CI 122.81- 205.14). The median T max was 1.25 hours for the 
DBF (range 0.36- 2.05 hours) and 1.00 hours for the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel (range 0.25 -
2.00 hours). The difference in T max values was not statistically significant. Examination of the 
mean plasma curves for D BF and Diastat® Acu Dial™ showed that although the C max was higher 
for the D BF relative to Diastat® AcuDial™, the pharmacokinetics were comparable in terms of 
rapid rate of absorption, duration of plateau, and the rate of elimination.1 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Study 162013 – Dose -Proportionality 
Study 162013 was a single -dose, randomized, open- label, three -period, six -sequence, crossover 
study conducted to as sess dose -proportionality of DB SF at doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg. A total of 
30 subjects were randomized and dosed in the study. Analysis of the pharmac okinetic data 
confirmed that DB SF is dose -proportional over the dose range 5 mg to 15 mg ( Table 1 ). The 
criteria for dose proportionality were met for diazepam since for both comparisons (A/B: D BSF 
5 mg/DB SF 10 mg and C/B: DB SF 15 mg/DBSF 10 mg), the geometric mean 90% CI of the 
ratios of Least -Squares means from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the ln -transformed 
AUC t, AUC ∞, and C max were within the acceptable range 80 -125%.1

bioavailability  of diazepam administered as DM F compared with Diastat® AcuDial™ gel is 
118% to 128%.1

reclining on his/her side (application site downward) for 15 minutes after application. This was 
based on aligning treatme nt administration with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_671935] a 
postictal state and the Sponsor’s interest in investigating whether position affected diazepam PK  
following administration of DB F.1  
Analysis comprised pairwise comparisons of Treatment C (high- fat meal, reclining) and 
Treatment D (moderate- fat meal, reclining) with Treatment B (fasting, reclining) as well as a 
comparison between Treatment B (fasting, reclining) with Treatment A (fasting, upright).1 
Overall, AUC t and AUC ∞ were not affected by [CONTACT_80354]. C max after the high fat 
meal (reclining) was approximately 53% of the fasting value (reclining), 90% CI: 41.1% - 59.5% 
(ratio of geometric means). C max after the moderate fat meal (reclining) was approximately 67% 
of the fasting value (reclining), 90% CI  59.8% -  74.6% (ratio of geometric means). Comparison 
of Treatment B with Treatment A demonstrated that position in the fasting condition (reclining versus upright) had no meaningful effect on either C
max or AUC. Diazepam profiles (reclining 
versus upright ) met bioequivalence criteria for the upright and fasting condition. There was no 
difference in T max, p = 0.4979.1 
Median T max fasting, upright was 1.00 hour with range 0.28 hour to 2.03 hours. Median T max 
fasting, reclining was 0.80 hour with range 0.50 hour to 2.03 hours whereas median T max after a 
high fat meal, reclining was 2.01 hours with range 0.50 hour to 4.06 hours (p = 0.0147 versus fasting,  reclining). and median T
max after a moderate fat meal, reclining was 3.00 hours with 
range 0.50 hour to 4.02 hours (p = 0.0005 versus fasting, reclining).[ADDRESS_907872] to C max. Also, as described above, the data from Study 162022 and 
Study 172018 demonstrate that food taken within 30 minutes prior to dosing affects the rate (but not the extent) of absorption of diazepam administered as DBF. Accordingly, Aquestive used population PK modeling to select a dosing regimen to compensate for the differences in PK

between DBF and DRG. The recommendation for adults derived from Population PK modelling 
is a weight -based dosing regimen with doses of 10.0 mg, 12.5 mg, 15.0 mg, 15.0 mg, and 17.5 
mg for the five weight bins (weight range 38 to 111 kg) corresponding to the labeled Diastat 
doses of 10.0 mg, 12.5 mg , 15.0 mg, 17.5 mg, and 20.0 mg  (Table 3 ).1

Using data from Study 162013, Study 162021, and Study 172018, population pharmacokinetic 
modeling was used to model the pharmacokinetic profiles for DBF and Diastat  rectal gel under 
fasted and fed conditions. In brief, the recommended DBF dose for each weight class as defined in the Diastat rectal gel label was selected (1) to provide a dose sufficiently high to ensure that the predicted median of the resulting diaze pam C
max following a moderate fat meal was similar to 
the median C max following the labeled dose of Diastat rectal gel, and (2) to provide a dose for 
which the predicted median of the resulting diazepam C max under fasting conditions would not 
exceed the median C max values observed and demonstrated as safe in Phase 1 studies with DBF. 
It was demonstrated that the predicted median diazepam C max values with the proposed regimen 
administered under fasting conditions did not meaningfully exceed the median C max values 
observed in the 115 healthy volunteers (adult men and women) who received DBF 15 or 20 mg under fasting conditions in Phase 1 studies conducted by [CONTACT_671961]. The median C
max among 
these 115 healthy subjects (138 DBF administrations) was 486 ng/mL. Under conditions of a moderate fat meal, the proposed DBF dosing regimen produces a C
max similar to the C max 
expected following the labeled dose of Diastat rectal gel.[ADDRESS_907873] udy to investigate the PK of DB F in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_671936] a regimen of AEDs 
(Aquestive Study 160326) indicated that diazepam plasma concentrations observed in patients were on average lower than t he concentrations predicted from healthy volunteer data.  Lower 
diazepam concentrations in patients could result from drug interactions with concomitant AEDs by [CONTACT_671962]/or displacement of diazepam f rom binding sites on albumin (as described for valproic acid and sodium divalproex).   
If the lower plasma diazepam concentrations observed in patients vs. healthy volunteers following DB F is a consequence of enzyme induction and/or protein binding displac ement from 
concomitant AEDs, the same effect of concomitant AEDs would be expected f ollowing 
administration of DRG, and the relative bioavailability  of diazepam administered as DB F 
compared with DRG should be the same in pa tients as in healthy volunteers .  
In the current study, the PK of diazepam will be compared in  patients  already receiving  a stable 
concomitant AED treatment following  single dose s of DB F or Diastat
® AcuDial™  according  to

180323 Diazepam  Buccal Film  DRG Crossover  Aquestive Therapeutics

body weight as described in  Table 3 . Moreover, t he DBF regimen was demonstrated in healthy 
male and female volunteer simulations to produce within each weight group a median C max value 
following a moderate -fat meal comparable to th e median C max value following DRG 
administration. Therefore Period 1 and Period 2 of this study will be conducted under fed 
conditions where DBF and Diastat® AcuDial™ will be administered following intake of a 
moderate- fat meal.  In addition, subjects who volunteer to participate in a third period will receive 
DBF in Period [ADDRESS_907874] period will allow for the PK evaluation of 
DBF following a single dose administration under conditions of a high -fat meal .  
The study will also aim to obtain PK data for Diastat® AcuDial™ under conditions  of use in 
patient population and to address whether lower concentrations observed in patients versus healthy volunteers following DBF administration are also observed following Diastat
® 
AcuDial™ adm inistration. The study will also determine whether the DBF recommended dose 
regimen (mappi[INVESTIGATOR_671937]® AcuDial™) developed from healthy volunteer 
data is applicable to patients under conditions of use.  
The weight -based DBF dose regimen was designed to e licit within each weight group a median 
Cmax value following a moderate fat meal comparable to the median C max value following DRG 
administered according to the current weight -based product labeling for Di astat® AcuDial™. 
Because of the crossover design, the effect of drug -drug interactions can be expected to be 
similar for both treatments.  Therefore, to the extent that population PK modeling in healthy 
volunteers is predictive for patients under conditions of use, it can be expected that diazepam C
max values observed in this study following a moderate -fat meal will be  similar under both 
treatments.  In the event that this is not the case, Aquestive anticipates that results from this study will be used to r efine the recommended dose regimen in consultation and collaboration with the 
Agency.  
5.8 Clinical Risks/Benefits of Study Drug  
5.8.1 Managing Clinical Risks/Benefits in the Current Study  
The available data indicate that study drug is dose proportional over the studied dose -range, 
while Diastat
® AcuDial™ is less than dose proportional with respect to C max.  
In this study, dose is based on weight category ( Table 3 ). Subjects will be  weighed at screening 
visit and dose dispensed will be adjusted depending on weight category at that visit. The rationale for the dose regimen for DBF is explained in Se ction 5.6. Trained study site  staff will 
administer the study drug. The study design includes several study site visits in each period to monitor safety and tolerability.  
5.8.2 Overdosage  Information Derived from Diastat
® AcuDialTM Prescribing 
Information  
According to the prescribing information for Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel , previous reports of 
diazepam overdosage have shown that manifestations of diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma, and diminished reflexes. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal. General supportive  measures should be employed, along with intravenous fluids,

16 subjects with representation of both genders, representation of subjects  taking /not taking one 
or more AED known to induce diazepam metabolism, and representation of subjects  taking/not 
taking Sodium divalproex/valproic acid.   
No clinical studies have been conducted with diazepam rectal gel in pregnant women. However, 
an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_671938]. There have been reports of neonatal flaccidi ty, respi[INVESTIGATOR_671939], and hypothermia in children born to mothers who have been receiving 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_671940]. Children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_500295] a 
regular basis late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during 
the postnatal period. During labor and delivery, measurable amounts of diazepam have been found in maternal and cord blood, indicating placental transfer of the drug. Additionally, 
diazepam and its metabolites may be  present in human breast milk for prolonged periods of time 
after acute use. A recent study suggested that paternal exposure may be associated with fetal 
abnormalities.
[ADDRESS_907876] been no studies conducted in pregnant women, it is uncertain whether there is 
human fetal risk associated with the use of diazepam. Therefore, non -pregnant, non- lactating 
females will be inclu ded in the study. Any f emales of childbearing potential will be included if 
they use appropriate methods of contraception. In addition, non- surgically -sterile male subjects 
who are sexually active with non -sterile female partners will be required to use effective 
contraceptive methods for  the duration of the study and for 111 days  following administration of 
the study medication.

6. Objectives  
Primary objective:  
• Evaluate the PK of single doses of DB F at the recommended dose regimen (range 10 mg 
to 17.5 mg according to body weight) compared with DRG at the labeled dose regimen 
(range 10 mg to 20 mg according to body weight) in adult male and female subjects on a 
stable concomitant regimen of AED for the treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , following a 
moderate- fat meal .  
Secondary objective s: 
• Evaluate the PK of single doses of DBF following a high- fat meal compared with DRG 
following a moderate -fat meal at the recommended dose regimen in adult male and 
female subjects on a stable concomitant regimen of AED for the treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
• Assess the safety -tolerability of single doses of DB F and DRG administered to adult male 
and female subjects on a stable concomitant regimen of AEDs under f ed conditions . 
7. Study Desig n 
This will be a randomized, multiple centers, single -dose, open -label, t hree- period, 
three- treatment, two -sequence crossover study under f ed conditions.  
The study will evaluate single doses of DB F compared with DRG administered according to 
weight category in adult male and female subjects on a stable concomitant regimen  of AED for 
the treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. A stable regimen of AED is defined as no change in the prescribed 
AED regimen during the 30- day period prior to the first study drug administration and no change 
anticipated in the prescribed AED regimen over the course o f study participation until the last 
PK blood sample collection.  
Subjects will receive Treatment A and Treatment B  (DB F and  DRG following a moderate -fat 
meal ) in Period 1 and Period 2 in a randomized sequence, and at a dosage  specific to body  
weight, as described  in Table 4 . DBF will be administered according to the  currently 
recommended dose regimen (derived by [CONTACT_671963] i n healthy 
volunteers). DRG will be administered depending on weight  category according to the current 
product labeling for Diastat®. Subjects may be asked to participate in a third period, on a 
voluntary basis . Subjects who volunteer to participate in a third period will  receive a second 
dose of DBF administered in exactly the same manner as the earlier dose of DBF with the 
exception that DBF in Period [ADDRESS_907877] 16 subjects with representation of both genders, re presentation across the five weight 
categories  of subjects taking  one or more AED s known to induce diazepam metabolis m, and 
representation of subjects taking  sodium divalproex/valproic acid.  Subjects who are eligible may  
be enrolle d without regard to weight category . Since only exploratory PK data will be 
gathered from treatment period  3, no more than 50% of the subjects who complete Period 1 
and Period 2 will participate in Period 3.  
This study is intended for filing under FDA regulations.

8. Study Population  
8.1 Sample Size  
Subjects will be enrolled to attain a sample size of no more than 32 subjects  (and a minimum of 
16 completed subj ects in Period 2).  Because this is not a formal hypothesis testing study, the 
sample size is proposed based on the desired level of precision for estimating pharmacokinetic 
parameters and the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters. In principle, t he expected 
precision of the estimates of the ratios of geometric means of interest can be estimated from the intra-subject variability observed in Aquestive Study 162021 (pharmacokinetic crossover of DBF 
15 mg with DRG 5, 12.5, and 20 mg in healthy volunteers). Aquestive has not undertaken a formal analysis to predict the expected precision.  
8.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects enrolled in this study will be members of the community at large . The recruitment 
advertisements  may use various media types (e.g. radio, newspaper, Web site, volunteer 
database ). Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study :

* The Investigator should confirm and document, for those AEDs medications that the patient is receiving at baseline screening, that AED drug level testing has been conducted within one year prior to the first dosing , and determine, in consultation with patient’s referring neurologist (if not 
the study Investigator), that AEDs are at acceptable therapeutic levels .  
For any AED medication where testing was not  conducted within one year before the first dosing 
or was determined in the past not to be therapeutic, the Investigator should obtain and confirm a blood test res ult demonstrating a current therapeutic level for that AED medication .  If the 
Investigator determines that a dose adjustment for that AED medication is needed, then the patient will be considered not to be stable on their AED medication regimen, and ineli gible for 
study enrollment.  
For eligibility purposes, abnormal  laboratory or vital signs results may be repeated once if 
abnormal result is observed at the initial reading. Moreover, abnormalities found in the ECG may 
need to be confirmed by [CONTACT_671968]. In the event that the participation of a subject in 
the study is delayed and some screening procedures had been performed outside the prescribed 
screening window, outdated screening procedures can be repeated.

Further details regarding the proper shipment, storage conditions, dispensing, or responsibilities 
will be provided by [CONTACT_671970]. 
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_907908] before the dosing procedure. 
Subjects will receive a single dose according to their body weight (as described in  Table 4 ). The 
body weight of each subject will be measured at screening and this value will be used to 
calculate the exact individual dose of diazepam required.  
Following each study drug administration, su bjects will remain in a safe comfortable position 
(sitting or reclining in bed) for at least one hour after dosing to allow for an assessment of drug 
effect including sedation. After one hour and depending on the assessment of the investigator/clinical sta ff, the subject may be permitted to ambulate provided that ambulation 
does not interfere with study procedures.   
DBF ease of use will be evaluated by [CONTACT_671971] [ADDRESS_907909] experience in using DRG or 
other rescue medication for the treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_671942]. Questions are listed in Appendix I – Diazepam PK Study Participant Questions . 
Test ( Treatment A  and Treatment C ): 
After the overnight fast, subjects will be served a stand ardized moderate -fat meal (Treatment A, 
Period  1 or Period 2) or a high -fat, high -calorie meal (Treatment C, Period  3). Subjects will have 
20 ± 1 minutes to finish the meal. The study drug will be administered 30 ± [ADDRESS_907910] will be asked to move his/her tongue around the mouth (front and 
back part of gums, teeth and palate) two times to note any signs of oral irritation and/or any mouth, tongue or gum ulcer(s). Study staff will check the subjec ts’ mouth to ensure the mouth is 
clean and free of food before study drug administration. Subsequently, staff will center the DB F 
against the inner aspect of the right or left buccal mucosa (inside the cheek) and ask the subject to close his/her mouth in a  natural way, without swallowing, che wing, biting or breaking the 
DBF (refer to Appendix III - Placement Diagram for Aquestive Therapeutics  Buccal Film). If the 
subject chews , talks , or moves the study drug within [ADDRESS_907911] the time the film was swallowed.

9.7.4 Posture and Physical Activity  
Diazepam may cause sedation.  Consistent with intended use of DBF and the use of DRG subjects should be in a safe comfortable position (sitting or reclining in bed) for at least one hour after dosing to allow for an assessment of drug effect including sedation. After one hour and depending on the assessment of the investigator/c linical staff, the subject may be permitted to 
ambulate provided that ambulation does not interfere with study procedures.  Vital signs should be taken in a consistent position (sitting or reclining).  Subject visits to the bathroom or washroom will be monitored by [CONTACT_671955] 4 hours after each study drug administration, and the following information will be recorded: whether the subject urinated, defecated, or vomited. Subjects will be instructed not to flush if they vomit. Vomitus will be verified a nd noted in the 
subject’s file for further evaluation if needed.  
Because excessive physical activ ity may increase the level of C K above the upper normal limit 
value, subjects will be advised to avoid performing vigorous physical  activities (e.g., intense or 
long-distance running or biking, etc.)  at all times during the study duration ( from at least 5 days 
prior to admission), including the washout period.

Blood sample s will be collected as close as possible to nominal times; exact sample  collection 
times will be recorded on the appropriate source documents and reported for each subject. The actual time of blood sample collection will be used for PK and statistical analysis. Unless otherwise specified or for subject safety, when blood draws and other procedures coincide, blood draws will have precedence.  A saline  intravenous  catheter will be used for blood collection to 
avoid multiple skin punctures, when appropriate. Otherwise, blood samples will be collected by 
[CONTACT_37277].  
The total volume of blood including that collected for eligibility and safety purposes should not exceed [ADDRESS_907924] 
from a physician. Any abnormal repeated measurement  will be evaluated by a physician and  
repeated if judged necessary. Further action may be taken upon physician's request.  
Subjects will be advised to notify their health care professional(s) (e.g., physician, dentist, and/or 
pharmacist) that they are participating in a clinical research study on a new formulation of  
diazepam  before taking any medicines or undergoing any medic al procedure.

occurred after the previous administration of the study drug. The incidence, seriousness, severity, duration, and relation to study drug of all AEs will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug)  
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in decid ing whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations.

[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Severity of AEs  
Severity will be evaluated according to the following scale:  
Mild  Adverse event resulting in discomfort, but not sufficient to cause interference in 
normal dai ly activities.  
Moderate  Adverse event resulting in discomfort that is sufficient to cause interference in 
daily activities.  
Severe  Adverse event resulting in discomfort causing an inability to carry out normal 
daily activities.  
 
Adverse Event monitoring and reporting will be followed -up until resolution or for up to 2 weeks 
following completion of the study, after which the Investigator will decide the course of action.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessing Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relat ionship of all AEs to the drug, using the following scale:  
Probable  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to drug administration, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal.  
Possible  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to drug administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking 
or unclear.  
Unlikely  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship 
to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and which 
other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanation.  
Unrelated  This category is applicable to AEs which are judged to be clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (diseases, environment, etc.) and do not 
meet the c riteria for drug relationship listed for the above -mentioned conditions.  
All AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], who must approve the subject for subsequent dosing.  
The Investigator or designee will be present from approximately [ADDRESS_907936]’s visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up of AEs  
Any AEs, whether serious or non- serious, will be monitored throughout the study and followed 
to resolution or for up to [ADDRESS_907937] PK blood draw, after which the Investigator will 
decide the course of action.

9.13.2 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
Subjects will be instructed to inform clinic al personnel of AEs t hat may arise during the course 
of the study. Treatment of any AEs will be administered under the direction of  the Investigator.  
All symptoms will be recorded by [CONTACT_671974].  
When a ppropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of 
the event(s).  
Adverse events will be coded into the Preferred Term (PT), classified according to the current 
version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) with System Organ Classification (SOC) and reported with severity, duration, onset time and relationship to study drug and action taken.  
Female subjects of child -bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at all 
treatment visits. Following administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female subjects will be reported until the subject completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a c ompleted Pregnancy Report to  the 
Sponsor’s safety representative, Syneos Health  Safety & Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and must  assess the 
outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor’s safety representative, Syneos Health Safety & Pharmacovigilance of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_671975] a follow -up Pregnancy 
Report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is 
to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_110191] /faxing a completed SAE form to  the Sponsor’s safety representative,

A violation of the requirement to maintain a stable regimen of AEDs or a stable regimen of other 
concomitant drugs with the potential to influence diazepam pharmacokinetics will be considered a significant violation of study restrictions.  A change of drug  in the prescribed AED regimen 
and/or change in the dose of a prescribed AED will be considered a departure from a stable regimen.  Any subject who does not maintain a stable AED regimen in the course of the study will be presented in the concentrations and pharmacokinetic tables but excluded from descriptive statistics and ANOVA.  For cases in which a departure from a stable AED regimen is a matter of judgment, the decision will be made by [CONTACT_079]/Sub -Investigator and/or by [CONTACT_671977].

concentrations and pharmacokinetic tables but excluded from descriptive statistics and ANOVA 
if the p re-dose concentration is greater than 5% of the C max value for that analyte of that period 
for that subject.  
Subjects withdrawn due to vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_671948] 9.12 or due to adverse events will be presented but excluded from the statistical analyses (i.e., 
descriptive statistics and ANOVA).  
Data from subjects who experienced emesis during the sampling interval and who were not 
withdrawn as per criterion established under section 9.[ADDRESS_907944] who experienced emesis within 2 times median T
max 
of the current study (based on the reference product) will be excluded from the statistical 
analysis (i.e., descriptive statistics and ANOVA).  
12.3 Statistical Analyses  
Demographic parameters will be summarized descriptively. Treatment -emergent adverse events 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_671978] (safety 
population). No inferential statistical analysis of safety data is planned.  
Individual and mean plasma concentration versus time curves will be presented for both linear 
and semi -log scales. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geo metric means, standard deviation 
[SD], coefficient of variation [CV%], minimum [Min], maximum [Max], and median) of the 
plasma concentrations versus time and the pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented  for the 
Test and the Reference products for each weight c ategory  as well as irrespective of weight 
category . 
For diazepam and nordiazepam, using  GLM procedures in SAS, ANOVA will be performed on 
untransformed T max, Kel, and T ½ el and on ln- transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, Cmax, Cl/F, Cl/F/kg, 
Vd/F, and V d/F/kg  at the alpha level of  0.05. Factors incorporated in the model will include: 
Sequence, Subject (Sequence), Period, and Treatment. T max will be analyzed using an additional 
non-parametric test (Wilcoxon signed -rank test).  
12.3.1 Treatment Comparison DB F (Test) versus DRG (Reference) Following a 
Moderate -Fat Meal  
The ratio of geometric means will be calculated for AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max  for the  Test 
product versus the Reference product ( Treatment A/Treatment B) irrespective of weight 
category . The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means, based on least -squares  
means from the ANOVA of the ln- transformed data will also be calculated . Intra and inter -
subject coefficient of variation will be estimated.   
12.3.2 Treatment  Comparison  DBF (Test) versu s DRG (Reference) Following Different 
Meal Conditions  
An e xploratory pair -wise analys is comparing DBF following a  high -fat meal (Treatment C) with 
DRG following a moderate -fat meal (Treatment B)  will be conducted and reported.

The ratio of geometric means will be calculated for AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max for Treatment C 
versus Treatment B,  irrespective of weight category. The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of 
geometric means, based on least -squares means from the ANOVA of the ln -transformed data 
will also be calculated. Intra and inter -subject coefficient of variation will be estimated.   
Additional analyses may be performed.  
Details of the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
12.4 Safety and Tolerability Parameters and Ana lyses  
Demographic parameters will be summarized descriptively.  
Safety and tolerability to DB F will be evaluated through the assessment of AEs (i.e., seriousness, 
severity, relationship to the study drug, outcome, duration, and management ), vital signs, clinical 
laboratory parameters and physical examination. Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_671978] (safety population). Changes from 
baseline values in vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory parame ters will be evaluated. Safety 
and tolerability data will be reported using descriptive statistics. No inferential statistical analysis 
of safety data is planned.  
Details of the safety and tolerability  analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
13. Final Report  
A final report including clinical, bioanalytical, and statistical sections will be the responsibility of inVentiv. 
In the event that the study is prematurely terminated, inVentiv will produce an abbreviated safety 
report. In such an event, raw data will not be submitted with the abbreviated report but will be 
archived at inVentiv, unless requested by [CONTACT_1034].

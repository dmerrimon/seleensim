CTMS #17- 0033  Study Synopsis  
This is a therapeutic study investigating the use of cryotherapy in the prevention of chemotherapy -induced 
peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and associated nail toxicities. The therapeutic intervention will involve patients 
wearing an Elasto- Gel cold glove and wrap  on one hand and one foot (both on the right side or both on the left 
side) .  The patients will wear the glove and wrap  during each infusion of taxane chemotherapy. Infusion therapy, 
assessments and patient questionnaires will take place in the Mays Ca ncer Center  and the Nerve Conduction 
Studies (NCS)  will be performed at the Medical Arts and Research Center (MARC). The primary aim is to 
demonstrate if cryotherapy is a safe and effective intervention in preventing peripheral neuropathy and nail toxicity in patients receiving taxane chemotherapy. The secondary aim is evaluating the relation of CIPN with 
gene expression profiles of TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPM8 in peripheral blood.  
 
Background 
Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death for women and is the most common cause of death 
for women ages [ADDRESS_1222236] been identified, therefore, making the treatment more effective due to better targeting. 
Women with node -positive disease and a significant percentage of node- negative women benefit from 
chemotherapy2. Although there are some well -known algorithms of treatments, the choice of which 
chemotherapy to use is based on variables like age, comorbidities, axillary node involvement and status of 
hormone receptors. For those patients receiving chemotherapy, mult iple combinations are available;  one 
commonly used is doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel  3. Taxanes improve the disease- free and overall 
survival in patients with early breast cancer  4.  There are multiple taxane ch emotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], but they all share the 
common mechanism of action of stabilizing microtubules assembly5-[ADDRESS_1222237] of many anti -cancer drugs including platinum drugs, 
taxanes, vinca alkaloids, epothilones, bortezomib, and lenolidamide17-19. The overall incidence of CIPN is 
estimated to be approximately 38% in patients treated with multiple agents16 although this percentage varies 
depending on the different chemotherapy regimens used and the duration of the exposure. These effects of chemotherapy drugs can resolve after treatment ceases but many patients are left with permanent sensory 
deficient or chronic pain syndromes
18. Treatments for CIPN have been disappointing, with most agents 
demonstrating no significant analgesic effect. Therefore, interventions that can reduce the prevalence or severity of neuropathic symptoms in patients receiving chemotherapy will immediately have a significant impact on 
patient care.  
 
Breast cancer is a common malignancy that responds well to taxane- containing chemotherapeutic regimens
1. 
Women who develop peripheral neuropathy as a result of treatment with taxane chemotherapy can have lasting 
side effects  and significant decrease in their quality of life. Peripheral neuropathy can result in loss of ability to 
complete activities of daily living  such as walking, standing and self -care, and can also lead to difficult to treat 
chronic pain syndromes  10-11. Unfortunately, studies exploring a  variety of agents for the prevention of taxane -
induced peripheral neuropathy have so far been unsuccessful 12. For example, recent studies of Amifostine and 
recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (rhuLIF, AM424, emfilermin) were shown to have no neuro -
protective effect against paclitaxel  13-15.  
 In trials where neurosensory evaluation included electrophysiology or other quantitative sensory testing, the 
large majority of subjects receiving taxane containing chemotherapy regimens demonstrated physiologic 
changes indicative of peripheral neuropathy 
8. In a small prospective trial in women receiving paclitaxel for breast 
cancer, neuropathy occurred after the first or second dose in 84% of patients and was progressive in 7% 20. In 
total, 97% developed signs of peripheral neuropathy when evaluated with quantitative sensory testing. In another

Neuropathy Trial Version 1 3 –  
CTMS #17- 0033  study, all patients receiving paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin, developed significant changes on 
electrophysiology measures 21. Furthermore, in another trial, 20 of 21 patients (95%) developed a sensory -motor 
neuropathy  1 to 21 weeks after the initiation of paclitaxel therapy and progressed with each additional course. 
The neuropathy  was reported to be symmetrical, length dependent (neurons with longer axons were more likely 
to be affected) and was more evident in patients receiving higher doses of paclitaxel22.  
 Recently, we have found that chemotherapy drugs directly activate peripheral sensory nociceptors in Drosophila  
and mice via the activation of Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily A Member 1 (TRPA1)  
resulting in a neuropathic pain syndrome similar to human patients . (Boiko, N., Medrano, G., Montano, E., Jiang, 
N., Williams, C. R., Madungwe, N. B., et al. (2017). TrpA1 activation in peripheral sensory neurons underlies the ionic basis of pain hypersensitivity in response to vinca alkaloids. P LoS ONE , 12(10), e0186888. 
http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186888.g007 ).  Our working model based on our data and others is that the 
activation of TRPA1 during chemotherapy is a significant contributor to the neuropathic pain syndrome 
associated with CIPN.  Further , prolonged  hyperexcitation of the sensory neuron by [CONTACT_875151]1 could 
lead to excitotoxicity and neuropathy  during chemotherapy treatment programs .   
 
TRPA1 is a well- studied and evolutionarily -conserved chemical nociceptor expressed throughout the body 
including sensory nociceptors23 ,  Importantly, a  gain-of-function mutation in hTRPA1 has been linked to Familial 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_875140] (FEPS), a human pain syndrome associated with enhanced sensitivity to punctate stimuli and mustard oil 
25. This mutation was shown to result in a 5- fold increase in the inward current in response 
to channel activation supporting that inappropriate activation of hTRPA1 channels in sensory neurons is sufficient 
to generate pain in humans 25.  Thus, the activation of hTRPA1 during chemotherapy may be responsible for the 
neuropathic pain experienced during chemotherapy treatment and represent an important pathogenic event 
during CIPN.  In addition to TRPA1, related genes in the Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily 
V member 1  (TRPV1) and Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 8 (TRPM8) may 
also play a role in development of CIPN.   Currently, multiple clinical trials are studying TRPA1 antagonists 24. 
Showing the effect of activated TRPA1 in vivo and the subsequent development of CIPN, would provide support 
for targeting TRPA1 for the treatment and prevention of CIPN in patients receiving taxane based chemotherapy.  
In addition, it is predicted that baseline TRPA1 activity in pati ents could represent an important biomarker for the 
prognosis of CIPN,   
 
Recently, a form of cryotherapy using an Elasto- Gel frozen (4ºC) glove or wrap has been shown to reduce nail 
toxicity and oncholysis 30. Its role in preventing peripheral neuropathy has not been thoroughly studied but 
preliminary observations suggest a potential beneficial effect (31 - 32). Cryotherapy has been extensively studied 
and the proposed mechanism of action is that local vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to the extremity and 
consequently reduces the exposure to the taxane 30. This therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing 
toxicities within the oral cavity 33 and the scalp 32. In regards to the oncholysis, a study with patients treated with 
docetaxel served as their own controls with a glove placed on the right hand starting 15 minutes prior to 
treatment, and extending 15 minutes after the infusion ended. Nail changes where observed in 51% in the 
untreated hand versus 11% in the cold glove hand 35. In the second trial, patients wore a frozen sock on their 
right foot using the same protocol. Grade 1 and 2 nail toxicity was 0% in the treated side and 21% in the untreated 
extremity  36. The intervention was well tolerated wit h only one of fifty patients withdrawing due to cold 
intolerances. Therefore, extremity cooling therapy provides a potential opportunity to reduce both peripheral neuropathies and nail toxicities related to taxane based chemotherapy.  
 
The importance of the study relies on the high incidence of debilitating symptoms as a result of breast cancer 
treatment, which has a high clinical and public health significance 37-39. Additionally, after completing treatment 
only approximately 50- 60% of the patients have improvement of the neuropathy; therefore, an important 
percentage of people remain affected by [CONTACT_432210]. Furthermore t here are no established agents that can 
be recommended for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents, 
and establishing a link between CIPN and activation of TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPM8 genes allows for the 
exploration of prevention with TRPA1 agonists.

Study Design  
 Overview:  
This is a therapeutic study investigating the use of cryotherapy  in the prevention of taxane -induced peripheral 
neuropathy and associated nail toxicities. Study subjects will be recruited primarily at the Mays Cancer Center  
Breast Oncology Clinic. Patients who are to receive taxane based chemotherapy regimens as part of their breast 
cancer treatment will be offered participation in the trial. Informed consent will take place at the Mays Cancer 
Center . A member of the patient’s medical team will introduce the coordinator, who will present the study and 
answer any questions or concerns of the patient. Once consented, the patient will complete the Patient Information Questionnaire and schedule a time for baseline data collection (Appendix 1). The questionnaire will 
cover: history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud’s, smoking, alcohol us e, recent weight changes, 
current medications, as well as history of surgery to the extremities, pre -existing neurological conditions, and 
current activity level. Several of these demographic characteristics are suspected to be risk factors in the 
developm ent of CIPN (e.g., diabetes, and alcoholism). Other risk factors have been implicated in the 
development of peripheral neuropathy not related to CIPN (e.g., statins, weight loss, pre -existing neurologic 
conditions).  
 
Administration of therapy and assessments will take place in the Breast Oncology Clinic and Infusion Clinics at 
the Mays Cancer Center . A member of the research team will administer the neurological exams and 
questionnaires at each specified time point.  The therapeutic intervention will involve patients wearing an Elasto-
Gel cold glove and wrap  on either their right or left side of their body, acting as their own controls. The treatment 
side will be determined by [CONTACT_875152].  Patients

CTMS #17- [ADDRESS_1222246] to race, gender, age, and other 
potentially confounding variable. The cold therapy treatm ent side will be assigned, according to the patients 
assigned study number at the time of eligibility . The purpose of stratifying by [CONTACT_875153]’t end up with, for example, the treatment being more likely to be assigned to the non- dominant hand. Since 
the non- dominant hand gets less use and wear and tear than the dominant hand, i t’s possible that neuropathy 
would tend to be less severe or less noticed in the non- dominant hand.  
  
The efficacy of cryotherapy will be assessed with  evaluation of patient reported adverse events using version 
4.03 of the CTCAE for neuropathy and nail toxicities, validated patient symptom surveys, focused neurological 
evaluations and NCS ’s.  Completion of these questionnaires will not require extra time outside of the patients 
scheduled appointments. Prior to beginning the cold therapy and tax ane based chemotherapy, baseline data will 
be collected. If the patient is receiving anthracycline treatment, then this data can be collected during their last 
anthracycline infusion. If the patient is not receiving chemotherapy prior to starting on a taxane, then the baseline 
data with be collected at the clinic visit prior to starting taxane chemotherapy. The Post -Chemotherapy 
assessment  will occur approximately 3  weeks ( + 1 week) after the patient’s last chemotherapy treatment  cycle 
end date. It may require a separate trip to clinic at a time that is convenient for them. At all- time points, a member 
of the research staff will meet with the patient to complete the questionnaires and quantitative sensory tests.  The 
Study Schedule outlines all of the assessments and the timing of those assessments during the study period. All assessment tools can be found in referenced section in the appendices section.  
 
Patient questionnaires  will be completed prior to starting taxane based chemotherapy, e very cycle of treatment , 
three weeks after last dose of taxane and 6 months after completion of taxane therapy.   
 
Assessments will be administered by  a member of the research team who has personal qualifications to perform 
neurological exams.  
 Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)  will be completed at the neurology clinic at the MARC within [ADDRESS_1222247] . One additional 
tube of blood (5ml) will be collected prior to starting on treatment for next -gen sequencing for TRPA1, TRPV1, 
and TRPM8 expression.  These expression profiles will be analyzed and correlated to patient symptom severity, sensory testing and NCS  findings. Sensory testing for TrpA1 activation will also be completed prior to the first 
infusion of taxane chemotherapy.  This pre-treatment assessment will be completed in the chemotherapy infusion 
clinic during the first chemotherapy session and involves the topi[INVESTIGATOR_875141]’s 
forearm that is receiving the cold glove therapy. It will then be applied to the forearm not receiving cold glove 
therapy after taxane is completed. The first application is prior to taxane infusion to the treatment side receiving 
cold therapy , and the second is at the conclusion of the taxane infusion  to the control s ide not receiving cold 
therapy . The degree of patient report punctate hyperalgesia
. will be recorded by [CONTACT_875154]. The full protocol is listed  in appendix [ADDRESS_1222248] will be done while the 
patient is in the chemotherapy infusion clinic for their scheduled chemotherapy.

chemotherapy. Patient accrual will occur by [CONTACT_875155]. The primary source of accrual will be dependent 
on clinician referrals to the study -coordinator. The study will be presented monthly at the Women’s Cancer Site 
Team meeting and potential study candidates will be identified and screened for eligibility during regular 
encounters for their breast cancer treatment.  
 
Informed consent will take place in clinic . A member of the patient’s medical team will introduce the coordinator, 
who will present the study and answer any questions or concerns of the patient.  
 
Once consented, the patient will complete the Patient Questionnaire and schedule a time for baseline data 
collection (Appendix 1). The questionnaire will cover: history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, 
Raynaud’s, smoking, alcohol use, recent weight changes, current medications, as well as history of surgery to 
the extremities, pre- existing neurological conditions, and current activity level. Several of these demographic 
characteristics are suspected to be risk factors in the development of paclitax el-induced peripheral neuropathy 
(e.g., diabetes, and alcoholism). Other risk factors have been implicated in the development of peripheral 
neuropathy not related to paclitaxel (e.g., statins, weight loss, pre -existing neurologic conditions).  
 Dosage:  
Since we are not administering a drug, the study team will be required to make no dose modifications. All the 
patients enrolled in this study are being administered a taxane based regimen as part of their specific 
chemotherapy regimen. Therefore, any dose changes in the patient’s chemotherapy regimen will be executed by [CONTACT_875156]. All  dose changes or delays in the subject’s chemotherapy 
regimen will be recorded in the study log as such fluctuations will likely impact t he subject’s neuropathy. This 
study recognizes the necessity of dose- adjustments in cases of severe and debilitating peripheral neuropathy 
secondary to taxane therapy. The signs and symptoms observed and reports should be examined for 
correlations with the dose administered on a particular date.  The total dose of the patient’s taxane therapy will 
be collected and recorded in the Patient Data file (Appendix 2 ).  
 
If the patient is able to wear the glove and wrap  for at least half of the infusion time , they can continue on study 
with intervention time noted. Patients will be allowed to continue with the cold therapy at subsequent 
chemotherapy treatments. The length of time in which they are able to maintain the cold therapy will be recorded 
in the Patient data file (appendix 2 ). 
 
Cold Therapy Treatment  
Duration of treatment: Patients will receive the cold therapy during the taxane portion of chemotherapy. The glove and wrap  will be worn at every infusion. The glove and wrap  will be worn for the duration of treatment 
including an additional 15 minutes before (± [ADDRESS_1222250] 15 min prior to infusion 
and 50% of the infusion time,  they will be considered as having received the full treatment. If the patient is unable 
to maintain the cold therapy for 50% of the infusion time for 2 consecutive treatments, then the patient will be 
withdrawn from the study  for cold intolerance . The duration of the cold therapy will be recorded in the patient 
data file (appendix 2) . In the event of trauma, not related to the study, to one or both extremities of the treatment 
side, treatment will be performed as tolerated applying the same rules as stated above.  
 
Administration: The side being treated will be determined by [CONTACT_875157], alternating between the non- dominant 
and dominant side. Patients will be randomized based on the assigned study number. Patients with even study 
numbers will wear the gloves and wraps  on their dominant hand and foot while patients with odd study numbers 
will wear the gloves and wraps on their non -dominant side. As a sanitary measure, patients will wear a disposable 
glove and sock liner each time they wear the glove and wrap . The glove and wrap  will be secured by a Velcro 
strap at the wrist and ankle per manufacture instructions. The glove and wrap  need to be kept at an approximate 
temperature of  4ºC (a range of 3 ºC - 6 ºC is acceptable) . The gloves and wraps  will be stored in a designated 
freezer check at approximately 4ºC.  The study member will verify freezer temperature prior to starting the cold 
treatments and record this on provided study forms. In order to maintain cold therapy, gloves and wraps  will be

CTMS #17- 0033  replaced every 30- 40 minutes during treatment. A member of the research team will be present  during treatment  
to switch the gloves and wraps as needed  within the time window. This research team member can be a 
chemotherapy infusion nurse, medical assistant,  or the study coordinator depending on staffing needs on 
particular days. Length of treatment will vary between eight week s and twelve weeks depending on if patient is  
prescribed bi -weekly or weekly paclitaxel treatments.  
 
• Every patient will wear an Elasto- Gel glove and wraps  for the duration of each neurotoxic chemotherapy 
agent infused that they have scheduled as part of their treatment plan at the infusion clinic at the Mays 
Cancer Center . The Elasto -Gel glove and wrap  are made of a glycerin -based gel that maintains its 
flexibility at a temperature of 4ºC. The cover material is a water resistant four -way stretchable fabric with 
straps at the wrist and ankle to assure good position.  
• Storage and stability: The gloves and wraps  will be kept in a freezer located on the chemotherapy infusion 
room at the Mays Cancer Center . Each glove and wrap  will be kept in individual plastic bags wit h the 
time placed in the fridge.  
• Preparation: Gloves and wraps  must be refrigerated for at least three hours prior to use.  Each glove or 
wrap  will be tagged on the plastic bag with the time and date recorded when it is placed in the refrigerator. 
The refrigerate temperature will be logged prior to removal of glove or wrap .  
• Protocol: Patients will wear the glove and wrap  on either the dominant hand or foot OR non- dominant 
hand and foot for the duration of each of their chemotherapy treatment (infusion). The gloves and wraps  
will be worn 15 minutes (± 20 minutes) prior to the start of the taxane infusion and 15 minutes after the 
completion this infusion. New cold gloves and wraps  will be switched every 30- 40 minutes until the end 
of each individual infusion in order to maintain the extremity cold with an ideal temperature of 
approximately 4ºC.  
• Patients unable to wear the glove and /or wrap  for [ADDRESS_1222251] 50% of infusion time for 2 consecutive treatments will be considered “ not tolerant of cold therapy ” 
and cold therapy will not be continued with subsequent infusions on study. However , if able to wear the 
glove and wrap  for [ADDRESS_1222252]  50% of the infusion 
time, patients will be allowed to continue the cold therapy at their next chemotherapy treatment.  
• Use of the Elasto- Gel glove and wrap  will be provided free of charge to patients.  
 
Assessments [Neurological Exams and Questionnaires]  
Patient Questionnaires  
At each of the six time points the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)  (Appendix 4) , European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 (EORTC QLQ -CIPN20) (Appendix 5 ), Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) (Appendix 6 ), will be 
administered. All questionnaires have been reproduced with permission from their authors.  
 
To complement the patient -reported contributions to symptom evaluation, the researcher will complete the 
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.03  (NCI-CTC v 4.0 3) neuropathy sub- scales 
(peripheral sensory neuropathy) and nail toxicities  for both the treated and not treated hands and feet  (Appendix 
3).  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_875142] -, and post -taxane treatments to access the changes 
that may occur as well as help evaluate the glove and wrap  efficacy of preventing nail toxicities.  
 
Quantitative Sensory Tests  
The focused neurological examination will quantitatively measure the subject’s sensitivity to noxious semi -sharp 
pin-prick stimuli, fine motor skills/manual dexterity, as well as vibration detection threshold. These measures are 
currently used in a study looking into the prevalence of paclitaxel -induced peripheral neuropathy.  
 Although no gold standard for QST assessment has been developed and accepted, an examination of the current 
literature reveals that when CIPN patients complete anatomical pain diagrams to visually characterize the 
location and intensity of their symptoms, the result is frequently a “stocking and glove” distribution[5]. The 
symptoms of this neuropathy are usually symmetrically manifested with no significant right -to-left difference 
[6,13].  
 
17-535H, Kaklamani, Protocol, 07- 05-21, AMD.docx 
Page 14 of 42 
Neuropathy Trial Version 1 3 –  
CTMS #17- 0033   
There are currently a few protocols available which can assess CIPN in a clinical setting [5,7,11,12]. Rolke et al, 
has written a Quantitative Sensory Tests protocol that details non- invasive tests to determine the presence of 
neuropathy. The protocol is w ell-accepted and has been validated in numerous CIPN studies. It also serves as 
a guide in a current study looking into the prevalence of PI[CONTACT_96253].  
 
To monitor the efficacy of the cold therapy, the following QST described below (with the exception of the fine 
motor tests) which will be administered on the right and left sides as well as both hands and feet.  
 
Monofilaments for Touch Stimulus  
To determine the subject’s sensitivity innocuous mechanical touch stimulation, we will use a set of Semmes -
Weinstein Monofilaments called The Touch- Test™ Sensory Evaluators ( .008 g - 300 g) produced by [CONTACT_875158], Inc. The monofilaments will be used to apply the stimulus via the “method of limits” on the 
patient’s right and left upper and lower extremity: the glabrous tip of the right and left index finger and at the tip 
of the hallux of the foot on both sides.  
 
To begin, we will ask the patient to place her right or left forearm on a stable surface with her palm up and face 
away with her eyes closed. The patient will be told to vocally say “Yes” to when she feels the stimulus. Nonverbal 
patients may tap the table lightly with the opposite hand (not being tested) when the stimulus is felt. The lightest 
monofilament in the set (.008 g) will be touched to the skin of the fingertip and depressed until it bows. Using a 
stopwatch for accuracy, the researcher holds the f ilament in this position for [ADDRESS_1222253] monofilament 
in the set (.02 g) and applies the stimulus in the same manner (gently depress until it bows), for the same amount 
of time (2 seconds) to a slightly different site on the fingertip. If the patient indicates that she felt the stimulus, 
then the researcher returns to the previous monofilament (.008 g). If the patient does not indicate that the 
stimulus was felt, then the researcher again moves to the next monofilament in the set (.04 g). This pattern is 
repeated until a total of five (5) stimuli have been applied. These data are recorded on the Monofilament Data 
Sheet, part of the Quantitative Sensory Test Data ( Appendix 7 ) and then entered into a spreadsheet, which will 
determine the patient’s final threshold (the geometric mean of the five -recorded weights) and generate a 
graphical representation of this datum to be used later in analysis. If paclitaxel -induced peripheral neuropathy 
causes an increase in sensitivity, then a significant disparity will appear between the “before paclitaxel” threshold 
and the “after paclitaxel” threshold.  
 25 –hole Pegboard test for Manual Dexterity  
To assess the subject’s manual dexterity, we will administer a 25- hole pegboard test manufactured by [CONTACT_875159]. At each time point, the researcher will give the patient a practice test. The patient will be asked to use her dominant hand to pi[INVESTIGATOR_705361] a time from the container and place them in the holes 
until all [ADDRESS_1222254] will assess the patient’s ability to detect vibration. We will use the Rydel -Seiffer tuning fork 
produced by [CONTACT_875160]. The tuning fork will be used on the following four regions of the patient’s right 
and left upper extremity  and the right and left lower extremity: dorsum of index finger DIP joint, dorsum of IP of 
hallux (great toe) on both sides.  
 
The researcher will place the base of the tuning fork, with the dampers facing the researcher, on the bony 
prominences listed above. To create a vibration, the tynes are pressed together between the thumb and index 
finger then  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_875143]. As the prongs start to oscillate, the illusion of two triangles is visible on each 
damper.  These are black and white triangles on the dampers that are each marked with a scale from [ADDRESS_1222255].   The intensity at which the patient no longer detects the vibration is read as 
the number adjacent the intersection of the vibrating triangles.   This number can be read off the white or black 
triangle depending on the amount of light available or which scale is more easily readable. According to 
 
17-535H, Kaklamani, Protocol, 07- 05-21, AMD.docx 
Page 15 of 42 
Neuropathy Trial Version 1 3 –  
CTMS #17- [ADDRESS_1222256] accurate readings between triangles for any particular moment 
in time.  
 The patient will be told to vocally say “Yes” immediately once the vibration is no longer detected. (Reading the 
tuning fork assessment)This procedure will then be repeated four more times per region (fingertip and toe), with the first reading being discar ded and the last three being recorded on the Vibration Test data section of the 
Quantitative Sensory Tests Data sheet . 
 
RESPONSE ASSESSMENT  
The primary objective of this study is to reduce or prevent paclitaxel -induced peripheral neuropathy. The primary 
focuses of concerns being the pain and oncholysis that often occur during the paclitaxel portion of the patient’s 
chemotherapy regimen. Therefore, the response ass essment will involve a comparison of the patient’s treated 
hand and foot wit h the non- treated hand and foot. Allowing the patient s to act as their own controls will reduce  
variability, ensuring the matching of the treated and non- treated sides with respect  to demographic differences 
and potentially confounding variables.  
 
Data Management/Interpretation of Results  
Redcap and Velos will be used for data management and statistical analysis. All data will be coded and entered 
into a database by a research assistant and checked for errors by [CONTACT_458]. Manipulation, 
analysis, and reporting of the data w ill be performed in an aggregate fashion and in no way will identify individual 
subjects. Data will be maintained by [CONTACT_589859] a secure location, within a locked office and a password protected computer. Both databases are supported by [CONTACT_875161].  
 
Because the data will have statistically non- normal distributions, nonparametric statistical methods will be used 
to analyze the data. The analyses will be done separately for each time point. A 0.[ADDRESS_1222257] the null hypothesis, one- sample paired t -tests will be used for continuously 
distributed outcomes and McNemar tests will be used for binary outcomes.  
 
Randomization for the Cold Gloves  
Determining right or left side dominance is important prior to the study in order to establish randomization. The 
purpose of stratifying by [CONTACT_875162].  Since the non-
dominant hand utilized less for activity , it’s possible that neuropathy could be perceived as less severe in the 
non-dominant hand . Patients with even study numbers will wear the gloves and wraps  on their dominant hand 
and foot while patients with odd study numbers will wear the gloves a nd wraps on their non- dominant side.  
 
Sample Size Calculation 
With regard to the occurrence of adverse events as assessed by [CONTACT_6812] -CTC method and dichotomizing this 
outcome to none or at least one, a sample size of 63 pairs achieves 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 2.[ADDRESS_1222258] ant pairs is 0.55.  Due to possibility 
of drop out, the target accrual is 65 patients.  
 
 
17-535H, Kaklamani, Protocol, 07- 05-21, AMD.docx 
Page 16 of 42 
Neuropathy Trial Version 1 3 –  
CTMS #17- [ADDRESS_1222259] changes in binary outcomes will be assessed with McNemar tests.  All statistical testing will be two -sided 
with a significance level of 5%.  SAS Version 9.4 or R will be used throughout.  
 8.3 Infection Control Intervention:  
The same set of gloves and wraps  will be used for multiple patients . Thus, preventive measures will be made in 
order to decrease the chances of infection spread between patients . After each use, the gloves and wraps  will 
be wiped down with an antibacterial and antiseptic wipe, and pa tients will wear  a disposable  standard medical  
glove and a disposable shoe liner during each infusion.  
 
8.4 Dosage of Anti -Cancer Therapy  
Since we are not administering a drug, the study team will be required to make no dose modifications. All the 
patients enrolled in this study are being administered anti -drug therapy that is well known to cause CIPN like 
taxanes. Therefore, any dose changes in the patient’s chemotherapy regimen will be made by [CONTACT_875163]. All dose changes or delays in the subject’s chemotherapy 
regimen will be recorded in the study log as these fluctuations will likely  impact the subject’s risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_875144]. The total dose of the anti -cancer drug will be recorded in the Patient Data File (Appendix 2).  
 This study recognizes the necessity of dose- adjustments in cases of severe and debilitating peripheral 
neuropathy secondary to anti -cancer therapy. The signs and symptoms observed should be examined for 
correlations with the dose administered on a particul ar date. Any dose reductions due to the occurrence of any 
toxicity from anti -cancer therapy will also be recorded in the same data file.  
 8.5 Discontinuation of Cold Gloves Therapy  
• Patients will discontinue the cold glove and wrap  therapy if they are not able to compl ete at least 50% of 
the infusion time  for 2 consecutive treatments .  
• Development of grade 2 nail toxicities or neuropathy on the treated extremity that is not also present on the non -treatment extremity.  
• Discontinuation of taxane based chemotherapy regimen   
• Patients may withdraw consent at any time.  
 8.6 Next-gen sequencing for Correlative Studies:  Correlative studies will be conducted as secondary outcome 
measure to provide information on toxicity prediction. One purple top tube of peripheral blood ( approximately 5 
cc) will be collected at baseline and sent for next -gen sequencing assays for TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPM8 
which will take place at the lab of [CONTACT_875174] at UT Health  San Antonio. This single tube will be placed 
on ice, marked  with study ID number and delivered to [CONTACT_193567]’s lab for proces sing.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) is required for all an individual protocols conducted at The Mays 
Cancer Center . All protocols conducted at the Mays Cancer Center  are covered under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_875145].   
 
The Mays Cancer Center  Institutional DSMP global policies provide individual trials with:  
• institutional policies and procedures for institutional data safety and monitoring,  
• an institutional guide to follow,  
• monitoring of protocol accrual by [CONTACT_875164],  
• review of study forms and orders by [CONTACT_16666],  
• tools for monitoring safety events,  
• monitoring of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]’s by [CONTACT_744633],  
• determining level of risk (Priority of Audit Level Score – PALS),  
• oversight by [CONTACT_71333] (DSMC), and

Monitoring Safety:  
Due to the low risk associated with participation in this protocol, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_875146], adverse event trends and treatment effects on this study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_875147] -annual review and report findings to the Mays Cancer Center  Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB ) and the UT Health San Antonio IRB.  
 Baseline events and adverse events will be captured using the Mays Cancer Center  Master Adverse Events 
Document for each patient using CTCAE V  4.03 for the grading and attribution of adverse events. Usage of the 
Mays Cancer Center  Master Adverse Events Document centrally documents:  
• the event and grades the seriousness of it,  
• if the event was a change from baseline,   
• determines the relationship between the event and study intervention,  
• if the event was part of the normal disease process, and  
• what actions were taken as a result of the event.  
 
Safety Definitions:  
For this study, the following safety definitions will be applicable:  
 
Adverse Event Definition: An adverse event (AE) is defined as  any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research , whether or not 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research  For this study, all adverse events will be 
documented starting with the first use of the cold therapy device  and ending [ADDRESS_1222260] dose use of 
the cold therapy device, regardless of the length of time the device was used.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Definition: is any adverse event  that: 
1. results in death;  
2. is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  
3. results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
4. results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
5. results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
6. based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others Definition: Unanticipated problem involving risk to 
subjects or others includes any incident, experience or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
A. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied (note: the 
unfounded classification of a serious adverse event as “anticipated” constitutes serious non -compliance);  
B. definitely related or probably related to participation in the research; and  
C. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized 
 
Reporting Requirements  
For this study, all Master Adverse Events Documents collected on patients for this protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a monthly basis to determine if a serious safety problem has emerged that result in 
a change or early termination of a protocol such as:  
• suspending enrollment due to safety or efficacy, or

Page 18 of 42 
Neuropathy Trial Version 1 3 –  
CTMS #17- 0033  • termination of the study due to a significant change in risks or benefits.   
 
Endpoints for termination of the study are: frostbites. If there are more than 5% of patients with frostbites then 
the study will be terminated 
 
As per the Mays Cancer Center  DSMP, any protocol modifications, problematic safety reports, unanticipated 
problems, and suspension or early termination of a trial must be reported to all members of the research team.  
Suspension and early termination of a trial must also be reported i mmediately to the Director of Quality 
Assurance (DQA) who will promptly notify the sponsor and the UT Health San Antonio IRB.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_875148] a semi -annual basis with the Mays Cancer 
Center  DSMC.  The Investigator Initiated Study Quarterly DSMB Report Form includes information on adverse 
events, current dose levels, number of patients enrolled, significant toxicities per the protocol, patient status 
(morbidity and mortality), dose adjustments with observed response, and any interim findings.  Any trend 
consisting of three or more of the same event will be reported to the Mays Cancer Center  DSMB for independent 
review outside of the quarterly reporting cycle, which begins three months following protocol start up. Conflict of 
interest is avoided by [CONTACT_875166].  
 
All SAE and UPRISO’s will be reported following the Mays Cancer Center  and UT Health San Antonio institutional 
guidelines.

Quantitative Sensory Testing for TrpA1 activity  
 
Materials:  
[ADDRESS_1222268] Oil solution ([ADDRESS_1222269] oil plus 100 ul olive oil) in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube  
5-1.5 empty Eppendorf tubes  
5- square spot bandages (Band- Aid Tru -Stay Clear Spots)  
~5 inch strip of paper tape~5 inch strip of paper tape 
Von Frey fiber (4.0 g force)  
1 pencil or pen for patient  
 
Instructions:  
 
1) Prior to receiving chemotherapy, patient reports baseline arm pain on a scale of 1 -10, 1=no pain and 10= 
worst pain ever to the treatment arm. Score is recorded on the MO data score sheet.  
 2) The CIPN strip is prepared as follows:  
A. using a black Sharpie, write each number (1 -5) on the back of the bandage. DO NOT write on the 
cotton pad. Number should be visible through paper tape. These can be made in advance.   
B. Attach numbered bandages side by [CONTACT_875170] a strip of paper tape. Remove bandage 
backing to expose cotton pads.  
C. Add [ADDRESS_1222270] a strip with wetted pads down on the ulnar region of the “treated: arm with spot #[ADDRESS_1222271]. Write numbers next to the appropriate bandage if needed for visualization.

3)  After [ADDRESS_1222273] responses on the data sheet  
 4) The strip is removed and the technician records all spots with a visible flare by [CONTACT_269304]. 
 5) Patients are asked to look away and punctate hyperalgesia  assayed using a single poke of Von Frey fiber 
(4g) beginning at spot #1 and moving towards spot #5.  Patients are asked to indicate when poke changes from a slight prick to something more painful.  Patients should also indicate which spots are numb to the  poke. 
It is helpful for the patient if a couple of test pokes are administrated on the arm away from the test zone so they can get a sense of the baseline sensation. Scores are recorded on data sheet provided.  
 
6) After chemotherapy treatment, Steps 1- 5 are repeated on opposite arm  (the control arm).

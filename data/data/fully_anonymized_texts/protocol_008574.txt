Glossary of terms 
 
Term  Definition  
Assessment  A procedure used to generate data required by [CONTACT_759183](s) used as a comparator to reduce assessment bias, preserve 
blinding of investigational drug, assess internal study validity, and/or 
evaluate comparative effects of the investigational drug.  
Core studies  Refers to the secukinumab phase III studies (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303 and other secukinumab phase III studies) from which subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will potentially enter the 
extension study CAIN457A2302E1  
Enrollment  Point/time of subject entry into the study; the point at which informed consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to starting any of the procedures 
described in the protocol).  
Epoch  The plann ed stage of the subjects’ participation in the study. Each epoch 
serves a purpose in the study as a whole. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_144914]: 
determination of subject eligibility, wash-out of previous treatments, 
exposure of subject to treatment or to follow -up on subjec ts after 
treatment has ended.  
Investigational treatment  The drug whose properties are being tested in the study; this definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is synonymous with 
“investigational new drug” or “investigational medicinal pro duct.”  
Medication number  A unique identifier on the label of each investigational/study drug 
package in studies that dispense medication using an IRT system  
Period A minor subdivision of the study timeline; divides phases into smaller 
functional segments  such as screening, baseline, titration, washout, etc.  
Premature subject withdrawal  Point/time when the subject exits from the study prior to the planned 
completion of all study treatment administration and assessments; at 
this time all study treatment ad ministration is discontinued and no further 
assessments are planned  
Randomization number  A unique identifier assigned to each randomized subject, corresponding  
to a specific treatment arm assignment  
Stop study participation  Point/time at which the subject came in for a final evaluation visit or 
when study treatment was discontinued whichever is later  
Study treatment  Any treatment administered to the subject as part of the required study procedures; includes investigational treatment and any control 
treatments  
Study treatment discontinuation Point/time when subject permanently stops taking study treatment for any reason; may or may not also be the point/time of premature subject 
withdrawal  
Subject Number  A number assigned to each subject who enrolls in the study. When 
combined with the site number, a unique identifier is created for each 
subject in the study.  
Variable Information used in the data analysis; derived directly or indirectly from 
data collected using specified assessments at speci fied time points

Amendment Protocol v03 Clean  Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
Amendment 3  
Amendment rationale 
 
       
 
Subjects who complete treatment period and follow -up period are  evaluated for 4 years 
regarding respective adverse events.  However, patient who prematurely discontinue treatment are evaluated for less than 4 years.  
Therefor e, this amendment extends the evaluation of subjects who prematurely discontinue 
treatment regarding respective adverse events and concomitant medications  in order to achieve 
a 4 year evaluation period. Evaluation of subjects should continue when achievabl e even if 
treatment is not continued for the duration. All subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment should complete all assessment of Week 260 (end of treatment visit) and of the follow -up period 
visits (Weeks 264 and 268). Subsequently, adverse events and use of concomitant medication will be evaluated by [CONTACT_471720] [ADDRESS_1039527] 
(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities.  
The changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation.  The changes herein affect  the Informed Consent, and sites are required to 
update and submit for approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this amended protocol. 
Amendment 2, 09 -Sep-2014  
Amendment rationale  
The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the wording for countries not selected for early trial termination when the drug is commercially available, this study will continue up to the end of additional 104 weeks of treatment. It also clarifies a discrepancy in the Assessment Schedule  
that PK samples at Week 140 are collected for all subjects and at Week 144 in case of relapse. This is consistent with Appendix 2. 
Changes to the protocol  
These changes were made to the protocol:  
• Secti on 5.5.[ADDRESS_1039528] the clarification to early study termination.  
• Table [ADDRESS_1039529] on the primary objective of the trial

Amendment Protocol v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
Amendme nt 1, 08- April-2014  
Amendment rationale  
The purpose of this amendment is to provide continued treatment for patients in the trial for an 
additional 104 weeks (or overall up to four years) or until the drug is commercially available in the market in the country of participation, whichever occurs first. This extension of treatment 
will allow for safety, tolerability, and efficacy data to be collected from the participating patients for a longer time period.  
All subjects will be unblinded and start open label at week 156.  Subjects on secukinumab [ADDRESS_1039530] would benefit from the higher dose.   
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the 
protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. The 
changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation. In addition, if the changes herein affect the Informed Consent, sites are required to update and submit for approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this amended protocol.

Study design: 
CAIN457A2302E1 is a four year multicenter, double- blind, randomized withdrawal extension study of 
two ongoing phase III studies CAIN457A2302 and CAIN457A2303 and will potentially include subjects 
rolling over from other secukinumab phase III studies (preceding studies collectively referred as core 
studies). About 1,220 subjects from approximately 300 sites in studies CAIN457A2302 and CAIN457A2303 are rolling over to this extension study.  
In this extension study, the prefilled syringe (PFS) liquid formulation of secukinumab will be used. In order to maintain double- blind in this study, matching placebo is used.  
This 4 year extension study will include a 2- year double blind period (between Week 52 and Week 156), 
during whic h randomized withdrawal analysis will be performed, followed by [CONTACT_33018] 2- year open 
label period (between Week 156 to Week 260). The subjects will receive the last blinded treatment at Week 152.  At Week 156, after performing the scheduled study assessments, the site will contact [CONTACT_759184] 15  
Amendment Protocol v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
to unblind the study treatment. Therefore Week 156 is the end of blinded withdrawal treatment/treatment 
period (EoT) and the beginning of the open label period. Week [ADDRESS_1039544] dose of the study drug at Week 256. Week 260 will be the end of open label 
treatment period (OL- EoT). Subjects completing the maintenance period (52 weeks) in the core studies 
(e.g., CAIN457A2302 and CAIN457A2303) will be classified based on Week 52 PASI response as PASI 
75 responders  (achieving at least PASI 75) or partial responders  (achieving at least PASI 50, but not 
PASI 75) or non-responders (not achieving at least a PASI 50 response). This Week 52 visit in the 
core studies is the randomization visit for CAIN457A2302E1 (extension study).  
For the subjects classified as PASI 75 responders at Week 52 the study consists of 5 or 6 
periods  
(i) screening period: is the duration between signing the informed consent form (ICF) and randomization 
registered with Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  
(ii) randomized withdrawal period: the duration of randomized withdrawal period for each subject is different i.e., starting from Week [ADDRESS_1039545] experiences the relapse or up t o Week 156.  
(iii) treatment period: A placebo subject experiencing a relapse during the withdrawal period will receive four doses of secukinumab s.c. at weekly intervals followed by [CONTACT_37234] s.c. every four weeks. Subjects on secukinumab in the randomized withdrawal period who have a relapse, will be given four weekly doses of placebo s.c. Following the loading doses, subjects will continue on secukinumab treatment at [ADDRESS_1039546] to enter the open label period prior to performing the dosing.  
(iv) open label period: The treatment will be unblinded at Week 156 and the subjects will enter the open 
label period. During this  period, the subjects will be given pre- filled syringes and instructed to perform 
self-injection at home every 4 weeks and return to the site every 12 or 16 weeks (please see Table 6-1  
Assessment schedule).  The first open label dose will be given at the site at Week 156.  Subjects previously randomized to receive [ADDRESS_1039547] on 150  mg s.c. may be switched to 300 mg s.c. at the discretion of the 
investigator at a regularly scheduled visit. Note: the Week [ADDRESS_1039548] dose of the study medication will be administered at Week 256. Week 260 is the end of the open label treatment period (OL- EoT).  
(v) follow -up period (for all subjects): treatment free period (Week 264 to Week 268).  
(vi) follow -up 2 period: treatment free period only for patients who prematurely discontinued treatment  
All subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment should complete all assessment of Week 260 (end of treatment visit) and of the follow -up period visits (Weeks 264 and 268). Subsequently, adverse events 
and use of concomitant medication will be evaluated by [CONTACT_471720] [ADDRESS_1039549] has been enrolled into CAIN457A2302E1

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 16  
Amendment Protocol v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
For the subjects classified as partial responders at Week 52 the study consists of 4 or 5 
periods  
(i) screening period: is the duration between signing the informed consent form (ICF) and randomization  
registered wi th IRT.  
(ii) treatment period: starting from the randomization visit at Week 52 continuing through Week 156. The patients will receive secukinumab s.c. every 4 weeks at the dose which they were originally assigned in the core study. At Week 156 they will enter the open label period. For subjects who don’t enter the open label period, Week 156 visit is the EoT.  
 (iii) open label period: At Week 156, the subjects will be given pre- filled syringes and starting Week 160 
the subjects will be asked to perform sel f-injection at home every 4 weeks and return to the site every 
12 or 16 weeks (please see Table 6-1  Assessment schedule). Also, at Week [ADDRESS_1039550] dose of the study medication at Week 256.  
(iv) follow -up period (for all subjects): treatment free period (Week 264 to Week  268).  
(v) follow -up 2 period: treatment free period only for patients who prematurely discontinued treatment  
All subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment should complete all assessment of Week 260 (end of treatment visit) and of t he follow -up period visits (Weeks 264 and 268). Subsequently, adverse events 
and use of concomitant medication will be evaluated by [CONTACT_471720] [ADDRESS_1039551] has been enrolled into CAIN457A2302E1 
study .  
 
 NOTE: Partial responders DO NOT  participate in the randomized withdrawal and DO NOT  receive any 
loading dose even if they experience a full relapse (a loss of >50% of the maximum PASI gain compared 
to baseline of the core study).  
Subjects classified as  partial responders  at Week 52 of the core studies will continue the same 
treatment dose in PFS (secukinumab s.c. 150 mg or 300 mg) that they were receiving at the time of 
completing the maintenance period (Week 52) in the core study.  
In the follow -up period  (Week 26 4 to Week 268)  all subjects will visit the study site for safety and

Data analysis:  
Treatment groups for analysis will include:  
• Subjects who were PASI 75 responders at Week 52 
• Secukinumab 150 mg 
• Secukinumab 300 mg 
• Placebo (secukinumab 150 mg in core studies)  
• Placebo (secukinumab 300 mg in core studies)  
• Subjects who were re- treated after relapse with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg  
• Secukinumab 150 mg 
• Secukinumab 300 mg 
• Subjects who were partial responders at Week 52 
• Secukinumab 150 mg 
• Secukinumab 300 mg 
The following hypotheses will be tested for 52 weeks≤ t ≤68 weeks 
• H1: Secukinumab [ADDRESS_1039556] PASI 75 response up to Week 68 
• H2: Secukinumab [ADDRESS_1039557] PASI 75 response up to Week 68 
The familywise error will be set to α=2.5% (one- sided). The two hypotheses H1 (referring to 150 mg) 
and H2 (referring to 300 mg) will be tested at α/2=1.25% one-s ided. In case, a null hypothesis has been

rejected for one dose, but not for the other dose, the alpha can be shifted to the other dose and the null 
hypotheses can be retested at level α=2.5% (one- sided).  
For loss of PASI [ADDRESS_1039558] ratios for these comparisons for loss of PASI 75 response and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be computed using a stratified 
Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment group, core study and baseline PASI of core study and baseline (at Week 52) PASI of extension study as explanatory variable and stratified by 
[CONTACT_759185]. The primary analysis will be the log- rank test. Subjects 
who have not lost PASI 75 response up to Week 68 will be considered as censored observations.  
Separate analyses will be performed for comparison of 150 mg secukinumab with placebo and 300 mg 
secukinumab with placebo. The two placebo groups will not be pooled for this analysis.

1 Introduction  
1.1 Background 
CAIN457A2302E1 is an extension study to two ongoing phase III studies CAIN457A2302 and 
CAIN457A2303, and will potentially include subjects from other secukinumab phase III studies (preceding studies collectively referred as core studies). Study CAIN457A2302 and study CAIN457A2303, each, is multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy 
of secukinumab after twelve weeks of treatment, and safety, tolerability and long -term efficacy 
up to one year in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque -type psoriasis. Both the 
studies are planned to demonstrate superiority of secukinumab compared with placebo. In addition, the study CAIN457A2303 aims also to show the non- inferiority versus etanercept. 
Please refer to the protocols of the respective studies for full details.  
At the end -of-phase- II meetings with se veral Health Authorities (FDA, EMA, and PMDA) in 
the first quarter of 2011, it was agreed to submit data from core studies along with interim data from at least one extension study to show long -term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
secukinumab in subjects with psoriasis. This study will also provide information from a randomized withdrawal period for subjects who have shown a PASI  75 response to 
secukinumab at Week 52 of the core studies (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) for 2 years until Week 156. The long- term efficacy, safety, and tolerability data (open label) will be 
collected for an additional 2 years. The overall treatment period (core study [52 weeks] plus extension [268 weeks]) is 320 weeks. 
Subjects (PASI 75 responders and partial responders) randomized to and completing Week 52 
of the core studies (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) on secukinumab treatment will be eligible to join this extension study, which is planned to collect up to- four  years of long -
term efficacy, safety, and toler ability data of secukinumab in either continuous or interrupted 
therapy (randomized withdrawal period). Subjects on placebo treatment or etanercept in the maintenance phase of the core studies, as well as subjects on secukinumab, but not showing at least a partial response, will not be eligible to enter this extension study.  
The study design, objectives, and other procedures of this extension study are applicable to 
other secukinumab phase III studies from which subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will potentially enter the extension study CAIN457A2302E1.  
In this extension study, the prefilled syringe (PFS) liquid formulation of secukinumab will be used. 
1.2 Purpose  
This extension study (CAIN457A2302E1) is planned to collect an additional four years of long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of secukinumab in either continuous or interrupted therapy (randomized withdrawal period) in subjects completing either one of the two phase III studies CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303 (and potentially  other secukinumab phase III 
studies) and showing at least partial response to secukinumab at Week 52 of the core study. An interim analysis on safety data only and a primary endpoint analysis (PEA) up to Week [ADDRESS_1039559] of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_759173], including time to relapse (i.e., loss of ≥50% of previous gain in PASI reduction) and frequency of rebounds, and therefore addresses needs brought forward by [CONTACT_6628]. The two year double –blind period of 
the study will be followed by a two year open label period. D uring the open label treatment 
period, subjects initially on the lower dose (150 mg) will be offered to switch to the higher dose 
(300 mg), at the discretion of the investigator. This allows all subjects in the study to receive 
the most efficacious dose of secukinumab.

core studies.  
Follow -up 2 period: treatment free period only for patients who prematurely discontinued treatment  
 
An outline of the study design is presented in Figure 3-1, while a detailed visit and assessment 
schedule can be found in Table 6 -1. The study design is applicable to other secukinumab phase 
III studies from which subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will potentially enter 
the extension study CAIN457A2302E1.

This 4 year extension study will include a 2 -year double blind period (between Week 52 and 
Week 156) during which randomized withdrawal analysis will be performed, followed by [CONTACT_102160] 2- year open label period (between Week 156 to Week 260). The subjects will receive 
the last blinded treatment at Week 152. At Week 156, after performing the scheduled study assessments and  prior to receiving the first unblinded dose of the study drug, the  site will be 
asked to contact [CONTACT_759186].  For subjects who will continue into the open label period, Week 156 will be the beginning of the open label period. The subjects who will not continue into the open label period Week 156 will be the end of blinded withdrawal treatment/treatment period (EoT) at which no study drug will be administered. During the open label period, subjects will receive the last dose of the study drug at Week 256. Week 260 will be the end of open label treat ment period (OL- EoT).  
Subjects completing the maintenance period (52 weeks) in the core studies (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) will be classified based on Week 52 PASI response as “PASI 75 responders” or “partial responders” or “non- responders”. This Week 52 visit in the 
core studies is the randomization visit for CAIN457A2302E1 (extension study).  
• PASI 75 Responders :  subjects with a PASI 75 response (subjects achieving ≥ 75% 
improvement [reduction] in PASI score compared to baseline of the core study) at Week 52 of core study 
• Partial responders : subjects with a PASI 50 response (subjects achieving ≥ 50% 
improvement [reduction] in PASI score compared to baseline of the core study, but not PASI 75 response) at Week 52 of core study  
• Non-responders : not achieving at least a PASI 50 response at Week 52 of core study  
For the subjects classified as PASI 75 responders at Week 52 the study consists of 5 or 6 periods  
At Week 52 of the core studies subjects enrolling in the extension trial will go through a 
screening period, a randomized withdrawal period, a treatment period, a two year secukinumab open label period and a follow up period. 
(i) screening period: is the duration between signing the informed consent form (ICF) and 
randomization registered with interactive response technology (IRT). 
(ii) randomized withdrawal period (double blind): Subjects will be randomized to either 
secukinumab or placebo. The subjects will continue on either secukinumab or placebo until there is a relapse or up to Week 156.  I f there is a relapse the patient will enter the treatment 
period.  
 In randomized withdrawal period (between Week 52 and Week 156), subjects in the group of 
PASI [ADDRESS_1039572] been receiving secukinumab s.c. 150 mg dose during the 
maintenance peri od of core studies will be randomized 2:1 to continue  same s.c. doses of 
secukinumab in PFS from the core studies or receive s.c. placebo secukinumab in PFS. Similarly, those subjects who were receiving secukinumab s.c. 300 mg dose during the maintenance p eriod of core studies will be randomized 2:1 to continue  same s.c. doses of 
secukinumab in PFS from the core studies or receive s.c. placebo secukinumab in PFS. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_759187] (< 90 kg or ≥90 kg) collected at Week 52. In order to maintain double -blind in this study, matching placebo is

used. Therefore subjects classified as PASI 75 responders and entering the randomized 
withdrawal period will be randomized (as explained above) at Week 52 in either of four treatment groups ( Figure 3 -1). Subjects who were on s.c. secukinumab 150 mg in the core study 
will be randomized to (a) or (b) treatments and subjects who were on s.c. secukinumab 300 mg in the co re study will be randomized to (c) or (d) treatments, as explained below:  
a. Secukinumab 150 mg PFS group: One s.c. injection of secukinumab 150 mg in PFS plus 
s.c. injection of placebo secukinumab 150 mg in PFS at randomization (Week 52) and thereafter every  4 weeks up to Week 152 (or until first full relapse). 
b. Placebo secukinumab 150 mg PFS: Two s.c. injections of placebo secukinumab 150 mg in 
PFS at randomization (Week 52) and thereafter every 4 weeks up to Week 152 (or until first full relapse).  
c. Secukinumab 300 mg PFS group: Two s.c. injections of secukinumab 150 mg in PFS at 
randomization (Week 52) and thereafter every 4 weeks up to Week 152 (or until first full relapse).  
d. Placebo secukinumab 300 mg PFS: Two s.c. injections of placebo secukinumab 150 mg in 
PFS at randomization (Week 52) and thereafter every 4 weeks up to Week 152 (or until first full relapse).  
Subjects in the randomized withdrawal period experiencing a first full relapse  (a loss of >50% 
of the maximum PASI gain compared to baselin e of the core study) at any scheduled visit after 
Week 52 during the randomized withdrawal period, will enter the treatment period . The dose

NOTE:  Partial responders DO NOT  participate in the randomized withdrawal and DO NOT  
receive any loading dose even if they experience a full relapse (a loss of >50% of the maximum PASI gain compared to baseline of the core study) 
Subjects on placebo treatment or etanercept in the maintenance phase of the core studies will 
not be eligible to enter this extension study, and will com plete follow -up visits in the core 
studies. 
Follow -up period (Week 26 4 to Week 268)  
The treatment -free follow -up period (no study treatment administered during follow -up period) 
includes visits at Week 264 (Follow-up visit F4, which is 4 w eeks after the Eo T/OL -EoT visit, 
and [ADDRESS_1039582] study treatment administration) and Week 268 (follow -up visit F8 [or 
End of follow -up {EOF}]), which is 8 weeks after the EoT/OL -EoT visit, and [ADDRESS_1039583] prematurely discontinued treatment prior to the  end of treatment phase 
(Week 260), and completed the subsequent follow -up period visits (Weeks 264 and 268) should 
enter the treatment free follow -up 2 period. Follow -up 2 period cons ists of telephone calls every 
3 months and unplanned assessments e.g. physical examinations, vital signs and laboratory 
assessments at the site if investigator considers this necessary. The end of Follow -up 2 period 
(EOF2) for an individual subject will be  after [ADDRESS_1039584] has been 
enrolled into the CAIN457A2302E1 study ( Figure 3 -1).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1039585] two years (104 weeks), of this multicenter, double -blind, randomized withdrawal 
extension study is set up to collect the long -term efficacy, safety and tolerability of secukinumab 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 32  
Amendment Protocol v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
in either continuous or interrupted therapy (randomized withdrawal/treatment period). The 
second two years of the study is open label and primarily designed to collect additional safety 
data.  
Since interruptions of treatment for various reasons are common in chronic diseases such as psoriasis, the first two years of this extension study will investigate the effect of treatment interrupti on as well as re- treatment following treatment interruption in a “randomized 
withdrawal” design.  
In addition, the “randomized withdrawal” period will allow assessing whether continuation of treatment with secukinumab is of benefit to subjects after having been treated with secukinumab 
for up to 52 weeks, compared to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_759173]. 
The concept of “randomized withdrawal” is in line with recommendations from the EMA as 
outlined in the guidelines for the development of drugs to treat psori asis 
(CHMP/EWP/2454/02), and with feedback received at the end -of-phase- II meetings with the 
FDA, the EMA, and the PMDA. 
Because a relapse can only reasonably be assessed if a subject has a response to start with, only 
subjects that have a PASI 75 at Week 52 of one of the core studies will be re -randomized into 
the randomized withdrawal period of this extension study. The “randomized withdrawal” period does not have a defined end. Instead, retreatment 
(including loa ding dose) will be initiated for each subject individually if at any scheduled visit 
a relapse is experienced. This is considered appropriate, since a subject not suffering from a relapse is not considered in need of active treatment at that time, and hence should not be exposed to treatment until the worsening of the disease (relapse). After two years any subjects on placebo in the randomized withdrawal arm will either be discontinued or started on secukinumab.  
Partial responders (i.e., subjects having a PASI  50 response, but not a PASI  75 response) are 
also allowed to enter the extension study; they will continue the treatment they received during 
the maintenance of the core study. This is based on the rationale that a subject could have been a responder during most of the core study, but suffered from a minor loss of response at Week 
52 (e.g., because of seasonal variation), and could still be regarded to benefit from continuous treatment with secukinumab. In addition, even for a subject responding to secukinumab only with a partial response, continuous treatment with secukinumab might still be the best available treatment option for this subject (e.g., due to intolerance or non- availability of other options). 
Therefore, at Week [ADDRESS_1039586] is expected to benefit from inclusion in the extension study; if that assessment is positive, the subject is eligible to enter the extension study.  
In the last two years of the study during the open label period subjects on 150 mg s.c. will be allowed to switch to 300 mg s.c. at the discretion of the investigator. The switch will be allowed starting Week 156 and only during the scheduled visit. Once subjects switch into the higher dose, they will not be allowed to switch back to the lower dose. Also, subjects initially randomized to 300 mg s.c. will not be allowed to switch to 150 mg sc at any time during the study. Non-responders to secukinumab (i.e., subjects not having at least a PASI 50 response) at 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1039587] shown that their disease status is not in need of active treatment. Hence, 
there is no benefit expected for these subjects from entering the extension study. 
Subjects on etanercept in the core study (CAIN457A2303) until Week [ADDRESS_1039588] an active comparator; instead, the main focus of the study objectives is to compare different secukinumab regimens agai nst each other. Since etanercept 
is an approved treatment in the countries where the study CAIN457A2303 is performed in, subjects can receive etanercept by [CONTACT_50246].  
3.3 Rationale of dose/regimen, duration of treatment 
The doses and regimens selected for secukinumab are projected to deliver high efficacy while at the same time ensuring subject safety. The proposal to continue treatment with s.c. doses of 150 mg and 300 mg administered every four weeks, as well as the additional treatment duration of 208 weeks (leading to an overall treatment period [core plus extension] of 260 weeks) is based on the need for efficacy and safety information during chronic treatment in subjects suffering from chronic plaque- type psoriasis.  
The rationale of the dose/regimen for  re-treatment after full relapse is supported by [CONTACT_338293]- based 
considerations. These model -based predictions are subject to caveats and assumptions, but 
appear to provide plausible guidance. The predictions are considered as extrapolations, as they are made for regimens, time points, subject subsets and withdrawal/re -treatment patterns for 
which limited or no data is available, as they have not (or not in exactly this way) been studied so far (which is the nature of the current status of development of secukinumab in psoriasis). 
The inclusion of a randomized withdrawal treatment period will allow assessing time to relapse 
and frequency of rebound after cessation of treatment, compared to continuous treatment. This is in line with guidelines for the development  of drugs to treat psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02).  
The switch from the lyophilisate to the more convenient prefilled syringe is supported by [CONTACT_759189]457A2106, which has shown that the exposure profiles of both formulations are virtually identical. This will also remove the need to have unblinded pharmacists involved in the study; these were necessary in the core studies to ensure the double -
blind. 
Model-based predictions in Figure [ADDRESS_1039589]: 
• Subjects lose PASI  75 response after withdrawal at an approximate rate of 10% per month 
(see Figure 3 -2 left).  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 34  
Amendment Protocol v03 Clean  Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
•Substantially less subjects show a full relapse, the predictions reaching 10% after four
months (see Figure 3 -2 right).

relapsing during a period of 6 months after either continuous 
treatment or of withdrawal (based on responders at Week 52)  
Model base exploration with high and unquantifiable uncertainty, thus no intervals are provided  
The use of loss of PASI 75 as primary objective is supported by [CONTACT_759190]457A2211 wherein a loss of PASI 75 was observed during treatment -free maintenance 
periods in an increasing number of subjects over time (see Figure 3 -3).

During each 4- week interval, an additional approximately 10% of subjects lost PASI 75 
response; twelve weeks after last administration of secukinumab, 33.3% of the subjects had lost 
PASI 75 response. While data from Week 16 is not available from that study, since subjects were retreated after 12 weeks, it can reasonably be expected that around 40% of subjects will have lost PASI [ADDRESS_1039590] on the time to loss of PASI 75. 
3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator 
Use of placebo (i.e. withdrawal of active therapy) in a randomized withdrawal  study design 
until retreatment is necessary (in the case of psoriasis a “relapse”, i.e., loss of >50% of the previous gain in PASI reduction) is in accordance with Health Authority Guidelines on Choice of Control Group in Clinical Trials (e.g., CPMP/ICH/364/96 2001). This is also be supported 
by [CONTACT_759191] a relapse. All patients in the last two years of the trial will be on active treatment.  
 
3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
A PEA will be conducted when all subjects have completed Week [ADDRESS_1039591] of the study  has either completed treatment period and follow -up period or  
discontinued treatment and completed follow -up and follow -up 2 periods (last telephone 
contact)  or withdrawn from study the final database lock occurs .  
3.[ADDRESS_1039592] not shown any impediment to using secukinumab either intravenously 
(i.v.) or s.c. in man. Study CAIN457A2302E1 will use secukinumab drug substance solution in PFS; this formulation has already been used  in a biocomparability study, CAIN457A2106, and 
has shown almost identical properties compared to the lyophilisate. 
Secukinumab is expected to show good to excellent efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis, as 
outlined in Section 1.1. 
At the time of Amendment 1, over [ADDRESS_1039593] 
received secukinumab. Details of the risk and benefits are outlined in the current version of the Investigator Brochure. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 36  
Amendment Protocol v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
 
The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by [CONTACT_374632]/exclusion 
criteria, proper study design and close clinical monitoring. In the extension study CAIN457A2302E1, all subjects will receive active treatment, either from 
the start of the study, or a fter they have experienced a relapse. To ensure a double- blind design, 
some subjects will receive  placebo up to [ADDRESS_1039594] a positive benefit / risk ratio for the 
treatment of psoriasis with secukinumab, and therefore to initiate extension study CAIN457A2302E1. 
4 Population 
All subjects from study CAIN457A2302 and CAIN457A2303 (and potentially rolling over from other secukinumab phase III studies) who were randomized to and have been receiving secukinumab treatment during the maintenance period of the core studies (e.g., CAIN 457A2302 
or CAIN457A2303), and who completed the full study treatment period (52 weeks) in core studies and who have at least a partial response at Week 52 of the core studies, and who comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study, are eli gible to enter into this extension 
study.  
Assuming drop-outs rates of 5% for secukinumab and 15% for placebo in the induction phases of the core studies, 15% drop- out rate in the maintenance phases of the core studies, and a PASI 
50 response rate of about 95%, it is aimed that a total of about 1,[ADDRESS_1039595] to fulfill all of the following criteria:  
1. Subjects who completed the full study treatment period (52 weeks) in the core studies (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303), and after randomization have been receiving secukinumab treatment during the maintenance phase of the core studies, and show at least a partial response (PASI 50 or better) at Week [ADDRESS_1039596] be deemed to benefit from the study drug based on the investigator's clinical judgment.  
4.2 Exclusion criteria 
Subjects fulfilling any of the following criteria are NOT  eligible for inclusion in this  study:  
1. A protocol deviation in the core studies which according to the investigator will prevent the meaningful analysis of the extension study for the individual subject 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1039597] unsuitable for the study 
6. Plans f or administration of live vaccines during the study period 
7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (>10 mIU/mL)  
8. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unwilling to use effective contraception during the study and for 16 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. Effective contraception is defined as either: 
• Barrier method: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with 
spermicide (where available). Spermicides alone are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone  
The following methods are considered more effective than the barrier method and are also 
acceptable:  
• Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) 
• Female sterilization: have had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492]-up hormone level assessment  
• Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject  
• Use of  established oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, 
intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)  
NOTE: Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have 
had: 
• 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or  
• six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40 mIU/mL [for US only: and estradiol <20 pg/mL] or 
• surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492]-up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

The IRT system will search (after the PASI response status has been updated by [CONTACT_759192]) the databases of core studies at Week [ADDRESS_1039606] 
has been on secukinumab (s.c. 150 mg or 300 mg) at the time of completion of Week [ADDRESS_1039607] will be eligible for randomization in the extension study. 
The Week 52 visit in the core study is the randomization visit for CAIN457A2302E1 (extension 
study).  
Based on the fulfillment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_471728] 52 (explained above), the investigator (or designee) will call the IRT set up of extension study (CAIN457A2302E1).The IRT can be contact[CONTACT_759193] (IVRS) or Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). The IRT will assi gn a randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subject 
to a treatment groups (secukinumab 150 mg or placebo secukinumab 150 mg or secukinumab 300 mg or placebo secukinumab 300 mg) and will specify a unique medication number for th e 
first package of investigational treatment to be dispensed to the subject. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller or any of the site staff members.  
The randomization numbers at Week [ADDRESS_1039608] will be produced by [CONTACT_759194] a validated system that automates the random 
assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s).  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_759187] (< 90 kg or ≥90 
kg) collected at Week 52.  
The rand omization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the 
Audit Readiness, Validation & Randomization Group within IIS IA&R (Integrated Information Science Integrated Analytics and Reporting). 
For the subjects classified as partial responders at Week 52  
The same randomization process used for PASI 75 responders at Week 52 will be followed for 
partial responders at Week 52. 
A randomization numbers will be assigned to partial responders. These randomization numbers 
will be linked to the two different treatment groups (secukinumab 150 mg, secukinumab 300 
mg) which correspond to the treatment received in the core studies. Partial responders at Week 52 will then continue to receive the treatment they were assigned in the core studies.

5.4 Treatment blinding  
Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain 
blind to the identity of the study treatment from the time of randomization until final database lock, using the following methods: 
1. Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not 
be accessible by [CONTACT_121927].  
2. The identity of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_759195],  schedule of administration and appearance.  
In order to maintain blind in this study, placebo is used.  
During the double blinded period of the study,  unblinding will only occur in the case of subject 
emergencies ( see Section 5.5.10), at the time of the primary endpoint at Week 68, and when the 
patients enter the open label part of the study at Week 156After all subjects complete Week 68, designated sponsor team members will be unblinded, whereas the subjects, investigator staff, and persons performing the assessments will remain blinded until Week 156  to ensure reliable efficacy and safety measures. At Week 156 all subjects will enter the open label period and subjects, investigator staff, and persons  performing the visit assessments will become 
unblinded.  
In case the results of the core study are published while the extension study is ongoing, the data 
will be published in groups only, with limited ability to unblind individual subjects (The exceptio n to this might be rare safety events that, if occurring in only one treatment group, 
would allow unblinding of the affected subjects). However, since this would be relevant to only a very small group of subjects, if any, no impact on the overall validity of the extension study is expected. Nevertheless, the integrity of the primary endpoint is not affected since no unblinding with respect to placebo in the randomized withdrawal is performed. 
5.[ADDRESS_1039609] number is composed by [CONTACT_175118] (CAIN457A2302E1), 4- digit study site identifier assigned by [CONTACT_759196] a 3- digit sequential number assigned by [CONTACT_759197] (e.g.,CAIN457A2302E1_1234001). The last [ADDRESS_1039610] in the core study and the extension study.  
Subjects will be given the ICF during one of the scheduled visits of the core study (e.g., Week 48 [Visit 20] or at earlier visit in study CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) to read and 
understand for their participation in this extension study. Subjects will NOT  be signing the 
ICF before  completing the assessments on Week 52 visit of the core study (e.g., Visit 21 of the 
study CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) and unless the investigator has entered t he Week 
[ADDRESS_1039611] was on secukinumab in the core study.

Subjects who are eligible (as decided by [CONTACT_1719]) based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and IRT notification (see Section 5.3)  will be asked to sign the ICF. 
In order to enter data for extension study CAIN457A2302E1, the site is to select a CRF book, add the subject’s number from the core study (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) and update the electronic data capturing (EDC) system with this number. 
If the subject fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified immediately and the 
reason for not being treated will be entered on the Screening Epoch Disposition electronic Case 
Repot Form (eCRF). The data or information regarding demography for the subjects not randomized will be available as a listing from the core study databases. The Inclusion/Exclusion eCRF for the extension study CAIN457A2302E1 is to be completed for the subjects not randomized (after signing the ICF), along with Adverse Events eCRF (for study CAIN457A2302E1) for any SAE that occurred after signing the ICF. If a subject fails to be treated in the extension study, the subject completes the follow -up visits in the respective core 
study.  
5.5.2   Dispensing the investigational treatment  
Each study site will be supplied by [CONTACT_759198].  
The boxes containing single prefilled syringes with study treatment solution (secukinumab or placebo secukinumab) has a 2- part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part 
of this label. The blinded qualified study site staff personal will identify the study treatment box to dispense to the subject by [CONTACT_105245](s). Immediately before dispensing the box containing PFS with study treatment, blinded qualified study site staff personal will d etach the outer part of the label from the boxes and affix it to the 
source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject’s unique subject number.  
At Week 160, and once the home administration is operationally set up, subjects will be 
expected to perform ho me administrations at the protocol specified time points. For these cases 
the investigator will dispense, via IRT, an appropriate number of investigational treatment packages for home administrations and detach outer part of the label from the packaging. T he 
subjects will record the date(s) of administration at home and will return the used medication and packaging at their next visit to the site. Subjects will be asked to return all unused medication and packaging the latest at the completion of the study or at the time of discontinuation of the investigational treatment. Site staff will record in the appropriate documents the dates of the administration.  Detailed instructions will be provided separately. 
5.5.3  Storage of investigational treatment  
Single PFS wi th study treatment solution (secukinumab or placebo) will be packed in individual 
boxes. The boxes must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored 
safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, PFS should be stored according to the instructions specified on the treatment labels. PFS and/or clinical supplies are to be dispensed and administered only in accordance with the protocol. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 43  
Amendment Protocol v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
The boxes containing the PFS with study treatment solution should be kept at 2 to 8°C (36°F 
and 46°F). PFS should be protected from direct exposure to light. Therefore the PFS must be stored protected from light. 
The medication label will be in the local language and will comply with the legal requirements 
of each country. The label will include storage conditions for the investigational treatment but no information about the subject except for the medication number.  
The investigator (or designee) must maintain an accurate reco rd of the shipment and dispensing 
of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by [CONTACT_527651].  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the investigator (or designee) will return all used and unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the [COMPANY_001] monitor or to the [COMPANY_001] address provided i n the investigator folder at each site.  
5.5.[ADDRESS_1039612] will require two boxes of syringe set (PFS) per dose throughout the study. 
• One secukinumab 150 mg PFS and one placebo secukinumab PFS (150 mg group) OR  
• Two secukinumab 150 mg PFS (300 mg group) OR   
• Two placebo secukinumab 150 mg PFS (Placebo group)  
All study treatment kits assigned to the subject during the study will be record ed/databased in 
the IRT.  
The syringes with the ready -to-use study treatment solution (PFS) will be provided by [CONTACT_471733].  
All doses of study treatment (secukinumab and/or placebo secukinumab) will be injected at the study site a fter Week [ADDRESS_1039613] study treatment administration (self or by [CONTACT_108575]) will occur at randomization visit (Week 52) after inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed, the core study scheduled assessments at Week [ADDRESS_1039614] use at randomization visit (Week 52) will take place 
under guidance and the supervision of one site staff member. At the randomization visit (Week 52) the subjects will be instructed through the site staff by [CONTACT_759199] “Instructions For Use” on how to self -inject via PFS. At the following visits, subjects will 
receive the PF S at the study site.  
NOTE: The needle cover of the syringe contains dry rubber (latex), which should not be handled by [CONTACT_471734]. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1039615] to be drawn ( Table 6 -1), the study treatment 
will be injected only after the blood samples have been taken. 
At each visit, all study assessments, including the completion of health -related quality of life 
(HRQoL) tools (as reported by [CONTACT_1766]), should be completed prior to the injection of study 
treatment.  
After Week 256, no further study treatment will be administered. In addition, no study treatment is administered during the follow -up period and follow-up 2 period. 
All dates, times of injections, mode of injection (self or by [CONTACT_108575]) during the study must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record eCRF. Immediately before dispensing the package for injection, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging  and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject’s unique 
subject number.  
Administration  
Secukinumab solution for s.c. injection or placebo secukinumab solution (active or placebo, 
respectively) will be provided in PFS. 
The study treatment solution must be injected in non- affected areas of the skin. If possible, 
throughout the trial administer the study treatment to one of the following body regions, 
changing the injection site from visit to visit: right thigh, left thigh, right stomach, left stomach, upper outer arm (when assisted by [CONTACT_471735]).  
Prior to administration the boxes containing the PFS with study treatment solution should be allowed to come to room temperature unopened for about 20 minutes before administration. Used PF S should be disposed immediately after use in a sharps container OR according to the 
regulatory needs of the respective countries. 
Home administration 
During the open label period, after approximately two years of study of self -administered 
treatment under  the supervision of site staff during the double blinded period, subjects will be 
expected to self -administer the PFS at home when they are not visiting the site for any other 
trial related procedures.  
The subjects will be allowed to self -administer treatment at home (starting Week 160) only if 
they have exhibited correct use for self -administering the PFS at the site.  
It is important that during the self -administration period at home, subjects contact [CONTACT_1275] / site staff in case they are experiencing any AE/SAEs or have any concerns.  
If the subject is not able / not confident to self -administer the PFS, he/she should visit the site

Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent 
• Emergence of the following AEs: the AEs that in the judgment of the investigator, taking 
into account the subject’s overall status, prevent the subject from continuing participation in the study (for example, sepsis or serious infection).
  
• Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into  consideration the subject’s overall status, prevents the subject from continuing participation in the study.  
• Pregnancy (see sections 6.5.6 and 7.3) 
• Use of prohibited treatment as per recommendations in Table 5 -1.

Subjects who withdraw from follow -up 2 period should perform the Week 268 assessments (see 
Table 6 -1). 
Premature subject withdrawal  
Subjects who state an intention to withdraw prematurely from the study will be asked to return 
for follow -up visits to assess safety after cessation of therapy and, if willing, to assess duration 
of effect (e.g., rebound assessments). If the subject returns to the study site to have his/her follow- up visits (Week 264 and Week 268), the investigator will follow the study treatment 
discontinuation procedures. 
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_759200]/ 
OL-EoT visit to register the subject’s early completion of the study due to subject withdrawal.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1039625] to follow -up (i.e. those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator should

using the IRT. When the investigator or his/her blinded designee contacts the system to unblind a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and the date, time, and reason for unblinding. The investigator will then receive details of the treatment for the specified subject and a fax confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the [COMPANY_001] monitor for the study site and the Clinical Trial Head that the code has been broken.  
It is the  investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the IRT access codes in case of emergency. The investigator (or designee) will inform the subject how to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she  is unavailable. The

the extension study after he/she has completed all visits and assessments as defined in Table 6 -
1 and received all doses of the study treatment in accordance with the protocol. 
The extension study as a whole will be considered complete when eligible subjects rolled over 
from the core study (e.g., CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303)  have com pleted as per protocol 
the visits and assessments defined in Table [ADDRESS_1039628]’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and/or Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) of the early termination of the trial.  
6 Visit schedule and assessments  
Table 6 -1 lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “x” when the visits are performed . 
Subjects should be seen for all visits on the designated day within the allowed “visit window” specified below or as close to it as possible.  
During the treatment periods, subjects may be seen at an unscheduled visit, e.g., if they experience deteriorati on of psoriasis, or AEs that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_759179]. During these unscheduled visits, study treatment will NOT be administered.  
A visit window of “±5” will be allowed for Week 52 to Week 256 during randomized withdrawal and/or treatment period, the open label period or the follow -up period. Patients are 
expected to adhere as close as possible to the visit schedule.  
Relapse visits (R1, R2, and R3) will have visit window of “±2” days. Time schedule of relapse visits cannot be anticipated and will be different for each subject experiencing first full relapse (a loss of >50% of the maximum PASI gain compared to baseline of the core study). 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment will continue to be followed for safety assessments. 
They are not considered withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment before completing the study, and those who 
prematurely withdraw from the study for any reason should be scheduled for a study visi t [ADDRESS_1039629] study treatment administration, at which time all the assessments listed for EoT (Week 260) will  be performed (see Section 5.5.10). Subjects will return to the study 
site for further assessments as indicated under the follow-up visits (Week 264 and 268). 
Only subjects who prematurely discontinued study treatment should enter follow -up 2 period 
after completion of follow -up visits (Weeks 264 and 268). Follow -up [ADDRESS_1039630] them or a knowledgeable informant by [CONTACT_109034] (i.e. certified letter) immediately. At this cont act, the 
safety (e.g., potential occurrence of AE or SAE) and the primary reason for a subject’s premature withdrawal should be determined.

6.4 Efficacy 
All efficacy assessments should be performed prior to administration of study treatment.  
It is important to perform the IGA before the PASI,  as the knowledge of PASI scoring can 
potentially influence how the evaluator scores the IGA. Therefore, the following order should 
be applied when performing the efficacy assessments during study visits: 
• Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA mod 2011; scale from 0 – 4)  
• Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; score from 0 – 72) 
• Rebound assessment 
6.4.1  Investigator’s global assessment (IGA mod 2011)  
IGA mod 2011 will be conducted for overall psoriatic disease as  indicated in Table 6 -1. It is 
recommended that the same evaluator conducts the assessment throughout the study whenever 
possible. 
The IGA mod 2011 rating scale for overall psoriatic disease is shown in Table 6 -2. 
The IGA mod 2011 scale has been used in the core studies (e.g., CAIN457A2302 and 
CAIN457A2303), and in secukinumab phase II studies in collaboration with Health Authorities, in particular th e FDA.  
The IGA mod [ADDRESS_1039648]’s disease state at the time of the assessments, and does not attempt a comparison with any of the subject’s previous disease states, whether at baseline of cor e study or at a previous visit.  
The IGA mod [ADDRESS_1039649] clear  Normal to pi[INVESTIGATOR_108997]; no thickening; no to minimal  
focal scaling  
2 Mild Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22767]; just detectable to mild thickening;  
predominantly fine scaling  
3 Moderate  Dull bright red, clearly distinguishable erythema; clearly 
distinguishable to moderate thickening; moderate scaling  
4 Severe  Bright to deep dark red coloration; severe thickening with hard edges; 
severe / coarse scal ing covering almost all or all lesions  
Note: Involvement of nails is not part of the assessment.  
Based on this scale, a subject will be considered as IGA [ADDRESS_1039650] 2 points on the IGA scale compared to baseline.  
6.4.2  Assessment of psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)  
The investigator or qualified designee will complete the PASI assessment as indicated in Table 
6-1. Whenever possible, the same evaluator should perform this assessment at all visits.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 60  
Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
A PASI score ( Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978, Weisman et al 2003 , Gottlieb et al 2005 ) will 
be derived as indicated in Table 6 -3. The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed 
separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration), and scaling (desquamation). 
The average degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score of 0-4. The area covered by [CONTACT_109042] a percentage of the total 
area of that particular body region. Furth er practical details help the assessment:  
1. The neck is assessed as part of the head.  
2. The axillae and groin are assessed as part of the trunk.  
3. The buttocks are assessed as part of the lower limbs. 
4. When scoring the severity of erythema, scales should not be removed.

†Neck is assessed as part of the Head (H) body region.  
‡Axillae and groin are assessed as part of the Trunk (T) body region.  
§Buttocks are assessed as part of the Lower limbs (L) body region.  
Because the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs correspond to approximately 
10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the body surface area, respectively, the PASI score is calculated 
using the formula: 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 61  
Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
PASI = 0.1(E H+IH+D H)AH + 0.2(E U+IU+D U)AU + 0.3(E T+IT+D T)AT + 0.4(E L+IL+D L)AL 
The keys for the letters are provided in Table [ADDRESS_1039651] be either a PASI 75 responder or partial responder according to the definitions stated below:  
• PASI 75 responders: subjects with PASI 75 response (subjects achieving ≥ 75% 
improvement [reduction] in PASI score compared to baseline of the core study) at Week 52  
• Partial responders: subjects with PASI 50 response (subjects achieving ≥ 50% improvement [reduction] in PASI score compared to baseline of the core study, but not achieving a PASI 75 response) at Week 52  
During the study, at each visit, the PASI score will be calculated and response will be classified according to the definitions from CHMP guidelines for psoriasis CHMP/EWP/2454/ 02 2004  
• PASI 75 response:  subjects achieving ≥ 75% improvement (reduction) in PASI score 
compared to baseline of the core study are defined as PASI 75 responders 
• PASI 50 response:  subjects achieving ≥ 50% improvement (reduction) in PASI score 
compared to baseline of the core study are defined as PASI 50 responders 
• PASI 90 response:  subjects achieving ≥ 90% improvement (reduction) in PASI score 
compared to baseline of the core study are defined as PASI 90 responders  
• PASI 100 response/remission:  complete clearing of psoriasis (PASI=0)  
• Relapse:  when the achieved maximal PASI improvement from baseline of core study is 
reduced by >50% 
For subjects in PASI 75 responder group and entering the randomized withdrawal period, PASI 
response status at each visit (after Week 52 visit) will be calculated to determine if subject will enter the treatment period. PASI at the visit will be compared to the PASI baseline of the core study to assess if su bject meets criteria for " first full relapse " (loss of >50% of maximum PASI 
gain compared to PASI baseline of the core study). Sites will have to enter relapse assessment into eCRFs and update the IRT at each visit in randomized withdrawal period. Subjects  with 
first full relapse then stop randomized withdrawal period and enter treatment period.  
6.4.3  Assessment of rebound  
Rebound of disease will be assessed as indicated in Table 6 -1.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 62  
Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
In addition to the asse ssment of PASI, the investigator will assess whether new pustular 
psoriasis, or new erythrodermic psoriasis, or more inflammatory psoriasis occurred (yes/no). 
Definitions related to rebound 
• Rebound: A Subject experiences a rebound, if PASI increases to > 1 25% of baseline 
(where baseline is the PASI at the randomization of the core study) PASI, or if new 
pustular psoriasis, or new erythrodermic psoriasis, or more inflammatory psoriasis occurs within [ADDRESS_1039652]’s body area is affected by [CONTACT_90050], is considered acceptable by [CONTACT_6628] ( CHMP/EWP/2454/02 2004) to assess efficacy in conjunction with IGA mod 2011. 
6.5 Safety  
All blood draws and safety assessments should be done prior to study treatment administration. Appropriate safety assessments (e.g., evaluation of AEs and SAEs including injection site 
reactions) should be repeated after the dose is administered. 
• Evaluation of all AEs and SAEs including injection site reactions  
• Physical examination  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory assessments  
• Hematology  
• Clinical chemistry  
• Urinalysis  
• Immunogenicity (IG; assessment of anti-secukinumab antibody development) 
• ECG

6.5.2  Vital signs  
Vital signs (including blood pressure and pulse measurements) will be assessed at every 
scheduled visit as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1039654] has been sitting for five minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured twice (measurements separated 
by 1 to 2 minutes) using a validated device, with an appropriately sized cuff. In case the cuff sizes available are not large enough for the subject's arm circumference, a sphygmomanometer with an appropriately sized cuff may  be used ( Mancia et al 2007 ). On the Vital Signs eCRF, the 
average of the two measurements will be entered. If possible, assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_759208] e study.  
Normal blood pressure will be defined as a systolic pressure of 90 to <120 mmHg, and a diastolic blood pressure of 60 to <80 mmHg under the measurement conditions outlined above. Notable blood pressure will be hypertension (systolic ≥140 mmHg and/ or diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg) 
or hypotension (systolic <90 mmHg and/or diastolic <60 mmHg). A blood pressure indicative of prehypertension (systolic 120 to < 140 mmHg and/or diastolic 80 to < 90 mmHg) will not be regarded as notable ( Chobanian et al 2003). A normal pulse rate will be defined as a rate of 60 
to 100 beats per minute under the measurement conditions outlined above. Notable pulse rates are a rate below 60 bpm (bradycardia) or above 100 bpm (tachyc ardia).  
Whether action needs to be taken to address notable vital signs will be decided by [CONTACT_093], taking into account the overall status of the subject. No specific action is foreseen as part of the study protocol.

Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential 
(neutrophils including bands, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) and platelet count will be measured at all scheduled study visits, within the visit window specified in Table 
6-1. 
Clinical chemistry  
Serum chemistries will include urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), 
GGT, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorous, total protein, albumin, uric acid, amylase and lipase.  Serum chemistries will be mea sured at all 
scheduled study visits within the visit window specified in Table [ADDRESS_1039656] dipstick measurements for specific gravity, protein, glucose, pH, blood, urine blood dipstick (non- hemolyzed), urine blood dipstick (hemolyzed), bilirubin, ketones and WBC will 
be done at scheduled visits as indicated in Table 6 -1. 
Immunogenecity (IG)  
Blood samples for IG (anti -secukinumab antibodies) will be taken pre -dose at the scheduled 
timepoints as indica ted in Table 6 -1 and Appendix 2, Table 13 -2. Blood samples (approximately 
2 mL) will be collec ted into serum separator tubes (SST). The blood sample will be allowed to 
clot over a minimum of 30 minutes at room temperature prior to harvesting of the serum. The serum will be obtained by [CONTACT_279880] 2500 revolutions per minute (rpm ) 
for 10 minutes. 
Serum samples will be placed on ice, split into 2 aliquots (labeled plain barrier polypropylene 
tubes) and then stored (within 30 minutes of collection) at approximately -70°C to -20°C prior 
to shipment on dry ice to the central laborator y. Shipment of stored aliquots from the site to the 
central lab should be on a monthly basis. To the extent possible, the site should send each aliquot to the central laboratory separately. If a study site does not have the facility to store aliquots at the conditions specified, then they will maintain the sample on dry ice at the site and ship on 
dry ice on the day of collection. The central lab will ship one aliquot of the samples on dry ice to the analytical laboratory. The remaining aliquots must be kept at the central lab as a backup sample. Remaining samples will only be disposed of after approval by [CONTACT_759209] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 to 12 months after the clinical study report [CSR] is published). 
All blood samples will be taken by [CONTACT_37277]. The actual sample collection date and 
exact time of collection will be entered on the Blood collection for IG eCRF or the Unscheduled blood collection for IG eCRF, as appropriate. Sampling problems will be noted in the ‘Reason sample not taken’ sectio n of the eCRF.

documentation by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) at scheduled visits as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1039664]/hip circumference 
ratio will be calculated from the waist and hip circumference measurements. Waist and hip circumference will be measured as follows ( WHO Document, 1988, Lohman TG, 1988).  
The subject should stand with weight evenly balanced on both feet 25- [ADDRESS_1039665] in the mid -axillary line 
and mark this level on the skin as well. Apply an elastic tape (e.g., a narrow string of silk covered elastic rubber band) horizontally midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest (this is to assist in defining the levels of the waist circumference). The tape should  be tied firmly 
enough to stay in position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. 
The subject should be asked to breathe normally and at the time of making the measurements, 
the subject should be asked to breathe out gently to prevent from contracting their muscles or holding their breath. Measure the circumference of the tape using a plastic tape measure (not elastic or metal).  
Repeat the above with the elastic tape around the point yielding the maximum circumference over the buttocks. 
It is recommended that the observer sits in front of the subject and that the same study site staff 
member carries out the assessment throughout the study wherever possible Note: waist and hip  circumference will not be performed during the open label period. 
6.6.2  Fasting laboratory evaluations

for clinical assessments. Responses will be collected using digitized paper with a digital pen. 
The dig itized paper will serve as source documentation; the pen will be transferred to its 
docking station for transmittal of the subject’s responses to the vendor’s database. Subjects are to initial and date the white box (and not the shaded area of the form) at  the bottom left hand 
portion of the last page of the questionnaire. In those countries not permitting subjects to initial documents, the date and 3- letter initials of the country in which the subject participates is to be 
used. By [CONTACT_759213], the subject’s initials will not be copi[INVESTIGATOR_759180] a digitized copy of the completed questionnaires. The digitized pen writes in green ink. Only this pen may be used for making corrections and only the subject may make corrections. Corrections must be “single -lined” 
through, and should be dated and where permitted, initialed by [CONTACT_423]. 
The subject is to be given sufficient space and time to complete the questionnaires. The study  
coordinator is to check the questionnaires for completeness and encourage the subject to 
complete any missing responses. The original questionnaires will be kept with the subject’s file as source documentation.  
Completed questionnaires will be reviewed a nd examined by a blinded staff member at the site 
(not the investigator or evaluator of the subject for the physician assessments), before the 
clinical examination, for responses that may indicate potential AEs or SAEs. The investigator is to review not only the responses to the questions in the questionnaires but also to look for unsolicited comments written by [CONTACT_423]. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed by [CONTACT_093], then she/he must record the events as per instructions given in Section 7  of the protocol. 
Investigators and study coordinators are not to encourage subjects to change the responses reported in the completed questionnaires. Study coordinators are to complete the header information at the top  of the questionnaire prior to distributing it to the subjects.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dermatology Life Quality Index© (DLQI©) 
The DLQI© is a 10 -item general dermatology disability index designed to assess HRQoL in 
adult subjects with skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, acn e, and viral warts ( Finlay and 
Khan, 1994). The measure is self -administered and includes domains of daily activities, leisure, 
personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment, and work/school. The measure  is 
widely used: it has been tested across [ADDRESS_1039666] week, and the instrument requires 1 to 2 minutes for completion. Each item has four response categories, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). "Not relevant" is also a valid response and is scored as 0. The DLQI
© total score is a sum of the 
10 questions. Scores range from 0 to 30, and higher scores indicate greater HRQoL impairment. Additionally, each subscale of the DLQI
© may be analyzed separately.  
The DLQI© questionnaire (date of publication 1994) will be completed by [CONTACT_759214] 6 -1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EuroQOL 5 -Dimension© (EQ-5D©) Health Status Questionna ire 
The EQ -5D© is a generic instrument to assess each subject’s health status. It provides a simple 
descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The instrument essentially consists of 2 pages – the EQ -5D
© descriptive system and the EQ vi sual analog scale (VAS). The EQ -
5D© descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. 
Each dimension has 3 response levels: no problems, some problems, severe problems. T he 
subject is asked to indicate her/his health state by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a cross) in the box against 
the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. 
The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical scale where the endpoints are 
labeled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state’. This information 
can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by [CONTACT_112775]. 
The EQ -5D

[IP_ADDRESS]  Health Assessment Questionnaire©- Disability Index (HAQ©-DI) 
(subjects with PsA only)  
The HAQ© was developed by [CONTACT_759215] -term influence of chronic disease on a subject's level of functional ability and 
activity restriction. Although originally developed for use in subje cts with rheumatic disease, 
the HAQ© has been employed across a large variety of disease areas. The disability assessment 
component of the HAQ©-DI, assesses a subject's level of functional ability and includes 
questions of fine movements of the upper extre mity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, 
and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities. There are 20 items in eight 
categories of functioning including dressing & grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. The stem of each item asks over the past week "Are you able 
to …" perform a particular task. Each item is scored on a 4 -point scale from 0 to 3, representing 
normal (without any difficulty [0]), with some difficulty (1), with much difficulty (2), and

unable to do (3). The HAQ©-DI also includes questions about the use of ‘aids or devices’ and 
aid from other people to supplement the answers given to the 20 items.  
The purpose of the HAQ©-DI in this study is to assess the functional ability of subj ects with 
PsA at baseline of the core study.  
The HAQ©-DI questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_471745] [ADDRESS_1039667] venipuncture. Blood samples (approximately 2 mL, not less than 1.5 mL) will be collected into SST. The blood sample will be allowed to clot over a minimum of 30 minutes at room temperature prior to harvesting of the serum. The serum wi ll 
be obtained by [CONTACT_279880] 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes. 
Serum samples will be placed on ice, split into 2 aliquots (polypropylene tubes) and then stored 
(within 30 minutes of collection) at -70°C to -20°C (approximately) prior to shipme nt to the 
central laboratory. Shipment of stored aliquots from the site to the central lab should be on a monthly basis. To the extent possible, the site should send each aliquot to the central laboratory separately. If a study site does not have the facil ity to store aliquots at the conditions specified, 
then samples must be stored on dry ice at the site and shipped on dry ice on the day of collection. The central lab will ship one aliquot of the samples on dry ice to the analytical laboratory. The remaini ng aliquots must be kept at the central lab as a backup sample. Remaining samples will 
only be disposed of after approval by [CONTACT_759209] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 to 12 months after the Clinical study report (CSR) is published). 
The actual sample collection  date and exact time of collection will be entered on the Blood 
collection for PK eCRF or the Unscheduled blood collection for PK eCRF, as appropriate. 
Sampling problems will be noted in the ‘Reason sample not taken’ section of the eCRF. 
PK sample handling, labeling and shipment instructions  
A laboratory manual will be provided by [CONTACT_279886], sample handling and shipment. Tubes and labels will be provided by [CONTACT_37281]/sample type and sample number preprinted on the label.

investigation  subject after providing written informed consent  for participation in the study. 
Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a study 
treatment. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment ar e only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting study treatment. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the subject at each 
visit or each telephone call during the study. AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_144970], laboratory test, or other assessments.  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria:  
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically significant,  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 71  
Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
• they require therapy.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non- typi[INVESTIGATOR_279832].  
The investigator must consider the AEs still ongoing at Week 52 of the core study (e.g., 
CAIN457A2302 or CAIN457A2303) at the time a subject enters the extension study. The ongoing AEs from the core study will be followed to final outcome in the extension study clinical trial database. New AEs with onset while subject is in the extension study will be entered in the Adverse Event eCRF of the extension study. 
Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and 
identifying adverse events. Alert ranges for labs and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1. 
AEs sho uld be recorded in the Adverse Events eCRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis 
associated with them accompanied by [CONTACT_6644].

• is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Unlike  routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements; see Section 7.2. 
All AEs should be treated appropriately. The action taken to treat the AE should be  recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
AEs that occur after informed consent has been obtained must be captured on the Adverse event 
eCRF. Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the IB or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator Notifications (IN). This information will be included in the informed consent given to the subject and should be discussed with the s ubject during the study as needed.  
The investigator should also instruct each subject to report any new AE (beyond the protocol observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to [COMPANY_001].

• after the subject has provided informed consent and until [ADDRESS_1039670] has stopped the study participation (defined as last visit of the study at Week 268)  for subjects who don’t enter follow-up 2 period  
• after the subject has provided informed consent and until the last telephone contact [CONTACT_471749]-up [ADDRESS_1039671] be submitted within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE that is 
considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as 
a new event.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 73  
Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow -up information) is collected and recorded 
on the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form (SAE report form) or where available the 
Serious Adverse Event Form within the remote data capturing (RDC) system. The investigator must assess the relationship to each specific study treatment and complete the paper or 
electronic SAE report form in its entirety in English.   
When SAEs are recorded on the paper SAE form, these should be faxed within 24 hours of 
awareness of the SAE to the local [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) 
Department. The telephone and fax number of the contact [CONTACT_146537]&E, specific to the site, are listed in the investigator folder provided to each site. The original 
copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report form documentation at the study site.  
When SAEs are recorded electronically in the Oracle Clinical/ Remote Data Capture (OC/RDC) system, these should be entered, saved and e -signed within 24 hours of awareness of the SAE . 
These data will automatically be submitted to [COMPANY_001] DS&E immediately after investigator signature [INVESTIGATOR_1660] [ADDRESS_1039672] continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re -occurrence, complication, or 
progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of 
when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the study treatment, a DS&E Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same investigational treatment that this SAE has been reported.
 Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

A data monitoring committee (DMC) will review the safety data of this trial at selected time 
intervals at least until the Week 68 PEA. Details regarding the DMC process will be available in relevant secukinumab DMC charter. 
8 Data review and database management  
8.1 Site monitoring 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] representative will review the protocol and eCRFs with the investigators and their staff. During the study, the field monit or will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of subject 
records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored , 
dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits.  
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case and visit n otes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original ICF signed by [CONTACT_3184] a 
signed copy is given to the subject. 
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency with the eCRF entrie s. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification for 
the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study -
specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed.  
8.2 Data collection 
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_109051]/RDC system. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the system until they have been trained.  
Automatic validation procedures within the system check for data discrepancies during and 
after data entry and, by [CONTACT_105273], allow the data to be confirmed or corrected online by [CONTACT_105274]. The investigator must certify that the data entered into the eCRFs are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_109002].  
8.3 Database management and quality control 
[COMPANY_001] staff [or CRO working on behalf of [COMPANY_001]] review the data entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_759217] [ADDRESS_1039674] the data. If the electronic query system is not used, a paper Data Query Form will be faxed to the site. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to [COMPANY_001] staff that

9.1 Analysi s sets  
The following analysis sets will be used in this trial: 
Randomized set : The randomized set will be defined as all subjects who were randomized. 
Unless otherwise specified, mis -randomized subjects (mis -randomized in IRT) will be excluded 
from the ra ndomized set. Mis -randomized subjects will be defined as those subjects where IRT 
contact [CONTACT_759218]’s final randomization eligibility and double -blind study treatment was not administered 
to the subject. 
Full analysis set (FAS) : The FAS will be comprised of all subjects from the randomized set to 
whom study treatment has been assigned. Following the intent -to-treat principle, subjects will 
be analyzed according to the treat ment assigned to at randomization, but actual stratum, if 
stratified randomization is used.

Psoriasis specific medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Previous treatments 
for psoriasis and whether or not response was achieved will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
All the medical history information will be retrieved from the core studies.  
9.3 Treatments 
Study treatment 
The analysis of study treatment data will be based on the safety set.  
The duration of exposure to study treatment will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. In 
addition, the number and percentage of subjects with cumulative exposure levels (e.g., any exposure, ≥ 1 week, ≥ 2 weeks, ≥ 3 weeks, ≥ 4 weeks, ≥ 8 weeks, etc.) will be presented. 
Prior and concomitant medication  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized in separate tables by [CONTACT_1570].  
Prior medications are defined as treatments taken and stopped prior to first dose of study 
treatment. Any medication given at lea st once between the day of first dose of randomized study 
treatment and the date of the last study visit will be a concomitant medication, including those which were started pre -baseline and continued into the period where study treatment is 
administered.  
Medications will be presented in alphabetical order, by [CONTACT_121974] (ATC) codes and grouped by [CONTACT_121975]. Tables will show the overall number and percentage of subjects receiving at least one treatment of a particular ATC code and at least one treatment in a particular anatomical main group.  
Significant prior and concomitant non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471715].  
The number and percentage of subjects  receiving different classes of prior psoriasis therapy 
(biologic systemic therapy, non -biologic systemic therapy, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], phototherapy, 
photochemotherapy) will be presented by [CONTACT_144971][INVESTIGATOR_759182] (primary lack of efficacy, secondary lack of efficacy,

comparisons for loss of PASI 75 response and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be computed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment group, core study and baseline PASI of core study and baseline PASI of extension study as explanatory variable and stratified by [CONTACT_759185]. The primary analysis will be the log -rank test. Subjects who have not lost PASI 75 response up to 
Week 68 will be considered as censored observations.  
The Kaplan -Meier estimates of the (1 minus cumulative rate loss of PASI 75 response) for each 
treatment will be plotted. The plot will include the number of subjects at risk for each treatment group at pre- specified time points (e.g., visits).  
The number of subjects with loss of PASI [ADDRESS_1039680] error, as estimable will be provided for each treatment group. In addition, for pr e-specified time 
intervals (e.g., 4-week intervals) the following will be presented: 
• for each treatment group and time interval: subjects at risk, subjects with loss of PASI 75 
response, subjects with loss of PASI 75 response divided by [CONTACT_759219], cumulative subjects with event and cumulative event probability including 95% confidence interval.

• for treatment comparisons the hazard ratio derived via Cox regression as well as log -rank 
test and Wilcoxon test.  
Separate analyses will be performed for com parison of 150 mg secukinumab with placebo and 
300 mg secukinumab with placebo. The two placebo groups will not be pooled for this analysis.  
Testing strategy  
The familywise error will be set to α=2.5% (one -sided). The two hypotheses H 1 (referring to 
150 mg) and H 2 (referring to 300 mg) will be tested at α/2=1.25% one -sided. In case, a null 
hypothesis has been rejected for one dose, but not for the other dose, the alpha can be shifted to 
the other dose and the null hypotheses can be retested at level α=2.5% (one- sided). The 
graphical approach of [Bretz et al (2009)] for sequentially rejective testing procedures is used to illustrate the testing strategy (Figure 9 -1): 
Figure 9-1 Testing strategy  
 
Other secondary endpoints will not be included in the testing strategy. 
9.4.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
For the primary analysis subjects who did not lose PASI 75 response before Week 68 but with 
missing values at Week 68 will be considered as censored. Other time -to-event analyses will be 
handled analogously. 
For other analyses (not time to event) missing values with respect to response variables based 
on PASI score and IGA mod 2011 score will be imputed with non-r esponse regardless of the 
reason for missing data (e.g., premature study discontinuation, missed visit, administrative issues).  
Following the intent -to-treat principle for subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment, but 
who are observed in the follow -up period, efficacy data collected in follow -up periods will be 
linked to planned but missed study visits as well, following imputation schemes described in the analysis plan (e.g., if a subject discontinues treatment at Week 56, but has follow -up visit 
F4, the PASI score observed at Visit F4 might be used for Week 60 assessments). 
The last observation carried forward method will be applied to PASI score and IGA mod [ADDRESS_1039681] will be removed from the analysis of the corresponding variable, i.e., it might be th at the number of subjects providing data to an analysis 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 80  
Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
is smaller than the number of subjects in the FAS. In addition, missing baseline values will not 
be imputed. 
9.4.4  Supportive analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed as follows: 
• Subjects fulfilling at least one of the following criteria will be classified as non -responders 
with respect to PASI  75 and IGA 0 or 1 response at Week 68 and the Cox proportional 
hazards regression analysis of the primary analysis will be repeated:  
• subjects with missing inje ction (s) up to Week 68,  
• dropouts due to AEs, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect up to Week 68, and 
• subjects with missing data at Week 68.  
• PASI 75 will be evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression as described above 
with multiple imputations instead of non-responder imputation for missing values. Within 
this analysis the PASI score will be imputed and response variables will be derived based on the imputed scores. For each treatment group values will be imputed separately. Further details will be given in the analysis plan. 
In addition, the secukinumab treatment groups will also be compared, i.e. a Cox proportional hazards regression will be fitted as described above including all four treatment groups. Placebo (secukinumab 150 mg in core studies) and Placebo (secukinumab 300 mg in core studies) will be compared as well as secukinumab 150 mg and secukinumab 300 mg.

9.5.2  Safety  variables 
All safety evaluations will be performed on the Safety set. For adverse events an analysis based 
on pooled treatment groups “any secukinumab 150 mg” and “any secukinumab 300 mg” will also be done. In the analysis of the subjects who were re -treated after relapse with secukinumab 
150 mg or 300 mg only safety data after re -treatment after relapse will be reported. With the 
exception of adverse events that qualify as "treatment emergent" (see definition below), data collected from telephone visits a nd unscheduled visits in follow -up period [ADDRESS_1039684] study treatment.  
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treat ment group, the number and percentage 
of subjects having any AE, having an AE in each primary system organ class and having each individual AE (preferred term). Summaries will also be presented for AEs by [CONTACT_201092]. If a subject reported more than one adverse events with the same 
preferred term, the adverse event with the greatest severity will be presented. If a subject reported more than one adverse events within the same primary system organ class, the subject will be c ounted only once with the greatest severity at the system organ class level, where 
applicable.  
Confidence intervals for relative frequencies will be derived as well according to the score method including continuity correction by [CONTACT_85691], 1998. 
Separate summaries will be provided for death, serious adverse event, other significant adverse 
events leading to discontinuation and adverse events leading to dose adjustment (including study treatment discontinuation).

A graphical display of relative frequencies within system organ classes and relative risks, if 
appropriate, will be presented. 
For infections, time -to-event analysis will be done. Results will be tabulated and the Kaplan-
Meier estimates for the cumulative rate will be plotted.  
Additional analyses will be provided for adjudicated adverse events. In supplementary analyses, exposure  (or observation) -time adjusted analyses in terms of 
incidence rate and event rate will be provided.  
Laboratory data  
The summary of laboratory evaluations will be presented for three groups of laboratory tests 
(hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis). Descriptive summary statistics for the change from baseline to each study visit will be presented. These descriptive summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_109057], laboratory test and treatment group. Change from baseline will only be summarized for subjects with both baseline and post baseline. 
For each parameter, the maximum change from baseline within each study period will be 
analyzed analogously.  
In addition, shift tables will be provided for all parameters to compare a subject’s baseline laboratory evaluation relative to the visit’s observed value. For the shift tables, the normal laboratory ranges will be used to evaluate whether a particular laboratory test value was normal, low, or high for each visit value relative to whether or not the baseline value was normal, low, or high. These summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_109058]. Shifts will be presented  for most extreme values post- baseline.  
Immunogenicity  
Summary statistics for baseline, each post- baseline visit and change from ba seline to each visit 
will be provided. Summary statistics will be provided for the percent of subjects with immunogenicity. If appropriate, shift tables will also be presented. 
Vital signs  
Analysis of the vital sign measurements using summary statistics fo r the change from baseline 
for each post -baseline visit will be performed. These descriptive summaries will be presented

9.5.3  Health -related Quality of Life (HRQoL)  
EQ-5D© 
The EQ -5D© is a questionnaire with 5 questions (regarding mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each with three categories (no problem, moderate 
problem, severe problems) and a health state assessment from 0 (worst possible health state) to 
100 (best possible health state). The number and percentage of subjects in each of the thr ee 
categories for each question will be presented by [CONTACT_3232]. Summary statistics will be shown for the health state assessment by [CONTACT_3232]. 
DLQI
©  
The DLQI© measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological d isorders that are 
greater than 18 years of age and had been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic 
dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The DLQI© is a simple, validated, self -
administered 10- item questionnaire.  The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., 
symptoms and feeling, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, treatment). For the DLQI
©, each question will be answered with the following response: “not 
at all,” “a little,” “a lot,” or “very much”. Seven scores will be derived from the DLQI©: the 
total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.  
For each of the seven scores the percentage chan ge from baseline will be derived. Summary 
statistics will be provided for absolute values as well as for the percentage change by [CONTACT_3232].  
For the “subjects who were PASI 75 responders at Week 52” the following analysis will be performed as well:  
The absolute value and the percentage change from baseline of DLQI
© total score will be 
analyzed with the Van -Elteren test using type -II weights, for all pairwise comparisons between 
secukinumab treatment groups versus placebo. The Van- Elteren tes t will be performed at each 
visit. Language of the questionnaire and body weight stratum will be the strata adjusted for in the Van -Elteren test. In addition, stratified Hodges -Lehmann estimates for the median as well 
as confidence intervals will be derived for the absolute values and percentage change to baseline for each treatment group as well as for all pairwise comparisons between secukinumab treatment groups versus placebo. 
It is understood that conclusions obtained from the confidence intervals of these estimates 
(mean or Hodges -Lehmann estimates for the median) will not be completely consistent with the 
testing results (Van -Elteren test) which constitute the key analysis for drawing conclusions.

Amendment Protocol  v03 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457A2302E1  
 
In addition, summary statistics will be provided for number of subjects achieving DLQI 0 or 
1. For the “subjects who were PASI 75 responders at Week 52” the secukinumab treatment 
groups will be compared to placebo by [CONTACT_111709]’s exact test . 
HAQ©-DI (for subjects with PSA at baseline of the core study)  
Summary statistics will be derived for HAQ©-DI score over time for all subjects with psoriatic 
arthritis recorded on the Psoriatic Arthritis History eCRF at screening visit of the core study.  
Absolute and relative frequencies for HAQ©-DI response will also be presented. HAQ©-DI 
response is defined by [CONTACT_471754] 0.[ADDRESS_1039685] deviation, coefficient of variation, median and quartiles, the geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation and n(log) will be presented.

All data collected u p to Week 68 will be analyzed. 
Additional interim analyses may be conducted at various time points for publications or health 
authority requests. The study procedures will not be modified as a result of these interim analyses  
9.7 Sample size calculation  
Assump tions for the number of subjects eligible for randomized withdrawal (i.e for the 
analysis of primary endpoint): 
• Drop -out rate on secukinumab at Week 12 in core studies: 5% (estimate from 
CAIN457A2211) 
• Drop -out rate on placebo at Week 12 in core studies: 15% (from CAIN457A2211) 
• Placebo PASI 75 response rate at Week 12: 5% (conservative assumption) 
• Drop -out rate on secukinumab up to Week 52 in core studies: 15% (common for 
secukinumab induction and placebo induction regimens, as in Leonardi et al, 2008) 
• PASI 75 response rate at Week 52 on secukinumab 150 mg in core studies: 65% (from 
dosing rationale in protocols of core studies) (power would be larger for 300 mg if we would assume similar loss of PASI75 rates)  
• Type -I-error rate is defined to one-sided 2.5%  
With these assumptions it is estimated to have 414 subjects eligible per dose  to enter the 
randomized withdrawal, with a randomization ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_1039687] more than 90% power to detect differences in the cumulative rates if 10% of subjects on secukinumab lost PASI 75 response versus 23% on placebo, PASS 2008 software (Log Rank Survival Power Analysis - Simple ).  
 
10 Ethical considerations

10.2 Informed consent procedures 
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing 
so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the subject. In cases where the subject’s representati ve gives consent, the subject should be informed about 
the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_759226] [ADDRESS_1039688] be obtained before conducting any 
study- specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of 
obtaining informed consent should be documented in the subject source docum ents. 
[COMPANY_001] will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form  suggested by [CONTACT_759227]/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the [COMPANY_001] monitor after IRB/IEC approval. 
Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taki ng the study treatment may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study. If there is any question that the subject will not reliably comply, they should not be entered in the study. 
10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC

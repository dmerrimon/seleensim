Background:  Each year, over [ADDRESS_202372] computed tomography (CT) 
scan that was ordered for some other indication. Now that guidelines from multiple 
organizations recommend lung cancer screening with low radiation- dose CT for high- risk 
smokers and former smokers, many more individuals with lung nodules will be identified. In 
contrast with more advanced presentations of lung cancer that are almost uniformly fatal, 
cancerous nodules can be cured with surgery when promptly diagnosed and treated. However, 
fewer than 5% of small nodules prove to be cancerous, and a key unanswered question is how 
to distinguish the malignant ones from those that are benign. Small nodules (especially those 
measuring up to 10 mm ) are difficult to biopsy or resect, so the default option for evaluation is 
surveillance with serial CT scans to identify growth that is suggestive of cancer. However, the 
optimal frequency of surveillance has never been determined. Guidelines are based on low-
quality evidence and provide conflicting recommendations. Thus, the proposed research will 
compare more intensive vs. less intensive protocols for surveillance among individuals who are 
found to have a small pulmonary nodule on c hest CT. 
Objectives: Our long-term goal is to improve decision- making and outcomes for patients with 
pulmonary nodules. This pragmatic clinical trial has the following aims: 
1. Among individuals with small pulmonary nodules identified either incidentally or by 
[CONTACT_15249], compare more vs. less intensive CT surveillance for the number of cancerous 
nodules that progress beyond stage T1a, the most curable stage of lung cancer.  
2. Compare patient-reported outcomes of emotional distress, anxiety, general health status 
and satisfaction with the evaluation process.  
   
2 
 Sub-aim: Compare provider -reported outcomes of knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about 
guidelines and practices for lung nodule evaluation, and provider satisfaction with the 
evaluation process.  
3. Compare resource utilization and exposure to ionizing radiation.  
4. Compare adherence to the recommended protocol for CT surveillance, and adherence to use of low radiation -dose techniques. 
Methods: This study is a large, simple and pragmatic trial that compares two protocols for CT 
surveillance of potentially cancerous small lung nodules. The two protocols are both supported 
by [CONTACT_172914]. Random 
assignment to intervention groups will occur at the level of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172870], and 
clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_172871]. Eligible patients will be enrolled 
passively at one of 24 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122577] 14 health care systems, using automated methods for 
identification, notification, and registration into the study. We plan to enroll approximately 35,200  
unique patients over 28 months and follow them  for two years to ascertain outcomes. Data will 
be collected from electronic health records (EHRs), local and statewide cancer registries, and 
surveys of patient -reported and provider-reported outcomes. All data will be transferred securely 
to the Data Coordinating Center for analyses using hierarchical models to account for clustering 
effects and to adjust for residual imbalances between groups. Sensitivity analyses and analyses 
to identify heterogeneity of treatment effect will be performed. 
Patient Outcomes: Based on our extensive clinical experience, engagement with stakeholders, 
and qualitative research with patients to date, we have identified the following set of clinical and 
patient-centered outcomes of interest. Most of the outcomes are amenable to collection by 
[CONTACT_172915].

10. Procedure-related complications, based on diagnosis codes documented in the EHR;

Patient and Stakeholder  Engagement:  We have assembled a team of researchers, patients, 
clinicians and stakeholders from health systems, advocacy groups, purchasers, and 
professional societies to help design and execute the study, and interpret and disseminate the 
results. Stakeholders have contributed to the framing of the research questions and the 
identification and prioritization of study outcomes. The researchers on the study team have had 
longstanding personal and/or professional relationships with many of the patients and 
   
[ADDRESS_202373]: There is concern among clinicians, purchasers, and health systems that 
as lung cancer screening diffuses into practice, there will be an epi[INVESTIGATOR_172872]—testing that is inconvenient, costly and potentially harmful. By 
[CONTACT_172916], our 
pragmatic trial will have a large and immediate impact on clinical care. By [CONTACT_172917], professional societies, and advocacy groups, we will 
disseminate our findings widely, and facilitate implementation in diverse practice settings.  
Background 
A pulmonary nodule (“spot on the lung”) is a spherical abnormality that measures up to 30 mm 
in diameter ( Figure 1)1. Although 95% of pulmonary (lung) nodules are benign and harmless, a 
small number prove to be early lung cancer. The goal of this pragmatic clinical trial is to identify 
the optimum surveillance strategy that will maximize early diagnosis for  individuals with 
cancerous nodules, while minimizing unnecessary surveillance of patients without cancer that 
can result in emotional stress, exposure to harmful ionizing radiation, and the discovery of 
additional incidental findings that may lead to  
unnecessary treatment. The trial will be conducted 
within diverse health  care settings: the integrated 
delivery systems of the HMO Cancer Research Network, several large academic medical centers, 
and a Veterans Health Administration hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], for 
results that are broadly applicable to the U.S. health care community. Continuous quality 
improvement will be applied to ensure consistent 
Figure 1. Computed tomography depi[INVESTIGATOR_27039] a [ADDRESS_202374] use has increased by [CONTACT_3450] 10% per year.  3,[ADDRESS_202375] scans of 
adult members of Kaiser Permanente Southern [LOCATION_004] (KPSC) from 2006–  2013, we found 
that 28% had a lung nodule5. In recent studies of lung cancer screening, nodules were 
discovered on 15% to 50% of chest CT scans.  6-[ADDRESS_202376] influential trial of screening, the 
National Lung Screening  Trial (NLST), found that [ADDRESS_202377] (LDCT) reduced lung cancer mortality by 20%  among high-risk smokers and 
former smokers.[ADDRESS_202378] in this population.  6,14-16 Since approximately 7 
million Americans meet  the Task Force’s eligibility criteria for screening,  [ADDRESS_202379] benign causes such as scarring or infection, but 5% to 10 % are caused by 
[CONTACT_67380]. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death for both men and women 
worldwide. [ADDRESS_202380] always fatal,  but cancerous nodules confined to 
the lung can be cured with surgery when promptly diagnosed and treated. Tumor size is  a 
critical factor: 5-year overall survival is only 58% for people with tumors 3 -5 cm in size, but 77% 
for patients with stage T1a disease (tumor size <20 mm).  [ADDRESS_202381] of care for patients with nodules is substantial; in a study of  veterans, per-patient 
   
6 
 health care costs over 2 years exceeded $22,000 among individuals with benign nodules, and 
were greater than $50,[ADDRESS_202382] Physicians (ACCP).  21-23 However, both sets of guidelines were informed by [CONTACT_6398] -quality 
evidence. In the ACCP guidelines, 27 of 29 recommendations for lung nodule evaluation were considered “weak”  and based on low -quality evidence.
23 Evaluation of nodules detected by 
[CONTACT_172918] (NCCN) and the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data  System (Lung-RADS), developed 
by [CONTACT_38978] (ACR). Al though the risk of  cancer should be higher 
among populations that undergo screening, the Lung- RADS recommendations for surveillance 
are less intensive than the existing recommendations from the Fleischner Society and ACCP. 
Although no new evidence of direct relevance to the study from randomized trials or observational studies has been published, the Fleischner Society recommendations were 
recently revised and are less intensive than the existing recommendations.  Indirect evidence 
from trials of lung cancer screening support the view that the risk of cancer is low in solid 
pulmonary nodules measuring ≤5 mm and subcentimeter nodules measuring <[ADDRESS_202383] study to date, 
only 55% of lung nodule patients received follow -up concordant with ACCP guidelines,[ADDRESS_202384] scan entails the risk of a new incidental finding; most are  
harmless, but each one requires additional surveillance. Greater than needed surveillance results in added exposure to  ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen. At the population level, 
radiation exposure from CT scanning is estima ted to cause as many as 1.5– 2% of all incident 
cancers in the U.S.
[ADDRESS_202385] surveillance strategy 
would also be simple, to maximize adherence.

 Significance  
ACCP guidelines for lung nodule evaluation explicitly call for additional research to “compare 
the benefits and harms of  alternative management strategies among individuals stratified by 
[CONTACT_172919].”[ADDRESS_202386] also identified lung nodule evaluation as a 
research priority area. In addition, when deliberating coverage policy for lung cancer screening, the Medicare Evidence Development  and Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) expressed 
concerns about the lack of standardization in the evaluation of  screen-detected nodules.
[ADDRESS_202387] noted that for lung cancer screening and 
surveillance of incidental nodules to be effective in practice, we need to know how to accurately, 
safely and efficiently  distinguish malignant from benign nodules.  
How Do the Specific Aims Relate to the Significance of the Proposed Study? 
Frequent identification of incidental  nodules is already widespread in current clinical practice. 
Providers, payers, and health systems are concerned that the potential benefits of LDCT 
screening will be mitigated by [CONTACT_172920], potentially harmful and costly to patients. To address this concern, this large, pragmatic trial will compare more frequent vs. less frequent CT surveillance for patients with small pulmonary nodules ≤ 15 mm in diameter in diverse health care setti ngs. We will 
measure outcomes selected by [CONTACT_172921], including progression of cancer to a less curable stage, timeliness of treatment, emotional distress and anxiety during surveillance, patient and provider satisfaction with the evaluation process, health care resource 
utilization, and adherence. Thus, completing our study aims will generate novel and 
generalizable knowledge about the comparative effectiveness of two strategies for nodule 
evaluation. This knowledge will benefit patients and clinicians who need better evidence about the potential benefits and harms of competing strategies for surveillance.

 Potential for the Study to Improve Healthcare and Outcomes:  
Lung cancer remains the number one cause of cancer death for both men and women in the 
[LOCATION_002],[ADDRESS_202388] patients with lung cancer present with symptomatic, advanced 
disease, only 18% of lung cancer patients are still alive [ADDRESS_202389], 
lung cancer is often curable when it presents as an asymptomatic nodule, with 5- year survival 
rates of 55% to 80%.19 However, up to 59% of patients who undergo resection for suspected 
cancer ultimately prove to have a benign nodule.28-[ADDRESS_202390] 30% received less intensive care than recommended and 20% received more care than recommended, indicating substantial room for improvement.
24 
Lung cancer and lung nodules are understudied compared with other conditions that lead to comparable morbidity and mortality. This  pragmatic, cluster -randomized trial of comparative 
effectiveness will be integrated into routine clinical practice in diverse settings so that the results 
will be broadly generalizable.  
Patient-centeredness:  
This study is patient -centered because it fills an unmet need for information that is critically 
important for informed shared decision- making by [CONTACT_139551]. To further ensure 
patient centeredness, we engaged our patient and stakeholder team when developi[INVESTIGATOR_172873] -centered outcomes of greatest importance. Patients 
and stakeholders selected “cure of cancer” as the most important priority, and endorsed our 
   
[ADDRESS_202391] important imperative was to identify cancer early at all 
costs, others were concerned that more intensive surveillance would aggravat e distress and 
anxiety associated with having a potentially cancerous nodule and “not knowing” its status. Listening to these views prompted us to expand the study design to include the survey of 
patient-reported outcomes during the surveillance period (Ai m 2). Stakeholder partners 
representing clinicians, health systems, and payers had additional concerns about resource 
utilization, radiation exposure and adherence, providing the incentive for studying these 
outcomes in Aims 3 and 4.  
Study Aims 
Aim 1. Among individuals with small pulmonary nodules identified either incidentally or by 
[CONTACT_15249], compare more versus less intensive surveillance for the number of cancerous nodules that progress beyond AJCC 7
th edition stage T1a or AJCC 8th edition stage T1b .  
Approach: search EHRs and establish linkages with local and statewide cancer registries to ascertain the primary outcome and secondary outcomes of timeliness of lung cancer diagnosis  
and overall survival of patients in each study arm who prove to  have a cancerous nodule.  
Aim 2. Compare patient-reported outcomes of emotional distress, anxiety, general health status 
and satisfaction with the evaluation process. Compare provider satisfaction with the surveillance 
protocol and the evaluation process.  Approach: survey patients via Internet or mail, using 
validated measures of emotional distress ( IES-R), anxiety (STAI-6), and general health status. 
Patients will be surveyed at 1 -2 and 13-24 months following nodule identification, and upon 
completion of surveillance to assess outcomes over time.  Radiologists and ordering providers 
   
11 
 (pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons) will be surveyed at the start of patient enrollment and at 
during the follow-up period. In addition, primary care physicians may be surveyed at the start of 
patient enrollment and during the follow -up period. 
Aim 3. Compare resource utilization and effective radiation doses received.  Approach: search 
EHRs to measure all resource utilization during the evaluation period that could be related to 
lung nodule evaluation, including total number of CT scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, invasive biopsy procedures, thoracic surgical procedures, outpatient visits, 
emergency department visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Search information contained in radiology 
transcripts or radiology information systems to esti mate radiation exposure.  
Aim 4. Compare adherence to the recommended protocols for CT surveillance, and adherence 
to use of low radiation dose techniques. Approach: review samples of dictated radiology reports 
and search EHRs to measure adherence and ascertain if the assigned surveillance protocol 
was recommended by [CONTACT_172922], ordered by [CONTACT_13917], and ultimately completed by [CONTACT_102]. We will also record adherence with low -radiation dose imaging techniques.  
Patients and Settings 
 
Patients will be identified, enrolled and studied at 14 health care delivery organizations ( Table 
1). 
 
   
12 
  
The organizations were chosen for geographic,  socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic  diversity of 
patients; and for diversity  in the size and type of health care  delivery system: fee for service,  
capi[INVESTIGATOR_172874], integrated, and  academic. We plan to enroll approximately 35,[ADDRESS_202392] the diversity of patients seen  at all participating institutions. The  large number Table 1

 and types of facilities and highly diverse populations will provide results that are generalizable to 
the broader U.S. population.  
Inclusion Criteria:  The target population includes adults with small lung nodules, who typi[INVESTIGATOR_172875]. Thus, we will enroll all adult patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_202393] one newly identified nodule measuring ≤ [ADDRESS_202394]. We increased the original age threshold from 21 years to 
35 years, because lung nodules and (especially) lung cancer are extremely rare in individuals 
younger than age 35, and the new Flei schner Society guidelines are specifically designed for 
individuals who are [ADDRESS_202395] 
patients will be >[ADDRESS_202396] comorbidities. To accommodat e the 
implementation of lung cancer screening in many settings, we will include individuals with 
nodules detected either incidentally or by [CONTACT_172923] 6 participating sites: HealthPartners, 
Kaiser Permanente (Colorado, Northwest, Southern [LOCATION_004]), Medical University of South 
Carolina, and UC Davis . 
The ≤15 mm threshold for inclusion represents a change from the original study proposal, in which we initially adopted a size threshold of ≤10 mm. The change in the size threshold was 
suggested by [CONTACT_172924] (site PIs), the Stakeholder Advisory Group, and the Executive Committee. To provide justification for  this modification, we address issues related to clinical relevance, 
generalizability, feasibility and validity.  
   
[ADDRESS_202397] surveillance, but rather by [CONTACT_172925] a more 
intensive evaluation with positron emission tomography (PET), invasive biopsy or surgery. 
However, most patients with nodules of this size (and their providers) still opt for surveillance as 
the preferred approach, especially in cases in which the patient does not have strong risk 
factors for lung cancer or the risk of procedure- related complications is judged to be high. 
Similarly, many patients and providers are risk averse and prefer to avoid biopsy or surgery unless the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_172876], and surveillance can help to establish this by 
[CONTACT_172926]. In fact, in recent studies performed in VA and community 
settings, between 46% and 78% of patients with even larger nodules measuring up to [ADDRESS_202398] 70,000 
members of Kaiser Permanente Southern [LOCATION_004] (KPSC) with incidentally detected 
pulmonary nodules indicate that nodules ≤10 mm make up 53% of the total population of 
patients with pulmonary nodules; by [CONTACT_172927] ≤15 mm, we will include an additional 16% of the total nodule population. Even if as many as one third of the study patients with nodules measuring between [ADDRESS_202399] 
   
15 
 surveillance, and instead undergo an initial invasive biopsy or surgical procedure, this would still 
increase the size of the target population considerably and improve generalizability.  
By [CONTACT_172928], we will also improve feasibility, both by [CONTACT_172929] a 
wider net that helps us to meet enrollment targets more efficiently, and by [CONTACT_172930]. Based on K PSC data, we estimate that 
2% of patients with nodules measuring ≤[ADDRESS_202400] a cancerous nodule, whereas 3% of patients with nodules measuring ≤[ADDRESS_202401] a cancerous nodule (including almost 7% of 
patients with nodules measuring between 11 mm and 15 mm). Because the study is powered to 
demonstrate equivalence in stage distribution for patients with cancerous nodules, the increase 
in the expected frequency of cancer will enable us to meet our goals for sample size much more 
efficiently. Specifical ly, we anticipate that approximately 1,[ADDRESS_202402] a 
cancerous nodule, which is greater than our initial estimate of approximately 900 patients. Of 
note, the original required sample size to achieve statistical power of 90% will not change, and 
the study will have slightly greater power than originally anticipated to demonstrate equivalence 
between the two comparison arms.   
Finally, the proposed change will not introduce bias and therefore does not threaten validity, 
because both the more frequent and less frequent surveillance groups will include patients with 
nodules measuring ≤15 mm.  
Exclusion Criteria:  Recommendations for surveillance will not apply to patients with nodules 
outside of the target population, for whom the strategies that we are studying may not be 
appropriate: patients who are < 35 years old, patients with nodules measuring >15 mm in size, 
whose risk of lung cancer (15% to 75%) is  much higher than our target population, and patients 
with an active pulmonary or extrapulmonary cancer within the past 5 years, who are typi[INVESTIGATOR_172877]. In addition, pregnant 
   
16 
 women will be excluded because exposure to ionizing radiation should be minimized in 
pregnancy and it would not be ethically appropriate to assign a pregnant woman to a more frequent surveillance protocol. In addition, we will exclude non- members (at participating 
integrated health care systems) , patients who previously requested not to be contact[CONTACT_172931] , and patients who are unreachable by [CONTACT_172932] . 
We will rely on study radiologists to exercise their judgment about whether to exclude patients with associated pulmonary abnormalities such as pleural fluid (effusions), collapsed lung 
(atelectasis) or hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement, each of which increases the risk of 
an underlying lung cancer, patients with multiple pulmonary nodules, who sometimes require an 
evaluation approach different than that for lung cancer, and patients with benign appearing 
nodules (e.g. nodules that have a benign pattern of calcification or a characteristic benign 
appearance, such as an intrapulmonary lymph node or an arterio- venous malformation).   In 
these cases, interpreting radiologists at all sites will make a determination of eligibility based on 
their clinical judgment . 
Anticipated Characteristics of the Study Population:  In a preliminary study at one of our 
sites (KPSC), we reviewed chest CT results for approximately 240,000 health plan members who underwent imaging between 2006 and December 2012, and identified 68,998  patients with 
a pulmonary nodule ≤[ADDRESS_202403]. 
The mean age was 63.6±14. 3 years; 55% were women; 48% w ere never smokers, 40% were 
former smokers and 11% were current smokers. The population was racially and ethnically 
diverse: 18% were Hispanic, 12% were non- Hispanic black, and 9% were Asian/Pacific 
Islander. Co-morbidities were frequent, including hypertension (58%), diabetes (22%), 
obstructive lung disease (14%), asthma (13%), coronary disease and/or heart failure (25%), and 
anxiety or depression (25%). Most (70%) nodules measured ≤ 15 mm. After excluding patients 
   
17 
 with a prior history of cancer, 3% of  patients with small nodules  of this size were subsequently 
diagnosed with lung cancer within the next [ADDRESS_202404] study procedures into existing clinical workflow, 
and perform few assessments or procedures exclusively for research purposes, relying heavily on EHRs and/or registries for recruitment of participants and data collection. As a comparative effectiveness trial, the goal is to inform health care decision- making by [CONTACT_172933], for whom, and under what circumstances.  
We used the PRECIS criteria to characterize the design of our trial along the pragmatic -
explanatory continuum.
[ADDRESS_202405] pragmatic:  
• Eligibility criteria: participants will be enrolled from multiple sources; no exclusions based on likelihood of response to the intervention; all patients with condition of interest will be 
   
18 
 enrolled (5); 
• Flexibility of the experimental and control intervention(s): comparators represent 
recommendations for surveillance, but practitioners can deviate from recommendations based on clinical judgment; standardized methods encouraged for documentation and 
notification of results and recommendations, but providers may tailor to fit local conditions 
(4); 
• Practitioner expertise: both interventions delivered by [CONTACT_172934], including primary care providers, 
pulmonologists, oncologists, radiologists and surgeons (5);  
• Follow-up intensity: no study visits outside of usual clinical care; no special procedures or 
assessments other than collection of patient -reported outcomes via surveys (4);  
• Choice of the primary outcome: progression of cancer beyond stage T1a assessed by 
[CONTACT_172935] (for those with cancer); surrogate 
outcome (stage) is strongly linked to patient -important outcome (survival); no special 
adjudication of outcomes or training of outcome assessors (4);  
• Participant adherence with the prescribed intervention: adherence measured purely for descriptive purposes at the conclusion of the trial; measurement not used to influence subsequent adherence (4);  
• Practitioner adherence to study protocol: radiologists’ adherence with protocols for recommended surveillance measured and fed back only early in the trial; strategies for 
improvement applied when adherence is poor (3);  
• Analysis of the primary outcome: analysis by [CONTACT_118067]; no post hoc exclusions; 
   
19 
 subgroup analyses specified in advance and selected based on information needed for 
clinical decision-making, not merely to find large effects (5).  
We chose cluster -randomization because the interventions will be applied at the level of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172878], and having different patients at the same facility receive different recommendations for surveillance would not be practical, efficient or effective. The study will be unblinded because both patients and providers need to be aware of the protocol to which they are assigned. We engaged clinical and non- clinical stakeholders in an intensive and 
iterative process of feedback and revision to design the  initial surveillance protocols to be 
compared and to ensure equipoise between the two trial arms.  In addition, the modified 
protocols were vetted extensively and approved unanimously by [CONTACT_56049] 15- member Steering 
Committee (composed of principal investigators from all participating sites), and by [CONTACT_172936] (composed of 5 patients, along with multiple representatives from 
advocacy groups, medical professional societies, and other health care stakeholders).  
Subsequently, the modification request was vetted and approved by [CONTACT_56049] [ADDRESS_202406].  
Our choice of outcomes was also guided by [CONTACT_172937], patient and non-patient stakeholders; our knowledge of the literature on clinical outcomes in 
lung nodule evaluation;
39,40 and recent studies performed by [CONTACT_172938]41 and lung nodule evaluation in 
particular.42-44 Aim 1 addresses the goal of an optimum surveillance strategy to diagnose cancer 
as early as possible to maximize the chances for cure; Aim 2 addresses the anxiety and distress that is experienced by [CONTACT_23270]  a nodule of uncertain cause, as well as the preferences and 
satisfaction of providers ; Aim [ADDRESS_202407] will monitor the study for unanticipated adverse events and safety, and 
perform interim analyses after 25% and 50% enrollment. The study will be registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov. This proposal was developed in close collaboration with all stakeholders, and additional feedback will be sought (and the protocol will be modified as needed) during kick -off 
activities, including conference calls, webinars and an in- person meeting. All analyses will be 
planned in advanced and specified in the protocol, including sensitivity analyses and analyses 
to examine heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE).   
Cluster Randomization:  Randomization to one of the guideline- based protocols will be 
performed at the level of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172879]. All patients with small pulmonary 
nodules within a given hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172880].  
Random assignment to one of the two intervention groups at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172881]
45,46 and re-randomization47 to ensure balance among several 
potential confounders: the volume of CT imaging performed , the setting type (integrated 
healthcare system vs. academic), KPSC vs. other institutions; racial and ethnic distribution ; 
percentage of patients who are current, former, vs. never smokers;  inclusion of patients with 
screening-detected nodules; frequency in using PET for patients with nodules 11- 15mm; timing 
of notification letters to participants; and distribution of insurance type . A biostatistician at the 
Data Coordinating Center will generate the allocation scheme using statistical software 
developed in R by [CONTACT_172939]45,46.  All participating organizations have agreed 
to accept random assignment to one of the two groups. While many of the participating 
   
[ADDRESS_202408] medical service areas (MSA); clinical and 
administrative leaders at this site have agreed to randomization at the level of the MSA. Site PIs, clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], and their multi disciplinary collaborators (including radiologists, primary 
care physicians, pulmonologists, oncologists and surgeons) will work with key administrative leaders and other clinicians to implement the assigned imaging protocols during the study period. Although randomization is at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172882], the unit of analysis will be the individual 
patient, and we will compare patients randomized to more vs. less frequent surveillance, after 
adjusting for potential clustering within sites.  
Data Collection and Patient Enrollment: Participants will be enrolled passively and added to 
the study cohort by [CONTACT_172940] a pulmonary nodule. This will facilitate enrollment of all eligible patients. All adult patients undergoing chest CT who are 
identified as having a nodule ≤ [ADDRESS_202409]’s report. This 
language will trigger a series of automated steps , to be executed in a site -specific manner 
according to local practices and workflow : a) inserting standardized text with the recommended 
protocol for surveillance in the dictated report; b) sending an IRB -approved notification letter to 
the patient; c) sending a notification to the provider who ordered the CT scan; and d) sending patient data to a local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based study repository. Participants will not be compensated for 
use of their data or for completing survey questions in this study , although we will hold a raffle to 
encourage participation.  
   
22 
 Each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172883] (often 
called “canned reports”) to insert into the dictated radiology transcripts. Templates will summarize findings (size and imaging characteristics of the nodule), and recommendations for 
surveillance based on the assigned protocol. Templates will not need to be used exactly as 
written and can be tailored by [CONTACT_172941].  
Currently, across settings, the text of radiology reports is stored within the radiology information 
system (RIS) and then forwarded to the EHR. Data transferred from the RIS to the EHR pass 
through an interface software engine that will be tailored to recognize the inclusion of the 
templates (i.e. particular text strings) or hash tags to identify eligible patients. This information 
will be used as an indicator to activate downstream systems that will notify both patient and provider. The IRB -approved letter to the patient will include provide a high level overview about 
the trial, let them know they have been tentatively enrolled in the trial, and offer an opportunity 
to opt-out of the trial (for data collec tion purposes). The letter will also provide contact 
[CONTACT_172942] [CONTACT_38450]. The letter 
(or electronic notification) to the provider (and/or copy of the dictated report) will be sent to the 
referring physician, explaining the finding, provi ding the recommendations for follow -up, and 
reminding them about the trial. Participating sites will also provide educational materials about 
the study to their treating physicians using various communication media (email, Webex, and/or 
face-to-face meetings) as appropriate for their site.  
Subsequently, identifying information (e.g. patient name, medical record number, accession 
number) from the report and RIS will be sent to a secure, local data repository. Identifying information will be used to ascertain outcomes through linkage with internal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172884] , and to enable centralized distribution and processing of patient 
surveys. In addition, patient -level data will be exported to the central study repository and used 
to assess progress with enrollment and for study quality improvement purposes. Finally, a de -
   
[ADDRESS_202410] radiology reports will be sent to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based study 
repository to ensure that all eligible patients (those with nodules) are enrolled. These data will 
be used for quality improvement activities to ensure enrollment of all eligible patients.   
The study design calls for patient and providers to receive notification regarding the enrollment into the trial, although the method of communication will vary across sites. Study coordinators will review charts of a sample of patients to assess if notifi cation is occurring, and if it is not 
above 95%, they will review the processes (electronic, manual) to improve these figures.  
Each collaborating site has the capacity to introduce these procedures and several have already implemented similar systems. Our plan is to adapt existing systems for this pragmatic clinical 
trial. As an example, at UCSF clinicians are alerted to criticall y important radiology findings 
when the interpreting radiologist uses the words “critical alert” in the dictation. This prompts an 
interface engine to notify the referring clinician about a critical imaging finding through phone 
calls, emails, and/or elect ronic messages in the report. Similarly, a large and successful clinical -
research collaboration across all University of [LOCATION_004] campuses, ATHENA, has successfully 
adopted a similar strategy of using HL7 text to identify patients who should be enrolled in 
various clinical programs around breast cancer screening and risk assessment. Likewise, at KPSC a significant findings tool was developed within the PACS reporting environment and is 
currently being used by [CONTACT_172943] i dentify patients with lung 
nodules as part of an operational “safety net” to prevent lung nodule patients from being lost to 
follow-up. While different hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172885], all allow 
inclusion of templates, and most systems allow the automatic execution of instructions or have 
developed unique strategies for doing this. We will work with participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172886].

 Interventions to be compared (Tables 2 and 3): Based on multiple rounds of consultation with 
clinicians and stakeholders, including four group webinars and much discussion within and 
between sites, we selected and refined two surveillance protocols to compare.  
The original protocol for more intensive imaging was based on published guidelines from the Fleischner Society (2005, 2013) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), while most of the recommendations for less intensive imaging were derived from  the American 
College of Radiology’s Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung- RADS). However, 
Fleischner Society and NCCN recommendations were recently revised, providing an ideal 
opportunity to compare the (more intensive) existing recommendations with the (less intensive) 
newly revised recommendations, a comparison that is most relevant to current clinical practice.  
The surveillance protocols are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Additional details are provided in 
Appendix Tables C1-C3.

The comparators selected will result in approximately 30% less imaging in the less intensive 
Group B. By [CONTACT_172944], we will preserve the trial’s equipoise, integrity and relevance now that the revised 
Fleischner Society recommendations have been released48.  
All CT scans performed for pulmonary nodule surveillance should be done using low radiation-dose technique, however, this vitally important aspect of imaging quality and safety is often overlooked during CT surveillance of lung nodules. Guidance on low radiation- dose techniques 
will be provided to each site and the study protocol will strongly recommend the use of these or 
equivalent low radiation- dose protocols for all follow up CT scans. During the first [ADDRESS_202413] radiation dose 
metrics (CT Volumetric Dose Index [CTDI vol] and Dose Length Product [DLP]) on a large sample of chest CTs performed at their site (10 -50% depending on population; 100% for 
[LOCATION_004] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172887]) to determine if the 
   
26 
 CTs were performed using appropriate techniques. Staff will be trained in radiation dose 
extraction techniques. Radiation dose metrics will be calculated monthly by [CONTACT_3725], provided to the Data Coordinating Center, and reviewed during regular meetings. Initi atives to ensure  
compliance with low -dose examinations will include site visits and radiology -specific lectures.

 Outcomes: The study will use readily available information from EHRs and local and statewide 
tumor registries to efficiently ascertain outcomes of importance to patients. We will supplement 
these clinical outcomes with surveys of patient -reported outcomes. The full panel of outcomes 
was selected based on our collective clinical expertise, and refined extensively based on 
iterative rounds of feedback from both clinical and non- clinical stakeholders ( Table 4). 
Aim 1 Outcomes, Lung Cancer Stage at Diagnosis: The primary study outcome  is tumor 
progression beyond AJCC 7th edition stage T1a or, equivalently, AJCC 8th edition stage T1b 
(tumor size ≤20 mm). This size threshold was identified as the best cut point for discriminating 
prognosis by [CONTACT_172947].[ADDRESS_202416], we will create linkages to 
the NCI Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and End Results (SEER) and state tumor registries. In 
addition, we will use data  on enrolled patients from each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local tumor registry. The 
former approach identifies patients who subsequently receive a lung cancer diagnosis at 
another institution, but will be complete only for patients enrolled during the first [ADDRESS_202417] 6 months of enrollment, and will be essentially complete for patients 
who receive care and retain their membership in one of the integrated  delivery systems.  
In response to anticipated delays in case abstraction and processing by [CONTACT_172948], we will also obtain information about lung cancers diagnosed during months 
not covered by [CONTACT_172949] -10 codes, verified via chart review, and 
obtain information about tumor size and stage based on detailed chart review. We anticipate that the majority of lung cancer outcomes will be captured by [CONTACT_172950]- level or local-level 
cancer registries, both of which rely on standardized case abstraction performed by [CONTACT_23872] 
   
28 
 registrars at local sites, so concordance between these sources is expected to be very high. 
Cases diagnosed during months not covered by [CONTACT_172951] (NAACCR) standards, using NACCR methods for coding tumor size and 
stage. To ensure consistency, a 10% sample of abstracted cases will be reviewed for accuracy 
and completeness by a [ADDRESS_202418] extensive experience with the NCI -funded Risk of Pediatric and Adolescent Cancer 
Associated with Medical Imaging (RIC) study and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium using data from state and local cancer registries and electr onic health records and have found 
high concordance between sources. A recent analysis by [CONTACT_6283]. Miglioretti and Smith -Bindman 
showed that ICD-10 codes had a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI 98% to 100%) for identifying cases 
of pediatric leukemia relative to the reference standard of local tumor registry and/or medical 
record review (Weinmann S, et al. Positive predictive value and sensitivity of ICD -9-CM codes 
for identifying pediatric leukemia. Pediatric Blood & Cancer 2021, e29283).  
While the level of effort to request, receive and link data from the three sources is somewhat greater than initially anticipated, we have always planned to link cancer outcomes data from the state registries with baseline and follow -up data from electroni c health records. We believe that 
the [ADDRESS_202419] treatment (surgery, 
radiotherapy or chemotherapy). In addition to stage at diagnosis and time s to diagnosis and 
treatment, we will measure overall survival from the date of the index CT scan, recognizing that 
we will have limited follow- up time for lung cancer deaths to accrue.  
Aim 2, Patient - and Provider -Reported Outcomes (PC -3): In Aim 2, we will collect  patient-
reported outcomes of relevance to lung nodule evaluation. In particular, we will examine 
emotional distress and anxiety related to having a potentially cancerous nodule of uncertain 
cause. To measure distress and anxiety, we will use two validated, self- administered 
instruments that have been applied in prior studies of lung cancer screening, the IES -R and the 
STAI-6. The IES-R measures emotional distress resulting from an identified stressor (e.g. 
identification of a lung nodule) and includes the 3 domains of intrusive thoughts, avoidance and 
hyper-arousal.50;[ADDRESS_202420] results.52,53 The STAI-6 is a brief, 6-item scale that was derived from the longer State -Trait 
Anxiety Inventory.54,55 The STAI-6 has demonstrated feasibility and responsiveness to change in 
an uncontrolled trial of lung cancer screening.56 Both instruments are available in English and 
Spanish-language versions ( Table 5).  In addition to these instruments, we will administer a 
one-item measure of general health status and novel items about  overall satisfaction with the 
surveillance strategy and evaluation process.

[ADDRESS_202421]. Kaplan at UCSF, 
based on her ongoing qualitative pi[INVESTIGATOR_172889].57,58 The survey will primarily focus on radiologists and ordering providers 
(pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons) at each study site, because they are most directly 
involved with lung nodule evaluation, although we will explore the possibility of surveying 
primary care providers . Surveys will be distributed to radiologists and ordering providers at the 
start of the trial and near the end of the study enrollment period (approximately mid- way through 
the trial). 
Aim 3 Outcomes, Nodule- Related Resource Utilization and Radiation Exposure: We will 
compare health care resource utilization between groups by [CONTACT_172952] -9 procedure codes that appear during the surveillance period 
(from date of the index CT scan to the date of first cancer treatment or [ADDRESS_202422]). Most study sites use the Epic EHR, which allows for efficient searching of utilization tables; other EHR systems have similar capabilities. We will capture all relevant imaging tests (chest CT, PET,), invasive biopsy procedures (bronchoscopy, transthoracic

[ADDRESS_202424] additional information about imaging protocols from radiologists at the sites outside of [LOCATION_004] who participate in the radiology Collaborative that we will set up as part of our quality assurance/quality improvement infrastructure.  
We will collect data for three CT radiation dose metrics: the volume computed tomography dose 
index (CTDIvol), the dose- length product (DLP), and the effective dose. CTDIvol represents the 
average per-slice radiation dose, measured in milli -Gray (mGy), and reflects whether 
conventional or low dose settings are used for CT examinations. DLP is defined as the product 
of the CTDIvol and the scan length, with units of mGy -cm, and reflects the total radiation output 
during the entire CT scan. With longer imaging times, the DLP will increase, or if a particular 
area is imaged multiple times, such as happens in multiphase studies, the dose length product 
from each scan is added together. CT scans done for the surveillance of nodules should use a 
shorter rather than a longer scan length. Both CTDIvol and DLP are reported directly on the CT 
examination (typi[INVESTIGATOR_172891]) and can thus 
be extracted for any subjects through review of the images. Further, in [LOCATION_004], by  [CONTACT_76522] 
   
[ADDRESS_202425], the technique 
for extracting these data will be locally determined. Effective dose, measured in milli -Sieverts 
(mSv), combines information about the radiation imparted to the patient, the scan location 
reflecting the organs irradiated, and the deleterious effect, primarily of developi[INVESTIGATOR_172892]. Effective dose increases with the dose length product and is a function of the radio -
sensitivity of the tissues irradiated.  Effective dose will be calculated from the DLP for each 
examination using existing established conversion formulas, and summed over the study period 
for each enrollee.  
Aim 4 Outcomes, Patient and Provider Adherence: We will measure adherence to the 
assigned surveillance protocol at the level of the interpreting radiologist, the ordering provider, 
and the individual patient. First, we will measure adherence with each recommended surveillance test: was the test recommended by [CONTACT_172922], ordered by [CONTACT_13917], and 
completed by [CONTACT_102]? Adherence at the patient and provider levels can be extracted from 
structured data in the EHR. To measure adherence at the level of the interpreting radiologist, we will review a sample of radiology transcripts to determine whether the recommendation for surveillance were present and per protocol. These analyses will provide granular information about adherence on a test -by-test basis and pi[INVESTIGATOR_172893]- adherence. In addition, we 
will measure overall adherence, defined as completion of all recommended tests for surveillance at the individual patient level.  
Data Management 
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at UC Davis will be the central location for data 
management. The DCC will collect data captured locally at each participating site. This collected 
   
[ADDRESS_202426] key access may enter 
the server room. The servers used by [CONTACT_172955][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Electronic Medical Record data and receive the same level of service and security. 
Real time data protection offers the ability to synchronize data to another physically separate server located in another geographical location. This service provides a layer of protection 
should the primary server fail due to physical hazard or malfunction, or software or hardware 
failure. The DCC fail- safe servers are located in Davis, CA in the UC Davis campus data center. 
Off-site tape storage provides for one set of full data backup tapes to be stored off site with Iron 
Mountain.  
Data will be collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap was 
developed at Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a consortium of institutional partners. 
REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic coll ection and 
management of research and clinical trial data. UC Davis hosts an instance of REDCap on 
servers secured in compliance with UC Davis Health System requirements and protocols.  
REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data dictionary defined in an 
iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_172956]. This iterative developm ent and testing 
process results in a well -planned, well documented data collection strategy for individual 
studies. The REDCap system provides secure, web- based applications that are flexible enough 
to be used for a variety of types of research, provide an intuitive interface for users to enter data 
   
[ADDRESS_202427] real time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of 
entry. These systems offer easy data manipulation with audit trails for reporting, monitoring and querying patient records, and an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages 
(SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S- Plus). REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA -Security 
guidelines. REDCap has been disseminated for use locally at other institutions and currently 
supports 240+ academic/non- profit consortium partners on six continents and over 26,000 
research end-users (www.project-redcap.org
).  
The DCC will track and monitor data collection through REDCap and each participating institution will have access through the DCC to a REDCap project in order to maintain a secure 
REDCap database of enrolled patients for their institution. Patient identifi ers (name, medical 
record number, social security number, address, contact [CONTACT_3031]) linked to a unique study ID 
number will be kept in a file separate from other study data. Demographic information (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and selected clinical variables from the RIS (date and indication of imaging, acquisition protocol) will be linked with information from the EHR to collect relevant clinical data 
such as smoking history, information about health care utilization (physician visits of different 
types, imaging), and diagnosis of cancer from medical records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172894]. The database format will be created centrally by [CONTACT_172957] a detailed data dictionary and a manual of study procedures to ensure consistent standards and definitions across sites. While the variables will be defined using a 
single data dictionary, the strategies for populating the database will be developed individually 
at each site, depending on available information systems and systems for extracting data to populate the database. Many of the sites use the Epic EHR, so a standard strategy will be developed for these sites. Other sites have homegrown informatics systems or research systems that have been developed for other projects that we can use. Institutional databases 
   
[ADDRESS_202428]. Miglioretti. The preferred approach is to (securely) send data with identifiers, to enable linkages with cancer regis tries from states with a participating site, and 
to facilitate survey distribution and processing. Alternative plans to share limited data sets or de-
identified data will be negot iated with individual sites as necessary. The DCC  will oversee the 
linkages of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_172895], including size, stage and histology of all diagnosed cancers. 
Linkage procedures vary by [CONTACT_172958], but typi[INVESTIGATOR_172896] h site will send their patient identifier file 
linked to the study ID number to the DCC, where matching to the cancer registry file will be 
performed by [CONTACT_15791]’s data manager. Once matching has been complet ed, personal 
identifiers will be deleted to create a cancer file with the requested lung cancer outcomes data, 
linked to the study ID. The registries will send this dataset to the coordinating center to link with 
the study database via study ID for analysi s. 
We will implement systems to encourage adherence with standards for enrollment, follow up, 
and performance of CT scans obtained for nodule surveillance. These systems and quality 
initiatives will be provided equally to all sites. As part of the quality ini tiatives, the study PIs may 
visit each site to meet with study personnel and deliver Grand Rounds presentations within radiology, primary care and pulmonary medicine, focused on raising awareness of the trial and study requirements. We anticipate that the intensity of quality assurance efforts will be highest 
during the first 3-[ADDRESS_202429] surveillance for the 
progression of cancer beyond AJCC 7th edition stage T1a disease (or T1b in the AJCC 8th 
edition) (Aim 1), nodule- related emotional distress (Aim 2), health care resource utilization and 
exposure to diagnostic radiation (Aim 3), and overall adherence with the recommended surveillance protocol (Aim 4).  
The secondary objectives  i
 nclude comparing more vs. less intensive CT surveillance for the 
timeliness of lung cancer diagnosis and overall survival of patients in each study arm who prove to have a cancerous nodule (Aim 1), patient general health status and satisfaction with the 
evaluation process  and the provider satisfaction with the surveillance protocol and the 
evaluation process (Aim  2), and adherence to use of low radiation- dose techniques (Aim  4). In 
general, we hypothesize that more intensive follow -up will result in more CT imaging (by 
[CONTACT_8345]), greater radiation exposure, more downstream testing, greater anxiety and emotional distress, slightly shorter times to cancer diagnosis, and worse adherence to follow -up, and no 
effect on cancer stage distribution or overall survival.

Hypotheses: 
We specify the following hypotheses by [CONTACT_172961]: 
H1a: Among participants with nodules that prove to be cancerous, less intensive surveillance 
will be non-inferior to more intensive surveillance for: (a) the frequency of cancer progression 
beyond AJCC 7th edition stage T1a disease (or T1b for AJCC 8th edition) and (b) the frequency 
of cancer progression beyond AJCC 7th edition TNM stage T1aN0M0 (or T1bN0M0 for AJCC 8th 
edition). In addition, among participants with lung nodules , less intensive surveillance will be 
non-inferior to more intensive surveillance for: (a) the frequency of cancer progression beyond 
AJCC 7th edition stage T1a disease (or T1b for AJCC 8th edition); and (b) the frequency of 
cancer progression beyond AJCC 7th edition TNM stage T1aN0M0 (or T1bN0M0 for AJCC 8th 
edition).. Furthermore, in exploratory analyses for HTE, we hypothesize that individuals who are 
most likely to benefit from more intensive surveillance will include older people, people with 
larger nodules (>8 mm), patients with solid or part -solid nodules (compared with non -solid 
   
40 
 nodules), and individuals with nodules detected by [CONTACT_15249] (compared with individuals who 
have nodules that are incidentally detected).  
H1b: Among participants with nodules that prove to be cancerous, more intensive surveillance 
will result in more timely diagnosis than less intensive surveillance.  
H1c: Among participants with nodules that prove to be cancerous, less intensive surveillance 
will be non-inferior to more intensive surveillance for  overall survival. Among participants with 
lung nodules, less intensive surveillance will be non- inferior to more intensive surveillance for 
overall survival.  
H2a: Among all participants with a lung nodule ≤ 15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be 
associated with greater levels of emotional distress and state anxiety at 13 -24 months, but 
levels of distress and anxiety similar to less intensive surveillance at 1 -2 months and ≥25 
months. 
H2b: Among all participants with a lung nodule ≤ 15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be 
associated with scores similar to less intensive surveillance for general health status at 1 -2 
months, 13-24 months and ≥25 months. 
H2c: Among participating radiologists and pulmonologists, satisfaction with the surveillance 
protocol will be greater among those who practice at institutions assigned to the less intensive 
protocol. 
H3a: Among all participants with a lung nodule ≤ [ADDRESS_202433] 
scanning, PET scanning and invasive biopsy.  
   
41 
 H3b: Among all participants with a lung nodule ≤ 15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be 
associated with a greater number of serious complications related to invasive procedures , 
including pneumothorax, pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy, bleeding,  acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], acute renal failure and acute myocardial infarction.  
H3c: Among all participants with a lung nodule ≤ 15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be 
associated with greater total exposure to diagnostic radiation than less intensive surveillance.  
H4: Among all participants with a lung nodule ≤ [ADDRESS_202434] cases, the unit of analysis will be the individual patient. All primary analyses will be by [CONTACT_118067], although we will also perform sensitivity analyses by [CONTACT_172962]. The intention to treat population will include all patients with qualifying 
nodules, even ones who do not undergo surveillance as the initial step in their evaluation (i.e., 
patients that proceed directly to tissue diagnosis) . Sensitivity analyses will evaluate outcomes 
by [CONTACT_172963].  
Descriptive statistics will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, 
median, range) and categorical variables (frequency) at baseline and follow -ups when 
appropriate. Bivariate analyses will include comparisons of means or med ians (as appropriate) 
for continuously measured variables, cross tabulations of categorical variables, and Kaplan-
Meier plots for time to event outcomes. Count outcomes, such as the number of procedure -
related complications, will be treated as Poisson random variables. Analysis of time to 
   
42 
 diagnosis, treatment, and survival will use Cox regression, after checking the proportionality 
assumption by [CONTACT_172964]- minus-log plots. 
H1a - Primary endpoint  –lung cancer stage >T1a at diagnosis : 
To examine whether among participants with cancerous nodules, less intensive surveillance will 
be non-inferior to more intensive surveillance for the frequency of cancer progression beyond 
AJCC 7th edition stage T1a (or T1b for 8th edition) disease, we will use hierarchical logistic 
regression that includes random site effects to account for clustering of patients within sites and to capture institutional characteristics that are not explicitly modeled. Hierarchical logistic regression models will be fitted with and without adjusting for potential confounders including 
age, gender, ethnicity/race, smoking, body mass index (BMI), baseline nodule size, and any 
facility-level factors balanced during the randomization.  
We will conduct a main analysis and several sensitivity analyses .  
1. The main intent to treat analysis will include all enrolled participants in both study arms  
2. A modified intent to treat sensitivity analysis will include:  
a. For integrated healthcare systems, all active members  
b. For other systems, patients who have at least one follow- up visit 
3. On treatment sensitivity analyses will include those who met the  definition of adherence 
to first recommended test and to overall surveillance protocol  
4. We will conduct another sensitivity  analysis using all nodules, instead of cancerous 
nodules, as the denominator to evaluate rates instead of proportions, given some 
concern about the potential for overdiagnosis in the more intensive arm. However, we are concerned about evaluating rates among all nodules due to the potential for differential enrollment of very small, likely insignificant nodules across sites. Inclusion of 
these nodules in overall rates will inflate the denominator without an increase in 
   
[ADDRESS_202435] the robustness of findings to the source of data. The primary analysis will include data from all three sources (local and state tumor registries and electronic health records). The first sensitivity analysis will be limited to lung cancer outcomes from both state and local tumor registries, truncating follow-up time as necessary to ensure non -differential follow-up across sites (likely at a 
minimum of 17-18 months). Another sensitivity analysis will be limited to lung cancer 
outcomes from only state registries, truncating follow -up as per above. 
6. A separate analysis will examine patients who adhere to the recommendations for 
evaluation compared to those who do not, within each of the two study arms and for both arms combined, for the primary outcome of tumor (T) stage >AJCC 7
th edition stage T1A  
(or AJCC 8th edition stage T1b).  
H1a - Secondary endpoint : 
TNM stage: We will conduct a secondary analysis to compare the presence of AJCC- 7 TNM 
stage >T1aN0M0 or AJCC -8 TNM stage >T1bN0M0 between study arms. This is a secondary 
analysis because it is not possible to ascertain TNM stage at the time of nodule identification, so we will not be able to compare rates of progression for this outcome. Nevertheless, we will be 
able to make an unbiased comparison of the presence of TNM stage >T1aN0M0 at the time of  
diagnosis. Because it is possible that a small percentage of enrolled patients will have minimal 
or occult N1-3 and/or M1 disease at the time of enrollment, the baseline risk using this outcome 
definition will be greater than what we assumed for the primary outcome of tumor (T) stage 
>T1a, and therefore we will have less power to show non- inferiority in this sensitivity analysis.  
H1b - S
econdary endpoint s: 
   
44 
 Timeliness of diagnosis : To investigate whether among participants with cancerous nodules, 
less intensive surveillance will be non- inferior to more intensive surveillance for timeliness of 
diagnosis, we will restrict our analysis to participants with cancerous nodules and use Cox 
regression models where time from initial nodule identification to diagnosis is the outcome variable.  
Timeliness of treatment :
  To investigate whether among participants with cancerous nodules, 
less intensive surveillance will be non- inferior to more intensive surveillance for timeliness of 
treatment, we will restrict our analysis to participants with cancerous nodules and use Cox 
regression models where time from initial nodule identification to treatment is the outcome variable. Patients who die or do not receive treatment will be censored at end of follow -up. We 
will consider using competing risk models, as necessary.  
H1c: Secondary endpoint  
Survival: To investigate whether among participants with cancerous nodules, less intensive 
surveillance will be non- inferior to more intensive surveillance for overall survival, we will restrict 
our analysis to participants with cancerous nodules and use Cox regression models where time from initial nodule identification to death as the outcome variable. Patients will be censored at 
end of follow-up.  
For all time-to-event analyses, clustering by [CONTACT_172965] .[ADDRESS_202436] of age (using the median and/or quartile values as cut points), nodule 
size (>8 mm), nodule attenuation (solid or part -solid nodules compared with non- solid nodules), 
and mode of detection (detected by [CONTACT_172966]) .  
   
[ADDRESS_202437] 
interaction terms, these analyses will be exploratory. For H1b, to study whether among participants with cancerous nodules, more intensive surveillance will result in more timely diagnosis and treatment than less intensive surveillance, we will adopt similar strategy used for 
comparing overall survival described above.  
H2a: 
Patient surveys : To examine whether among all participants with a lung nodule ≤15 mm, more 
intensive surveillance will be associated with greater levels of emotional distress and state 
anxiety at 13-24 months, but levels of distress and anxiety similar to less intensive surveillance 
at 1-2 months and ≥25 months, comparisons of the levels of emotional distress and state 
anxiety (measured according to the scoring systems detailed in Table 4) will be assessed at 1 -2, 
13-24, and ≥[ADDRESS_202438], to assess whether accounting for 
measurement error in the survey items changes our conclusions. Finally, we will use Latent Class Regression ( LCR) to identify subgroups of the study population whose change in levels of 
emotional distress and state anxiety may differ, since LCR allows for modeling of time trends 
along with adjustment demographic and clinical characteristics within an arbitrary number of 
latent classes.
62 For example, there could be the following three classes: 1) patients whose 
   
46 
 levels are elevated at 1-2 months after being notified of a nodule, but then drop off and stay low 
throughout follow-up; 2) patients whose levels are elevated at 1- 2 months and stay high 
throughout follow-up; 3) and patients whose levels are normal at 1 -2 months following 
surveillance, and then  increase during follow -up. The differences in changes of levels of 
distress and anxiety between the latent classes over time would then be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_172897], as described above.  
For H2b, to investigate whether among all participants with a lung nodule ≤15 mm, more 
intensive surveillance will be associated with scores similar to less intensive surveillance for 
general health status at 1- 2 months, 13-24 months, and ≥[ADDRESS_202439] heterogeneity will be used to rule out sources of clustering 
that are not warranted. The mixed effects models will be adjusted for potential confounders 
including age, gender, ethnicity/race, smoking, BMI, nodule size, and any facility -level factors 
balanced during the randomization. Interaction between the treatment assignment and time will 
also be considered in the models and subgroup analysis will be conducted at separate time 
points if the interaction term is significant. For H2c , to examine whether among participating 
radiologists and pulmonologists, satisfaction with the surveillance protocol will be greater among 
those who practice at institutions assigned to the less intensive protocol, similar analysis 
strategy for H2b will be adopted.  
Similar methods will be used to evaluate ordering specialist, primary care, and radiologist knowledge attitudes and beliefs about existing guidelines for pulmonary nodule evaluation and provider satisfaction with the surveillance protocol and the evaluation process measured at 
approximately mid-way during follow -up. 
   
47 
 Aim 3: Health care resource utilization and exposure to diagnostic radiation  
Descriptive statistics will be generated for radiation exposure  and frequency of follow- up CT 
scans and other nodule- related resource utilization will be obtained by [CONTACT_172967] . For 
each type of nodule- related resource utilization, we will also create a binary variable to indicate 
whether a patient has any exam of that type (1 yes and 0 no) and obtain the corresponding 
frequency. For H3a, to examine whether among all participants with a lung nodule ≤15 mm, 
more intensive surveillance will be associated with a greater number of specific follow-up tests 
and types of follow -up tests (e.g., imaging, non-surgical biopsy, surgery) , we will use mixed -
effects Poisson regression model including random site effects to account for clustering of 
patients within sites. We will also model the frequency at which at least [ADDRESS_202440] is performed using hierarchical logistic regression that includes random 
site effects. All regression models mentioned above will be fitted with and without potential 
confounders including age, gender, ethnicity/race, smoking, BMI, nodule size, and any facility -
level factors balanced during the  randomization. For H3b, to examine whether among all 
participants with a lung nodule ≤15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be associated with a 
greater number of serious complications related to invasive procedures, similar strategy used for H3a will be adopted. We will model the number of serious procedure -related complications 
using mixed-effects Poisson regression models and the frequency of patients with any serious 
complications using hierarchical logistic regression models. For H3c, to investigate whether all participants with a lung nodule ≤15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be associated w ith 
greater total exposure to diagnostic radiation than less intensive surveillance, we will use mixed effects models and log- transform the radiation exposure to make normal assumption more 
appropriate.  
For H4, binary variables will be generated to indicate adherence to the recommended protocols measured at the level of the ordering provider and the patient. Cross tabulations of the 
   
48 
 adherence indicators and the surveillance arm will be obtained. To examine whether among all 
participants with a lung nodule ≤15 mm, more intensive surveillance will be associated with worse adherence to the surveillance protocol than less intensive survei llance, we will use 
hierarchical logistic regression that includes random site effects, with and without adjusting for 
potential confounders including age, gender, ethnicity/race, smoking, BMI, nodule size, and any 
facility-level factors balanced during the randomization. 
Sample size and power calculations by [CONTACT_172968] a retrospective study of patients who underwent one or more chest CT 
scans at KPSC (2006-2012) showed that 76% of chest CT scans are performed in unique 
patients, and that approximately 30% of these individuals will have a prior history of cancer.  Of 
the remainder, approximately 32% of unique patients (with no prior cancer diagnosis) who 
undergo chest CT will have a pulmonary nodule ≤ 30 mm, and 72% of all nodules measure ≤[ADDRESS_202441] that approximately 16% of all unique patients who undergo chest CT will 
have a qualifying pulmonary nodule measuring ≤[ADDRESS_202442] scans will be 
performed during the planned 20- month enrollment period in over  279,500 unique individuals 
(Table 1). This translates to an estimated target population size of approximately 45,[ADDRESS_202443] scans , we will 
passively enroll a minimum of 35,200 individuals with a nodule ≤ 15 mm at one of the 14 health 
systems (24 individual study sites for cluster randomization) during the initial 28- month 
recruitment period. To allow time to complete the evaluation and accrue outcomes, patients will be followed for at least 2 years during the funding period. Among these individuals with small pulmonary nodules, we assume (based on data from KPSC) tha t 3.0% will be diagnosed with 
lung cancer, resulting in a sample size of approximately 1,[ADDRESS_202444] additional data for HTE 
analyses with greater statistical power  for Aim 1. We assume 10% loss to follow -up before final 
diagnosis is established based on KPSC membership data. This yields an estimated sample 
size for analyses of 960 individuals with cancerous nodules for Aim 1, and 32,000 individuals 
with small nodules for Aims 2 -4. 
Aim 1: For the primary outcome, the baseline risk of progression has not been reported. 
Conservatively, we assume that 5% of patients will progress from a tumor ≤ 15 mm to a tumor 
>20 mm during the surveillance period. Assuming a two- sided alpha of 0.05, and an intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.01, a sample size of 888 unique patients with cancerous lung nodules (444 per arm) is required to achieve 83% power to detect an absolute increase in tumor 
progression of 5 percentage points. Thus, our anticipated sample size o f 960 unique patients 
with cancerous lung nodules provides adequate power to show non -inferiority of the less 
intensive surveillance strategy for our primary outcome of lung cancer stage >T1a  at diagnosis. 
The most uncertainty in our assumptions is for the ICC. We will have at least 8 0% power to 
detect a 5% increase in our primary outcome for ICC values of 0.012  or less. At the baseline 
ICC value of 0.01, a total sample size of 32,560 enrolled (including 888 patients with cancerous nodules) will have 0. 83 power; for an ICC value of 0. 012, a total sample size of 35,200 enrolled 
(960 patients with cancer) will also have 0.83 power. 
Aim 2: Prior studies of anxiety and distress in lung cancer screening have shown that the 
identification of a lung nodule leads to anxiety and emotional distress that subsequently dissipates over 1-[ADDRESS_202445] >90% power to detect an effect size of 0. [ADDRESS_202446] deviation, assuming an ICC of 0.01, 
even if the response rate is as low as 5%, resulting in an estimated sample size of approximately 792 respondents in each arm.  
   
50 
 Aim 3: The primary outcome for this aim is the total number of non- invasive and invasive 
procedures performed from the date of the index CT scan to the end of surveillance. We 
assume that patients who undergo more intensive surveillance will have 3.5 procedures on 
average. A sample size of 32,000 individuals with small nodules provides 90% power to detect a 
difference of 0.[ADDRESS_202447], we assume that 5% of patients with benign nodules will undergo 
at least one invasive test. With an estimated sample size of 15,[ADDRESS_202448] 90% power to detect a difference between groups in the use of invasive testing of 3.4  
percentage points.  
Aim 4: For the analysis of radiologist adherence to inclusion of the recommendation for 
surveillance per protocol  in the radiology report , we assume that radiologists will adhere to the 
assigned protocol for at least  85% of participants in the more intensive group.  We estimated the 
ICC to be 0.[ADDRESS_202449] 130  reports 
for enrolled patients at each participating facility to achieve 80%  power to detect an 
improvement in adherence of 5.[ADDRESS_202450] according to 
the assigned protocol , we assume that 80%  of physicians in the more intensive group will be 
adherent. Assuming a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, our sample size of 16,000  individuals with small 
nodules in each group will provide >90% power to detect an improvement in adherence of 5 .3 
percentage points, assuming an ICC of 0.01 -0.19.  
   
51 
 For the analysis of patient overall adherence with surveillance, we assume that 27% of 
participants in the more intensive group will be non- adherent, based on the results of our study 
of guideline-concordant follow -up in veterans with pulmonary nodules.24  Assuming a 2-sided 
alpha of 0.05, our sample size of 16,000 individuals with small nodules in each group will 
provide 90% power to detect an improvement in non- adherence of 5.9 percentage points, 
assuming an ICC of 0.01 . 
Subgroup Analyses /Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect : During the 7.5-year study period, we 
will have sufficient power to achieve our primary aims based on the planned [ADDRESS_202451] indication (lung cancer screening or unrelated to lung cancer screening), lung cancer risk factors (primarily 
smoking history), nodule density (solid, part -solid or non-solid), health care setting, demographic 
characteristics, and geographic region. Each of these subgroup analyses will be guided by [CONTACT_172969], pre- specified hypothesis that more intensive surveillance is more effective in 
subgroups that are at higher risk for more aggressive forms of lung cancer, such as older 
individuals; smokers and former smokers; patients with screening- detected nodules, s olid 
nodules, or nodules of larger size; and patients from regions where a large portion of nodules 
are caused by [CONTACT_172970].  
To examine differences in “treatment” effect, we will include relevant interaction terms in all regression models, and report magnitudes of effects and standard errors for each subgroup level when interactions are statistically significant.  
Missing Data: Two types of missing data might occur: (1) core study variables (such as 
potential confounders) may be missing for some patients because of incomplete capture in the 
   
52 
 EHR, and (2) patients might disenroll from a health system and/or leave the capture area. We 
will minimize missingness of core study variables through intensive quality assurance. The Data Coordinating Center will review monthly reports for potential data issues and follow -up with site 
coordinators and programmers to abstract missing data, correct data issues, and document in 
the study database when missing data cannot be found.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], we expect to have some data missing at random because of information 
not being documented in the EHR, as opposed to informatively missing, where the probability of 
being missing depends on the missing value. Thus, we will use multipl e imputation methods to 
account for missing data.
64,[ADDRESS_202452] a maximum of 10% of patients to be lost to 
follow-up within [ADDRESS_202453] patient encounter in the health 
system. We will censor these patients in time -to-event analyses. For analyses restricted to 
patients with a lung cancer diagnosis, we will perform sens itivity analysis to determine the 
potential effects of incomplete capture of lung cancers in patients who disenroll. For example, we will assume some percentage of these patients were diagnosed with lung cancer and vary 
the percentage with stage >T1a tumors.  
 
 
   
53 
 Patient and Stakeholder Engagement 
This collaboration between scientists, patients and multiple stakeholders will be guided 
by [CONTACT_172971]: reciprocity, co-learning, partnership, trust, 
transparency and honesty. The PIs have identified key stakeholders who have agreed 
to serve as study partners and assist us with study design and execution and 
interpretation and dissemination of results . The preliminary governing structure that we 
developed is illustrated in the Figure.  
 
 
 This structure will facilitate interactions between each of the following groups:  
Executive Committee (EC): The EC will include the 4 study PIs, 1 patient stakeholder, 1 non-patient stakeholder, and 1 site PI. The EC will provide an efficient forum for 
discussion of all study -related issues and a mechanism for rapid decision- making when 
necessary. The EC will meet during monthly conference calls.  

   
54 
 Steering Committee (SC) : the SC will include the [ADDRESS_202454] of the study at the individual local sites.  The SC will 
meet during monthly conference calls in year 1 and quarterly thereafter.  
Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG): The SAG will include the [ADDRESS_202455] primary 
responsibility for all decisions regarding research methodology, publications, 
communications and dissemination of study results.  
Local Study Teams (LST): The local team at the individual study sites will include the 
site PI, one or more clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458], a local administrative leader, and a local 
patient representative. The LST will assist with implementing study procedures and the 
assigned protocols for surveillance, and will address unique issues that may arise at an 
individual site.   
 
  
   
55 
 Ethical Issues Including Informed Consent 
All participating sites will comply with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
regulations for the protection of human subjects, [ADDRESS_202456] on file with OHRP an acceptable Assurance of Compliance. 
Risks to Human Subjects  
Human Subjects Involvem ent, Characteristics, and Design. 
This study is a large pragmatic trial with cluster randomization by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_172898] (Arm A) versus less (Arm B) intensive chest CT surveillance for identifying lung cancers in subjects with small indeterminate pulmonary nodules. All subjects enrolled in this study have one or more small ( ≤15 mm) pulmonary nodule(s) identified on a chest 
computerized tomography (CT) scan that is determined to be of unclear significance. The most life threatening etiology for an indeterminate nodule is lung cancer but the vast majority of nodules are benign. Small nodules are difficult to biopsy or resect, so surveillance with serial CT scans is the default option for distinguishing cancerous nodules from those that are benign. Growth of a nodule on serial CT scans is suggestive of cancer and warrants an additional evaluation, while a nodule that does not grow over 2 years is usually presumed 
benign.  
We are comparing two well -established protocols for surveillance of these nodules – both 
consistent with current clinical practices. Our goal is to identify the optimal strategy for CT 
surveillance of these nodules, and identify tradeoffs between the more and less intensive approaches. The primary outcome is the percent of lung cancer patients with early stage 
(T1a) lung cancer. Additional outcomes include 1) emotional distress, anxiety, general health 
   
56 
 status and overall satisfaction with the evaluation process; 2) physician satisfaction with the 
surveillance strategy and surveillance process; 3) cumulative radiation exposure; 4) healthcare utilization related to nodule evaluation; and 5) adherence to the assigned protocol 
for CT surveillance.  
All subjects [ADDRESS_202457] one newly identified pulmonary nodule 
measuring ≤[ADDRESS_202458]. Subjects with nodules 
will be identified by [CONTACT_172972], who will trigger an alert in the Radiology 
Information System (RIS) to embed a template with the recommended surveillance protocol into the dictated radiology report. In addition, sites w ill use manual and/or automated 
methods to search radiology reports and identify subjects with small nodules who may not 
have been enrolled, thereby [CONTACT_172973]. Additional alerts flowing from the RIS to the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) will 
generate letters or emails to the ordering physician and patient notifying them of the results, 
explaining the results and the recommendation for follow -up, describing the study goals and 
duration, and specifying the types of data to be collected. Contact [CONTACT_172974] (PI) will be provided. An alert will also be created to 
send the radiology report to the local site data repository that wi ll then be used by [CONTACT_172975]. Patients will complete validated measures of anxiety, emotional distress and general health status via the Internet. P atient– and physician–
level data will be exported to the central data repository at Data Coordinating Center .   
   
[ADDRESS_202459] (e.g. demographics, smoking status, cancer history, radiology and pathology reports). Identifiers (name, gender, address, date of birth, and/or Social Security 
number) will be used for linking with local and state cancer registries to ascertain tumor size and stage in the patients with nodules that prove to be cancer. Patient -reported outcomes will 
be collected using validated instruments  via the Internet or regular mail at 1-[ADDRESS_202460] prior to all data transfers.  
 
   
58 
 Subjects’ privacy will be respected at all times, and all procedures will be HIPAA -compliant.  
All data will remain confidential and only people who are involved in the study will have access 
to private information. No information identifying individual st udy subjects will be released 
except as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Subjects will be tracked in a local database system and only de -
identified data will be sent to the central database at the Data Coordinating Center  for 
analysis. Only certified staff will have acces s to the database, which will be securely 
password-protected in a REDCap database.  
Potential Risks 
The study poses minimal risk to the patient because CT surveillance will be performed as part of 
routine medical care, and both protocols for surveillance are based on  guidelines from 
professional societies.  Randomization will occur at the level of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172879], 
and all participating institutions have indicated that there is equipoise between the comparators. Thus, all aspects of care, regardless of the group assignment to more versus less active surveillance, fall within the current stand ards of clinical practice. All nodule patients who receive 
care at a given site will be followed using the same protocol for surveillance. To the extent that adherence with current guidelines is often poor in routine clinical practice, receipt of care at a participating site may even be beneficial if adherence is improved.  
A rare but serious harm that could occur is loss of confidentiality of personal health information (PHI), but every effort will be made to protect PHI.  Patient and physician questionnaire data will 
be de-identified prior to transfer to the Data Coordinating Center for Analysis.  
Adequacy and Protection Against Risks  
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
All adult subjects undergoing a chest CT scan who have a small pulmonary nodule(s) will be 
enrolled in the study when an interpreting radiologist triggers an alert indicating the abnormal 
   
[ADDRESS_202461] findings and the study. The patients will thus be 
passively enrolled in the trial (i.e. we will ascertain outcomes of interest by [CONTACT_172976]. Other than accessing their records, and inviting them to 
complete a survey describing their experiences, there is no planned change in the care they 
receive.) They will be no tified that they have been included in the study, told what the study 
entails (i.e. following the course of their care) and they will be provided with information on how to opt out of the study and thus not have any of their information included in our ana lysis should 
they choose. Any subjects who choose to opt out will have all of their data removed from the 
study archives. Subjects will have the opportunity to opt out when they receive the invitation to 
complete surveys of patient -reported outcomes. We do not anticipate accrual issues. After a 
discussion with our patient partners we believe the majority of patients will agree to participate 
because of the “standard of care” nature of this study therefore a recruitment plan will not be devised.  However, if  underperforming sites are identified, a site -  specific recruitment plan will be 
devised, implemented and monitored.  
Each participating institution must obtain IRB approval to conduct this study. Sites will request  an 
institutional waiver of consent . Obtaining individual patient consent is not possible,  because there 
is no opportunity to contact [CONTACT_172977] (in the form of 
recommendations for surveillance that will be embedded in the formal radiology report). In 
addition, receipt of care at a participating site should not pose any additional risks to patients, 
since both options for surveillance are based on guidelines and consistent with current standards of care. Recent papers have argued that the greater risk to patients is not to perfo rm the study of 
comparative effectiveness, because the risks associated with participating in the study might be very small.  
   
60 
 All subjects (including physicians) will receive written communication describing the purpose of 
the study, study procedures, and the risks and benefits of participating in the study. If additional information about the study is needed the study coordinator and/or local PI [INVESTIGATOR_172899]. 
No subject will be included in the study against his or her will. Subjects also have the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time.  
Protections Against Risk 
All investigators and research staff at participating sites will be required to maintain up- to-date 
training in human subject protection and good clinical practice through Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI; https://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp
) and HIPAA training.  To protect 
subjects from a breach in confidentiality of personal health information, all data will be stored on secure servers that are password protected. Access to the database will be granted to as few as possible with a need to know. Additional security precautions include encryption, digital certification, audit logs, and firewall protection. Unique study -specific identifiers will be assigned 
to support accurate linkage of data on the same individual across time frames and data files. 
Encrypted data will be transferred from participating sites to the UC Davis central database 
using a web-based secure file transfer site and servers.  This method is commonly used.   
State cancer registries are experienced with data linkage procedures. Sites will send identifiers to the UC Davis Data Coordinating Center, who in term will link these data with the cancer registries. The state cancer registries will do the linkages, determine who developed cancer, 
and provide relevant information to the data coordinating center, stripped of personal identifiers 
except the study identification number. All transfer of identifiers and cancer information will be through appropriate encrypted means following established data transfer protocols of each participating institution and cancer registry. The cancer registry will destroy files with personal health information after they are no longer deemed of use for the project.  
   
[ADDRESS_202462] (DSMB) employed for this study will provide another layer of 
protection. The DSMB will meet twice each year by [CONTACT_172978]. When data are presented or published, subjects will not be individually 
identified.  
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
Given patients will receive similar care whether or not they participate in the study, there will 
be no direct benefit of participation. There is no direct benefit for physicians participating in 
the surveys. The benefit for subjects and physicians is in t he knowledge gained to improve 
evidenced based health care.   
This study follows standard practices with minimal additional risks. Although there is no direct 
benefit to the subjects or physicians contributing data the new knowledge derived is 
anticipated to have a substantial impact on overall health care.  
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide for both men and women. One  
reason for the poor outcomes is the lack of a screening and early detection tool. As a 
consequence, patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_172900].  Recently, low dose CT was shown to detect early stage lung cancer wit h a significant 
decrease in lung cancer mortality. However small pulmonary nodules detected on CT are problematic because they are infrequently cancerous, and the benefi ts of intensive testing to 
identify cancer must be balanced by [CONTACT_172979]. Several guidelines have been developed to make 
recommendations for the evaluation of small pulmonary nodul es, but the evidence supporting 
them is limited. Moreover adherence to guidelines is highly variable. At the completion of this 
   
[ADDRESS_202463] abide by [CONTACT_172980]. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_172901], state and 
federal guidelines.

The distribution is based on the general population in the [LOCATION_002] using the [ADDRESS_202464] a small pulmonary nodule(s) on a chest CT.   
2.  Describe the subject selection criteria and rationale 
Subjects selected to participate in this study is based on a chest CT finding of a small 
pulmonary nodule and not on the basis of sex/gender or racial/ethnic group. To the best of 
our knowledge there is no data to suggest that sex/gender or racial/ethnic group influences the incidence of small pulmonary nodules.  
3.  Provide a compelling rationale for exclusion of any sex/gender, racial, or ethnic group  
There is no exclusion of subjects based on sex/gender, racial or ethnic group.  
   
64 
 4.  Describe proposed outreach programs for recruiting sex/gender, racial and ethnic group 
members as  subjects.  
Each participating institution will be responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_172902] a 
current program does not exist to ensure enrolled subjects match their catchment region.  If 
gaps in sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic enrollment are identified an action plan will be designed, executed, monitored and revised as needed. Trial demographics will be a standing agenda item on the steering committee conference calls.  
NIH-Defined Phase III Clinical Trial Requirements 
There is no data to suggest that sex/gender or racial/ethnic group influences the incidence of 
small pulmonary nodules therefore we do not expect the surveillance intervention to detect a 
difference among these groups.  
Inclusion of Children  
The research topic to be studied is not relevant to children.

We are writing to let you know about a  voluntary  research study we are doing at Kaiser Permanente 
Southern [LOCATION_004]. This study is about the follow -up of patients with a small lung nodule (spot on the 
lung). This study will help us understand how best to care for patients with small lung nodules.  
• We are letting you know about the study because your doctor found a small lung nodule on your 
recent chest CT scan  that may require follow -up.  
• Most small lung nodules are harmless. About 2 to 3% are found to be lung cancer. Most 
cancerous nodules are potentially curable.   
• This study plans to find out how often doctors should do follow -up chest CT scans on patients in 
order to:   
o Find any cancerous nodules as early as possible;  
o Limit patient exposure to chest scan radiation.  
 
Do I have to be in this study?  
Being in this study is your choice. You do not have to be in any research project offered by [CONTACT_172984]. For information on how to request that your health information not be included in this study, please see the paragraph below titled “What if I d on’t want to be in this study.”  Your choice will not 
affect your eligibility for treatment at Kaiser Permanente Health Plan hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Your choice will not affect the medical care you receive.  
If after reading this letter, you still have questions or you do not understand what the research study is 
about, you can call [CONTACT_172991] at 844- 795-3878 (toll free).  
If your provider has not contact[CONTACT_172985], 
or if you have questions about follow -up care for patients with small lung nodules, please contact [CONTACT_172986]’s office.  
The study is using an accurate computer program to identify patients with nodules . However, there is a 
small chance that the computer made a mistake and you have received this letter in error. If you are 
   
[ADDRESS_202476] scan results together.  
 
What is this study about?  
The study will compare two sets of guidelines for the follow-up of patients with small lung nodules.  Professional medical societies with expert knowledge about caring for patients with lung nodules 
developed both sets of guidelines. Both guidelines are in line with current standards of care. One guideline recommends earlier or more frequent scanning than the other one. More frequent scanning isn't 
always better for health. The study is being done because doctors do not know which guideline is better 
for patients.  
Your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172905]. Your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172906]-up.   
• All patients (like you) who had a small lung nodule found on a recent chest scan have had 
recommendations for follow -up, based on your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s guideline, put into a report in your 
electronic medical record .   
• Following the recommendations in the report is best for most patients but is not required.   
• You can talk with your doctor about whether the recommendations are a good fit for you. 
• Depending on what you want or your doctor’s judgment, you and your doctor may choose  not to follow the recommendations in the report.              
If I participate in this study, what happens next?  
• We will collect the following information from your electronic medical record:  
o General information about you and your health (for example, age, smoking history and health 
conditions) 
o Basic information about your lung nodule (for example, nodule size)  
o Information about the medical care that you receive (for example, the dates of your chest 
scans).    
• We will invite you to take a survey
 about your feelings and experiences related to lung nodule 
follow-up, and your satisfaction with the care you receive. 
 
How long will the study last?  
We will collect information from your electronic health record for approximately two (2) years after 
your nodule was found. 
 
What are the possible risks if I am in this study?  
There are minimal risks to people enrolled in this study. The main risk is a loss of confidentiality because 
of sharing of health information, including some identifiable information such as your name [CONTACT_172990], between members of the research team , including our research partners at the University 
of [LOCATION_004] Davis Data Coordinating Center, who will perform all data analysis.  
 
   
71 
 How will you keep my information private?  
To maintain your confidentiality, we will take the following steps: 
• We will only share your health information with other members of the research team.  
• Any research staff who has access to your health information will be extensively trained in how to 
keep this kind of information private.   
• Our results will never be presented in any way where you may be identified. 
 
What are the possible benefits if I am in this study?  
There may not be any direct benefit to you as a result of taking part in the research study.   
 
Will I be paid for being in this study?  
You will not be paid for being in this study.  
 
Do I have to pay to be in this study?

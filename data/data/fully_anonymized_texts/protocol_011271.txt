Improving Colonoscopy Quality for Colorectal 
Cancer Screening in the National VA Healthcare 
System
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
December 15, 2019
BACKGROUND 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is a top VA priority.  Veterans are highly impacted by [CONTACT_63394], the third 
most common cancer diagnosed11,12 with a 3-year mortality rate of 35%.[ADDRESS_396686] 
lives, and is the cornerstone of effective prevention.  The National Polyp Study showed that removal of 
adenomas during screening colonoscopy decreases the subsequent development of CRC by [CONTACT_8622] 90% and death by [CONTACT_8622] 50% in comparison to historical cont rols. In VA, colonoscopy is the primary CRC screening 
modality with over 200,000 colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321366].
15 Eighty-two percent of Veterans are up-to-
date on CRC screening, with 89% having a colonoscopy.15 However, the quality of VA colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321367].  
 High quality colonoscopy is critical for CRC prevention . Observational studies found significant rates of 
CRC even after normal colonoscopy, likely due to col onoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ varied performance in detecting and 
removing polyps.
16,19 Among Medicare beneficiaries, approximately 7% of all CRC occurred in individuals who 
had colonoscopy that apparently missed the CRC diagnosis. A pooled analysis from eight surveillance studies suggested 52% of incident CRCs after colonoscopy were due to missed lesions.
20 These interval cancers 
highlight the need to focus on colonoscopy quality indicators.16,19,21,22 
 Adenoma detection rate (ADR) significantly varies by [CONTACT_321400]. In essence, polyps that are not found cannot be removed for CRC prevention. 
ADR, defined as the proportion of screening colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321368] a physician that has one or more 
histologically-confirmed adenomatous polyps or CRC, is the primary benchmark for colonoscopy inspection 
quality. Increasing ADR correlates with a lower risk of interval and fatal CRC.7,16 A landmark US study of 
314,872 colonoscopy exams showed marked variability in providers’ ability to detect polyps, with the ADR ranging from 7.4 to 52.5%.
[ADDRESS_396687] ratios (HR) for fatal interval CRC was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.65).7 Each 1% 
increase in ADR was associated with a decrease risk of 3% for CRC incidence and 5% for CRC death.[ADDRESS_396688] association with CRC death.
23,24 From 1999-2011, 634,331 Veterans had a baseline colonoscopy performed by [CONTACT_127958] 
3101 colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321369] 13-79%. In patients who had a normal colonoscopy, the higher the provider ADR, the more protected the patient was from developi[INVESTIGATOR_321370]: adjusted HR (adjHR) 0.57 for incident (95%CI: 0.42-0.79; ptrend< 0.001) and 0.73 for fatal (95%CI: 0.50-1.06; p=0.047) CRC for the highest vs. lowest ADR quintile. A 5% absolute increase in ADR was associated with relative reductions in fatal CRC risk of 4% after normal colonoscopy (adjHR 0.96, 95%CI: 0.95-0.97). Other important quality metrics, including bowel preparation quality
25–[ADDRESS_396689] patient outcomes. Both poor 
bowel preparation and incomplete examinations, for example, are associated with missed lesions29 and need 
for earlier repeat procedures.   Interventions to improve colonoscopy quality. [The reason endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321371], and deficits in 
knowledge and skills related to best practices. There is strong evidence from 3 studies that providing 
colonoscopy performance feedback
2,8,30 improves quality (ADR) in a reasonable time frame (3-24 mo) and 
patient outcomes.2,[ADDRESS_396690] and 
implementation of practice standards resulted in a 11% overall increase in ADR.]   Most recently, in a large 
prospective European cohort study evaluating annual f eedback and quality benchmark indicators on screening 
colonoscopy performance,8 the majority of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (74.5%) increased their annual ADR. Moreover, 
individuals examined by [CONTACT_218535][INVESTIGATOR_321372] A DR quintile (> 24.6%) had significantly lower risk of 
interval CRC and death. When compared with no increase in ADR, reaching or maintaining the highest quintile ADR decreased adjusted hazard ratios for interval and fatal CRC to 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12-0.63; P = .03), and 
0.18 (95% CI, 0.06-0.56; P = .03). Such data shows that audit and feedback alone can improve colonoscopy 
quality. However, it may not be enough for every provider. A Polish study found that an intensive endoscopy hands-on training session compared to feedback alone im proved ADRs 4.5% (vs. 2.3% in feedback only 
group) at 12 months.
31 [And a recent US abstract highlighted that in addition to audit and feedback, a single 
online training module offered to providers improved ADR by 5.9% in 12-24 months.32 Feedback and 
benchmarks target awareness and motivation, whereas training targets knowledge and skills. Both appear to 
be important in improving colonoscopy quality.]  
 
Quality Gap: Colonoscopy quality is linked to patient outcomes. The national VA healthcare system has lacked a comprehensive program to measure and report colonoscopy quality and help providers improve adenoma detection.
17 Accurate measurement of quality metrics is challenging because validated 
quality metrics are not available in structured VA data from VA CDW. The challenge is multifactorial. Colonoscopy procedure documentation resides in text notes in Vista/CPRS or endoscopic reporting software. 
The commonly used VA endoscopy note writer software programs (i.e. Endopro®, Provation®, etc) do not 
facilitate tracking of pathology data and quality measurement. [These same issues will persist with the 
move to Cerner Millenium  over the next decade unless an infrastructure is in place to collate and 
process colonoscopy quality data.] Thus, within VA, there has not been a reliable, efficient way to measure 
colonoscopy quality and ensure optimal protection from CRC incidence and death for Veterans.  
 Proposed Solution and Rationale for Study:  A primary justification for this study is that VA-EQuIP has a high probability of improving a quality metric outcome (ADR) directly associated with CRC death, one of the most common cancers in Veterans. A 
randomized controlled trial of this magnitude is an opportunity to show, for the first time, that even small 
improvements in clinical performance from audit and feedback, with support to improve skills and quality, can save Veterans lives, since even a 1% increase in ADR translates to a 3% reduction in interval cancer death.  
Our proposal for a randomized program evaluation is a tremendous opportunity to determine the large scale effect of the VA-EQuIP strategy on changes in the colonoscopy quality metrics of individual endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321373]. The evaluation of VA-EQuIP implementation will identify factors associated with effective implementation 
and colonoscopy quality improvement at VA sites. Our prior and planned work builds toward our long-term goal 
to reduce mortality in Veterans by [CONTACT_321401][INVESTIGATOR_11437].   The novel foundation of VA-EQuIP is a natural language pr ocessing (NLP) algorithm and informatics reporting 
infrastructure that we developed to measure and report the quality of colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321374].
33 [Our program is similar to the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) that 
houses a national quality assurance database for reporting, comparison, and quality improvement.34,[ADDRESS_396691] and enter data into the registry. Recreating the same model for gastroenterology procedures would be costly (if not impossible) and take years. Our novel informatics infrastructure collects and enters the data into the 
colonoscopy registry. This automation allows implementation and evaluation of quality reporting and 
improvement on a national scale in a shorter time frame with minimal manual labor.]   
 [With continued expansion to community care via the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION ) Act, VA will be providing and paying for colonoscopy services by [CONTACT_321402]-VA providers. It is crucial that VA is able to collect, compare, and impact quality metrics from VA and community care that are linked by [CONTACT_321403] “make versus buy” determinations.] It is our hope that our study will not only improve colonoscopy quality but also provide a framework for a ssessing the quality of other specialty care procedures 
such as bone marrow biopsy or bronchoscopy.
 
 [As prior evidence in the GI literature also supports education and training to improve ADR,
31,32 and taking into 
account the large number and heterogeneity of VA endoscopy sites and providers, VA-EQuIP’s audit and feedback implementation strategy will be supported by [CONTACT_321404]. This will promote active discussion, troubleshooting, and evidence based practice 
to improve quality. The approach avoids a “one size fits a ll” strategy such as passive webinars or costly hands-
on training programs. The virtual collaborative learning sess ions will provide a non-punitive, flexible forum to 
guide colonoscopy quality improvement in combination with our novel colonoscopy quality reporting.]  
 [Learning collaboratives were originally developed by [CONTACT_120845] (“Breakthrough Series”) to 
support peer-to-peer and peer-to-expert learning to improve healthcare.
36 Specifically, quality improvement 
learning collaboratives allow sharing of expertise acro ss practice sites to hasten the diffusion of evidence 
based practices.37 Our VA EQuIP collaborative will emphasize shared learning across multiple units led by 
[CONTACT_321405] (Drs. Kahi, Kaltenbach, Gupta, Saini). Learning sessions 
will include didactic sessions, discussion, and skill buildi ng activities followed by [CONTACT_321406].[ADDRESS_396692] been very few randomized controlled trials performed with data on their 
effectiveness in clinical care.38–40 Recently, “virtual” collaboratives  have been described and used in many 
patient safety projects (fall prevention, pressure ulcer prevention, catheter infections) in the VA.41–[ADDRESS_396693], in rigorous fashion, if virtual collaborative learning combined 
with audit and feedback can improve an outcome measure (ADR) associated with CRC mortality. The results will expand knowledge on how best to operationalize virtual collaborative learning for clinical care in a large integrated, but diverse, healthcare system.]
 
 
[Conceptual Model: Our conceptual model (Figure 1) incorporates the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation 
(COM-B) model of behavior change to guide and enhance our implementation strategy and evaluation.1 We 
will also use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework46 with 
integrated Qualitative Evaluation for Systematic Evaluation (RE-AIM QuEST47). The evaluation is designed to 
target and capture constructs defined by [CONTACT_321407]-QuEST47 as they apply to colonoscopy quality measurement, 
reporting, and improvement. Provider surveys and qualit ative interviews will explore components of behaviors 
change mapped to COM-B domains.]  
 
[Figure 1: Conceptual model of VA-EQuIP impact on behavior and colonoscopy quality] 
 
Leveraging the informatics investment made by [CONTACT_69287]&D as well as the national GI program office partnership in 
quality improvement initiatives, the roll out of VA-EQuIP is a rare opportunity to study, in real time, the 
deployment and impact of a large-scale learning health  system initiative on provider behavior change and 
colonoscopy quality. This is where implementation science becomes essential, especially with respect to stakeholder engagement, adaptation and tailoring . Our team will evaluate VA-EQuIP implementation to better 
understand how and why such a program is effective or ineffective in different contexts, such as how to improve and enhance audit and feedback with collaborative learning. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE Our proposed evaluation is highly relevant to our operations partner and to national VA priorities.  The 
VA gastroenterology community is leading national efforts to better define and deliver high-quality specialty care. The VA National Gastroenterology Program Office (Jason A. Dominitz, MD, MHS) is the sponsoring 
operational partner for VA-EQuIP and this initiative  to implement and evaluate the impact on colonoscopy 
providers. [CONTACT_321433] strongly supports this proposal and randomization method, and is committed to the 
evaluation. The proposed work clearly aligns with HSR&D and QUERI’s goals of accelerating the timeline from 
evidence to implementation and impact, and utilizing hybr id study designs to derive generalizable knowledge 
from large-scale programmatic initiatives.  
VA-EQuIP has the potential to quickly and dramatically improve variability in ADRs across VA and 
ultimately reduce the risk of CRC incidence and mortality. Our new data showing interval and fatal CRC VA‐EQuIP

time frame.  
 Secondary impacts of proposed research: The reported quality metrics could potentially contribute to 
ongoing professional practice evaluations (OPPE), which we will evaluate during the trial.  Measurement of 
completeness (i.e. cecal intubation rate) and inspection quality (i.e. ADR) of colonoscopy is a recommended 
part of OPPE for VA endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and emphasizes to VA providers that VA values high quality procedures for Veterans. However, current data limitations and the time burden for manual data collection and processing are major impediments to providing and tracking accurate  performance data to incorporate into OPPEs. The 
reporting of quality measures will also improve access to care. Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321375] (e.g. 1 year). More repeat 
procedures leads to decreased access to endoscopy specialty care for new patients. If VA could identify and 
highlight high quality endoscopy centers and endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], that data could be used to promote system wide improvement, protocol and documentation standardization, and adoption of best practices to ensure access to 
high quality colonoscopy for all Veterans.   
Audience for research results and how they will use the products : VA-EQuIP will have multiple primary 
and downstream users and stakeholders including: 
● The VA National Gastroenterology Program Office as noted above, the sponsor of VA-EQuIP. 
● The Office of Specialty Care and Primary Care to ensure Veterans are referred to high quality providers.  
● The Office of Veterans Access to Care (OVAC) and National GI Access initiative to ensure that access 
initiatives are aligned on providing Veterans with high quality procedures. 
 The proposal directly addresses VA priorities by [CONTACT_321409]. 1. “Modernize our systems”: National standardized colono scopy quality reporting will improve infrastructure 
and streamline services by [CONTACT_114094], prospecti ve quality monitoring that currently does not exist. 
2. Focus resources more efficiently: The manual chart review used by [CONTACT_321410]. VA EQuIP will make this inefficient practice obsolete.  
 Significance to Veterans and Veteran engagement: This proposal engages Veterans across the project spectrum. We solicited feedback from 12 Veterans on the Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center 
(GRECC) Veteran engagement panel, including a mix of persons who receive and do not receive VA care. 
Colonoscopy and colon cancer screening was very familiar to all Veterans present. A letter from the GRECC 
Veteran engagement panel ( Appendix 3) highlights the support and excitement for the proposal. In particular, 
there was interest in expanding VA-EQuIP to allow patients to view provider colonoscopy quality data. At this 
time, VA-EQuIP is not “patient facing” but this Veteran feedback will inform future work in this area. At study conclusion we will reach out to the GRECC engagement panel and other Veteran groups to help disseminate 
research findings. In this way we can assure the effective reach of our research and also gain insights about 
the importance of our findings from Veterans themselves.  Completed work to inform implementation and evaluation:  Multiple pre-implementation strategies
48 guided 
the planned implementation of VA-EQuIP by [CONTACT_321411]. These strategies include our identification 
of the major barriers to colonoscopy quality reporting to help ensure effective implementation with audit and 
feedback as outlined below: 
 Needs Assessment:  We published survey results showing marked variability in quality measurement and 
reporting practices at [ADDRESS_396695] (38%) of sites. A majority 
(87.8%) of respondents were interested in a centralized automatic colonoscopy quality reporting system to avoid performing manual calculations.   Barriers & Facilitators:  We conducted 21 qualitative interviews of gastrointestinal (GI) section chiefs to 
understand barriers and facilitators in measuring and reporting colonoscopy quality . We identified six 
Figure 2: VA-EQuIP Quality Dashboard predominant barriers to measuring ADR: 1) Time-consuming manual data retrieval; 2) Lack of dedicated time 
and resources; 3) Lack of standardized measurement; 4) Reliance on proxy measures; 5) Poor data resolution; 
6) Need for automation for quality reporting. Our results are under review for publication ( Appendix 4). 
 
Develop and organize a quality monitoring system - Data and Infrastructure: We created an operational database of colonoscopy procedures and linked pathology notes housed in the VA CDW Text Integration Utility that can be semi-automatically updated with the most 
current data across the VA healthcare 
system. We have optimized a machine learning document classifier that uses the support vector machine algorithm to delineate a note as either a colonoscopy 
procedure note, or not. Our process allows us 
to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321376]. 
Our NLP pi[INVESTIGATOR_321377] ( Table 
1). The VA-EQuIP dashboard visually presents 
biannual and cumulative colonoscopy quality 
metrics to VA sites and providers, and provides 
comparison metric data at the local site and 
national level (Figure 2). All reports are created 
using Microsoft™ SQL Server Reporting 
Services 2013 and are hosted on a Microsoft 
SharePoint 2013 internal website. Access is 
controlled by [CONTACT_321412].   Usability and [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]] Testing: In cooperation with our operations sponsor and partner, we 
obtained feedback and usability information on 
VA-EQuIP from the GI Field Advisory Committee. The committee members were provided access to their sites and individual data on colonoscopy quality. Respondents (N=5) provided feedback for internal consistency and 
were surveyed via the System Usability Scale 
(SUS).
49 The average SUS score for VA-EQuIP 
for 5 respondents was 87.0 (SD 9.9, range 77.5-100). A score >80.3 has been found to be in the top 10% of usability performance based on an evaluation of 500 prior evaluations using this scale.

RESEARCH OVERLAP 
We conducted a thorough search of multiple clinical trial databases and VA funded HSR&D projects using keyword searches (Appendix 2).  The search resulted in the following: colonoscopy quality metrics (N=1 
study), report card (N=30 studies), adenoma detection rate (ADR) (N=33 studies), and colonoscopy (N=641 
studies). One prior VA study (RRP 12-184, PI S aini, July 2012-Sept 2013) evaluated electronic surveillance 
measures of overuse of CRC screening. A 10-year-old study (SHP 08-201, PI [INVESTIGATOR_321378], April 2008-Sept 2008) determined if colonoscopy quality indicators were being measured at 9 VA centers. Our searches appropriately identified the Measurement Science QUERI and IIR 14-092 (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_321379], Optimizing Colorectal 
Cancer and Polyp Surveillance after Colorectal Polypec tomy) that played a crucial role in infrastructure 
development for this current proposal. Detailed review  of all studies revealed no overlap for implementation of 
a colonoscopy quality report card across the VA healthcare system with potential to impact >100,000 Veterans 
/ year by [CONTACT_321413].

[Overview of VA-EQuIP implementation strategy, study design, and timeline per randomized cluster 
Our prospective, multi-center, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design facilitates a graduated rollout of 
VA-EQuIP across participating sites, which is more  feasible than a parallel randomized trial where an 
intervention is implemented across all sites simultaneously.51 We will stratify randomization of sites to our six 
enrollment waves by [CONTACT_321414] (low/high annual patient volume) and site annual ADRs in 2018 (low/high). Low 
volume sites and low ADRs sites are likely to benefit the most from VA-EQuIP. If there were differences in site volume, or ADRs over time (ie, secular trends) and syst ematic differences in volume or ADR rates across 
enrollment waves, then these effects would be confounded in our analysis.

[Analysis Overview:  Our goal is to compare the efficacy of VA-EQuIP versus usual care for the primary 
outcomes of overall (all indications) and screening indication ADR and secondary outcomes of bowel 
preparation quality and cecal intubation rate. We hypothesize that VA-EQuIP will lead to a higher rate of ADR, 
bowel preparation quality and cecal intubation relative to standard of care. We also hypothesize the effect will be particularly pronounced among providers who have low ADR, bowel preparation quality and cecal intubation rates prior to our intervention. The primary anal ysis takes advantage of the stepped wedge design by 
[CONTACT_321415]- and post- intervention data both within and across providers to evaluate the 
effect of the intervention while controlling for secular trends, which are uniform across sites. As a secondary 
analysis, we will implement a two-stage interrupted time-series and meta-regression analysis, which is 
commonly used to study intervention effects when an intervention occurs at different times within different providers. For all analyses, our primary inferences evaluate the ratio of ADR with versus without intervention for a given provider. However, our planned analyses also address the data structure, which nests patients within providers within sites.] 
 
Eligibility / Inclusion criteria:  We have identified 73 VA sites spanning VA ( Figure 4) eligible for the study 
that have endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321380] (SCS_Endoqual). In 2017, these [ADDRESS_396698] (i.e. GI section chief) at each site will be contact[CONTACT_321416]-EQuIP implementation and given specific 
instructions for accessing site data.  Exclusion criteria: VA facilities without existing colonoscopy procedure or pathology notes in our operational database will not be included in the study.  
 
Consent:  The national GI program office will implement VA-
EQuIP as an operational initiative.  We will obtain provider 
verbal consent by [CONTACT_756], if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_5040], for the evaluation. 
 Colonoscopy quality report card & reporting infrastructure:  The VA-EQuIP quality reporting infrastructure 
includes [ADDRESS_396699], transform, loading (ETL) framework and secure SharePoint Site to visually present quarterly colonoscopy quality metrics ( Figure 2) . VA-EQuIP has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_321381].  
 
Data measures:  CDW structured data include patient demographics and endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321382] (e.g. 
gastroenterology, surgery). Variables derived from nat ural language processing of colonoscopy procedure and 
pathology notes include extent of exam , screening indication, and adenoma detection. 
 
Outcome measures:  The primary outcomes are overall and screening ADR for endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321383], [with an  average follow up of 19.5 months (range 12-27 months).] 
Overall ADR is defined as the percentage of patients undergoing colonoscopy for any indication with one or 
more adenomas detected. Screening ADR is defined as the percentage of patients ≥[ADDRESS_396700] for bowel cleanliness allowing polyp visualization and removal.   
Primary Analysis -- Stepped Wedge at the Provider Level: We will utilize patient data aggregated to the 
provider level at monthly intervals to examine how the ADR changes pre- and post-intervention. A provider’s 
monthly ADR is the ratio of the total number of the provider’s positive ADR screening results to the total 
number of patients that the provider screened during the month. Prospective data collection will begin Jan [ADDRESS_396701] 
rates for 2018 will be used to determine randomization strata (high vs. low ADR). Our stepped wedge design 
yields varying pre- and post-intervention periods for each enrollment wave or “cluster” ( Figure 5).  
New sites will be enrolled quarterly in 6 waves (12-[ADDRESS_396702], 73 total). For each wave, we will discard the data from the 3-month period where the intervention is being implemented. We will augment baseline data capture 
by [ADDRESS_396703] by [CONTACT_20904] 12 months to improve 
estimation of pre/post intervention effects within individual providers who are members of the first and final waves. Under this design, both the pre- and post-intervention data available will range from 12-[ADDRESS_396704], with an average of 19.5 months of data. 
 
 
Figure 5: Enrollment Strategy for Stepped Wedge Trial Design 
 We will construct a mixed effects generalized linear model that will act on data aggregated monthly within each 
provider to estimate the average intervention effect ac ross providers. We will use a Poisson outcome model 
with a log link to characterize each provider’s mont hly rate, where the number of positive screens will be the 
outcome and the log of the number of total screens will be included as an offset term.

indicator for whether the report card intervention was in effect at a particular month (Intervention). We will additionally control for time since the study began in quarters ( Time, coded as a categorical variable) to 
account for secular trends; as well as site leve l characteristics obtained from administrative and the 
quantitative survey data (Aim 1) (urban/rural, cumulative annual procedure volume in 2018 and current volume, site annual ADRs in 2018, use of split dose bowel preparation protocols (SDBP) in 2018, and whether or not ADR was measured in 2018), provider level characteristics (baseline years in practice, primary practice type {academic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321384], private practice}, and baseline annual procedure volume), and baseline patient 
characteristics aggregated to the provider level (age, sex, race/ethnicity). Since study time will be coded in quarters, it will incorporate seasonal effects in addition to secular trends over the study period. Random effects 
will be included for both provider and site, where provider is nested within site. Let PositiveScreens
ijt denote the 
observed number of positive screens for the j th provider at site i  during month t , and let TotalScreens ijt denote 
the total number of patients screened. Because the monthly screening rates are expected to be relatively low 
(≤ 0.30), we assume that the observed number of positive screens, PositiveScreens ijt follows a Poisson 
distribution with conditional mean λijt. We anticipate the following model for λijt on a log scale, where 
TotalScreens ijt is included as an offset term on the right hand side of the equation: Log(λ ijt) =  β0 + 
log(TotalScreens ijt) + β1Intervention ijt + β2Time ijt + β3Urban i + β4SiteVolume i + β5YrsPractice ij + β 6PracticeType ij

variables used in stratifying the baseline randomization of sites to waves. We will also examine whether the 
intervention effect varies by [CONTACT_321418]. Under the proposed Poisson model and logarithmic link function, exponentiating 
the results will allow us to report rate ratios (RRs), their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values from the 
models. Under the generalized linear mixed model the estimated treatment effect, obtained by [CONTACT_321419] β
1, represents the ratio of the screening rate after versus before implementing the intervention 
for a given provider.  We will plot monthly ADRs for a random sample of endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321385], and to check for the presence of a lagged intervention effect. We expect to see about a one month lag in the intervention effect and plan to drop the outcome data for this period to avoid biased estimates.
[ADDRESS_396706] rates within providers using residual plots and the 
Durbin-Watson or Durbin’s alternative test and include study time lags as appropriate.[ADDRESS_396707] that the residual covariance deviates substantially  from those assumed by [CONTACT_321420], we will substitute a generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis under the assumption that outcomes are independent between sites, and use robust standard errors for statistical inference.
[ADDRESS_396708] structure of the generalized linear mixed model turns out to be numerically intractable. [As a secondary question we will assess the impact of compliance with the intervention on ADR rate among the providers from Aim [ADDRESS_396709] access and participation in one or more collaborative 
learning sessions. Compliance will be modeled as an interaction with intervention in the model described above, to see if the efficacy of the inte rvention varies by [CONTACT_321421].]   
 
Power Calculation: Our power calculation for the intervention effect comes from a stepped wedge model. Based on 2017 data there were 73 sites with 657 providers performing 155,926 cases per year in our sampling frame. We estimate a 5% loss of site data due to data quality issues. We also estimate a provider attrition rate 
of 8% from four years of data provided by [CONTACT_321422] 6.9-
12%.
[ADDRESS_396710] 69 sites with 571 providers seeing 
135,517 patients/year, corresponding to 95 providers/wave and 59 patients/provider/quarter. Note that the number of patients seen by [CONTACT_321423], where seeing more patients yields greater power. Our primary outcome is ADR, which we 
will conservatively estimate as having a range of 13-79% based on prior research
7,8 and our preliminary data. 
For cluster randomized trials using implementation designs such as ours, the intra-cluster correlation 
coefficient (ICC) estimates for patient outcomes are approximately 0.030.[ADDRESS_396711] of 27.5% in the 
pre-intervention period, we would have about 93% power to detect a 1.0% absolute increase in ADR. This difference is clinically important, because a 1% increase in  ADR is associated with a 3.0% decrease in risk of 
incident CRC, and a 5% decrease in risk of fatal interval CRC.

the swCRTdesign package, and are conservative due to exclusion of three quarters of baseline data, and because the second level of clustering by [CONTACT_321424].

 Secondary Analysis -- Interrupted Time-Series (ITS) at the Provider Level:  While the analysis described 
above will be considered primary, our stepped wedge design coupled with our focus on provider performance 
provides opportunity for several analysis options. As  a secondary analysis, we will estimate the average 
intervention effect across providers using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we will implement ITS 
models within each provider, estimating the intervention effect for each provider. In the second stage, we will 
use a meta-regression approach to combine results across providers to estimate the mean and the standard deviation (on the log scale) of the intervention effect across providers.
61,62 This analysis is conventional for 
pre/post analysis of interventions implemented at different time points for different units,62,[ADDRESS_396712] across sites and providers. However, it focuses on pre/post comparisons within providers and does not allow for comparisons between treatment and control at the same time points as is done in our stepped wedge analysis.   The first stage ITS analysis will consist of segmented regression with an autoregressive error model to account 
for the correlation between successive monthly ADRs. As described in the primary analysis, we will plot 
monthly ADRs for a random sample of endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321386]. We will also use these plots to assess whether to include seasonal effects, which would be included as a categorical quarter variable in the model. We assume that a provider ’s observed number of positive screens during month t, 
PositiveScreens
t, follows a Poisson distribution with conditional mean λt. Our basic ITS model for λt for a 
particular provider has the following form: Log( PositiveScreens t)=  β 0 + log(TotalScreens t) + β1Intervention t + 
β2Time t + β2Time-After-Intervention t + β 8Age + β9Sex + β10Race + β11Season t , where t indicates time coded in 
months.[ADDRESS_396713] ( Intervention ) and whether the monthly post-intervention time trend differs from 
the pre-intervention time trend (Time-After-Intervention ). Autocorrelation will be examined using residual plots 
and the Durbin-Watson or Durbin’s alternative test and corrected using lagged study time variables as appropriate.
56 Each model will provide a RR estimate, 95% CI and p-value for a provider’s intervention effect.  
 
The second stage analysis will consist of random effects meta-regression to aggregate the provider 
intervention effects estimated from the first stage.61,[ADDRESS_396714] included the majority of the eligible providers in the VA system, we  conservatively consider the providers included in our 
analysis to be a random sample from the full possible set of providers.
64 Konstantopoulos et al. describe a 
similar multilevel meta-regression analysis where studi es are nested within school districts – here we have 
providers nested within sites.[ADDRESS_396715] for the variables used in the 
randomization stratification procedure ( Volume2018, ADR2018, and ADRMeasured), provider-level variables 
(baseline years in practice and baseline annual procedure volume), and site level characteristics including [split dose bowel preparation protocols (SDBP) in 2018,] urban/rural and cumulative annual procedure volume.   Power Calculation: Our power calculation for the overall interv ention effect is estimated from an ITS model 
after accounting for 5% data loss at the site level and 8% provider attrition. On average a provider has 19.[ADDRESS_396716]-intervention periods. Thus we estimate 386 patients/provider or 220,[ADDRESS_396717] to achieve 96.8% power 
to detect a 1.25% increase in ADR from a pre-intervention rate of 27.5% (based on 1000 simulations). Power 
calculations were conducted in SAS v 9.0.  Explanatory Analysis – Stepped Wedge and ITS analyses at the Patient Level:  One potential limitation of 
the analyses described above is that we are aggregating patient-level data to the provider month-level. The 
analysis of aggregated data is susceptible to Simpson’s paradox, where the direction of a relationship between an exposure and outcome can change when the data is analyzed at an aggregated level versus a partitioned level.
67,68 This is due to insufficient adjustment for confounders when the data is analyzed at the aggregated 
level. The ITS analysis is particularly vulnerable to  Simpson’s paradox as there is no comparison of 
intervention and controls at the same point in time, but rather this analysis focuses on pre/post comparisons 
within providers. Thus, there is potential for confounding due to case-mix differences in patients seen at 
different points in time. To overcome this paradox, we will re-examine both our primary stepped wedge analysis and our secondary ITS analysis using data at the patient observation level. The modeling will be very similar, where we will use Poisson outcome models, but there will be no offset term at the patient level. The 
interpretation of the results will be the same as before. For the stepped wedge analysis, the exponentiated coefficient of intervention will represent the ratio of  the screening rate after implementing the intervention 
versus before, for a given provider. For the ITS analysis, the first stage modeling will yield the ratio of each providers screening rate after implementing the inte rvention versus before. The second stage will yield a 
pooled estimate of the intervention RR across providers.  Aim 2: Evaluation of VA-EQuIP implementation 
[Evaluation Overview:  We will use a mixed-methods approach to perform the evaluation. This multi-faceted 
evaluation consists of three components: monitoring of  VA-EQuIP usage statistics, pre/post surveys of quality 
stewards and providers, and qualitative interviews with quality stewards and individual providers. The approach 
will capture key RE-AIM (1a) and COM-B (1b) domains  with qualitative assessments to explore barriers and 
facilitators to implementation and components of provider behavior change.]   
Evaluation Measures and Outcomes:   
Aim 2a:  The evaluation measures will include reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance domains 
(Appendix 5). Reach will be measured with site practice characteristics items from the baseline quality 
steward survey. We will also evaluate claims data from CDW fee basis, VA Choice and MISSION Acts, and contracting records to determine the proportion of Vete rans at each facility who have colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321387]-VA (community care) providers (another reach measure). Our comprehensive data infrastructure allows us to electronically monitor VA-EQ uIP quality data views by [CONTACT_321425] (our primary 
adoption measure). These data will be used as quantitative, continuous measures of adoption at both the site and individual provider level. We will also collect participant data from those sites and providers participating in collaborative learning sessions. We will also include additional adoption measures in the quality steward 
surveys by [CONTACT_321426]-EQuIP for quality measurement and reporting at each site. As for 
implementation measures, the centralized VA-EQuIP infrastr ucture will also allow us to capture fidelity by 
[CONTACT_321427] (fidelit y). The quality steward surveys were designed to capture 
outcome measures for sites (e.g. change in bowel preparation protocols) before and after VA-EQuIP implementation (Appendices 6-7 ). Qualitative interviews with quality stewards will explore site level barriers 
and facilitators to VA-EQuIP implementation and start after the last collaborative learning session for each randomized cluster.  
[Aim 2b:  The provider surveys and qualitative interviewers  were designed to capture components of behavior 
change mapped to domains of the COM-B model (e.g. capability: knowledge of colonoscopy techniques to 
enhance adenoma detection) before and after VA-EQuIP implementation ( Appendices 6-7 ). Provider 
qualitative interviews will start after the last collaborative learning session for each randomized cluster. ] 
Quantitative Survey Design and Qualitative Interview Guide:  [Our quantitative surveys for quality stewards 
and individual providers include measures we have defined for each domain. Surveys will be delivered pre- 
and post (12 months) VA-EQuIP implementation; interviews will be conducted after each randomized cluster through trial completion.]  A full description of all data sources, measures, outcomes, quantitative surveys, and 
qualitative interview guide are available in  Appendices 5-8. We have developed draft survey questionnaires 
for quality stewards [and providers  and a provider interview script to capture the intended constructs of our 
conceptual framework.] Because our measures are specific  to the VA-EQuIP intervention, it was necessary to 
develop specific questionnaire items with our co-inves tigator and survey design expert [CONTACT_321434]. 
Development has been an iterative process, wherein all necessary constructs and domains were identified and appropriate questions for capturing these domains were constructed (see draft, Appendix 6-7). The quality 
steward surveys will assess site characteristics (R E-AIM) and colonoscopy protocols before and after VA-
EQuIP implementation for use in assessing site level c hange after implementation. Practice changes include 
whether or not sites changed clinical protocols or pr actice, including quality measurement practices, quality 
reporting practices, bowel preparation protocols, endoscopy  technique (e.g. withdrawal time), use of assist 
devices marketed to improve adenoma detection (e.g. cap), or seeking additional training or proctoring. The provider survey was modified from a prev iously developed, validated COM-B-based survey
69 to capture 
behavior change domains consistent with our conceptual model. Qualitative interviews with stewards will 
explore barriers and facilitators of VA-EQuIP implementation (RE-AIM QuEST).69 Qualitative interviews with 
providers will explore components of behavior change related to VA-EQuIP implementation ( Appendix 8). 
Quantitative Survey Administration: The quantitative surveys will be delivered to the identified local quality stewards (N=73)  and providers (N=657) for each enro lled site via the Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap)
70 platform at baseline (prior to VA-EQuIP) and 12 months following completion of the VA-EQuIP 
intervention. We will incorporate established methods of maximizing web survey responses, including multiple, 
carefully-timed, integrated email contacts.71  
 
Qualitative Interviews and Transcription:  Trained interviewers, supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Susan Zickmund, will 
conduct and audio record up to 60-minute telephone interviews with and individual endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321388]. All interviews will be transcri bed verbatim by [CONTACT_321428] (HSR&D) Centralized Transcription Serv ices Program (CTSP), directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zickmund and 
located in Salt Lake City. Purposive sampling
72 will create the sample needed for interviewing endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321389]. Based on principles of thematic satu ration (the concept that no new themes emerge from 
subsequent interviews), we will estimate a minimum sample size of at least 50 persons (25 quality stewards 
and 25 individual providers)  across the sites enrolled in our study, with plans to evenly distribute interviews 
between high and low performing providers and at least 2 sites per VISN. Given the two cohorts of providers at 
high and low performing sites geographically dispersed across the country, our sample size has been chosen 
to ensure saturation.73 We will continue with interviews until thematic saturation has been reached.73  
 Analysis VA-EQuIP Statistics:  To evaluate VA-EQuIP adoption and implement ation we will continuously monitor the 
number of providers viewing VA-EQuIP dashboards and participating in collaborative learning sessions through 12-month assessment time points. Descriptive statistics will be performed at both the site and provider level.   
Survey analysis (Baseline and 12 month outcomes):  [Survey data analysis will include descriptive statistics 
of quality steward and individual provider survey res ponses at two timepoints: baseline and 12 months after 
VA-EQuIP implementation. These will include respons e distributions/percentages or means and standard 
deviations for all baseline site characteristics and all implementation and behavior change measures. We will 
examine what percent of providers viewed their quality data and if site-level activities that could impact provider 
behavior (“opportunities”) had been initiated after the intervention. Using the quality steward survey, we will assess the proportion of sites exhibiting changes in pr otocols and be able to assess sustainability of new 
practices invoked earlier in the intervention. We will summarize responses for the provider survey using the 
scoring approach from the COM-B survey that we adapted fo r our provider survey, and will compare responses 
from the baseline and 12-month surveys. We will also co mpare COM-B measures between providers, stratified 
by [CONTACT_321429] (e.g. quintiles) pre- and post-VA-EQuI P and by [CONTACT_321430] a 
categorical variable.]  
 
Qualitative analysis:  Qualitative interviews will be analyzed using the verbatim transcripts for codebook 
construction using the qualitative “editing” method by [CONTACT_77518].
74 Representative quotations will be 
captured verbatim using Atlas.ti (Scientific Softw are, Berlin [LOCATION_013]) [and mapped to COM-B behavior 
change domains.] Working with [CONTACT_321435], two extensively trained qualitative analysts will meet and 
process any differences until they agree. The codes determined through this agreement process will be 
recorded in a master file and become the basis for the final analysis. This process of coding independently (the 
basis for the inter-coder reliability scores) and then discussing each case will ensure narrative coherence in the coding process. Inter-coder reliability kappa scores of below 0.61 will trigger a training meeting. This process has consistently achieved an inter-coder reliability kappa score of ≥ 0.70.
[ADDRESS_396718] step to ensure and improve colonoscopy 
quality. [Due to the sensitive nature of provider quality metrics, heterogeneity of VA sites, and desire to 
maintain local autonomy, we postulate that the collaborative learning sessions will help drive peer-to-peer and 
peer-to-expert learning to impact quality improvement in a non-punitive forum.] The interactive problem solving 
and support in our collaborative learning represents a limited form of external facilitation.  A critical next step 
will be to provide access to more intensive interventions, such as site visits and hands-on training, for 
persistently low performing providers based on findings from our evaluation.  Research has 
demonstrated that colonoscopy quality can be improved thr ough a short course to train colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321390] a higher quality exam.31 The national GI program office is still planning a joint training program with 
VA’s Employee Education System (EES) for colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321391], Veterans’ health outcomes. The training will take advantage of lessons learned from the 
Kaminski study31 and would be co-directed by [CONTACT_6283]. Tonya Kaltenbach (Co-PI) and Charles Kahi (Co-I) in 
collaboration with leadership of the SimLEARN Center (Orlando, [LOCATION_012]). Highly qualified faculty will be 
recruited from across VA to lead a 1.5-day course comprised of didactic lectures and hands-on skills 
enhancement for approximately 50 VA colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Future training programs of this type are likely to be 
needed given the large number of providers performi ng colonoscopy in VA. Adding hands-on-training to VA-
EQuIP will be the critical next step for improving refrac tory colonoscopy quality deficiencies identified after VA-
EQuIP implementation. An additional next step is to report over and underuse of colonoscopy to improve access to GI specialty care. The National GI Access initiative ([CONTACT_321436]) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_321392]. In collaboration with [CONTACT_74229]’s office, VA-EQuIP can ensure that access initiatives are focused on providing Veterans with high quality procedures. If validated overuse measures become available in the VA-CDW we would be able to incorporate them into VA-EQuIP. 
 
DISSEMINATION PLAN Our strong partnership with the Measurement Science QUERI and national GI program office will provide ongoing dissemination throughout the project via print and electronic publications. We will post news about progress of the project on both the Measurement Science QUERI Web Site and National GI Sharepoint Site. 
We will alert VA stakeholders to new postings via electronic internal news releases. At the conclusion of the 
project, Drs. Gawron and Kaltenbach will collaborate with [CONTACT_321433] to produce a VA HSR&D CyberSeminar to notify critical VA stakeholders of the findings. Our leadership team and members of the GI Field Advisory Committee will participate in the seminar development. Sp ecifically, they will help fo rmulate the implications 
from the study and key members of our team will be available during the CyberSeminar to answer questions. 
All slides and formal notes will be posted on the Gastroenterology Program SharePoint site, ensuring their 
continued availability for VA providers. We plan sim ilar presentations for the American Gastroenterology 
Association and American College of Gastroenterology . The academic and research communities beyond VA 
will be reached through traditional means, including public ation in high impact peer-reviewed journals specific 
to the field, such as Gastroenterology  and the American Journal of Gastroenterology . Results will be presented 
at national conferences hosted by [CONTACT_69286]&D and AcademyHealth. Policy makers and others (e.g. Office of Specialty Care) in a position to affect clinical care will be reached through a policy brief, which we will distribute in collaboration with the national GI program office to researchers, federal, state, and local elected leaders, and 
Veterans’ organizations.  
 SAMPLE RECRUITMENT Recruitment timeline / detailed monthly plan for sample recruitment: The implementation strategy timeline and monthly plan for the trial is shown in Figures 3 & 5 . VA-EQuIP dashboards will be delivered in 6 waves of 
12-13 sites (N=73). We will deliver our quality steward and provider surveys before and at 12 months after each cluster in our stepped wedge design to study completion. We will recruit endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321393] 12 weeks  (after VA-EQuIP interv ention) and conduct 2-5 interviews per cluster until study 
completion.   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207] / Alternative plans if sample recruitment does not meet expectations:   
For Aim 1, we have accounted for provider attrition and problematic data in our power calculation, based on 
our own and historical data provided by [CONTACT_321431]. The centralized infrastructure and NLP 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_321394]-EQuIP will allow creation of reports for all providers in our database to ensure that the NLP 
system performance remains high throughout the project, several internal validation studies are planned. Each validation will involve a manual annotation of a random set of notes selected at each of the participating sites 
to create a reference standard. The system performance me trics will be calculated by [CONTACT_321432]. Since the NLP syst em was extensively evaluated during development, 
validation will be limited to measuring precision of extraction. If precision of extraction of each of the variable 
stays above 90%, the NLP system will be applied on the colonoscopy reports without changes. If evaluation 
detects decreased precision, detailed error analysis will be performed and system adaptation might be 
required. If system adaptation is performed, another round of validation will be required. In this case, both 
precision and recall will be evaluated. Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321395].  For Aim 2, our pre-implementation work provides str ong evidence that our team is capable of performing the 
evaluation and maximizing survey response and qualitative interview completion. Our published needs assessment survey
18 had a response rate of 69% facilitated by [ADDRESS_396719] information, which is now available to us. For the qualitative work to determine barriers to quality reporting we obtained 21 interviews in <[ADDRESS_396720] team and workgroups, incorporation of feedback from the Steering Committee, and 
facilitation of partnerships with the national GI program office and FAC, QUERI, and other VA constituents. The 
Steering Committee (Drs. Gawron, Kaltenbach, Dominitz, [Helfrich], [Samore], Whooley, and Saini) will meet virtually monthly to review all major decisions, monitor the project’s progress in meeting recruitment and other goals, to review the data analysis and findings, and coordinate publications and other products. The project aims will be advanced by [ADDRESS_396721]. Domi nitz (GI program office) or a GI FAC representative 
designated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dominitz. 
 The Quality Reporting and Informatics Workgroup,  chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gawron, includes Drs. Kaltenbach, 
Patterson, Gupta, 3 data programmers, and VINCI support staff. This workgroup will be responsible for ongoing updates and maintenance of the VA-EQuIP database, NLP processing of colonoscopy procedure and 
pathology notes, and maintenance of the reporting infrastructure. This will also include granting appropriate 
permissions to each site and provider to view VA-EQuIP data.   The Implementation and [Collaborative Learning] Workgroup,  chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kaltenbach, includes Drs. 
Kahi, Gupta, Helfrich, Whooley, Saini, Kahi, and Dominitz. This workgroup will be responsible for ensuring a 
broad range of stakeholder engagement and leading the collabor ative learning sessions outlined above. Drs. 
Whooley and Helfrich will ensure that appropriate implem entation strategies are applied to both anticipated and 
unanticipated challenges.
[ADDRESS_396722] a 
small number of endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321396]. Such 
adjustments will be based on the key principles of balancing fidelity with adaptability of the intervention. Drs. Kaltenbach, Kahi will lead the collaborative learning sessions with assistance from our other co-investigators 
and experts (Saini, Gupta, Gawron).]     
 The Evaluation Workgroup,  chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Helfrich, includes Drs. Gawron, Zickmund, Taber, Whooley, 
Presson, Millar, a data programmer, and a program manage r. This workgroup will be responsible for reviewing 
and final refinement of the quantitative surveys and inte rview scripts, and guiding delivery of the survey and 
interviews. They will also review the interview transcripts  and all new qualitative codes for codebook inclusion.  
 Research Team and Relevant Experience: As described above, we have a strong record of working with our 
operational partner to improve colonoscopy quality. Proposal  investigators bring expertise in many areas that 
will benefit the successful completion of the proposed work. Drs. Gawron (Co-PI) and Kaltenbach (Co-PI) have 
led the initiative (Measurement Science QUERI, Project 1) to build the infrastructure for VA-EQuIP - the 
foundation of this proposal. [CONTACT_84137] (Co-I) is PI [CONTACT_4007] a VA Merit Review focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a prediction 
model for CRC risk after colonoscopy. Drs. Gupta, Kaltenbach, and Dominitz have led randomized trials. [CONTACT_321437], a VA national leader on colonoscopy quality, brings strong content expertise to the project, as he has developed and implemented a single institution VA r eport card that is a model for this study.

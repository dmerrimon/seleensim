1 Introduction  
 
This document describes the proposed content for the primary statistical analysis of ACTG A5353. This 
document focuses on analyses that address the key safety and efficacy outcome measures, including those 
needed to address the study’s primary and secondar y objectives.  A subset of these analyses will form the 
basis of reports provided to the ACTG Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) while the study is ongoing. This 
analysis plan thus includes the key analyses which might lead to modification or termination of the study, 
and hence also form the core of any presentation or publication used to disseminate the primary conclusions 
of the study. It is, however, recognized that this analysis plan may be modified by [CONTACT_611915] o utside of the study, or to reflect recommendations made by [CONTACT_4484]. In 
addition, some analyses, tables, or figures may be omitted at interim analyses if there are insufficient data to 
warrant analysis or at the request of the SMC.  
2 Study schema, hypotheses and objectives  
2.1 Study schema  
DESIGN  This is a phase II, single -arm, open -label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_439405] 
(DTG) plus lamivudine (3TC).  
All participants will undergo routine monitoring including plasma HIV -
1 RNA levels, CD4+ cell count, hematology, chemistry, and 
urinalysis.  
Population -based protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), and 
integrase genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_611913]. Plasma samples will be stored for potential future studies to 
assess the impact of adherence, drug -resistant minority viral variants, 
and DTG exposure on virologic and CD4+ cell count resp onses to 
DTG plus 3TC. All participants will also undergo UGT1A1 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
DURATION  52 weeks  
SAMPLE SIZE  120 participants  
POPULATION  HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ARV) naïve men and women, 18 years 
and older, with plasma HIV -1 RNA ≥1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and <500,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, and with no evidence of a major PR mutation, any RT or 
any integrase mutations as defined by [CONTACT_941] 2014 International  Antiviral 
Society (IAS) -[LOCATION_003] drug resistance mutations list. At least 25% 
(N=30) of the participants will have screening HIV -1 RNA >100,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. The study will aim to enroll ≥20% women.  
REGIMEN  DTG 50 mg once a day (QD) plus 3TC 300 mg QD for 52 wee ks 
 
2.2 Hypothesis  
In treatment -naive participants, dual therapy with DTG plus 3TC is efficacious and well tolerated.  
2.3 Primary Objective  
To estimate the virologic success rate at week 24 after initiating DTG plus 3TC.  
2.4 Secondary Objectives  
 To compare the efficacy of DTG plus 3TC in participants with baseline HIV -1 RNA ≤ 100,000 versus 
> 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  
 To estimate the virologic success rate of DTG plus 3TC therapy at weeks 12 and 48.  
 To describe emergent integrase and RT resistance in participants with virologic failure.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DTG plus 3TC.  
 To evaluate changes in CD4+ cell counts and serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
 To store plasma samples for future studies of the impact of drug -resistant minority viral variants on 
response to DTG plus  3TC.  
 To describe the relationships between functional genetic variants in selected UGT1A1  and other 
human genes relevant to the study drugs and responses (virologic and immunologic) as well as 
adverse events observed with DTG plus 3TC.  
 To store random -timed plasma samples that may be used to characterize associations between 
plasma DTG exposure, adherence, responses (virologic and immunologic) as well as adverse 
events observed with DTG plus 3TC.  
 
  
3 General analysis considerations  
Unless otherwise specified, data wil l be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_611916]-1 RNA strata (≤ 
100,000 vs. > 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) . Throughout this document, “study entry” is defined as the visit date of a 
participant’s entry visit captured on the study initiation case report form (ADM0010). Annotations in square 
brackets ([xxx]) will provide the source table/view names and in cases, target fields.  
3.[ADDRESS_811298] between each successive study visi t at which a given evaluation is expected. For  example, for clinic 
visits and HIV -1 RNA evaluations, the week 12 win dow will span the period from >10  to 14 weeks after 
enrollment, the week 24 visit window will span the period from > [ADDRESS_811299] to the week 2 visit window is that this visit window will span the entire period from  after the start of 
treatment to week 3. In all cases, week 0 will include eval uations up to and including the  date of study entry. 
The start time for calculation of study week will be the date of study entry  (variable onstdt  in status dataset) .  
 
3.[ADDRESS_811300] to the center of the week window (the actual scheduled study week)  will be used .  
Exception: multiple HIV -[ADDRESS_811301] confidentiality of d ata, the content of these lists will be limited and will not 
include dates, participants’ ACTG identifier numbers or other combinations of information that might identify 
an individual participant (except that these may be included in the confidential clos ed reports prepared for 
SMC review).  
3.[ADDRESS_811302] dose of study treatment , 
unless otherwise specified in the protocol.  
3.6 Period of Follow -up 
Per protocol section 6.2.3, week 24 evaluation and confirmation evaluation, if warranted, will serve as the 
evaluations for the study’s primary endpoint. Study follow -up will continue until the week 52 evaluation to 
complete study evaluation for secondary endpoints.  
3.7 Validatio n of Programs  
All programs creating treatment codes, derived datasets, formats, and primary analyses will be validated in 
accordance with SOP PROG.[ZIP_CODE] and PROG.[ZIP_CODE]. All user options files will be validated in accordance 
with SOP PROG.[ZIP_CODE].  
The primary  analyses will be additionally validated through independent coding.

10 Primary Outcome Measure  
10.1 Virologic success at week 24  
Primary efficacy outcome of the study is virologic success a t week 24 . Virologic success is defined as HIV -1 
RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and on study treatment ( FDA Snapshot definition : Human immunodeficiency virus -1 
infection: developi[INVESTIGATOR_611914], November 2015).  
The virolog ic success at week 24 will be tabulated as below:  
Virologic Success  N (%) 
       HIV-1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  N 
Virologic Non -success  N (%) 
       HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  N  
       Discontinued study drug for lack of efficacy  N 
       Discontinued study  drug for other reasons; HIV -1 RNA ≥ 
50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  N  
       Discontinued study drug for other reasons; HIV -1 RNA < 
50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  N  
No Virologic Data at Week 24 window  N (%) 
       Discontinued study/study drug due to AE or Death  N 
       Discontinued study/study drug for Other Reasons  N  
       On study but missing data in window  N  
 
Table: Primary outcome measure evaluability N(%): Evaluable vs. HIV -1 RNA pending. [For interim 
analysis only]  
Table: Proportion of participants with  virologic success and 95% CI.  
 
Notes : 
 The primary outcome window at week 24 is defined as week 22 -28, i.e., 155 -196 days, inclusive.  The 
window is defined based on the guidance “Window size is one -half the duration of time between study 
visits”.  
 
 For int erim analysis:  
 
o Evaluable participants are those with week 24 visit (ADM0020 visit form and/or HIV -1 RNA 
results in database) or those who discontinued the study prior to the visit window.  
 
o Participants with premature study discontinuation will be evaluated for primary outcome 
measure regardless whether their potential on -study follow -up would reach week 24 by [CONTACT_611925].  
 
 Snapshot analysis follows a Virology First hierarchy. Because  this is primarily a virologic endpoint, the 
hierarchy for assessing row and column percentages is HIV-1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  or HIV RNA ≥  50 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL,  first, for any given window followed by [CONTACT_611926] . 
 
 Data in the window  
o Virologic outcome should be determined by [CONTACT_611927].  
o Participants who had changes in ART will be counted as virologic non -success.  
 
 No data in the wind ow 
o Discontinued study due to Adverse Event or Death.  
 Any participant who discontinues because of an AE or death before  the window should 
be classified as Discontinued due to AE or Death , regardless of the HIV -1 RNA result, 
even if the HIV -1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at the time of discontinuation.  
 If a participant has an HIV -1 RNA in the time window and also discontinues after the 
viral load was tested in the time window , the viral load data should be used to classify 
the participant’s response.  
o Disconti nued study for Other Reasons  
 If a participant discontinues the study before the window because of lack of efficacy 
then the participant should be included in the HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL row and not in 
the Discontinued for Other Reasons  row.  
 For participa nts who discontinued for Other Reasons, it is important to realize that in the 
Virology First hierarchy only participants who have achieved virologic suppression can 
be counted as Discontinued for Other Reasons . Example, if a participant discontinues 
becau se of the withdrew of consent and the HIV -1 RNA at the time of discontinuation 
was ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, then s/he should be categorized as HIV RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and 
not Discontinued for Other Reasons . 
o On study but missing data in window  
 Only participants remai ning on study but with missing virologic data should be classified 
as this category.  
 
 Dataset for Snapshot approach  should contain, at minimum, the following information:  
o PATID  
o Study day and date of last study treatment  
o Virologic outcome based on the Snapshot approach (i.e., HIV-1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, HIV -1 
RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, Discontinued due to AE or death, Discontinued for Other Reasons, On 
study but missing data during window ) 
o HIV-1 RNA measurement and the corresponding study day and date used to det ermine the 
above virologic outcome if the measurement was not missing  
o Study day and date when the participant switched to non -study treatment because of lack or 
loss of virologic suppression (VF), if applicable  
o Study day and date for permanent study discon tinuation, reason for discontinuation, and last on 
study treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement before discontinuation for the participants who 
discontinued study treatment  
 
11 Secondary Outcome Measures  
11.1 Comparison of efficacy in participants with baseline HIV -1 RNA  ≤ 100,000 vs. > 100,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  
Proportion of participants with virologic success at week 24 between participants with baseline HIV -1 RNA 
≤ 100,000 vs. > 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL will be compared using Fisher’s exact test.  
 
11.2 Virologic success at weeks 12 and 48  [Not done for interim analysis]  
The analysis of virologic success at weeks 12 and 48 will follow the same approach for virologic success at 
week 24 (section 1 2.1). 
Notes:  
 The outcome window at week 12 is defined as week 10 -14, i.e., 71 -98 days.   
 The outc ome window at week 48 is defined as week 44 -52, i.e., 309 -364 days.  Since week 52 is the 
final study visit, the window will be the latter of (last day of study follow -up and 364  days ).  
 
11.3 Virologic failure  
Virologic failure is defined as follows  (in protoc ol section 6.2.3) : 
 Weeks 16 or 20:   
o confirmed plasma HIV -1 RNA > 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  
 Week 24 or later:   
o confirmed plasma HIV -1 RNA > 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  
Notes:  
 Participants are evaluated for virologic failure regardless of whether on study treatment.  
 Confirmation will  be determined based on any two consecutive evaluations meeting the virologic failure 
definition regardless of the time between them.  
 Participants discontinuing the study (for any reason, including death and lost to follow -up) will be 
considered a virologi c failure if their last measurement meets the definition of virologic failure but no 
confirmatory measurement was obtained. All other participants’ follow -up will be censored immediately 
after the last available plasma HIV -1 RNA measurement.

11.4 Plasma HIV -1 RNA level < 50 and < 200 copie s/mL  
Three analyses will be performed with alternative considerations of missing data, treatment discontinuation 
and loss to follow -up: 
 ITT, pure virologic missing=ignored. The numerator will include participants with HIV -1 RNA < 50 (200) 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL; the de nominator will include all participants with an HIV -1 RNA evaluation at the given week.  
 ITT missing/off study/off treatment=failure. The numerator will include participant with HIV -1 RNA < 50 
(200) copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and still on initial treatment; the denominator  will include all participants with potential 
for the given week of follow -up based on the date of registration.  
 AT, purely virologic missing=ignored. The numerator will include participants with HIV -1 RNA < 50 (200) 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and still on initial treatmen t; the denominator will include participants on initial treatment with 
an HIV -1 RNA evaluation at the given week.  
 
Note: at interim analyses, only ITT, pure virologic missing=ignored approach will be used.

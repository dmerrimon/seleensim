Study Design:  This Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, single center, efficacy 
and safety study is designed to evaluate allogeneic HB -adMSCs 
to provide immune support against COVID -19 in subjects 
classified as high risk or very high risk.  
  
The screening period, up to 4 5 days long for each patient, will be 
used to assess eligibility. At baseline (Week 0), approximately 53 
patients who are eligible will be randomly assigned to one of 4 
groups (n=25 per group). Three groups will receive allogeneic 
HB-adMSCs infusions in di fferent doses, and the fourth group of 
subjects will receive vehicle infusions (solution without cells).   
  
After the study is finished the investigators should know whether 
or not HB -adMSCs provides immune support against COVID -19 
and whether or not it i s safe to give this medication to patients 
with an increased risk of infection by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2. To ensure 
that the drug is safe, a Medical Monitor will oversee the entire 
study. Laboratory data, including complete blood counts, serum 
chemistry and adverse ev ents will be reviewed.  
 
 
Planned Sample Size:   Population: 53 patients.  
The sample size required assumes a 15% drop -out of patients.  
Treatment Duration:  The approximate maximum duration of treatment for each patient 
is 14 weeks (Week 0 through 14), and the approximate duration of 
the study is 26 weeks.   
Criteria for Evaluation:   
  Safety:   
  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_60235] (AE) reporting, physical 
examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory values. Patient 
safety data will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_690154], as well as the Medical Monitor and DSM B.   
  
Clinical Efficacy:   
  
Efficacy will be evaluated through the analysis of Complete 
Blood Count with differential.  Exploratory measures will include 
changes from baseline inflammation, SF -36 and PHQ -9.

Introduction   
  
 
Background and Study Rationale    
  
In December 2019, several unexplained cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China. On 
January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named this new virus the 2019 
novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV), which was later updated to include the disea se caused by 
2019nCoV, Coronavirus Disease (COVID -19). The most common complications observed in 
patients with COVID -19 are acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), anemia, acute heart 
injuries, and secondary infections.  Currently, there is no specific  therapeutic intervention to 
effectively improve clinical outcomes in ARDS [1]. Pulmonary fibrosis risk is greatly increased 
in infected patients and may persist even after infection is resolved [2]. In addition to many 
pulmonary symptoms, it has been repo rted that there is evidence that coronaviruses are not 
confined to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] [3]. COVID -[ADDRESS_936305] the central nervous system 
(CNS), with symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, and potentially lead to neurological 
disease [4]. Curr ently, healthcare professionals are treating infected patients with antibiotics, 
antiviral therapy, and systemic corticosteroids, however these methods have no effect on 
transmission. A substantial proportion of the US is susceptible to COVID -[ADDRESS_936306] 
of the infected patients are older, with reports of median age ranging from 47 to 75 years [4 -8], 
and had underlying disease, likely increasing their vulnerability [5]. As this pandemic continues 
to spread across the globe, researchers and clinici ans are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_690138]. While the world awaits an effective vaccine, treatment

The homeostasis of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_690139], induce tolerance, and 
regulate efficient immune reactions to pathogens [9]. In the case of viral infection, the host innate 
immune response is the first line of defense to prevent invasion or replication prior to adaptive 
immune response. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_690140] a re typi[INVESTIGATOR_690141] a cascade of inflammation. In the case of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection, the CoV spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) glycoprotein binds to host angiotensinconverting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is n ormally expressed on alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Pattern 
recognition receptors (PRR) engage to detect viral components and to induce type 1 interferons 
(IFNs) and pro -inflammatory cytokines. Type 1 interferons are produced by [CONTACT_690155] v iral infection. IFNs are known to exhibit pleiotropic functions, increasing 
expression of intrinsic proteins and inducing apoptosis of virus -infected cells, and induce cellular 
resistance to viral infection [10]. Much of the function of PRRs is to discrimi nate pathogen 
nucleic acids from host nucleic acids, often through toll -like receptors (TLRs). PRRs are also 
known to initiate recruitment and activation of immune cells to the site. SARS -CoV -2-associated 
damage to alveolar cells triggers a systemic immune  response. Detected viral structures activate 
macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) via TLRs to secrete pro -inflammatory cytokines, such as 
interleukins (ILs) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and induce proliferation of naïve T -cells. 
Macrophages, once acti vated, undergo polarization to either an M1 or M2 phenotype. M1 
macrophages exhibit pro -inflammatory functions, secreting pro -inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-12, IL -23, TNF -α, IL -1β, and IL -6. Increased production of IL -1a, IL -6, TNF -α, and IFN -γ is 
know n to contribute significantly to the development of acute lung injury [11]. M2 macrophages 
exhibit anti -inflammatory functions, secreting anti -inflammatory cytokines such as IL -10 and 
TGF -β. It has been reported that SARS -CoV -2 biophysically and structural ly exhibits a binding 
ability 10 -20 times stronger than that observed with SARS -CoV [12], which would likely elicit a 
significantly more robust response.

Protocol Version 1.5  
Version Date: [ADDRESS_936308] become a promising tool for the treatment of autoimmune disease, 
degener ative disease, and injury by [CONTACT_690156]. Donor -screened allogeneic stem cells present a safe option as they will 
not induce immune rejection. MSCs are known for their ability to regulate the im mune system 
and reduce inflammation [13]. Tissue repair by [CONTACT_690157] [14]. MSCs have low immunogenicity due to low 
expression levels of major histocompatibility complex -I (MHC -I) and no expression of MHC -II 
molecules and costimulatory molecules including CD80, CD86 or CD40. MSCs also secrete 
soluble factors such as IL -6 and macrophage -colony stimulating factor (M -CSF), suppress the 
activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes,  and interfere with differentiation, 
maturation and function of DCs. MSCs release anti -inflammatory and anti -apoptotic molecules 
and hence may protect damaged tissues [15]. In cases of infection, the activation of the innate 
immune system results in cytoki nes, adhesion molecules, and chemokines interacting to facilitate 
leukocyte migration to the lungs and recruitment of neutrophils. In this cascade, lung injury may 
be a direct consequence of inflammatory response. MSCs suppress lymphocyte proliferation and  
activation, reduce cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity, and induce peripheral tolerance and 
regulatory cell expansion [16 -18]. MSCs have been effective in acute and chronic inflammatory 
lung conditions by [CONTACT_690158], possibly, by [CONTACT_690159][INVESTIGATOR_690142] [19, 20].   
  
MSC therapy has been shown to be effective in many models, including models of ARDS, CNS 
and nerve injury, via mechanisms of immunomodulation, remodeling, and neurop rotection [1, 
21-29]. Inhibition of T cell proliferation is a key immunomodulatory feature of MSCs [30], along 
with their ability to dampen the immune response and attenuate secondary injury mechanisms 
[31, 32]. They suppress T cell -dependent inflammation by [CONTACT_690160]-6, M -CSF, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF -β), indoleamine  
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and nitric oxide (NO) [33]. In addition to direct suppression of effector  
T cells, MSCs also suppre ss the generation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells via PGE2, IL -10, and 
IL6-dependent modulation of DCs [19]. MSCs have been shown to significantly reduce the total 
number of effector T cells in injured lungs, attenuating Th1 -, Th2, and Th17 -driven 
inflammation  [19]. MSCs can exert potent immunomodulatory effects through many 
mechanisms which have not been completely elucidated, however the concept of ‘licensing’ is a 
well-accepted mechanistic component. MSCs are licensed when they encounter endogenous 
proinflam matory factors, such as TNF -α and IFN -γ [34], which upregulates the expression of 
regulatory factors and produces an anti -inflammatory response [34 -36]. Stimulation of MSCs 
induces production of TNF -α-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG -6), which has been shown  to 
decrease inflammatory reactions in several animal models [37 -39], in part by [CONTACT_690161]/macrophage response and reducing stimulation of NF -κB signaling in 
resident macrophages [37]. This negative -feedback loop attenuates the pro -inflammatory cascade 
and subsequent neutrophil recruitment [40]. MSCs have also been shown to modulate 
macrophage differentiation and activation states, specifically prompting attenuation of 
proinflammatory M1 and enhancement of anti -inflammatory M 2 [41 -45]. This has been 
proposed as another possible mechanism through which adMSC exert anti -inflammatory effects, 
evident in treatment of immunological and inflammatory diseases [46 -50]. In addition to

phagocytic activity, increase T reg cell expansion, increase alveolar fluid clearance and increase

The drug for this submission is Hope Biosciences’ allogeneic, adipose -derived culture -expanded 
mesenchymal stem cells (HB -adMSCs) to provide immune support an d protection against 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_35910] -19. We hypothesize that the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs will 
inhibit cell -mediated immune inflammatory responses and MSC endogenous regenerative 
properties will reduce pathological changes of lung associated wi th COVID -19. The population 
we are proposing to treat are at high -risk due to age, preexisting conditions, or high exposure to 
individuals infected with SARS -CoV -2 and/or diagnosed with COVID -19. We believe this 
patient population is high -risk and therefor e, we must provide cells to give them the best chance 
against this virus. We have preclinical safety and efficacy data, as well as clinical evidence of the 
safety of HB -adMSCs in patients in ongoing phase I/IIa clinical trials for Rheumatoid Arthritis 
(NCT 03691909), Traumatic Brain Injury and/or Hypoxic -Ischemic Encephalopathy 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and Alzheimer’s Disease ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), as well as individual expanded 
access for Parkinson’s Disease ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and

expanded access for Pancreatic Cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) who received allogeneic HB -adMSCs, 
as well. All treatments have been well -tolerated, with no severe adverse events related to the 
study drug.

● Prior to administration, visually inspect the infusion solution for particulates. If foreign 
particles are present, do not use the solution.  
● Emergency equipment, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, and  corticosteroids must be 
available in the event of infusion -related reactions.  
● Start IV administration after dilution.   
● Administer the infusion solution over a period of 1h. Observe the patient for at least [ADDRESS_936318] -infusion for acute infusion -relate d reactions, including anaphylaxis. See 
Appendix 1 for guidelines on diagnosing anaphylaxis.  
● Do not store or reuse any unused portion of the infusion solution. Any unused product or 
waste material should be disposed.   
● Volume of study drug infused, start times, and stop times will be recorded. If any portion 
of the infusion (cell solution) is discarded, the reason will be recorded in the CRF.  
● The patient will be monitored for a total of [ADDRESS_936319] administration (1 hour) vital signs will be measured 
at minute 0, 15, [ADDRESS_936320] Assignment and Infusion Schedule (Randomization and 
Staggering)  
  
Randomization   
A total of [ADDRESS_936321] -party personnel will be responsible for assigning the participants’ treatment 
group. This role will be referred to as ‘randomizer’. The designated personnel from the drug 
manufacturer will be responsible in labeling and packaging the investigational product for each 
participant. This role will be referred to as ‘mixer’. Participants’ names are not disclosed to the 
mixer and the unblinded information will only be known to the r andomizer.

● Group 4→Placebo infusions at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10 and 14.  
  
  
Every effort should be made to adhere to the dosing schedule. However, a scheduled infusion 
should not be administered if a patient has an ongoing AE that, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
warrants holding the infusion.  
  
Blinding  
  
Blinding for Dose Admin istration   
  
All patients, investigators, mixer, and site staff will be blinded to treatment assigned.  
  
Amber bags covering the saline will be used for product infusion. Only subject ID, DOB and 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_690145], to ensure proper distribution. Mixer will inject product 
into the bag before handing off to the clinical team.   
  
Blinding for Clinical Evaluators   
  
To minimize assessment bias, clinical evaluators (data analysts and physicians) will be trained on 
how to maintain blinding to treatment as best as possible. “Best as possible” means that blinding 
will be maintained unless an adverse event occurs that requ ires unblinding the physician, which 
is determined by [CONTACT_643117]. Training includes review of the process of 
blinding, describing who will be responsible for assigning product for the appropriate group, 
labels that will be used to identify  subjects but not treatment group, and the process that should 
be followed if an adverse event occurs, triggering review by [CONTACT_643118]/or DSMB.

Informed Consent (ICF)  
  
Prior to commencement of any trial related activity, the investigator or designated staff will 
obtain written informed consent from the patient.   
  
Patient Re -Screening   
  
If a patient is screened and fails to meet any study entry criteria may be re -screened only once. 
Such patient must be fully consented a second time before the second set of screening 
assessments take place and shall be assigned a new subject number. Inves tigator discretion 
should be exercised in determining who may be re -screened.  
  
In case of doubt about the accuracy of screening laboratory value(s), the laboratory test(s) may 
be repeated provided that this can be done within the 45 -day screening period without the need to 
repeat all other screening procedures (i.e., no re -screening).   
  
If a patient is enrolled after they have been re -screened, such subject shall be assigned a new 
subject ID number, different from the previous attempt to enroll.

Assessments will occur as outlined in the following subsections. For visits at Weeks 0 through 
26, there will be a window of ±[ADDRESS_936325] up to 45 days. These are the procedures to be performed during this 
visit:  
  
● Demographic Information will be obtained.  
● Medical History and Current conditions will be obtained,   
● Concomitant Medications will be obtained. Every medication listed should match a 
condition in the medical history.   
● Ascertain patient eligibility by [CONTACT_690165]/exclusion 
criteria.  
  
Upon completion of all Screening procedures, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_690146] “Screening Result” CRF and notify the Sponsor via Fax or 
e-mail.   
  
Infusion Visits (Baseline/Week 0, Week 2, Week 6, Week 10,  and Week 14)   
  
Generally, these are the procedures to be performed at every infusion visit. For details,  please 
refer to the schedule of assessments.   
Baseline assessments will be taken before the administration of the first infusion.  A second 
assessm ent of informed consent shall be obtained prior to the first infusion.  
  
● Pre-infusion assessment will be made by [CONTACT_690166].  In the event a subject is exhibiting 
symptom s, the subject will be asked to remain home.  ● Weight will be measured  
● Vital Signs will be measured.   
● Concomitant medications will be reviewed and updated if necessary.   
● Medical History will be reviewed and updated if necessary. If the patient reported  a 
medication which does not match the current medical history, further investigation will 
be required to determine whether it was an Adverse Event, or the patient just forgot to 
mention it before. If it is found to be an AE, it should be recorded in the a ppropriate CRF. 
If the patient forgot to mention it before, a note to file (NTF) should be made to clarify 
the case.  
● Blood samples will be collected for laboratory assessments at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, and  
26.

If a patient prematurely withdraws from the study for any reason, the early discontinuation visit 
requirements should be completed. If the early discontinuation visit is not done, the reason(s) 
will be recorded in the CRF.   
  
Unscheduled Visits  
  
The Investigator may at his/her discretion arrange for a patient to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of adverse events (AEs) that require follow -up, or an AE 
considered by [CONTACT_690167]. The 
unscheduled visit page in the CRF must be completed.   
Efficacy Assessments  
  
Complete Blood Count with Differential  
The evaluation of the Complete Blood count with differential will help suspect the presenc e of a 
bacterial or viral infection with the predominance of either the neutrophils or lymphocytes. 
Generally, a healthy person’s blood count would not show out of range values in the differential 
in the absence of a pathological condition.  
  
CRP  
C-react ive protein is considered to be an "acute phase protein," an early indicator of infectious or 
inflammatory conditions. CRP must be interpreted in the clinical context; no single value will be 
used to rule in or rule out a specific diagnosis.  
  
SF-36  
The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36 -item, patient -reported survey of patient health. The  
SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their 
section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 -100 scale on the assumption that each 
question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.   
  
PHQ -9  
The PHQ -9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM -IV criteria as "0" (not 
at all) to "3" (nearly every day). It is not a screening tool for depression, but it is used to monitor

the severity of depression. In addition to maki ng criteria -based diagnoses of depressive disorders, 
the PHQ -9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity.   
  
TNF -a  
The primary role of TNF is in the regulation of immune cells. TNF, being an endogenous 
pyrogen, is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inflammation and to inhibit 
tumorigenesis and viral replication and respond to sepsis via IL1 - & IL6 -producing cells.  
  
IL-10  
IL-10 is a cytokine with multiple effects in immunoregulation and inflammation. It 
downregulates the expression of Th1 cytokines, MHC class II antigens, and co -stimulatory 
molecules on macrophages. It also enhances B cell survival,  proliferation, and antibody 
production.  
  
IL-6   
Interleukin 6 (IL -6) is an interleukin that acts as both a pro -inflammatory cytokine and an 
antiinflammatory myokine. In humans, it is encoded by [CONTACT_24977]6 gene.   
  
Safety Assessments   
  
Safety assessments (vital signs, weight, physical examinations, AEs, routine clinical laboratory 
tests (CBC, CMP, PT and PTT/INR) will be performed at the visits specified in the schedule of 
assessments in Table 2.  
  
Vital Signs, Height, and Weight   
  
Vital signs (body temperature, pulse, oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the schedule of assessments. It is 
important that all vital signs be measured after the patient has be en resting in a sitting position 
for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. Body weight (without coats and shoes) will be recorded whenever vital 
signs are recorded, and height (withou t shoes) will be recorded at Infusion 1 (baseline) only.   
  
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out -of-range blood pressure and pulse measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs 
and followed up as such.   
  
Physical Examination   
  
A complete physical examination (head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, 
cervical and axillary lymph nodes, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems) will be performed

at baseline visit. In addition, medical history (including smoking history) will be recorded at 
baseline.   
  
A limited physical examination to verify continued patient elig ibility and to follow up any 
change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the schedule of 
assessments. Symptom -driven physical examinations will be performed as clinically indicated at 
any study visit. All changes not present at b aseline or described in the past medical history and 
identified as clinically noteworthy will be recorded as AEs.   
  
Clinical Laboratory Parameters   
  
The Investigator must review all laboratory reports and document the review. Any laboratory test 
result  or change considered by [CONTACT_690168]. Clinically significant abnormal values occurring during the 
study will be followed until repeat test results return to normal, sta bilize, or are no longer 
clinically significant.   
  
Laboratory tests to be performed during the study:  
  
Complete Blood Count with Differential  IL-6  
Chemistry  Il-10  
Coagulation study (PTT/PT/INR)     Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha   
C Reactive Protein   Rapid Antibody Test for COVID -19  
  
Adverse Events  
  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign or disease that either emerges during the study or, if 
present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the event. All 
medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the i ndication under study) present at 
screening will be documented in the medical history CRF. Changes in these conditions and new 
symptoms, physical signs, or diseases should be noted on the AE CRF during the rest of the 
study.   
  
Clinically significant labo ratory abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical 
procedures that were planned before the patient enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if 
the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in 
the patient’s medical history.   
  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that is:

- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
- Important Medical Events (IME): those events that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. They may be considered a SAE 
when, based upon medical judgement, they may jeopardize the subject and may require 
intervention to prevent o ne of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_48517]. (FDA, 21CFR312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6)  
  
All SAEs must be reported to Hope Biosciences immediately after the Investigator becomes 
aware of the event, along with a determination as to whether it is associated with the study drug.  
Patients will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed until 
resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint is reached.   
  
Each AE is to be documented in the CRF with reference to onset date, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, treatment of event, and outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to 
be classified as being serious or non -serious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be 
documented in the CRF.   
  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient gives informed consent through Week 26 (or early discontinuation visit). 
Follow -up of the AE is required until the event resolves or stabilize s at a level acceptable to the 
Investigator.  
  
Intensity of Adverse Event  
  
The intensity of the AE will be judged based on the following:  
• Mild:          Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) which is/are easily tolerated  
• Moderate:  Enough discomfort to c ause interference with usual activity  
• Severe:       Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities  
  
Causal Relationship of Adverse Events   
  
Medical judgement will be used to determine the relationship, considering all releva nt factors, 
including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge and confounding factors such 
as concomitant medication, concomitant disease and relevant history. Assessment of causal 
relationship will be recorded in the CRF.  
  
● Definitely Related :  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational product –

● Possibly Related :  An adverse event  that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to 
the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of 
other factors.  
  
● Not Related :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational product. -   
i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal 
sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.   
  
Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor  
  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of

If any of the following events listed below occur, administration of the study drug will be 
immediately suspended. The Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC), presided by [CONTACT_690169]. The committee det ermine if it is likely 
related to the drug, the infusion or unrelated. If the IMC along with the Medical Monitor agree 
that the SAE is unlikely or unrelated to the drug, the study will be continued. If the SAE appears 
to be definitely drug -related, the stu dy will be stopped. If the SAE is probably or possibly linked 
to the drug, the IMC will determine the risk to future patients and decide if the study should 
proceed or be stopped.

It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_690150] t he safety of the study at his/her 
site. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above. At Hope Biosciences, [CONTACT_690185], MD (832) 435 -2906 will be 
responsible for reviewing any report ed AEs and SAEs to determine if changes to the study need 
to be made or if the study should be stopped for the protection of patients. DSMB will review all 
deaths (to assure non -attribution), cases of anaphylaxis or suspected anaphylaxis,  
thromboembolic e vents, new malignancy/tumor, infections/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (including unrelated 
to COVID -19 but due to underlying condition). After [ADDRESS_936328] and Clinical Investigation   
  
Risks Associated with HB -adMSCs   
  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_275240]:   
A potential risk is that the infusion could initiate a VTE event with subsequent cardiopulmonary 
sequelae of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1444]/or right heart strain/failure. We plan to monitor oxygen 
saturation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]/work of breathing for the first [ADDRESS_936329] - infusion. The patient 
will be examined for VTE events (clinical exam, oxygen saturation) during each infusion visit 
and at each follow -up visit.  
Hepatic Risks:   
The reticuloendothelial system can sequester immature blood elements, theoretical ly resulting in 
hepatic injury. An acute elevation of the AST/ALT hepatic enzymes > 900 U/dl post -infusions 
will be considered an infusion related adverse event. This level is based upon the organ system 
scoring definitions for moderate hepatic failure and  corresponds to the CTCAE v4.03 Grade 4 
adverse event. It is unlikely that "end vessel" micro -thrombosis would occur in the liver due to 
the dual blood supply of the liver and the lung is the first pass organ. A CMP will be obtained at 
follow -up visits.   
Coagulation Cascade:   
A coagulation panel will be obtained at screening, baseline, infusion and the follow -up 
visits. The patient will be monitored for the development of venous thromboembolic events 
(see pulmonary monitoring above) as well as for the deve lopment of clinical deep vein 
thrombosis (limb swelling, tenderness, discoloration).  
  
The risks associated with this cellular product are currently unknown and have not been studied 
in this population, to date. There is a potential risk of increased vulnerability to COVID -19, 
worsening of the disease, and/or complications from the disease. Although currently not

Appendix 1: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
  
Anaphylaxis is defined as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.  
The following criteria were outlined by [CONTACT_690178] (a 2005 meeting of the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network).  
  
Anaphy laxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria are met:  
   
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  AND 
at least 1 of the following:   
  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)   
b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g., 
hypotonia [collapse], s yncope, incontinence)   
  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):   
  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lipstongue -uvula)   
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)   
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)   
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)   
  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient ( minutes to several hours):   
  
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age -specific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP. Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mmHg from 1 month 
to 1 year, less than (70 mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mmHg 
from 11 to 17 years.  
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline

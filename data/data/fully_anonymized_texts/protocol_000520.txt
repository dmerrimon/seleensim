 Version Date: 04 /02/2020   STUDY SUMMARY : 
The purpose and overarching aim of this study is to reduce melanoma mortality by 
[CONTACT_240901] -examination among people who 
self-identify as being at risk . Self-management of melanoma detection with skin self -
examination (SSE) depends on ready access to dermatologists when a concerning mole is det ected. In March 2020, the Illinois stay at home order (COVID -19) removed 
ready physician access  and prohibited  non-essential health care. Additionally, there was 
uncertainty about when regularly scheduled health care would resume.  This submission 
seeks to explore the feasibility of at -home non- invasive mole self -sampling for those 
with a concerning mole  with the intention of providing recommendations about the need 
for the mole to be biopsied.  
 OBJECTIVES:
 
Aim 1:  To assess the effectiveness of tar geted melanoma detection (TMD) with  
SSE education delivered  remotely to women who had a  screening mammogra m. 
The effect of TMD with SSE education on a) SSE performance, b) identification of 
concerning moles , c) time between noticing a concerning mole , requesting a mole self -
sampling kit and  receiving health care,  and d) SSE sustainability in comparison with 
controls will be assessed among women served by [CONTACT_240902] . Health care providers’ (HCPs) 
clinical/pathologic assessment of concerning moles will be identified in the Northwestern Medicine electronic health record (EHR) system.  
 Exploratory Aim:  To assess the feasibility of self -sampling concerning moles for 
gene assay. S elf-sampling kits will be sent to women who identify concerning moles 
and chose to perform self -sampling rather than watch the mole for change in a month.  
The blinded samples wil l be sent to  DermTech, Inc. , a CLIA  laboratory , for analysis and 
the results reported directly to the PI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_240889] , make 
a recommendation about the need to obtain a biopsy of the mole, offer to provide a referral to l ocal HCPs , and send the laboratory results to the HCP selected by [CONTACT_2416].  Anxiety/cancer worry will be assessed monthly to compare a) baseline 
measures, b) initial SSE and c) monitoring concerning moles for change.  
 
Knowledge gained from this study may be helpful to other health care systems serving 
at-risk women and their families in locations with limited access to physicians, especially 
dermatologists.  
 BACKGROUND : 
Early detection of melanoma remains a crucial component of effective treatment to reduce the mortality and morbidity of melanoma and the costs of melanoma care. In the [LOCATION_002] (US), melanoma incidence has increased by 270% between [ADDRESS_292612] common cause of cancer in women in the 
US (fifth in men). There will be an estimated 100,350 new cases and 6,850 deaths in 2020.
11 Melanoma predominantly occurs in non- Hispani c Whites with a history of 
unprotected occupational or recreational sun exposure; however, i ndoor tanning by

 Version Date: 04 /02/2020   women as adolescents and young adults contributes to the rising incidence.12,13 People 
with a history of 10 or more indoor tanning sessions in thei r lifetime,14 a personal or 
family history of melanoma, and a history of sunburn,15,16 are at risk to develop 
melanoma. When people with skin of color, such as Hispanics, develop melanoma they 
are twice as likely to present with late stage disease, thus, f atality is greater.11 
Prognosis is dependent on melanoma stage. For early stage melanoma,  the 5 -year 
survival is 98%, but for metastatic disease (late stage),  the 5- year survival is 25%.[ADDRESS_292613] melanomas are visible on the surface of the skin at a curable phase in their 
evolution, people can perform screening at home with the help of a partner. The annual 
prevalence of self -reported SSE in the general community ranges from 8 to 21%.[ADDRESS_292614] more than half of melanomas 
and melanomas detected by [CONTACT_240904].8 The American Academy of 
Dermatology recognized that 6- 50% of melanom as were self -detected;21,22 therefore, 
the Academy encourages self -advocacy thorough routine SSE and regular skin cancer 
screening for at -risk patients.23 In a 20 year follow -up case control study of people newly 
diagnosed with melanoma in 1987- 89, skin aw areness was associated independently 
with a decreased risk of melanoma death (HR=0.46, 95% CI=0.28- 0.75, p<0.01).24 
Currently, the median delay in diagnosis, is ~[ADDRESS_292615] melanomas 
get about 0.12 mm deeper per month with attendant increasing disease stage.26 A 27-
month delay in diagnosis may result in a 0.12 mm deep melanoma (Stage 1A) 
becoming a 3.24 mm melanoma (Stage 2B with greater risk of metastasis). Time to 
presentation for care is a key determinant of the patient outcome. Compared with other 
cancers, melanoma has the longest delays measured as the median time to patient 
presentation. One goal of this research is to reduce the time from a woman first noticing 
a “new or changing mole” to examination by a doctor.  
 
Leveraging the Mamm ogram Screening Encounter.   
In the US, w omen age 50 and older develop the habit of having regular screening 
mammograms.27 From 50 -59 years of age is also when melanoma incidence in women 
increases.28 In Illinois, screening mammograms may be scheduled without a physician’s 
order, thus, women who do not have regular care with HCPs may obtain mammograms. 
One of the innovations of our proposed study, as described below, is using the screening mammography encounter as an opportunity to educate women of all races and ethnicities at the point in their lives when melanoma is most likely to  develop. In our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_240890], we leveraged mammogram screening encounters to reach women, who were not aware of their melanoma risk.
4 Women, who are the nexus of 
familial communication of health information and social support in their own homes and

relatives.4,6,29,[ADDRESS_292616] the 
feasibility of at -home mole self -sampling with a non- invasive adhesive patch used to 
acquire surface cells of the mole.  Our primary objective,  assessing effectiveness of a  
SSE education with partner assistance among at -risk women, extends  the evidence-
based SSE intervention dev eloped among melanoma survivors and their skin check 
partners ( R01CA154908)
6 and deliver s the program to women who had a screening 
mammogra m, which demonstrated the individuals’ commitment to health promotion and 
cancer screening.   
 STUDY ENDPOINTS:  
Aim 1  
Primary outcome:  
Effectiveness of TMD with SSE will be defined as SSE performance. Further measures of fidelity will be assessed by : 
 a) extent of body checked,  
b) recruitment of a skin check partner,  c) time between noticing a concerning mole , requesting a mole self -sampling kit,  and 
seeking HCP care for a concerning mole,  and  
d) SSE sustained by [CONTACT_240905] 4 months.  
 Secondary Outcome:  
The effect of TMD with SSE on seeking health care comparing intervention vs control groups for : 
a) inappropriate HCP appointments and skin biopsies for benign conditions , and  
b) appropriate HCP appointments for the clinical diagnosis of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (dysplastic nevus) or rule out melanoma and biopsy performed. 
 
 Exploratory Aim  
Proof -of-concept Outcome:  
Research participants will self -sample concerning moles  using a kit currently used in 
physician offices to obtain a sample (DermTech, Inc) . DermTech, Inc. will perform 
analysis on up to [ADDRESS_292617] 
lack of self -sampling competency. If the initial sample has too few cells for analysis, 
then the instructions will be revi ewed by [CONTACT_240906]. Time to initiation of mole self -sampling after identifying a 
concerning mole, number of kits returned for analysis, and adequate number of cells acquired will be assessed. Correlation with monthly SSE anxiety will be done.

STUDY INTERVENTION S: 
Contact [CONTACT_240907] , who will be  women who had a screening 
mammogram from January 2, 2019 until February 28, 2020 , will be obtained from the 
Northwestern Medicine Electronic Data Warehouse (EDW). Based on our experience, 
women with a history of breast cancer will be excluded because the focus of their health 
care is on treatment of breast cancer.  Subjects will be emailed a recruitment  email 
explaining the research study regarding skin cancer prevention and skin self -
examinations. Subjects will receive a link to the online REDCap program t hat offers 
electronic consent, randomization, and self -reported surveys. After remotely enrolling in 
the study, and completing the baseline questionnaire, the subjects will be randomized 
1:[ADDRESS_292618] 
maybe printed by [CONTACT_240908] a location in their  home s to capture their 
attention and remind participants  to perform SSE . Subjects will invite  a skin check 
partner to help score the border, color , and diameter of a new and/or concerning 
mole(s) using a provided scoring system  for their 4  months of study participation.  While 
a skin check partner will be beneficial to perform SSE, a  skin check partner is not an 
absolute requirement to participate in this research. The scoring system uses a scale of 
1-3 (1= normal, 2= unsure, 3= not normal). In the brochure, color examples of normal 
and abnormal features illustrate the scoring rules. The decision rules  about seeking 
health care are based on the cumulat ive score of three features of the mole: 3 = benign, 
stop checking the mole; 4 -7 = check the mole in one month; 8-9 = make an appointment 
with a doctor to have the mole checked in about 2- [ADDRESS_292619] of 
care for evolving moles . In the absence of physician access (COVD -19), the decision 
rules used in our prior research will be modified to:  
8-9= perform mole self -sampling to determine if the mole needs to be biopsied.         
 Subjects in the intervention arm will monitor  new and concerni ng moles for 4 months  by 
[CONTACT_240909] -assisted  skin checks (if applicable) , record the 
scores on a scorecard provided in their SSE brochure, and complete the monthly online 
survey, which  asks about changes in mole scores and potent ial anxiety associated with 
evolving moles.  Subjects will also receive a monthly text message to their personal 
phone with SSE reminders.  
 If the subject indicates on their monthly survey or by [CONTACT_240910], in the form of an email and/or call, that the score of their mole has increased , 
three options  on how to proceed will be offered to the subject . The three choices are as 
follows: a) continue monthly checking the mole for change, b) receive the mole self-
sampling kit to obtain genetic analysis to guide the decision to seek health care, or c) 
seek an appointment with an HCP.  
 
The mole self-sampling kit contains the materials, directions and a F ed Express or 
USPS Express mail envelop to overnight the kit to the DermTech laboratory.

Robinson, who will inform the participant with a written report stating:  
a) the mole is benign,  and nothing further is needed or  
b) the mole needs to be biopsied.  
 If the initial sample has too few cells for analysis, then the participant will be invited to obtain another sample , instructions  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_240911].  
 
Participants req uiring a skin biopsy will be referred to a local HCP. The research team 
will develop a participant navigation system  for triage  to a local HCP, including surgical 
oncologists, dermatolo gists, and family practitioners. T his triage system will be used to 
refer participants to schedul e an appointment for the skin biopsy within 2- [ADDRESS_292621] checked moles of family members, especially the 
male spouse. We will extend the opportunity for the women enrolled in the study to sample the concerning moles of their skin check partner . If throughout the 4 months of 
the intervention arm’s active engagement in skin self -examinations, participants  indicate 
that they found a concerning mole on their skin check partner while performing a partner skin exam, an opportunity for the mole of the partner to be self -sampled (or sampled by 
[CONTACT_2299]) will be offer ed. For mole  self-sampling to occur, the subject would first 
be asked eligibility questions to ensure they are over the age of 18. Once the age is established, the partner will be required to sign an electronic consent form, indicating what information wil l be collected and what information will be shared with them and 
their HCP.   
 
Participants who have selected the self -sampling kit will be invited to  participate in a 
structured telephone exit interview.  The exit interview will seek to obtain feedback from 
the participant on the process of self -sampling and gain feedback on study materials.  
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVE D: 
Enrollment  to intervention or control arms , randomization,  will be automated in REDCap 
using a specific formula generated by [CONTACT_240912]’s 
Department of Preventative Medicine statistical team . The randomization of subjects 
who had screening mammograms at Northwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Community  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240891] 500 women are enrolled from  each location. De-
identified data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1758]’s statistical team to ensure there is an equal 
distribution of subjects at each site in both the intervention and control arm.    
 
In the intervention arm  (Group 2) , the participant will receive the SSE brochure and SSE 
postcard after consenting online and completing baseline assessments . Upon  request,

This monthly survey will include goal setting and reminders to engage a skin check 
partner to help check skin in hard to see areas and to assist with the monitoring of any concerning moles and new moles. Tracking of specific details and changes of concerning and new moles will be documented on the provided scorecard in the 
brochure . If the score of the mole increases, which is indicated on the monthly survey or 
via email and/or phone, three opti ons on how to proceed with the concerning mole will 
be provided to the subject.  
-Option [ADDRESS_292623] a sample of surface 
cells of the concerning mole with four  adhesive patches  for gene analysis  to help decide 
about seek ing further health care for biopsy of the mole. Of note, physician collected 
samples tested for LINC  and PRAME gene mutati ons differentiated melanoma and 
melanoma in situ from benign moles and were confirmed histologically with 91% accuracy.  
-Option [ADDRESS_292624] num ber as ID (blinded for 
personal identifying information) , directions, and postage for the kit to be sent to the 
company that created this self -sampling kit, DermTech, will be provided. Upon 
completing the mole self-sampling and mailing the specimen  to the DermTech 
laboratory, it will take [ADDRESS_292625] of treatment recommended by 
[CONTACT_82275] . The non- payments details are  explicitly stated in the consent document .  
 If the mole(s) requires a biopsy and/or treatment, the EHR will be reviewed to identify diagnosis codes of the mole and review HCP notes.  
 
If throughout the [ADDRESS_292626] 
(the skin chec k partner) would first be asked eligibility questions to ensure they are over 
the age of 18 and meet basic eligibility criteria. Once eligibility is established, the partner 
will be sent an electronic consent form, via REDCap, and complete and sign the for m,

Controls (Group 1) will receive a healthy lifestyle brochure and a healthy lifestyle 
postcard after consenting online and completing baseline assessments . After enrolling 
in the study, a baseline survey will populate  in REDCap , and the subject will be able to 
download a healthy lifestyle  brochure and the postcard reminder . Upon request, the 
brochure will be mailed. Each month, the subject will receive an e mail to complete the 
monthly survey and will receive healthy lifestyle text messages to their mobile phone. 
The survey they receive will mirror the survey of the SSE intervention arm ; therefore, 
awareness of SSE will be expected to increase,  and SSE may be  initiated among 
controls . If a subject indicates that they have found a concerning mole on their monthly 
survey, the subject will be advised to reach out to their health care provider for further assessment. After completing the final monthly survey, cont rols will be offered the SSE 
brochure.  
 Intervention participants who have selected the mole self-sampling kit will be invited to 
participate in a structured telephone exit interview. The exit interview will seek to obtain feedback from the participant on the process of mole self-sampling and gain feedback 
on study materials. Subjects will be asked, at time of consent, if the study team has 
permission to audio record the exit interview for purposes of data analysis. Subjects 
may opt out of the audio- recording portion of the study.  The researcher will not share 
these recordings with anyone outside of the immediate study team. The recordings will remain in locked file cabinets and on computers with restricted and password protected 
access.  
 Anxiety will be assessed on monthly surveys. If enhanced anxiety regarding a concerning mole is indicated, a referral for psychological support will be made my PI, [CONTACT_240928].  
 Out of the 500 women enrolled at each location,  it is expected that 140 of the 1000 
(14%) enrolled will identify a concerning mole.

Results of the gene analysis from the cells captured by [CONTACT_240913], [CONTACT_240928]. [CONTACT_60966] will then inform the participant, in 
the form of a written report, if the mole is benign and nothing furt her needs to be done 
or if the mole needs to be biopsied. If requested, [CONTACT_60966] will discuss the report with participants. Participants requiring a skin biopsy will be referred to a local HCP , 
who will receive the genetic analysis of the mole via fax  from [CONTACT_60966] . At the 
conclusion of the study, all participants will receive an email summary of the results.

  STUDY TIMELINES:   
Subjects , both intervention and controls  will be engaged with the research for 4  months. 
After 4 mont hs of active engagement, follow -up communication will only occur via 
telephone or email to answer any incomplete questions on surveys or any questions that arise from evaluating the EHR of HCP visits regarding the concerning mole(s). All communication will be documented in the subject’s file as  a progress note.  
 In order to complete this research before the end of the grant (March 2021), we need to have IRB approval in early May, which will allow EDW to build the lists of eligible subjects. Then we will enroll subjects remotely in June- August 2020 and follow them for 
4 months with online surveys (Oct -Dec 2020). Finally, the EHR of HCP visits will be 
reviewed about [ADDRESS_292629] online survey. This additional 
period of EHR rev iew (Feb 2021-  March 2021) gives subjects time to obtain an 
appointment with their HCP and have a biopsy, if needed.

RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS : 
The potential risks to participants are expected to be minimal if they occur.   Subjects will be participat ing in an intervention that may enhance their awareness of 
their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_192785]. All study participants will be provided with an email address and phone number to contact [CONTACT_240915]. If a subject indicates t hey have a concerning mole, they will be provided with three options 
on how to address the mole. The research team will be in communication with the subject to ensure there are no questions or concerns regarding next steps. Because of the potential for the intervention to help the subject identify melanoma at a stage of 
development with the best prognosis, we feel that the potential benefits, in reduced morbidity and mortality, to the subject outweigh the risk of potential enhanced anxiety in discovering a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_240892]. If subjects report high levels of anxiety , then  a referral 
for psychological support would  be made. We do not believe that subjects in this study 
will be exposed to any risk of physical or psychological harm as a result of either the intervention or research processes. Our measures do not assess individuals at risk of immediately harming themselves (e.g. suicide); therefore,  we will not have to screen the 
data to potentially intervene with individuals who may be a risk to themselves.  
 POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS : 
Because of the potential for the intervention to help the subject improve their ability to detect melanomas in the early and potentially curable phase, they will reduce their risk of death from melanoma. We feel that the potential benefits in reduced morbi dity and 
mortality to the subject outweigh the risk of potential enhanced anxiety in discovering that they are at risk to develop another melanoma. If subjects report high levels of 
anxiety, then a referral for psychological support would  be made.  
 DATA M ANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY : 
Data Management and Quality Control  
Data will be collected via REDCap and by [CONTACT_240916]. The subject number identifies the specimen on the case report form for gene 
sampling of moles. All databases are encrypted and stored on study specific servers at 
Northwestern University. Forms and database architecture will be set up during study preparat ion and launch. Only authorized study personnel can access these servers. Our 
data manager maintains data integrity and does fidelity checks and performs regular data checking for accuracy and completeness in coordination with the PI.

 Version Date: 04 /02/[ADDRESS_292633], participants will be randomly assigned to receive the SSE intervention or 
control (healthy lifestyle ) in a 1:[ADDRESS_292634], we will run a “worse -case scenario” where all drop-  outs will be assumed to 
not be performing S SE. Second, we will create [ADDRESS_292635] 60% retention at [ADDRESS_292636] an increase from 80% of SSE in the control group to 86.3% in t he intervention group. Assuming only 10% discordance, a sample of 500 
control women provides 80% power to detect an increase of 7%, while the remaining 3% cease SSE. Additional fidelity measures in Aim 2 will be combined to score an overall standardized fi delity score at each time. If the mean fidelity score is 80%, a 
sample of 500 women provide enough information to produce a 95% Confidence interval with a width of 0.09. The sample for 500 intervention women provides 80% power to detect declining fidelity or sustainability of monthly SSEs as a standardized slope of 0.13. The secondary outcome of seeking HCP appointments for a necessary mole will be analyzed with generalized linear models, as described above, but considering the outcome as “any HCP appointment” during the study time frame. Previous data suggests that approximately 14% of women should contact [CONTACT_240917], and our sample of 1000 women provides 80% power to detect a baseline 
rate in the control group as small as 21%.  
 Plans for securing the data is in  the “provisions to protect the privacy interests of 
participants” section of the protocol.  
 PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANT S: 
All subjects are encouraged and will be encouraged throughout the course of their participation in the research study to contact [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_60966] at Northwestern, to report complaints or adverse events. A telephone number and email address will be provided  to subjects  to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robinson if they have any co ncerns or increased 
anxiety, or if they become worried about developi[INVESTIGATOR_192785]. Instructions for reporting  adverse events and complaints are included in the consent documents and on 
all contact,  information provided to subjects  through the course of t he study. Any 
significant adverse events will be reported to NIH in addition to the local IRB, in compliance with federal regulations. Our measures do not assess individuals at risk of 
immediately harming themselves (e.g., suicide); therefore, we will not have to screen 
the data to potentially intervene with individuals who may be a risk to themselves. [CONTACT_240929] has been a board- certified physician for over three decades and has 
conducted an NCI funded R01 of a similar nature. We will notify the Northwes tern 
University IRB, our project officers, and NCI within 24- 48 hours of any serious adverse

This research includes provisions for protecting the privacy of research subjects. Study interactions will take place in person, through electronic collection data forms using REDCap, with a paper -based on the case report form for gene sampling of moles  that 
used a subject number to identify the specimen, and by [CONTACT_756]. The research team will make every effort to address the questions and concerns of potential and current subjects. Steps will be taken to ensure that the subjects feel at ease throughout t he 
entire process. To reduce the sense of intrusiveness a subject may experience in response to survey questions, subjects will be informed that they may decline to provide any information they do not wish to disclose. The information being collected is li mited 
to only the minimum amount of data necessary to accomplish the research purposes.  
 The research team will be permitted to access study -related, subject -reported 
information and the EHR of subjects who have a visit with a health care provider for a concerning mole. The EHR of skin check partners will not be accessed. The database 
that will house this data will only have de- identified data. A unique subject number will 
replace the use of names in the database. Our systems are guarded against outside entry by [CONTACT_140515]’s own firewall supporting 128- bit encryption. This level of 
encryption provides the highest level of protection against hackers, computer break -ins, 
etc. All data is de -identified. Only experienced research team members will work on this  
study and will have receive training that includes an emphasis upon the importance of confidentiality of information, and all personnel on the project will complete the required 
NIH training in the protection of human research participants. Physical copi[INVESTIGATOR_240893]- protected access, without links to the master code list. All 
data based on the research will be reported in aggregate form. No individual respondents will be identified. Electronic data will be maintained in a study -specific 
database on the server of the Department of Dermatology at the Feinberg School of Medicine. Paper -based files will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked room withi n the 
Northwestern University Department of Dermatology research offices. Identifiable data will be kept separate from the case report forms and source documents. Data gathered as a result of this study are available to inspection on request by [CONTACT_240918], and the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
  
Only approved research personnel will have access to the stored data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_240894]. As per the 
Department of Dermatology protocol, data will be retained indefinitely after the 
completion of the study. All data and other information in this study will be maintained 
confidentially.

of reimbursement options will be provided to subjects  for health care resulting from 
finding a concerning mole.  This information is explicitly stated in the consent document.  
 CONSENT PROCESS : 
Participants will be required to answer eligibility questions prior to obtaining access to the online consent form  (REDCap) . A question on the eligibility criteria will ask 
participants if they feel  comfortable reading and completing the consent process 
electronically.  Question regarding the research will be invited and answered by 
[CONTACT_240919]. If a participant indicates she would like to participate in the research study, the consent document will be completed electronically and the 
participant will complete the following survey items electronically, as they will be sent to the participant’s email.  
 
The electronic consent process will  use the secure data collection platform, REDCap. 
Particip ants will have questions asking them if they would like to speak to a research 
team member before signing the consent form. Questions will also be in place to ensure 
that the subject is comfortable with what is required of them if they agree to participate in the research  and that they understand the information. If they indicate no to either of 
the questions, the consent form will generate an option for a phone number to be collected for a study team member to contact [CONTACT_240920]. These steps are put in place to ensure each subject is comfortable with the 
information in the consent form , before being enrolled in the study . 
  
PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION:

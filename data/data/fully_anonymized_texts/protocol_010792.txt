Background
Apathy, defined as the absence or lack of motivation and emotional detachment, is a clinical 
feature of depression. Depressive symptoms and insulin resistance are conditions that are 
interdependent. We hypothesize that increasing insulin sensitivity in apathetic insulin resistant 
individuals will reduce apathy. Our preliminary studies show that a low glycemic index (GI) diet 
and exercise (D+E) intervention for seven days and 12 weeks increases insulin sensitivity in 
older adults with obesity. The key feature of a low GI diet is its high dietary fiber (DF) content. In 
preparation for an efficacy trial, we will conduct a dose escalation trial in the elderly with obesity 
and determine the maximum tolerated dose of a novel DF from whole young soy pods (soy) 
delivered in soft foods.
Design and Method
Aim
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of dietary fiber from soy in elderly subjects with obesity 
and measure fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as a biomarker of compliance.
Hypothesis
Since this is a dose finding study there is no hypothesis for the maximum tolerated dose; 
however, fecal SCFA will increase with the dose.
Study Design
We propose to conduct a dose escalation trial. We will test the tolerability to [ADDRESS_600542]’s current intake. Based on this information, subjects will be 
counseled on incorporating the study foods in their diet with the appropriate fluid intake. 
Subjects will receive the study foods containing 4g DF/10g soy/day for one week and complete 
a tolerability questionnaire.
Subjects will consume the soft foods containing soy along with their regular diet for one week, 
and will be advised to return all used and unused containers at the end of the week. Compliance 
will be assessed from an interview with the subject and an evaluation of used and unused 
containers returned by [CONTACT_1766]. Pre-intervention tests and measures will be repeated, and 
adverse events will be recorded. If a dose is tolerated, subjects will receive the next escalated 
dose for one week (8 g DF/20 g soy/day or 12 g DF/30 g soy/day). At the end of each subject’s 
participation in the study, a fasting blood sample will be drawn for evaluation of CBC, and blood 
chemistry panel as safety markers.
The results of the present study will guide the design and implementation of a clinical trial to 
determine the effect of a low GI D+E program on insulin sensitivity and apathy in elderly 
subjects with obesity and insulin resistance. These results will be significant, in that they will 
potentially provide a cost-effective intervention that will substantially improve the health and 
quality of life for the growing number of elderly individuals with obesity who have developed 
insulin resistance and apathy.

DESCRIPTION AND RATIONALE
The US population is expected to be comprised of approximately 24% older adults (> 65 years) 
by 2050.1 More than 35% of US adults over [ADDRESS_600543] an incidence of 6.8 per 100 
person-years in the elderly (> 70 years),3 and insulin resistance are conditions that are 
interdependent;4,[ADDRESS_600544] of 
improving insulin sensitivity on 
depressive symptoms such as apathy 
has not been investigated.
Apathy. Apathy is a motivation 
disorder that results in diminished goal directed behavior, lack of concern about one’s health, 
and emotional indifference.6 Apathy occurs in more than 
30% of individuals with major depression and is most 
prevalent in depressed older adults.7,[ADDRESS_600545] older adults (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS] endorsed apathy items ≥ 2) ranges from 
14% to 26%.9,10 Impaired glucose metabolism is associated with depressive symptoms, 
particularly in the elderly11-15 (Figure 1). The biological link between depression and insulin 
resistance appears to be an overactive dysregulated hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis. 
The resulting hypercortisolemia promotes obesity and insulin resistance.11,[ADDRESS_600546] pathways for intervention 
will guide the course of treatment and facilitate customized interventions for a pressing, unmet, 
aging need. 
Exercise and Insulin Resistance. The literature supports the benefits of exercise on insulin 
sensitivity in the overweight and obese elderly.21-24 Different doses of aerobic exercise ranging 
from 90 minutes/week to 300 minutes/week have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. 
Adherence to the exercise prescription varies across the studies and the dose that would most 
likely foster compliance with a regimen, and yet be effective, remains unclear. The appropriate 
exercise regimen for older insulin resistant individuals that will be of relevance in real-world 
clinical practice settings constitutes a significant gap in the literature. Further, the effects of 
exercise on apathy are unexplored; but, evidence lends support to the usefulness of exercise in 
treating depression and preventing its onset.25-[ADDRESS_600547] a lower potential to 
raise blood glucose concentrations than other carbohydrate-rich food sources. This potential of 
individual foods, is measured by [CONTACT_468578] (GI), which provides a numerical value to 
represent the effect of the food on blood glucose concentrations.28,29 In a tightly controlled study, 
a low GI diet and exercise (D+E) based lifestyle intervention for 12 weeks improved insulin 
sensitivity in obese insulin resistant older adults.30 Supplementing the high GI diet with dietary 
fiber (DF) produced similar results.30 The key feature of the low GI diet is its high DF content. 
Another randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that a low GI diet that included legumes high 
in soluble DF reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1C) in subjects with type 2 diabetes, but the 
improvements in glycemia did not differ from a regular diet high in insoluble wheat DF.31 Thus, 
the DF content of a low GI diet appears to be an important mediator of its effects on glucose 
metabolism. Figure 1. Relationship between 
insulin resistance and apathy

Dietary Fiber in Soybean. The whole pods of young soybean (edamame) provide 
approximately four times the DF in an equivalent amount of the green soybean.32 A high-DF diet 
prevents the stress related rise in cortisol.33,34,35,36 The majority of the clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_468568]-depressive effects of diets high in soybeans.37  Observational studies 
in Asian populations showed an association between soybean consumption and reduced 
incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.38-40 A meta-analysis of nine RCTs 
determined that consumption of whole soy products, reduced hyperglycemia.41 Including 
soybean in a Western diet in the amounts consumed in Asian cultures poses a challenge. 
However, milled to a flour the whole pods of young soybean (soy) taste like other legume flours, 
and contain far more DF. Moreover, soy contains DF, protein, isoflavones, and phytochemicals 
in their original proportions. In rodents, soy increases fecal fat and glucose excretion, and the 
synthesis of short chain fatty acids (SCFA).42 Therefore, we hypothesize that soy will potentiate 
the effects of a low GI diet on insulin sensitivity. 
Summary. Depressive symptoms, which are common in the elderly (> 70 years), and insulin 
resistance are conditions that predispose to each other. Therefore, improving insulin sensitivity 
may be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms in the obese elderly. Apathy, being a 
common depressive symptom in the elderly and among individuals with diabetes, represents a 
particularly attractive therapeutic target for interventions designed to improve glucose 
metabolism. A low glycemic index (GI) diet and exercise (D+E) intervention increases insulin 
sensitivity in obese older adults. To maintain the benefits of a low GI diet in the elderly, foods 
must be DF-dense, yet soft and tasty. The effect of whole pods of young soybean (soy) on 
insulin sensitivity has never been explored in humans. In preparation for conducting an efficacy 
trial of the effect of soy on insulin sensitivity, we will first conduct a dose escalation study in an 
elderly population to determine the maximum dose of fiber from soy that wil be tolerated.
HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS
Edamame or green soybean in the pod has approximately four times more dietary fiber than 
soybean without the pod. The whole soy pod (soy), rich in phytonutrients, increases fecal fat 
and glucose excretion and the synthesis of short chain fatty acids in mice. The majority of the 
clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_468569]-depressive effects of diets high in 
soybeans. In previous controlled feeding and exercise studies, we found that a low GI D+E for 
one week (n = 32) or 12 weeks (n = 22) increases insulin sensitivity in older adults with obesity. 
These data form the basis of a proposal to test the hypothesis that insulin sensitivity mediates 
apathy in depression. No study to date has empi[INVESTIGATOR_468570]. The success of 
the efficacy trial depends on a determination of the optimal dose of dietary fiber from soy that 
will be tolerated by [CONTACT_219439]. Therefore, the present study will determine the maximum 
tolerated dose of dietary fiber from soy. The results will inform the development of a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a low GI D+E program (with and without soy) to 
increase insulin sensitivity and reduce apathy in the elderly.
Aim. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of dietary fiber from soy in elderly subjects with 
obesity. This aim requires a dose escalation trial in the elderly with obesity. We will test the 
tolerability to soft foods including 10 g, 20 g, and 30 g of soy containing 4 g, 8 g, and 12 g of 
dietary fiber, respectively. At each dose, eight subjects will consume the foods for one week. 
We will evaluate tolerability to each dose and measure fecal short chain fatty acids as a 
biomarker of compliance with the intervention.
Hypothesis: Since this is a dose finding study there is no hypothesis for the maximum tolerated 
dose; however, fecal short chain fatty acids will increase with the dose.
 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FW A [ADDRESS_600548]’s participation in the study will be approximately four weeks. Primary analyses are 
expected to be completed within a month of the study completion.
STUDY ENDPOINTS
Eligible subjects will consume each dose of soy for one week. They will report any adverse 
events and complete a tolerability questionnaire. Our primary aim is to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose. The secondary outcome will be the change in fecal SCFA with each escalating 
dose.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
To determine an acceptable dose of DF, we will conduct a dose escalation trial in eight elderly 
subjects with obesity and test the tolerability to soft foods containing 4 g, 8 g, and 12 g of 
DF/day from soy for one week at each dose. The soy contains approximately 39% DF.42 
Therefore, subjects will consume soft foods containing 10 g, 20 g, and 30 g of soy/day to 
provide the required DF doses and the phytonutrients in soy. This clinical trial is patterned 
according to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) recommendation for dose escalation to 
determine toxicity to a drug.43 We are testing a food, and we know that relatively large doses of 
DF are tolerated if daily intake is divided into small portions throughout the day.44 However, we 
will evaluate tolerability to DF from soy, and measure fecal SCFA as a biomarker of compliance 
with the intervention. The maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) for DF may be 
estimated at 4 g which added to average DF intake in the US of approximately 17g45 is not in 
excess of the recommended adequate intake of 25 - 38  g/day.[ADDRESS_600549]-in-human trials is rapid dose escalation initially (MRSD x 2) until the 
estimated desirable dose (8 g) is reached and then at a more cautious escalation (e.g. MRSD x 
1.5).47 Subjects will consume soft foods containing 4 g/day of DF from soy for one week, then 
proceed to 8 g/day for one week, followed by 12 g/day for one week, incorporated into their 
usual diet. 
Adverse events will be recorded as they occur and collated for each week. Fecal SCFA and 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will be evaluated at the end of each week (Figure 2).

STUDY PROCEDURES
Whole soy pods (soy). The plants will be grown under carefully monitored conditions at the 
LSU Agricultural Center and harvested at reproductive stage six or when the green pods contain 
soybeans that fill the pods. The whole pods will be processed at the [LOCATION_002] Department 
of Agriculture (USDA, New Orleans, LA), Food Processing and Sensory Quality Research Unit, 
where scientists work with foods for research purposes. Slicing the pods into thin cross-sections 
injures plant cells and activates the synthesis of an anti-microbial compound (glyceollin) 
synthesized by [CONTACT_468583]. Glyceollins have been shown to improve 
insulin sensitivity and cognition.48-52 The sliced pods will be lyophilized and milled. Nutrient 
analysis, will be performed at Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing (Madison, WI) using methods of 
analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists.[ADDRESS_600551]’s current intake. Based on this information, subjects will 
be counseled on incorporating the test foods in their diet. We expect that subjects will 
experience GI symptoms from increased DF intake, but from the applicant’s practice as a

symptoms.
Food Tolerability. Subjects will complete a version of the GI symptoms questionnaire designed 
as a validated assessment for dyspepsia,55 and modified to make it specific by [CONTACT_468584]. The scale is ranked as none, mild, 
moderate, and severe for each of four GI symptoms (bloating, abdominal rumbling, flatulence, 
and abdominal pain). Additionally, subjects will report their stool frequency ranging from 0 to 9+, 
and stool consistency based on the Bristol Stool scale.[ADDRESS_600552] PBRC procedures for blood draws and the relevant 
measurement. The total amount of blood that will be drawn across the study is approximately 20 
ml. Homogenized fecal samples will be analyzed for SCFA as previously described.42,57  
MMSE. A cut-off score of 25 on the MMSE administered at screening will be used to exclude 
subjects with dementia.58
GDS-15. The Geriatric Depression Scale is validated for evaluating symptoms of apathy and 
depression,59,60 and will be used as a screening tool. A score > [ADDRESS_600553] each dose of DF from soy. Dose safety will be investigated by [CONTACT_49169][INVESTIGATOR_468571] (e.g. 4 g dose, 8 g dose, 12 g dose) a list of adverse events such as frequency of 
headaches, nausea, vomiting. For GI symptoms the scale is ranked as none (no symptoms), 
mild, moderate, and severe for each of four GI symptoms and the assessment of intensity is 
provided in the data safety monitoring plan. Moderate and severe ratings will be considered 
intolerance to the dose. Stool frequency of one to three/day, or three times/per week is 
considered regular. Therefore, stool frequency of less than one and more than nine over a [ADDRESS_600554] rate stool 
frequency and consistency as being of moderate to severe intensity.
 According to the NCI convention for dose limiting toxicity to a drug, 1) if two out of three (66%) 
subjects are intolerant to the dose, the next lower dose is the maximum dose tested; and 2) if 
one out of three (33%) are intolerant to a dose, then that dose is considered the maximum 
tolerated dose. Therefore for a food, 1) if five out of eight (63%) are intolerant, we will adopt the 
next lower dose; and 2) if three out of eight (37%) are intolerant to a dose, then that dose will be 
taken as the maximum tolerated dose. 
A mixed effect linear model will be used to estimate changes in the fecal SCFA while accounting 
for subject correlation across time using all available data. The outcome will be within subject 
changes over time.

Lifestyle intervention to reduce apathy in the elderly
Brief Description of Intervention:  To determine an acceptable dose of dietary fiber from 
soy, a dose escalation trial in eight older subjects with obesity will be conducted. The 
tolerability to soft foods containing approximately 4 g, 8 g, and 12 g/day of dietary fiber 
(depending on the nutrition analysis of the soy flour) from 10g, 20g, and 30g of soy flour for 
one week at each dose will be assessed, and the maximum tolerated dose will be determined. 
Brief Description of Project Design
•Eight subjects will consume soft foods containing soy along with their regular diet for one 
week.
•Compliance will be assessed from an interview with the subject and an evaluation of used 
and unused containers returned by [CONTACT_1766]. 
•Subjects will provide a stool sample for measurement of short chain fatty acids as an 
objective biomarker of compliance.
•Subjects will complete a tolerability questionnaire at the end of each week. If a dose is 
tolerated, subjects will receive the next escalated dose for one week.

151.0 PARTICPANTS SAFETY
1.1 Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants
The study involves the following procedures which may pose a potential risk:
•Blood Draws. There is the possibility of discomfort, pain, and bruising at the vein on the 
arm where the needle is inserted. There may also be a small risk of bleeding and a very 
small risk of infection at the site of the blood draw. Sterile technique and trained personnel 
minimize these risks.
•Safety Assessments. Complete blood count (CBC), and chemistry 15 panel (glucose, 
creatinine, potassium, uric acid, albumin, calcium, magnesium, creatine phosphokinase, 
alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, iron, cholesterol [total, high density 
lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein], and triglycerides) reports will be used to screen for 
eligibility prior to enrollment and will be used as a safety assessment following completion of 
each dose of dietary fiber during the study. The medical investigator will review the reports, 
and clinically significant changes in laboratory values will be investigated, and the subject 
will be referred for treatment, as appropriate.  
•Whole soy pods. The soy being tested in the study is a food. The soybean will be grown at 
the Louisiana State University (LSU) Agricultural Center and milled to a flour at the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA, New Orleans, LA.) Food Processing and Sensory 
Quality Research Unit, where scientists work with foods for research purposes. This 
research examines an approach that mimics soybean consumption from parts of the world 
where its efficacy and health benefits are known.38-[ADDRESS_600558] that subjects will 
experience GI symptoms from increased dietary fiber intake, but from the applicant’s 
practice as a registered dietitian and evidence in the literature we know that these 
symptoms resolve.54 In the general population, supplementation with dietary fibers such as 
inulin and guar gum is well-tolerated at 15 g/day.[ADDRESS_600559] that 
supplementation of the usual diet with 4 g, 8 g, and 12 g dietary fiber from soy will be 
tolerated by [CONTACT_219439].
•Study Foods. There is ordinarily no risk associated with the foods provided by [CONTACT_468589]. Additionally, subjects will be asked to inform staff about any 
food allergies or intolerances. A dietary questionnaire is routinely administered at the 
screening visit when the study involves a meal service. Research dietitians are responsible 
for managing the dietary component of specific study protocols. A continuous quality 
assurance program is followed to check food item weights, recipe procedures, packed meal 
and tray assembly, and food temperatures.  Documentation is  maintained for each study. 
All Metabolic Kitchen staff members receive training in food sanitation and in research diet 
preparation. 
•Anthropometric Measurements and Vital Signs. The PBRC outpatient clinic staff are 
trained to perform these procedures in accordance with PBRC standards of practice. 
•Fecal Samples. The clinical chemistry core staff will collect the fecal samples in accordance 
with standard operating practices. 
In addition to the potential risks listed above, participants may experience a previously unknown 
risk or side effect.

16Potential Benefits 
Constipation is a common problem in the elderly. With the increase in dietary fiber, participants 
may experience benefits in their bowel movements, and as a result, in their general well-being.
1.2 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Unanticipated Problem
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the study 
population; (2) related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); (3) suggests that the research places 
participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Unanticipated problems include other 
incidents, experiences, and outcomes that are not adverse events.
Adverse Events
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. We define AE as any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the study food. 
We will define a serious adverse event (SAE) as any untoward medical occurrence that results 
in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or in a congenital anomaly. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_326349]. The study team will inquire regarding 
adverse events while minimizing the chance for bias when detecting AEs/SAEs. The study team 
will employ open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject as the preferred 
method to inquire about AE occurrence. For examples, appropriate questions include: “How are 
you feeling?”, “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”, or 
“Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit/contact?” It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or 
other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and 
not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Assessment of Intensity. An assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study will be provided by [CONTACT_468590]:
Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.
 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FW A 00006218
Approved March 4, 2022 

17Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities.
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE and both AEs and SAEs 
can be assessed as severe. Severe Adverse Event is a category utilized for rating the intensity 
of an event.
Assessment of Causality. The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between 
study treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility" is meant to 
convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than 
that a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine 
the relationship. Alternative causes, such as concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the 
temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated.
Events meeting the definition of an AE:
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (clinical chemistry) or other safety assessments (e.g., 
vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it 
may have been present prior to the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment 
or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE).
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE:
•Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments 
that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_468591]’s condition.
•Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE
•Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
•Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
AEs will be reported per IRB policies, and to the NIA on an annual basis. The reporting of AEs 
will follow the standards of practice as outlined by [CONTACT_326351] 
(PBRC) IRB in the ‘Unanticipated problems Involving risks to subjects or others’ policy. Once 
the investigator determines that an event meets the definition of an AE that must be reported, 
the investigator will not wait to receive additional information before notifying the responsible 
parties of the event and completing the appropriate forms. An assessment of causality at the 
time of the initial report will be provided. Email transmission of the AE data collection tool will be 
the preferred method to transmit this information followed by [CONTACT_468592]/or 
 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FW A 00006218
Approved March 4, 2022 

18fax. A copy of the AE report will also be sent to the institution officials. New or updated 
information will be recorded in the originally completed data collection tool. 
We are testing tolerability to a dietary fiber at supplementation levels known to be tolerated. In 
some instances, increased intake of dietary fiber may result in gastrointestinal symptoms which 
resolve over time. Nevertheless, should an SAE occur, a summary will be reported to NIA 
Program Officer and to the Safety Officer quarterly, in accordance with NIA policies. When 
SAEs occur that are unexpected (i.e., have not been previously reported for the study’s 
intervention) and that are related to the intervention, they will be reported to NIA Program 
Officer and to the Safety Officer within 48 hours of study’s knowledge of the SAE. All deaths will 
be reported within 24 hours of study’s knowledge of death. The report of death will be submitted 
to NIA Program Officer and to the Safety Officer.
The investigators will abide by [CONTACT_326353], NIA, and 
the Safety Officer, of any Unanticipated Problem involving risks to study participants or others 
(45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)). Accordingly, events meeting the definition of unanticipated problems will 
be reported within 48 hours, when possible, to avoid potential harm to subjects. PBRC 
Unanticipated Problems reporting procedures require completion and submission to the IRB of 
forms which include detailed information on the event and the actions that will be taken to 
prevent reoccurrence. Reports of Unanticipated Problems, as defined above, will be forwarded 
to OHRP using [EMAIL_6365], within two weeks of the event.
Data Safety Monitoring Plan. For each AE, the seriousness, intensity, and relationship to 
study product will be assessed, documented, and supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s medical 
records. During the study, each subject will be carefully monitored for any adverse events. After 
the initial AE/SAE report is completed and sent, the investigator is required to follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts. As currently practiced, it is planned that all AEs and SAEs 
will be followed in clinic until: 1) resolution; 2) the condition stabilizes; 3) the event is otherwise 
explained; or 4) the subject is lost to follow-up.
1.[ADDRESS_600560] will be allowed to take the consent home to discuss their decision 
with their family or counselor, if desired. Written informed consent will be obtained in the 
outpatient research clinic by [CONTACT_468593]. A waiting period will be allowed, if desired by [CONTACT_2299]. The 
coordinators and investigators will be available for questions throughout the study.
Minimizing risks
Study procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_468594]’ informed consent. Continuous monitoring by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the medical investigator of the study and institution of a safety officer will minimize all 
potential risks and discomforts. Research participants will be immediately withdrawn from the

19study upon evidence of any significant adverse event if the investigative team deems that the 
safety of the participant is in jeopardy.
2.0 INTERIM ANALYSIS
The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of dietary fiber. 
Dose safety will be investigated by [CONTACT_49169][INVESTIGATOR_468573] (e.g. 4 g dose, 8 g dose, 12 g dose) a 
list of adverse events such as frequency of headaches, nausea, vomiting. For GI symptoms the 
scale is ranked as none (no symptoms), mild, moderate, and severe for each of four GI 
symptoms and the assessment of intensity is provided in the section on adverse events. 
Moderate and severe ratings will be considered intolerance to the dose. Stool frequency of one 
to three/day, or three times/per week is considered regular. Therefore, stool frequency of less 
than one and more than nine over a 72-hour period will be a consideration for determining 
intolerance. Stool consistency of Type three to five on the Bristol Stool Scale is considered 
normal.[ADDRESS_600561] rate stool frequency and consistency as being of 
moderate to severe intensity. If a dose is tolerated, subjects will receive the next escalated dose 
for one week.
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]. The study foods will be stopped, and further dosing will be halted until un-
blinded safety information can be reviewed in the event that:
•A death occurs.
•Two or more subjects experience the same SAE following administration of study product.
•Based on AEs, laboratory findings, or clinical findings the Investigator determines that 
review of pertinent safety information is required.  
Dosing may only resume if, after review of safety information, both the Investigator and IRB 
agree that it is safe to proceed. 
3.0 Data and Safety monitoring 
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily 
basis. The Safety Officer advises the NIA Program staff and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_468574], evaluates the progress of the study, reviews procedures for maintaining the 
confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses. 
3.[ADDRESS_600562] and tolerability to the dose of dietary fiber is 
being assessed. Hence, there is no masking of data.

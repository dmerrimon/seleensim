!Patients with primary platinum resi stant/refractory disease defined as

Rationale for change:
To clarify the length of time for disease progression by [CONTACT_76362] 3.1 Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_82814] line or recurrent setting.
Rationale for change:
Bevacizumab has recently been approved by [CONTACT_76363]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76298], feasibility data show that nearly half of the recurrent ovarian cancer patients particularly in earlier lines of treatment do not 
receive bevacizumab. Therefore, to enable recruitment, prior receipt of antiangiogenic 
treatment is now changed from mandatory to optional.

9. At least 3 prior lines of therapy for advanced ovarian cancer as follows: 
∀Platinum chemotherapy: at least two prior lines required
∀Non-platinum chemotherapy: up to two prior lines are allowed but not 
required
∀Hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), bevacizumab or other immunotherapy used as a single agent will not count as a line of therapy
Rationale for change:
To clarify what treatments will count towards prior lines of therapy.Section 3.10.2 – Survival status for withdrawn consent and lost to follow up patients
At the time of OS analysis, the survival status of all patients in the full analysis set should 
be re-checked, this includes those patients who withdrew consent or are classified as “lost to 
follow up.”
!Lost to follow up – site personnel should check hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], the patients’ current physician, and a publicly available death registry (if available) to obtain a current survival status in the 2 weeks following data cut-off. (The 
SURVIVE module will be updated.)
!In the event that the patient has actively withdrawn consent to the processing 
of their personal data, the survival status of the patient can be obtained by [CONTACT_76364] (if available) 
where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws to obtain a current survival status in the 2 weeks following data cut-off. (The SURVIVE module 
will be updated.)
Rationale:
This new section has been created to clarify that at the time of OS analysis, site personnel 
should attempt to obtai n the survival status for all patients in the full analysis set who had 
previously withdrawn consent or were considered lost to follow-up using publicly available resources where available.

Rationale for change:This section has been added, per [COMPANY_008] new Protocol Template. This was previously 
covered in Section 6.8 Study governance and ove rsight – which has been removed. The 
Section has been expanded to include further details on the structure and functioning of the steering committee.  
Section 3.1 Inclusion criteria #[ADDRESS_82817] receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy.  
!Patients with platinum refractory disease defined as disease progression 
during the last receipt of platinum-based therapy, are not eligible
!Patients with primary platinum resistant/refractory disease defined as 
progression during or within [ADDRESS_82818]-line platinum-
based chemotherapy are not eligible. 
Rationale for the change:
To allow clinical judgement by [CONTACT_76365], the stipulation for radiological 
evidence of disease progression is removed. Previous criteria required radiological evidence of platinum-resistant disease which was dependent on when the CT scan was taken rather 
than on investigator’s clinical judgement of when disease progression occurred within the 
6-months of the last receipt of platinum-based  chemotherapy. The GCIG criteria for 
platinum resistant ovarian cancer does not stipulate the requirement for radiological 
evidence of disease progression with 6 months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy 
(Friedlander M et al 2011, Int J Gynecol Canc er 2011: 21: 771-775).  The amendment will

9. At least three prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer are

!Up to two prior non-platinum chemotherapy regimens are allowed but 
not required.    
!Hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), 
bevacizumab (or other angiogenesis inhibitor), or other 
immunotherapy used as a single agent will not count as a line of 
chemotherapy.  
Rationale for the change:
The allowance of only one prior non-platinum regimen aimed to select patients who start 
study treatment as soon as platinum resistant relapse is diagnosed. However, in the heavily 
pre-treated setting of at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy, it becomes too restrictive.

New text
The following 6 PRO-CTCAE AEs will be collected in the study: nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, and dizziness. In addition to these items from the 
PRO-CTCAE item bank, the following additional item will be asked together with the 
PRO-CTCAE items: "In the last 7 days, how much did LOOSE OR WATERY 
STOOLS (DIARRHEA) INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities?"
Rationale for the change
Data collection has been amended to include an additional question to a pre-existing 
question on Diarrhea in the instrument PRO-CTCAE, and to the ERT logpad. The rationale 
for this is that the item ‘Diarrhea’ was earlier assessed only on one dimension ‘frequency’. The addition of the new question will allow the assessment on two dimensions (frequency 
and interference). Although interference is not a standard NCI PRO-CTCAE item for 
diarrhoea, NCI accepts that individual sponsors can add dimensions to those in the item bank. Diarrhoea is a very common AE for cediranib and assessing the impact of the adverse 
event on patient well-being is clinically relevant. Furthermore, diarrhoea is reported as a 
very common event for olaparib, therefore assessing the impact of the combination on frequency and interference is important.

Female patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_82826] conducted in an appropriately accredited laboratory (eg, 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA]-certified) that includes 
comprehensive DNA sequencing and large rearrangement analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
These patients will be required to provide a blood sample prior to receiving investigational 
products (IPs) which may be used to perform a subsequent confirmatory BRCA mutation test 
using Myriad’s BRACAnalysis CDx®test.
Patients who do not know their gBRCA status, or whose gBRCA status has not been

Cediranib
Cediranib is available as a beige film-coated tablet containing 20 mg or 15 mg of cediranib.  
Patients will be administered cediranib study treatment tablets orally at a dose of 30 mg once 
daily (od).  The planned dose of 30 mg od will be made up of 2 × 15 mg tablets od.  One x 20 mg and 1 x 15 mg tablets will be used to manage dose reductions.
Dose reduction steps for cediranib:

Initial dose 30 mg daily
Dose reduction 1 20 mg daily
Dose reduction 2 15 mg daily
Olaparib
Olaparib is available as a green film-coated tablet containing 150 mg or 100 mg of olaparib.  
Patients will be administered olaparib study treatment tablets orally at a dose of 200 mg twice 
daily (bd).  The planned dose of 200 mg bd will be made up of 2 × 100 mg tablets bd.  One x 150 mg and 1 x 100 mg tablets will be used to manage dose reductions.

Assuming the study passes the fut ility assessment, the d ata cut-off for the primary analysis of 
ORR (confirmed CRs + PRs only) will take place [ADDRESS_82831] follow-
up assessments and estimate duration of response (DoR).  The primary analysis for the clinical 
study report (CSR) will be based on the confirmed ORR by [CONTACT_76378] 1.1 criteria 
and supported by [CONTACT_76379] (DoR, disease control rate [DCR] and progression free survival [PFS], time to treatment 
discontinuation or death [TDT]), patient reported outcomes (PROs), and safety and tolerability 
data.  For the primary analysis of ORR by [CONTACT_76380], along with the standard deviation and a 95% credible 
interval around the mean (based on the highest posterior density [ Lee 1997]).  ORR by [CONTACT_76381] 95% exact (Clopper Pearson) confidence intervals (95% CI).
The posterior probabilities of the ORR being larger than 15%, 20% and 24% will also be 
computed.  To further characterize the response rate, the posterior probability of showing low 
(<15%), moderate ( ≥15%- <20%), high ( ≥20%- <24%) or substantial ( ≥24%) efficacy will be 
presented.  
At the time of primary analysis, ORR and exact 95% CI (Clopper Pearson) will also be 
presented for the following:
! ORR by [CONTACT_3138]
! ORR for both confirmed and unconfirmed responses for ICR assessment
! ORR in the subgroup of patients carrying a somatic deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in either of the BRCA genes ( BRCA1 or 
BRCA2) or in predefined homologous recombination repair (HRR)-
associated genes identified with current and potential future tumor based 
BRCA or HRR gene mutation assays (ICR and Investigator assessment). 
The primary analysis of ORR, and analyses of DoR and DCR by [CONTACT_76382] (EFR) analysis set; ie, all patients who have received at least 
one dose of study treatments and have measurable disease at baseline according to the ICR of 
baseline imaging data.  All other efficacy variables (ORR, DoR, DCR based on investigator assessment; PFS, time to treatment discontinuation or death [TDT] and overall survival [OS]), 
patient reported outcome (PRO) variables and sa fety variables will be summarized using the 
Full Analysis set (FAS) comprising all patients who received at least one dose of either of the 
IPs.

32(173)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
1.1.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_76309] (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most 
common cause of cancer-related death in women with the estimated annual incidence of just 
over 200,000 individuals and approximately 125,000 deaths ( American Cancer Society 2015; 
Siegel et al 2015 ).  
Most patients with EOC present with advanced disease at diagnosis ( Cannistra 2004 ; Parmar 
et al 2003 ).  The combination of a platinum drug with a taxane is the standard of care first-line 
treatment after primary cytoreductive surgery ( du Bois et al 2003 , McGuire et al 1996 ).  
Response to the first-line treatment is achieved in more than 70% of patients whose tumors are 
optimally or sub-optimally cytoreduced ( Ozols et al 2003 ; Kang et al 2006 ).  However, of 
those who respond, 55% to 75% will relapse within 2 years of completing treatment ( Edwards 
et al 2015 ).  
A patient’s response to first-line platinum-based therapy is indicative of their response to 
second and subsequent lines of platinum-based treatment, with the length of the platinum-free interval (PFI) and the extent of relapse (site and number of tumors) being particularly 
prognostic of response.  However, most patients will develop resistance to platinum-based 
therapy over time, with decreasing length of PFI with increasing rounds of treatment.  
Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [defined as disease recurring within 6 months (182 days) 
after the last receipt of platinum based chemotherapy, Stuart et al 2011 ] has a particularly poor 
prognosis, with a low response rate (RR) to subsequent chemotherapy (< 15%), median 
progression free survival (PFS) of 3 to 4 months and overall survival (OS) of approximately 
12 months ( Davis et al 2014 ).  
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), paclitaxel, topotecan and gemcitabine, the most 
commonly used agents in the setting of ‘platinum resistance’ (Luvero et al 2014), show RRs 
ranging from 10% to 15% and duration of response (DoR) of typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] <6 months ( Markman 
et al 2000 ; Matsuo et al 2010 ).
Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76310], given the poor response to traditional cytotoxic agents.  Two potential 
therapeutic targets are DNA damage repair and angiogenesis pathways.  
1.1.2 Cediranib
Cediranib is a potent, oral once daily small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- signalling and angiogenesis that targets all 3 VEGF 
receptors (VEGFR-1,-2,-3) and has additional act ivity against stem cell factor receptor (c-kit)-
dependent tumor growth.

33(173)[IP_ADDRESS] Activity of cediranib as single agent in ovarian cancer patients
Two studies showed the activity of single agent cediranib in recurrent ovarian cancer patients, 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored studies NCI 7102 ( Matulonis et al 2009 ) and 
NCI 7129 ( Hirte et al 2015 ); both studies enrolled patients with platinum-sensitive and 
platinum-resistant disease.  Single agent cediranib has shown an objective response rate (ORR) of 17% and a median PFS of 5.2 months in patients with platinum resistant ovarian 
cancer, treated in 2
ndor 3rdline setting ( Matulonis et al 2009 ); another study in platinum 
resistant ovarian cancer patients treated in 2ndline setting, showed an ORR of 0% (0/35 
patients) and a median PFS of 3.7 months ( Hirte et al 2015 ).  Results are presented in Table 4 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Activity of cediranib in combination with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer 
patients
The ICON6 study, led by [CONTACT_76384], was a Phase III randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with  platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian 
cancer who had received one prior chemotherap y regimen.  The ICON6 study recruited 
456 women who were randomized 2:3:3 to three parallel treatment arms: in arm A (reference) 
platinum-based chemotherapy plus placebo; in arm B (concurrent), platinum-based chemotherapy plus cediranib 20 mg, followed by [CONTACT_76385]; in 
arm C (concurrent plus maintenance) platinum-based chemotherapy plus cediranib [ADDRESS_82844] four cycles were 
completed. Results are summarized in Table 1 :

OS of 26.3 months in arm C and 21 months in arm A (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.55-1.07, p=0.11). 
Diarrhea, neutropenia, hypertension, and vo ice changes were significantly more common, 
during chemotherapy with cediranib, and diarrhea, hypothyroidism and voice changes were 
more common during maintenance.

1.1.3 Olaparib 
Olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436, Lynparza™) is a potent polyadenosine 5’ diphosphoribose 
[poly (ADP ribose)] polymerization (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi; PARP-1, -2 and -3) which is 
now approved by [CONTACT_76388] ( BRCA ) mutated (as detected by [CONTACT_13247]-approved 
test) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.   
FDA approval for olaparib was based on data from Study D8180C000042 (Study 42); a 
Phase II non-comparative study in gBRCAm advanced tumors, including ovarian cancer using 
olaparib capsule formulation, 400 mg bd ( Table 2 ).

1.1.4 Activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical experience with the combination of cediranib and olaparib
To determine whether cediranib has potential to combine with olaparib, the combination 
treatment was tested in an ovarian patient derived tumor explant model.  Tumors were implanted sub-cutaneously, then selected and randomized once they were 0.2 cm
3.  Tumor 
bearing animals were treated with either monotherapy cediranib at 3 mg/kg on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule, olaparib at 100 mg/kg daily, or a combination of cediranib and olaparib.  
Treatment with both cediranib and olaparib as monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_76311], however 
the combination of the 2 agents resulted in increased anti-tumor activity with tumors not 
progressing through therapy for the duration of the study.

36(173)Potential mechanism of action for the combination
Specific mechanisms driving the clinical benefit observed with the combination of cediranib 
and olaparib are currently not defined ( Liu et al 2014 ).  However, combining cediranib and 
olaparib have potential to synergize by [CONTACT_76391]-angiogenic effect of cediranib, or preventing the tumor cell from adapting to the anti-angiogenic treatment.  Alternatively, cediranib may lower the expression of DNA da mage response genes and induce a synthetic 
“DNA damage response (DDR) phenotype” thereby [CONTACT_76392]. 
Cediranib treatment results in a change in va sculature permeability and a reduction in vessels 
(refer to the cediranib IB for more information).  This in turn may induce tumor hypoxia, 
nutrient and metabolic stress in the tumor cell compartment, specifically, the hypoxia 
mediated micro-environmental stress has potential to induce both acute DNA damage and suppression of DNA repair pathways with downregulation of homologous recombination 
genes such as BRCA1 and RAD51 and mismatch repair genes ( Bindra et al 2005 ; Bindra et al 
2007; Bristow and Hill 2008 ).  This increases the rate of background DNA damage.  An 
increase in metabolic stress as caused by [CONTACT_76393]-factors to drive DNA repair.  Subsequently the combination with olaparib 
would impair the ability of the tumor cell to tolerate this increase in background DNA 
damage.  
Other mechanisms may also contribute to the combination effect.  BRCA1 can influence the 
hypoxia response ( Kang et al 2006 ) and hence may prevent cells adapting to the reduction in 
oxygen.  Furthermore, VEGFR3 inhibition can sens itize ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy 
via downregulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( Lim et al 2014 ).  Other studies have 
demonstrated that PARP inhibition can result in some anti-angiogenic activity, with PARPi 
[INVESTIGATOR_76312] a matrigel plug assay in vivo 
(Tentori et al 2007 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for treatment with cediranib after prior exposure to bevacizumab
While bevacizumab targets VEGF-A driven act ivation of VEGFR-1 and -2, evidence is 
emerging that patients either naturally possess alternative VEGF-VEGFR angiogenesis 
pathways/features not targeted by [CONTACT_76394]/or acquire reactive resistance to 
bevacizumab following inhibition of VEGF-A.  VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D mediated activation 
of VEGFR-2 has now emerged as a potential resistance mechanism following inhibition of VEGF-A by [CONTACT_76395] ( Van der Bilt et al 2012 ).  Recent data show that VEGF-C and its 
receptor VEGFR-3 are elevated in serum and ascites fluid isolated from ovarian cancer 
patients.  VEGF-C is described as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, with patients 
presenting with high serum VEGF-C ( Cheng et al 2013 ) or high tumor expression ( Nishida et 
al 2004 ) associated with a worse prognosis.  Similar data are described for the related ligand 
VEGF-D, which also activates VEGFR-3 ( Yokoyama et al 2003a ; Yokoyama et al 2003b ). 
The selectivity and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of cediranib, which targets all 3 VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, -2, -3) activated by [CONTACT_76396] (VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D) has the potential to 
achieve consistent and comprehensive suppression of the VEGF axis for the treatment of 
ovarian cancer in patients with natural or acquired resistance to bevacizumab.

37(173)[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical experience with the combination of cediranib and olaparib
Phase I study cediranib plus olaparib capsules
A Phase I study was initially conducted to establish the recommended Phase II dosing (RP2D) 
of the cediranib plus olaparib capsule co mbination, which enrolled a total of 28 patients 
([ADDRESS_82846]).  Among the 18 evaluable ovarian patients, an overall ORR of 44% to 
the cediranib/olaparib combination was observed in this Phase I population, which included 
both gBRCAm patients and patients who did not carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious 
gBRCA mutation ( Liu et al 2013 ).  Two dose limiting toxicities (1 Grade 4 neutropenia 
≥4 days; 1 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia) occurred at the highest dose level (cediranib 30 mg 
daily; olaparib 400 mg bd).  The RP2D established in this study was cediranib 30 mg od plus 
olaparib capsules 200 mg bd.
In total, 6 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer p atients were treated across all dose levels 
investigated; the patients comprised of 3 patients who harbored gBRCAm mutations (1 patient 
with each of the following responses: confirmed partial response [PR], unconfirmed PR and 
stable disease [SD] x 8 months) and 3 patients who did not carry deleterious or suspected 
deleterious gBRCA mutations, or patients whose muta tion status was of unknown significance; 
amongst these patients, 2 had confirmed PRs and 1 patient had SD [<6 months, by [CONTACT_28474]-125 
only]).  The ORR was 50%, with a clinical benefit rate of 67%.  The median PFS was 
7.5 months, with a range of 3.3 to 20.4 months. 
Phase I study cediranib plus olaparib tablets
A Phase I study was subsequently conducted to establish the RP2D of cediranib plus olaparib 
tablets combination; the study enrolled 24 patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_12249].  Ten (42%) out of the 24 patients were known to carry a gBRCA
mutation; 13 patients were non- carriers and 1 patient had unknown BRCA status 
(Liu et al 2013).  Among 22 evaluable patients, an overall response rate of 27% was observed.  
Two of the responders were BRCA mutation non-carriers and [ADDRESS_82847] common toxicities included hypertension, diarrhea and fatigue.  The RP2D 
established for the combination were cediranib 30 mg od plus olaparib tablet 200 mg bd or 
cediranib 20 mg od plus olaparib tablet 300 mg bd.  
Phase II study
A Phase II study comparing the activity of cediranib and olaparib (capsule formulation) 
combination with olaparib alone in recurrent  platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer is ongoing 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Liu et al 2014 ).  In the full analysis set (FAS), there were 2 CRs and 20 PRs 
in patients who received olaparib monotherapy (48% ORR) and 5 CRs and 30 PRs in patients who received the combination of cediranib and olaparib (80% ORR, p = 0.002).  The 
combination of cediranib and olaparib significantly extended both PFS and ORR compared 
with olaparib alone, with a median PFS of 9.2 months for olaparib alone and 16.7 months for cediranib/olaparib (HR 0.402, 95% CI 0.217, 0.741, p = 0.0036).
A post-hoc subset analysis of PFS by [CONTACT_76397] (patients with gBRCAm vs. 
patients without gBRCAm, including patients with mutation status unknown or variants of

38(173)unknown significance [VUS]) showed that in patients who were confirmed to be gBRCAm , 
median PFS was 16.7 months on the olaparib monotherapy arm and 20.2 months on the 
cediranib/olaparib arm (HR 0.541, 95% CI 0.230, 1.26, p = 0.16).  In patients who were not gBRCAm or had a VUS, there was a marked increase in PFS from 5.8 months with olaparib 
monotherapy to 16.6 months with cediran ib/olaparib therapy (HR 0.323, 95% CI 0.139, 0.746; 
p = 0.008) and an increase in ORR from 32% to 76% (p = 0.006).  The majority of patients in both arms had received 1 or 2 previous lines of treatment (76% of patients on olaparib 
monotherapy vs. 82% of patients on cediranib/olaparib arm); it is unclear if the observed 
difference in ORR and PFS based on gBRCAm status could in part be attributable to the 
degree of prior therapy.
Overall, the cediranib/olaparib combination demonstrated a significant clinical benefit over 
olaparib alone, as measured both by [CONTACT_16625] a nd ORR.  The increased clinical benefit of the 
cediranib/olaparib combination over olaparib mo notherapy was greater in women with tumors 
that were not gBRCAm or who had a VUS status compared with women who harbored 
gBRCA1/[ADDRESS_82848] common grade 3 or 4 toxicities attributed to each of the IPs including 
fatigue (27% cediranib/olaparib vs. 11% olaparib), diarrhea (23% vs. 0%), and hypertension 
(41% vs. 0%).  There were 2 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) Grade 4 events, both in the cediranib/olaparib arm: 1 event of Grade 4 hypertension in a 
patient who was not fully compliant with blood pressure (BP) monitoring and 1 event of 
Grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Summaries of the clinical data in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer for cediranib/olaparib 
combination compared with single agent olaparib or cediranib are shown in Table 3 and

1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
Single agent olaparib has shown limited activity in patients with non-BRCAm platinum 
resistant ovarian cancer with ORR 4% (1/26) ( Gelmon et al 2011 ).  Single agent cediranib has 
shown an ORR of 17% and a median PFS of 5.2 months in patients with platinum resistant 
ovarian cancer, treated in 2ndor 3rdline setting ( Matulonis et al 2009 ); another study in 
platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients treated in 2ndline setting, showed an ORR of 0% 
(0/35 patients) and a median PFS of 3.7 months ( Hirte et al 2015 ).  
A Phase I trial of the combination of cediranib and olaparib in patients with recurrent ovarian 
cancer showed that cediranib 30 mg od in combination with olaparib tablet 200 mg bd is a 
tolerable regimen with preliminary evidence of activity in platinum resistant disease with an ORR of 29% (4/14 patients) including both BRCA mutation carriers and non-carriers 
RI

41(173)(Liu et al 2013).  Given the limited activity of single agent olaparib or cediranib in 
platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer  patients who do not carry a deleterious or 
suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation, and the synergistic effect of the combination observed 
both non-clinically and clinically, it is considered appropriate to evaluate only the
combination of olaparib/cediranib using an open-label, single arm design in this patient 
population of high unmet need for whom there are currently no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76313].   
The study thus has the limitation that the current design would not allow an assessment of the 
contribution components within this study.  However, in parallel, a Phase II/III study (NRG-GY005) is investigating in a randomized setting the activity of single agent olaparib and 
cediranib versus the combination of cediranib plus olaparib and versus standard of care non-platinum based chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer who have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_76314].
Both studies will use the previously established and recommended Phase II dose for the combination of cediranib (30 mg, oral, once daily) plus olaparib tablet 200 mg oral twice daily (Liu et al 2014 ).
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
Ovarian cancer remains a leading cause of death from gynecological cancers in the [LOCATION_002] ( American Cancer Society 2015 ) and is the fifth most common cause of cancer 
mortality in women ( Siegel et al 2015).  Recurrent platinum resistant high grade serous 
ovarian cancer accounts for most EOC deaths ( Vaughan et al 2011 ).  Effective targeted agents 
are needed that can improve prognosis with an acceptable toxicity profile without adversely 
impacting quality of life.  
The outlook for patients who de velop platinum resistant disease is poor, with a low RR to 
subsequent chemotherapy (<15%), median PFS of 3 to 4 months and OS of approximately 
12 months ( Davis et al 2014 ). 
Bevacizumab has recently been approved by [CONTACT_1622], based on the results of AURELIA trial, in combination with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD] or topotecan) for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant recurrent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76315] 
2 prior chemotherapy regimens.  In the 287 p atients with responses evaluable by [CONTACT_44852] (RECIST), the ORR was 11.8% versus 27.3% for chemotherapy and bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, respectively (p =0.001; Pujade-Lauraine 
et al 2014 ).
Olaparib is approved by [CONTACT_76399] 
≥3 prior lines of chemotherapy and are either platinum sensitive or platinum resistant.

42(173)However, patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer who do not carry a del eterious or 
suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation and who have received ≥3 prior chemotherapy 
regimens, including prior anti-angiogenic therapy (eg, bevacizumab), do not have effective 
therapeutic options currently available and there remains a high unmet need for new effective 
targeted agents for this population.  Moreover, efficacy rapi[INVESTIGATOR_76316], as per National Comprehensive Cancer network (NCCN) guidelines ( NCCN guidelines ), palliation should be 
considered after failure of 2 lines of treatment.  Available data demonstrate that the combination of cediranib/olaparib has the po tential to provide clinical benefit in this group of 
patients, with toxicities being consistent w ith expected class-related toxicities of these drugs 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
Patients who have progressed on prior anti-angiogenic therapy (eg, bevacizumab) have been reported to have an increase in alternate VEGF ligands suggesting that a more comprehensive 
inhibition of VEGF signaling as offered by [CONTACT_76400] ( Lieu et 
al 2013 ).  Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need for effective treatment options with 
an alternative anti-angiogenic treatment for patients at their relapse on bevacizumab.  
On balance, therefore the benefit/risk for the combination of cediranib plus olaparib in heavily 
pre-treated patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients who do not carry a deleterious or susp ected deleterious gBRCA mutation, for whom only palliative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76317], is considered favorable. 
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), applicable regulatory requirements and the [COMPANY_008] 
policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples.

All patients will be required to provide an archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample from the primary or preferably recurre nt cancer.  If an archival tumor sample is 
not available, a tumor sample from a fresh biopsy is acceptable.  Please note that a lesion that 
has been biopsied during screening cannot be selected as a target lesion for RECIST 
assessment.  Tumor samples will be tested for somatic (ie, non-germline) deleterious or 
suspected deleterious mutation in either of the BRCA genes ( BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) and the 
following homologous recombination repair (HRR)-associated genes: ATM, BRIP1, PALB2, 
RAD51C, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51D, and

Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered 
pre-study screening.
The Investigator(s) will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient or their guardian/legal 
representative before any study specific procedures are performed.  
2. Assign potential patient a unique enrollment number, beginning with ‘E#’ through 
the Interactive Response Technology system.  This numbe r is the patient’s unique 
identifier and is used to identify the patient on the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs). 
3. Determine patient eligibility. See Section 3.
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then her enrollment code cannot be 
reused.
This is an open-label study; there is  no randomization.

Absorption of oral contraceptives can be impaired in case of GI symptoms such as diarrhea 
>24 hours or vomiting.  In addition, the possibility that cediranib may induce GI CYP3A and 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT) enzymes cannot be excluded and the 
efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co administered with cediranib.  
Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use two highly effective forms of 
contraception (see Appendix J) during study treatment and for at least 6 weeks after 
discontinuation of study treatment and to perform pregnancy tests as required (see Sections 
[IP_ADDRESS], 6.6.1).  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant during the study 
conduct, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Breast-feeding is 
contraindicated whilst receiving IPs.
Restrictions related to pregnancy are provided in Section 6.6.  Restrictions related to 
concomitant medications (including medications metabolized via CYP3A4/5 or 
P glycoprotein (PgP)/UGT; anticoagulant therapy; anti-emetics/anti-diarrheal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
palliative RT and administration of other anti-cancer agents) are described in Section 7.7and 
Appendix I.  
Patients may not use any complementary or al ternative medicines including natural herbal 
products or folk remedies as they may interfere with the effectiveness of the IPs.It is prohibited to consume grapefruit juice while on olaparib therapy.

Patients may be discontinued from IPs in the following situations:
! Patient decision; the patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, 
without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient who discontinues 
treatment is normally expected to con tinue to participate in the study 
unless she specifically withdraws her consent to further participation in any study procedures and assessments (see Section 3.10.1).
! Adverse Event (AE), including AEs that meet criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section 6.7; any AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_76320], 
contraindicates further dosing.
! Objective progression according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria.

At any time, patients are free to discontinue IPs (ie, both cediranib and olaparib treatments) or 
withdraw from the study (ie, both cediranib a nd olaparib treatments and assessments) without 
prejudice to further treatment.  If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10.
A patient that decides to discontinue the IPs will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_39595](s).  AEs 
will be followed up (see Section 6) and all study drugs should be returned by [CONTACT_102].
By [CONTACT_76405], the patient is not withdrawing from the study.  Any patient

treatments required at the time of discontinuation.  
Any patient who has not yet shown objective radiological disease progression at 
discontinuation from cediranib and olaparib tre atments should continue to be followed as per 
RECIST as detailed in Section 4(ie, patients should be followed for progression by [CONTACT_76406] 8 weeks).  Following objective radiological progression, patients should also be followed for survival as detailed in Section 5.1.4.
After discontinuation of the IPs at any point in the study, all ongoing AEs or serious adverse 
events (SAEs) must be followed until resolution unless, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_76322], or the patient is lost to 
follow up (see Section 6.3.2 ) or until the patient starts new anti-cancer treatment.  All new

Reasons for withdrawal from the study:
! Voluntary withdrawal* by [CONTACT_76407], without prejudice to further treatment.
! Incorrectly enrolled patients ie, the patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study (please refer to Section 3.4).
! Patient lost to follow-up.
! Death.
*If a patient withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent to continue further treatment with study medication:

or blood) Data obtained prior to withdrawal of consent will be maintained 
in the clinical database and used in the study reporting (see Section 
5.7.6 ).
3.10.1 Withdrawal of the informed consent 
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IPs and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs.  The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then her enrollment code cannot be 
reused.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
If the patient is lost to follow-up, the Investigator should make every reasonable effort to 
contact [CONTACT_76409] a responsible relative.  Patients will be considered lost to follow-up only 
if no contact [CONTACT_76410]-off for the primary analysis, such 
that there is insufficient information to determine the patient’s status at that time.  Patients who refuse to continue participation in the study, including telephone contact, should be 
documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather th an “lost to follow-up.”  Investigators should 
document attempts to re-establis h contact [CONTACT_76411].  
If contact [CONTACT_4490] a missing patient is re-established, the patient should not be considered lost to follow-up and any evaluations shoul d resume according to the protocol.
3.10.[ADDRESS_82871] to follow up patients
At the time of primary analysis, the survival status of all patients in the full analysis set should 
be re-checked, this includes those patients who withdrew consent or are classified as “lost to 
follow up.”
!Lost to Follow up – site personnel should check hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], the patients’ current 
physician, and a publicly available death registry (if available) to obtain a current survival status in the 2 weeks following data cut-off. (The SURVIVE module will be updated.)
!In the event that the patient has actively withdrawn consent to the processing of their personal data, the survival status of the patient can be obtained by [CONTACT_76412] (if available) where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws to obtain a current survival status in the 2 weeks following 
data cut-off. (The SURVIVE module will be updated.)
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgement of [COMPANY_008], trial patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that are not considered to be consistent 
with continuation of the study, or if the futility boundary is met at the Interim Analysis.

65(173)4.1 Screening/Enrollment period
Prior to inclusion into the study, patients w ill undergo screening.  All patients must sign the 
Informed Consent Form and if applicable, any locally required privacy act document 
authorization must also be obtained prior to the start of any screening procedures.  All 
screening procedures must be performed within 28 days before dosing (Day -28 to Day -1).
Consenting patients are assessed (Table 5 ) to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria and to 
discontinue other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], if required (Section 3.1, Section 3.4). Patients who do not meet 
these criteria must not be entered into the study. 
All patients agree to provide a sample of their archival FFPE tumor sample (or approximately 
20 unstained sections mounted on glass slides  prepared from the block) from the primary or 
recurrent cancer for entry into this study, and a blood sample which may be used for a 
subsequent confirmatory BRCA mutation test using the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx®test.  If 
archival tumor sample is not available tumor sample from fresh biopsy is acceptable.
4.2 Treatment period
Descriptions of the procedures for this period are included in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 5 ) with exceptions of the following specific requirements for the treatment period: 
The Study conduct period starts at the time of admin istration of the first dose of IPs (cediranib 
plus olaparib).  There is no maximum duration for taking IPs in this study.
While on study treatment, patients will be required to attend study visits every week during 
the first 4 weeks, every 2 weeks during the next 4 weeks and every 4 weeks (± 3 days) 
thereafter.  RECIST assessments will be pe rformed every 8 weeks (±1 week) after first doses 
of IPs until disease progression.  Patients will continue the study treatments until:
∀objective radiological disease progression, as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 guidelines, 
∀unacceptable toxicity or
∀discontinuation of IPs for other reasons (patient withdrawal of consent, physician discretion; see Section 3.9, Section 3.10 and Section 3.11).
∀Severe non-compliance with the protocol.
4.3 Follow-up period
If both study treatments are discontinued, patie nts should undergo the assessments required at 
the discontinuation visit (see Table 5 ), whether or not radiological disease progression has 
occurred.  A safety follow-up visi t should be condu cted 30 days after the discontinuation visit.  
Any serious and/or non-serious AEs ongoing at this time should be followed-up to resolution or until, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the cond ition is unlikely to improve or resolve due to

66(173)the patient’s underlying disease.  Descriptions of the procedures for the follow-up visit are 
included in the Schedule of Assessment ( Table 5 ).
Assessments in the post study treatments follow-up period (following discontinuation of IPs), depend on whether a patient discontinues study treatments in the presence or absence ofradiological disease progression.
4.3.1 Discontinu ation of study treatments due to disease progression
If a patient discontinues IPs because of radiol ogical disease progression, she will be followed 
up for survival every 8 weeks (relative to first dose).  Survival information may be obtained 
via telephone contact [CONTACT_10970], patient’s family or by [CONTACT_76416]’s current 
physician. 
4.3.[ADDRESS_82884] 
assessments for disease progression should continue to be performed every 8 weeks (±1 week) 
until radiological disease progression or withdra wal of consent.  Once a patient has 
radiological disease progression, she will be followed up as described in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_82885] scheduled visit prior to 
data cut-off for the primary analysis.  Beyond the FPV, patients may continue to receive 
cediranib and/or olaparib if th ey are deriving clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
and not fulfilling any discontinuation criteria.  
Beyond the FPV, patients continuing to receive IPs are to be treated as described in 
Section 4.5. 
4.5 End of study
The end of the study is defined as ‘the last visit of the last patient undergoing the study’ (ie, 
last subject last visit [LSLV]) or when the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.  
There will be a primary data cut-off defined at approximately 8 months (LSLV) after the last 
patient received her first dose of study treatment.   This primary data cut-off will be followed 
by [CONTACT_76420].  The primary data 
analysis will be performed and a Clinical Study Re port (CSR) written based on this data set.

67(173)Patients who continue to receive clinical benef it without meeting any discontinuation criteria 
during the study, will complete a FPV which will occur at their last scheduled visit prior to 
primary data cut-off.  Beyond the FPV, patients may continue to receive cediranib and/or 
olaparib (to be provided by [CONTACT_1034]), if they are deriving clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], and not fulfilling any discontinuation criteria.  
Such patients are to be followed in accordance with the Medical Standard of Care and as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_32366].  Seri ous adverse event reporting (on paper) will 
continue to ensure safety data collection and monitoring of the patients while receiving the 
investigational product.  It is recommended th at investigators continue to observe ongoing 
patients at the frequency employed prior to the FPV.  Protocol dose modification and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76324] a patient is receiving cediranib and/or olaparib.  Restrictions 
regarding concomitant medications (Section 7.7) must be followed while the patient is 
receiving cediranib and/or olaparib.  A change in the dose/schedule of cediranib and/or 
olaparib should only occur for safety reas ons, based on the Investigator’s judgement, and 
should generally follow the approach for dose reduction and discontinuation as described in this protocol.  Combining cediranib and/or olaparib with other anti-cancer therapy is not allowed. 
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a patient is no longer receiving clinical benefit from the 
IPs beyond the FPV, then the IPs will be stopped.  The Investigator will inform [COMPANY_008] when a patient discontinues the IPs.  Patients must return unused medication during routine 
clinic visits; drug accountability information must continue to be collected in patient source 
documents until the patient discontinues treatment.   Patients will continue to be monitored for 
all SAEs and pregnancies while receiving IPs and for [ADDRESS_82886] Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection.  The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol 
and in accordance with the eCRF completion guidelines.
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded in the 
eCRF and the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA).  The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs 
will be archived at the study site.

Radiological examinations performed in the condu ct of this study should be retained at site as 
source data.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_76325] (CRO) for ICR (see 
Section 5.1.3 ).
All treatment decisions will be based on Investigator assessment of scans.  All patients will 
have RECIST 1.1 tumor assessments at screening (within [ADDRESS_82889] 
dose of IPs) and thereafter every 8 weeks (±1 week) relative to the date of first dose of IPs 
(Table 5 ) until objective radi ological disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and as 
determined by [CONTACT_737], or unless they withdraw consent.  Objective radiological 
response on treatment (CR or PR) will need to be confirmed during next RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_82890] 1.1 assessments should continue as per protocol schedule until evidence of 
objective radiological progression or withdrawal of consent (see Section 4.3).
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  If scans are 
performed outside of scheduled visit (±1 week window) and the patient has not progressed, 
every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent scans at their scheduled time points.
5.1.[ADDRESS_82891] 1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions (N TLs) and the objective tumor response criteria 
(CR, PR, SD or PD) are presented in Appendix F.
Categorization of objective tumor response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 
criteria of response: CR, PR, SD or PD.  Target lesion progression will be calculated in 
comparison with when the tumor burden was at a minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters 
previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, tumor response (CR, PR, or SD) will be calculated in comparison with the baseline tumor measurements obtained before 
starting treatment.  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the 
tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST 1.1 criteria.  For this study, a rise in CA-125 al one is not sufficient to declare 
progression, and progression events should be determined by [CONTACT_76421].
If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly with 
response to NTLs or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment until

status.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared 
as the date of progression.
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of non -target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.

symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiti ng); a 2-item global HRQoL scale; 5 single 
items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by [CONTACT_76428] (dyspnea, loss of 
appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea) a nd [ADDRESS_82902] of the disease.
The QLQ-OV28 is a module which is sp ecific for ovarian cancer.  It consists of 28 items 
assessing abdominal/GI symptoms (6 items), peripheral neuropathy (2 items), other chemotherapy side effects (5 items), hormonal symptoms (2 items), body image (2 items), 
attitudes to disease/treatment (3 items), sexuality (4 items), and four other single items.
[IP_ADDRESS] PRO-CTCAE
The Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (PRO-CTCAE) system has been devel oped by [CONTACT_6812].  PRO-CTCAE is an item-bank 
of symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_76429].  It was developed in recognition that collecting symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based 
on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate 
symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009 ; 
Basch et al 2014 ; Litwin et al 1999 ; Sprangers and Aaronson 1992 ).  To date, 81 symptoms of 
the CTCAE (version 4) have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term “myalgia” converted to “aching muscles”). For several symptoms, like fatigue and pain, additional questions are asked 
about symptom frequency, severity, and interference with usual activities.  For other 
symptoms like rash, additional questions focus on the presence on the body.  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and 
patients.  These items and the additional quest ions for some of the symptoms have been 
extensively evaluated by [CONTACT_76428], using cognitive testing methods, to be clear, 
comprehendible, and measure the symptom of inte rest.  Not all items are administered in any 
one clinical trial. The intention is to only ask patients to complete those items which are 
considered relevant for the trial, site of cancer, and cancer treatment (see Appendix K).  The following 6 PRO-CTCAE AEs will be collected in the study: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
decreased appetite, fatigue, and dizziness. In addition to these items from the PRO-CTCAE 
item bank, the following additional item will be asked together with the PRO-CTCAE items: 
"In the last 7 days, how much did LOOSE OR WATERY STOOLS (DIARRHEA) 
INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities?" 
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration of PRO questionnaires
Patients will complete the PRO assessments at home and at site using the same handheld 
electronic device (ePRO).
All assessments should be completed according to the following parameters:
! Without assistance from site staff or anyone else according to the 
assessment schedule (see Table 5 )

75(173)! Before any other study procedures are conducted at a given visit
! Before being seen by a study nurse or physician
Each center must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePROs to a specific 
individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person 
to cover if that individual is absent.  Subjects  may complete some of the ePROs at study sites 
if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; ot herwise, subjects may 
complete the ePROs at home.  Similarly, during the post-progression period, subjects should complete ePROs at home or at the study site if a scheduled visit coincides with the time point.  
If subjects have had scans or other tests at an outside fa cility or missed a scheduled data 
collection site visit, ePROs should st ill be completed by [CONTACT_76430].
The Investigator will arrange for relevant training in the set-up of the electronic device and 
training patients in how to self-administer the questionnaires using the electronic device. 
Subjects should complete the questionnaires in accordance with the study schedule (see Table 5 ). 
The significance and relevance of the data should be explained carefully to participating 
subjects so that they are motivated to comply with data collection.  Reminders should be sent 
to subjects at home as needed to ensure  compliance with the assessment schedules.
The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO data via an 
electronic device:
! PRO questionnaires must be completed prior to any other study 
procedures (following informed consent) and before discussion of disease 
progression to avoid bias in patient’s responses to the questions.
! When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order for 
completion should be ensured: EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-OV28, PRO-CTCAE.
! PRO questionnaires must be completed by [CONTACT_76431].
! The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to subject the value and relevance of study participation and inform them that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel.  The research nurse or appointed site staff should also stress that the 
information is confidential.  Therefore, if the subjects have any medical 
problems, they should discuss them wi th the doctor or research nurse 
separately from the ePRO assessment.
! The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the subject on how to use the ePRO device, using the materials and training provided by [CONTACT_941]

! The research nurse or appointed site staff should remind subjects that there are no right or wrong answers.
! The research nurse or appointed staff must avoid clarifying items in order to avoid bias.
! The subject must not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to 
answer the PRO questionnaires.  If a subject uses visual aids (eg, 
spectacles or contact [CONTACT_13276]) for reading and does not have them when he attends the clinic, the subject will be exempted from completing the 
PROs.  
! Site staff must not read or complete the PRO questionnaires on behalf of 
the subject.  If the subject is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind 
or illiterate), that subject is exempted from completing PRO 
questionnaires and may still participate in the study.  Subjects exempted

disease recurrence. 
5.7.2 Collection of biomarkers biological samples
Biological samples (archived tumor samples and blood sa mples) will be collected only from 
patients who are eligible to start study treatment and will be analyzed for exploratory 
biomarkers to assess correlations with diseas e activity, effects of study drug, clinical outcomes 
and toxicity:
! Mandatory: Archival tumor sample or fresh tumor biopsy
∀FFPE tumor sample from the primary or recurrent cancer must be available for 
central testing (or approximately 20 unstain ed sections mounted on glass slides 
prepared from the block).  If there is not written confirmation of the availability of an archival tumor sample prior to enrollment, or if the patient does not consent 
to donating a fresh tumor biopsy sample (if an archival sample is unavailable), 
the patient is not eligible for the study.  The tumor samples will be collected and will be analyzed for somatic deleterious or suspected deleterious variants in 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, and the following HRR-associated genes: ATM, BRIP1, 
PALB2, RAD51C, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PPP2R2A,

Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 y ears from the date of LSLV (ie, approximately 
[ADDRESS_82905] dose of IP) after which they will be destroyed.  The results of this biomarker res earch will be reported either in the CSR itself or 
as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication.  The results of this biomarker research may be pooled with biomarker data from other studies with the study drug to generate hypotheses to be tested in future research.
5.7.4 Labelling and shipment of biological samples
The Investigator ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance with the 
Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), 
see Appendix C ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.
Any samples identified as Infectious Cate gory A materials are not shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the patient unless agreed with [COMPANY_008] and appropriate 
labelling, shipment and containment provisions are approved.
5.7.5 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Investigator at each center keeps full traceability  of collected biological samples from the 
patients while in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where appropriate).The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
[COMPANY_008] keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of 
study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers. 
Samples retained for further use are registered in the [COMPANY_008] Biobank system during the 
entire life cycle.
5.7.6 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated  biological samples, the samples will be 
disposed of/destroyed, and the action docu mented.  If samples are already analyzed ,
[COMPANY_008] is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.

are an integral part of the study (ie, the ar chival tumor sample or the mandatory biomarker 
blood samples), further study participation can be continued, if the patient is already receiving 
treatment with IPs.  
The PI:
! Ensures patients’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to [COMPANY_008]
! Ensures that biological samples from that patient, if stored at the study site, are immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented
! Ensures the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed, the 
action documented and the signed document returned to the study site
! Ensures that the patient and [COMPANY_008] are informed about the sample disposal.
[COMPANY_008] ensures the central laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed and the action 
documented and returned to the study site.
5.8 Biological sampling procedures
5.8.1 Volume of blood
The volume of blood that will be drawn from each patient will vary, dependent upon the 
length of time that the patient remains in the trial.  However, the volume of blood to be drawn 
from each patient (including for PK samples) during screening and up to and including Week 
8 should not exceed 154 mL, according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidance ( NIH 
guidance 2009 ).
The total volume of blood to be drawn from each patient in the study, assuming they complete 
screening, 48 weeks of treatment, a treatment discontinuation visit and the 30-day follow-up visit, should not exceed 335 mL.
The procedures for the collection, handling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_76327].
Safety laboratory assessments will be performed locally by [CONTACT_76436].  The number of samples/blood volumes is therefore subject to site-specific change. 
Extra blood samples may also be collected if, for example, additional samples are required for 
repeat safety assessments.

83(173)6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_76328].
6.[ADDRESS_82906].  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laborat ory findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or 
washout periods, even if no IPs have been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
6.1.[ADDRESS_82907] (AESIs) are events of scientific and medical interest specific 
to the further understanding of the safety profiles of cediranib and olaparib; AESIs require 
close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_3433] e investigators to [COMPANY_008].  An AESI 
may be serious or non-serious.  
! AESIs for cediranib are the Important Identified Risks: PRES, arterial 
thromboembolic events, and the Important Potential Risks: symptomatic 
left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac failure; nephrotic syndrome; renal 
thrombotic microangiopathy and liver failure.
! AESIs for olaparib are the Important Potential Risks of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
! Results in death (NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event)
! Is immediately life-threatening (NOTE: the term “Life-Threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe)
! Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]

84(173)! Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
! Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may 
require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B to the Clinical Study 
Protocol.  The full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to.
6.[ADDRESS_82908] dose of IPs and the end of th e 30-day follow-up period.  All ongoing and any 
new AEs/SAEs identified during the [ADDRESS_82909] additional information for any patient 
with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
6.3.[ADDRESS_82910], any case of MDS/AML or new primary malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety whether 
it is considered a non-serious AE (eg, non-melanoma skin cancer) or SAE, and 
regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality.  These AEs must be reported 
according to the timelines for reporting an SAE (see Section 6.4).  Investigators 
will be asked during the regular follow up for OS if the patient has developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any such cases.  A questionnaire will be sent to any investigator reporting MDS/AML, 
pneumonitis, or new primary malignancy as an aid to provide detailed information 
on the case.
At any time after a patient has completed the study, if an Investigator learns of 
any SAE or death, unrelated to SAEs of special interest, and he/she considers 
there is a reasonable possibility that the ev ent is causally related to the IPs, the 
Investigator should notify [COMPANY_008], Patient Safety.

86(173)The following variables will also be collected for deaths:
! Probable cause of death
! Date of death
! Autopsy performed
! Causality assessment in relation to IPs and/or Study procedure(s).
Investigators are also required to complete targeted safety questionnaires should any of the 
following events be reported:  MDS/AML, new primary malignancy or pneumonitis. 
The grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be utilized for all events with 
an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades the 
recommendation is that the CTCAE criteria that convert mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.
A copy of NCI CTCAE version 4.03 is available at 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf.
Adverse events not listed by [CONTACT_30828] 4.03 will be graded using the following criteria:
Intensity rating scale:1 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)2 moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
3 severe (incapacitating, with inab ility to perform normal activities)
Alternative intensity rating scale for in-patients:
4 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
5 moderate (disturbing but still tolerable)
6 severe (intolerable).It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.

87(173)6.3.5 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between each IP and each AE, and answer 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘ Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_76437]? ’
Causality assessment for all AEs must be clearly assigned for each IP.  Causal relationship will also be assessed for other (ie, other than one of study IPs) medication and study 
procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B to the Clinical 
Study Protocol.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_76438]: ‘ Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked ?’, or revealed by [CONTACT_76439].  When collecting AEs, the rec ording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms; for example, for vomiting, nausea, fever, please 
consider providing diagnosis if available, as 1 AE of ‘gastroenteritis’ if appropriate, instead of 
3 separate AEs.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that 
are not generally part of the diagnosis, th e diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
6.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration as compared with baselin e in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital 
signs and ECG abnormalities should only be reported as AEs or SAEs if one of the following 
is met:
! Any criterion for an AE or SAE is fulfilled
! Causes discontinuation of IPs
! Causes IP interruption
! Causes IP dose reduction
! The abnormality is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_76440] a laboratory value/vital sign is  associated with clini cal signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low Hb value).  In the

88(173)absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters (ie, those not described in Table 5 ) should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a baseline laboratory value or condition, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.8 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases 
in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
6.3.9 Disease progression
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IPs are being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the 
disease under study and/or increases in th e signs and symptoms of the cancer.  The 
development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study 
should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events, which are unequivocally 
due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study.
6.3.10 New cancers
The development of a new primary cancer (including skin cancer) should be regarded as an 
AE and will generally meet at least one of the SAE criteria (see Section 6.2).  New primary 
cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the IPs and have 
developed after the inclusion of the patient into  the study.  They do not include metastases of 
the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as 
an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression.

comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory cause s of death.  This information can be 
captured in the ‘death eCRF’.
Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.  A post mortem maybe helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to Ast raZeneca within the usual timeframes.

For patients who continue to receive clinical benefit and IP after data cut-off, investigators 
will continue to report all SAEs to [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety until 30 days after study 
treatment is discontinued (Section 6.3.1 ).  As the clinical study database will have closed, 
investigators should complete paper SAE forms and fax them directly to the [COMPANY_008] 
Patient Safety Data Entry site for entering onto the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety database.  Drug 
accountability s hould conti nue to be performed until the patient stops study treatment 
completely.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators, or other site personnel, 
inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] represen tatives within one day ie, immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756].

these higher dose levels the cediranib safety profile was similar to that observed at lower dose 
levels of 20 mg.  In cases of suspected overdose, cediranib should be paused, BP monitored 
and if needed, supportive care instituted.  There is no specific treatment for cediranib overdose.  At the discretion of the Investigator, re-starting cediranib at the recommended dose 
can be considered.
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose with olaparib and possible 
symptoms of overdose are not established.  In the event of an overdose, physicians should 
follow general supportive measures and AEs associated with overdose should be treated 
symptomatically.  Any dose, or frequency of dosing, that exceeds the dose regimen specified in the study protocol should be reported as an overdose.  The maximum tolerated dose is 
300 mg bd for the tablet formulation.
! An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE 
diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant  AE eCRF, including the Overdose 
section of the eCRF.
! An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose section of the eCRF.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_82914] occur within 30 days.

hormonal contraceptives ma y be reduced if co-administered with cediranib (see Section 3.8); 
therefore, an additional non- hormonal contraceptive method should be used during treatment 
(see Appendix J) and pregnancy tests performed as required per SOA See Table 5).  Should a pregnancy still occur, the IPs should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy reported 
to [COMPANY_008]. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_76330] e ffectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous  miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose of study medication until [ADDRESS_82916] udy, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZen eca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 
5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
The PREGREP module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the PREGOUT is 
used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
6.7 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study drug that either causes harm to the Patient or 
has the potential to cause harm to the Patient. 
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or Patient.
Medication error includes situations where an error: 
! occurred
! was identified and intercepted before the patient received the drug

Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
! Drug name [CONTACT_2976]
! Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the subject
! Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration
! Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet 
! Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature 
! Wrong subject received the medication (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
! Wrong drug administered to subject (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies:
! Errors related to or resulting from IVRS/IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
! Subject accidentally missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
! Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
! Subject failed to return unused medication or empty packaging
! Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in open label studi es, even if an AZ product 
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.  
If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day ie, immediately 
but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.

[IP_ADDRESS] Use of hematopoietic agents
Use erythropoi etin-stimulating agents per standard of care National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) and/or institutional guidelines, iron supplements, and/or transfusions as 
clinically indicated for management of anemia.  Prescribing information for the eryth ropoiesis 
stimulating agents (including Aranesp, Epogen and Procrit) highlight that there is a potential risk of shortening the time to tumor progression or disease-free survival.  Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is not recommended (Mountzios et al 
2016).  They do not alleviate fatigue or increase energy.  They should not be used in patients 
with uncontrolled hypertension.  The package inserts should be consulted.
If a patient develops febrile neutropenia, IPs should be stopped and appropriate management 
including G-CSF should be given according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799].  Please note that 
G-CSF should not be used within at least [ADDRESS_82917] dose of olaparib unless absolutely necessary.
Platelet transfusions, if indicated, should be done according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799].
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity
Patients who have IPs held for hematologic toxicities should have blood counts and 
differentials checked at least weekly until recovery; these data should be recorded in eCRF as extra laboratory examinations.  If counts do not improve to CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_82918] for further 
assessment.  A bone marrow analysis should be considered per hematology assessment. 
For AEs that are unrelated to the study drug, study  drug may be withheld for up to 3 weeks at 
the discretion of the treating Investigator.  Management of anemia
Anemia is a common adverse drug reaction related to olaparib.  Cediranib is not reported to 
increase the risk of anemia.  Management of anemia is in accordance with Table 10:

management of anemia may require blood transfusions.  Any subsequently required dose interruptions, related to development of an emia, or coexistent with newly developed 
neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia, will require olaparib dose reductions to [ADDRESS_82920] step and to 100 mg twice daily as a second step. 
If Hb drops to < 8 g/dL despi[INVESTIGATOR_76331], olaparib should 
be permanently discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension
Only doses of cediranib will be modified for hypertension; olaparib doses will not be reduced 
unless other toxicities are experienced. 
In clinical trials, increases in BP have been reported within a few hours of starting cediranib.  
Since rapid changes in blood pressure can occur with cediranib treatment, with the potential 
for life-threatening complications if hypertension is not appropriately managed, all patients should check their BP twice daily for at least the first [ADDRESS_82923] udy visits: weekly during the first [ADDRESS_82924] up to 4 drugs for management of hype rtension prior to any dose reduction in 
cediranib.
If patients require a delay of > [ADDRESS_82925] or 
more intensive therapy.  Pre-existing cardiov ascular risks should be assessed and managed, 
and pre-existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting treatment with 
cediranib.  Note: Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76334] a decrease in 
BP.  The treating physician should monitor the patient for hypotension and adjust the number 
and dose of antihypertensive medications accordingly.

[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea
Diarrhea is often observed with cediranib.  Diarrhea usually starts early (within the first 
4 weeks of treatment), however, it can occur at any time during treatment.  Management of 
diarrhea should start at the first sign of diarrhea. Loperamide and advice on how to manage 
diarrhea should be readily available to patients from the start of cediranib treatment so that they can be applied at first epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337].  Active and early management of diarrhea is 
recommended even with Grade 1 diarrhea.  Management is as shown in Table 13 :

[IP_ADDRESS] Fatigue
Fatigue is a common adverse drug reaction reported for both cediranib and olaparib.  Fatigue 
experienced by [CONTACT_76443].  During clinic visits, patients 
fatigue levels should be discussed.  Patients should seek medical advice early if Grade 2 fatigue develops (moderate fatigue causing di fficulty performing some activities of daily 
living).
Care should be taken to ensure that the nutritional status of the patients is optimized and 
patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. Patients should be encouraged to 
manage fatigue by [CONTACT_76444], which may improve the symptoms in some cases.
Consideration should be given to other possible causes of fatigue (eg, thyroid function, 
depression/insomnia and other concomitant medicinal products).  Additionally, short 
interruption of cedir anib dosing (initially 2-3 days-or longer-up to a maximum of 21 days) 
may help relieve fatigue.  When symptoms improve cediranib should be restarted with the 
same dose or, if necessary, a dose reduction can be considered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Proteinuria
Proteinuria is a common adverse reaction reported for cediranib and if this occurs during 
treatment, it should be managed according to Table 14.  For management of suspected cases

[IP_ADDRESS] Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been uncommonly reported in 
clinical studies with cediranib.  PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with 
headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances, and can be fatal. Mild to severe hypertension may be present.  In patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_14493], 
treatment of specific symptoms including control of BP is recommended. Confirmation of 
PRES requires brain imaging, preferably MRI.  Cediranib should be discontinued following confirmation of PRES.  The safety of reinitiati ng cediranib in patients previously experiencing 
PRES is not known.
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal perforation
GI perforation has been uncommonly reported in ced iranib treated patients and may be fatal.  
Cediranib should be used with caution in patients at risk and permanently discontinued in 
patients who develop GI perforation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Fistula
In patients treated with cediranib, fistula has been reported and reflected the location of the 
underling malignancy.  In the ovarian cancer population, vaginal fistula has been uncommonly 
reported in cediranib treated patients.  Cediranib should be used with caution in patients at risk 
of fistula and discontinuation of cediranib should be considered in patients who develop fistulae.
[IP_ADDRESS] Arterial thromboembolism

thrombotic events.  Cediranib should be permanen tly discontinued in patients who develop an 
arterial thromboembolic event. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Venous thromboembolism
Venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis 
have been commonly reported in patients treated with cediranib.  Anticoagulant treatment 
should be started in accordance with clinical practice.  Discontinuation of cediranib may be considered.  Cediranib should be used with caution in patients at risk of venous 
thromboembolism.
[IP_ADDRESS] Wound healing
Treatment with cediranib should be stopped at least [ADDRESS_82932] been conducted; however, in 
the ICON6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_76340].
[IP_ADDRESS] Elderly
There is a limited amount of safety data available for cediranib use in patients aged [ADDRESS_82933] on exposure or variability. Caution should be taken when treating patients who are aged 75 years or older with cediranib. 
In case of toxicity dose pause or dose reduction may be considered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Mild/moderate renally impaired patients
Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment discontinued cediranib more often due to 
adverse events, particularly when cediranib was co-administered with chemotherapy.  Population PK analysis showed that no adjustment of cediranib dose is required in this 
population as cediranib is minimally renally cleared; however, cediranib clearance may be 
decreased in patients with low body weight.  In the ICON6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], patients with mild or moderate impairment had lower median body w eight compared with patients with normal 
renal function.  Caution shoul d be exercised in patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment and a cediranib dose adjustment should be considered in case of signs of toxicity.  
For information on use of olaparib in renally-impaired patients, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS]
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight decreased  
In the ICON6 study, weight decreased was very commonly reported in cediranib treated 
patients.  Weight loss ( ≥7%) in cediranib-treated patients was associated with higher incidence 
of decreased appetite, vomiting and stomatitis, although these events were also commonly 
reported in patients who did not lose weight.

108(173)6.8.4 Management of olaparib associated toxicity
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of MDS/AML
Patients who develop MDS/AML on treatment should be discontinued from olaparib 
treatment and managed appropriately.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of olparib-related new or worsening pulmonary symptoms 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (eg, dyspnea) or radiological abnormalities occur 
in the absence of a clear diagnosis, an interruption in 1 or both IPs dosing is recommended 
and further diagnostic workup (including a HRCT scan) should be performed to exclude 
pneumonitis.
Following investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and 
symptoms resolve, then IP(s) can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].  If 
significant pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be discussed with the Study Physician.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of nausea and vomiting
Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with olaparib treatment.  In study 
D0810C00019 nausea was reported in 71% of the olaparib treated patients and 36% in the 
placebo treated patients and vomiting was reported in 34% of the olaparib treated patients and 14% in the placebo treated patients.  These events are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE 
Grade 1 or 2) severity, intermittent and manageable on continued treatment.  The first onset 
generally occurs in the first month of treatment for nausea and within the first [ADDRESS_82934] onset of nausea 
or vomiting and as required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines.  
Taking olaparib tablets with food may help alleviate symptoms of nausea and vomiting.
As per international guidance on anti-emetic use in cancer patients (European Society for 
Medical Oncology [ESMO], NCCN), generally a single agent antiemetic should be considered 
eg, dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines or dexamethasone.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of renal impairment
If subsequent to study entry and while still on study treatments, a patient’s estimated 
creatinine clearance (CrCL) falls below the threshold for study inclusion (<50 mL/min), retesting should be performed promptly.  A dose reduction of olaparib is recommended for 
patients who develop moderate renal impairment (calculated CrCL by [CONTACT_3158]-Gault 
equation of ≥31 mL/min and ≤50 mL/min) for any reason during the course of the study: the 
dose of olaparib should be reduced to 150 mg bd.

109(173)Because the CrCL determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where the 
CrCL falls to between 31 mL/minutes and 50 mL/minutes, the Investigator should use his or 
her discretion in determining whether a dose change or discontinuation of therapy is 
warranted.
Olaparib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment 
(CrCL≤30 mL/minutes) or end-stage renal disease; if patients develop severe impairment or 
end stage disease is it recommended that olaparib be discontinued.  For information on use of 
cediranib in renally-impaired patients, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
6.8.5 Interruptions for intercurrent non-toxicity related events
IP(s) dose interruption for conditions other than t oxicity resolution should be kept as short as 
possible.  If a patient cannot restart IP(s) within 3 weeks for resolution of intercurrent 
conditions not related to disease progression or tox icity, the case should be discussed with 
[COMPANY_008] study physician.
All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the eCRF.

113(173)Cediranib and inducers of PgP/UGT 
In vitro data indicate that cediranib is unlikely to cause interactions with CYP450 inducers, 
inhibitors, and substrates.  Cediranib oxidative metabolism appears to be mediated by 
[CONTACT_14997]-containing monooxygenase enzymes FMO1 and FMO3 and glucuronidation by 
[CONTACT_15924]1A4.  Co-administration of cediranib with strong inducers of PgP/UGT decrease 
cediranib plasma concentrations; therefore, use of potent inducers of UGT/PgP (eg, 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin and St. John Wort) should be avoided if possible.  Cediranib is a substrate of MDR1 (Pgp), and possible substrate of breast cancer 
resistant protein (BCRP).  Cediranib is not an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3, but it has a low 
potential to inhibit MDR1 (Pgp), BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1.  The clinical impact of this finding is unknown.  Cediranib may act as an inhibitor of renal tubular 
MATE2-K, this could increase exposure of co-administered agents such metformin or to 
endogenous agents such as creatinine; however, the ICON6 study showed that increases of blood creatinine caused by 20 mg/day cediranib treatment were infrequent (4.4%) and only 
mild in severity, suggesting the clinical impact of renal tubular MATE2-K inhibition by 
[CONTACT_76453].
Olaparib and CYP 3A4/5 enzymes
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_82939] shown that co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased olaparib maximum 
plasma concentration (C
max) 1.42-fold (90% CI: 1.33-1.52) and increased mean area under the 
plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) 2.70-fold (90% CI: 2.44-2.97); co-
administration of a strong CYP inducer decreased C maxby 71% (treatment ratio: 0.29; 90% 
CI: 0.24-0.33) and mean AUC by 87% (treatment ratio: 0.13; 90% CI: 0.11-0.16). 
Consequently, to ensure patient safety, the follo wing potent inhibitors of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_82940] not 
be used during this study for any patient receiving olaparib (eg, itraconazole, telithromycin, 
clarithromycin, boosted protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, 
verapamil) of this isozyme should not be taken with the IPs in this study.
Strong CYP 3A4/5 inducers (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabutin, rifapentine, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enzalutamide and St John’s Wort) and moderate inducers CYP 
3A4 inducers (eg, bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) should not be taken with the IPs in this 
study.
After enrollment if the use of any potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 are considered 
necessary for the patient’s safety and welfare, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_76454].  A decision to allow the patient to continue in the study will be made on a case-by-case basis.

(approximately 20 months after study start), allows all patients to have at least [ADDRESS_82946] 
follow-up assessments.
An interim futility analysis of ORR (c onfirmed and/or unconfirmed CRs and PRs based on 
investigator assessment) will take place after 20 evaluable patients (ie, with measurable 
disease (by [CONTACT_76377]) have received at least [ADDRESS_82947] responded the study will continue to the 
primary analysis.
The study design was formulated within a Bayesian framework ( Fisch et al 2015 ) based on 
dual criteria to show improvement over the expected response rate under current standard 
treatments (20% RR targeted as an improvement over <15% RR based on chemotherapy, Davis et al 2014 ) and to have a RR of a relevant size (approximately 30%, similar to the RR 
seen for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in the AURELIA trial, Pujade-Lauraine et al 2014 ) 
defined as follows: 
1. to have high confidence (>90%) that the true ORR is at least 20% or probability 
(ORR≥ 20%) >0.9 and  
2. an observed rate of 30/100 is seen at the primary analysis.The futility rule a bove (stop if number of responses is <4), was chosen so that the trial may 
stop if there is a low chance (<10% predictive probability) of 30 or more responses being 
observed at the primary analysis.  Computation of posterior and predictive probabilities used a 
neutral prior ie, beta (1/3, 1/3) distribution (Kerman 2011), for the ORR.  The predictive 
probability of observing a given number of responses at the end of the trial given the observed 
responses at the interim analysis is computed using a beta binomial distribution.
With 30 responders out of 100 at the primary analysis we would be >99% confident that the 
ORR is greater or equal to 20% and 94.6% confident that the ORR is ≥23%.  It is noted that 
the interim analysis is based on unconfirmed, investigator assessed RECIST data, whereas the 
primary analysis will be based on ICR assessed data with responses confirmed at least 4 
weeks after the initial response.  Data from the OCEANS study indicated an approximate 
1.5% reduction in response by [CONTACT_76456] (Aghajanian et al 
2014).  If only 26 patients out of 100 were to m eet the latter definition of response at the 
primary analysis there would still be >90% confidence that the true rate was greater than or equal to 20%.
Assuming median PFS of 6 months, 73% PFS events are expected at the primary analysis at 
[ADDRESS_82948] 59% deaths.

information on any lesions that were biopsied to provide a tumor sample for study entry (see 
Section 5.7.2 ) will also be provided to allow the selection of appropriate target lesions.  The 
imaging scans will be reviewed by [CONTACT_76458] 1.1 criteria 
and will be adjudicated if required.  For each patient, the ICR will define the overall visit 
response data (CR, PR, SD, PD or not evaluable [NE]) and the relevant scan dates for each time point (ie, for visits where response or progression is/is not identified).  If a patient has 
had a tumor assessment which cannot be evaluated then the patient will be assigned a visit 
response of NE (unless there is evidence of progression in which case the response will be assigned as PD).  
Further details of the ICR will be documented in the Independent Review Charter.
Investigator RECIST based assessments
From the investigators review of the imagining scans, the RECIST tumor response data will 
be used to determine each patient’s visit response according to RECIST version 1.1.  At each 
visit, patients will be programmatically assigned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of CR, PR, SD or PD depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous

Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
119(173)8.4.2 Secondary endpoints
Duration of response (DoR)
DoR will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response, (that is 
subsequently confirmed) until date of documented progression or death in the absence of 
disease progression.  The date of the response start will be defined as the latest of the dates 
contributing towards the first visit response of PR or CR.  If the response is not confirmed, it will not be included.  The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or 
death from any cause used for the PFS endpoint.  If a patient does not progress following a 
response, then their duration of response will use the PFS censoring time.
Disease control rate (DCR)
DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response of CR or PR or 
SD (at 6 months).
Progression free survival (PFS)
PFS is defined as the time from date of fi rst dose until the date of objective disease 
progression or death (by [CONTACT_72999]) regardless of whether the 
patient withdraws from study therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to 
progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment fro m their last evaluable RECIST assessment. 
However, if the patient progresses or dies after three or more missed RECIST assessments visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST assessment. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not ha ve baseline data they will be censored at 0 
days unless they die within two visits of baseline. 
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates.  RECIST 
assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on different dates. 
The following rules will be applied:
! Date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the dates 
of the component that triggered the progression
! When censoring a patient for PFS the patient will be censored at the latest of the dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment.
Overall visit assessments will be determined for each assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) and will contribute to the derivation of PFS.  Objective disease progression is defined as: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions (compared with a 
previous minimum sum) and an absolute increase of >5 mm, an overall assessment of 
progression or a new lesion.

Study Code D8488C00001
Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
120(173)Overall survival (OS)
OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause. Any patient 
not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date 
on which the patient was known to be alive.
Note: Survival calls will be made in the 2 weeks following the date of the data cut-off for the 
primary analysis, and if patients are confirmed to be alive (or if the death date is post the 
relevant data cut-off date) these patients will be censored in the associated analyses at the date of the data cut off.
Time to discontinuation of IPs or death (TDT)
TDT is defined as the time from the date of first doses of IPs to the earlier of the date of 
discontinuation of both IPs, or death date.  Both IPs should be discontinued at the same time 
but in rare circumstances discontinuation of one of the IPs before the other may be allowed (see Section 3.9).  In such a case, TDT will reflect the time from the date of first dose to the 
earliest IP discontinuation date.
HRQoL Analyses:
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-OV28 questionnaires will be used.  Descriptive 
statistics of absolute scores and change from baseline of all subscales will be presented and 
plots will be generated as appropriate to interpret changes over time.  
Proportions of patients who had improved, stayed the same or deteriorated for all subscales 
(symptom and functioning scales) will be presented.  A [ADDRESS_82953] of missing data will be evaluated.  If warranted, 
some investigation of HRQoL data by [CONTACT_76460]. 
! Symptom Improvement Rate at 8 weeks
∀For dyspnea, pain and constipation from QLQ-C30 and abdominal/GI symptoms 
from QLQ-OV28, the symptom improvement rate at 8 weeks will be defined as 
the number (%) of patients showing a clinically meaningful improvement (a 
decrease from baseline score >10; Osoba et al 2005 ) in that symptom from 
baseline.  The denominator will consist of a subset of the FAS population who 
have a baseline symptom score >10.
8.4.3 Other endpoints
Patient reporting of CTCAE symptoms
The PRO-CTCAE questionnaire will be used to derive patient reporting of CTCAE 
symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, and dizziness.

Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
121(173)Safety variables
Safety and tolerability will be  assessed in terms of AEs, deaths, laboratory data, vital signs 
including BP and ECGs.  Any AE occurring before the start of IP will not be included in the 
summary tables of AEs.
Any AE occurring within 30 days of discontinuation of IPs (ie, the last dose of cediranib + 
olaparib) or the last dose of the last IP to be discontinued, in the rare case where 
discontinuation dates are different will be included in the AE summaries.
Blood pressure data collected electronically (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will not be reported in the 
CSR.  Patient profiles and BP data over time for pa tients may be evaluated in an exploratory 
analysis at a later time.
8.[ADDRESS_82954] 4 weeks after the initial response will be counted as 
responders.
The number of responders (confirmed CR or PR) will be modelled  using a binomial 
distribution with a neutral Beta (1 /3,1/3) prior distribution on the rate.
The mean and median of the posterior distribution of ORR will be presented, along with the 
standard deviation and a 95% credible interval around the mean (based on the highest 
posterior density [Lee, 1997]).  The observed ORR by [CONTACT_76461] 95% 
exact (Clopper Pearson) CIs.
The posterior probabilities of the ORR being larger than 15%, 20% and 24% will be also 
computed.  To further characterize the RR, the posterior probability of showing low (<15%),
moderate ( ≥15%- <20%), high ( ≥20%- <24%) or substantial ( ≥24%) efficacy will be 
presented.
Summaries of the number of patients with best response in each of the follow categories will 
be presented: CR, PR, SD, PD and NE.  For the interim analysis, the CR (PR) category will be split into confirmed CR (PR) and unconfirmed CR (PR).

presented for the following:
! ORR by [CONTACT_3138]
! ORR for both confirmed and unconfirmed responses based on ICR assessment
! ORR based on ICR assessment in the subgroup of patients carrying a somatic deleterious or suspected deleterious variant in either of the BRCA
genes ( BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) or in HRR-associated genes identified with 
current and potential future tumor based BRCA or HRR gene mutation 
assays (ICR and Investigator assessment)
The concordance between ORR (confirmed responses) as assessed by [CONTACT_76462].
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)
Disease Control Rate (DCR)
DCR is defined as confirmed CR, PR or SD for at least 6 months.  DCR based on ICR in the 
evaluable for response analysis set will be presented together with 95% exact (Clopper 
Pearson) CIs.  DCR will be presented based on the Investigator assessment as a sensitivity analysis.
Duration of response (DoR)
DoR in responding patients will be summarized and the number (%) of responding patients 
with a DoR >3, >6, >9 and >12 months will be presented.  A Kaplan Meier plot and median 
DoR with 95% CI (calculated from the Kaplan-Meie r plot) will be presented.  DoR will be 
presented based on the ICR, and (as a sensitivity analysis) based on the Investigator 
assessment.
Progression free survival (PFS)
PFS will be displayed using a Kaplan Meier plot. The number of events, the type of event 
(RECIST 1.1 progression or death), median time to event (calculated from the Kaplan-Meier 
plot), and the proportion of patients without an event at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months will be summarized. 
Overall survival (OS) 
OS will be displayed using a Kaplan-Meier plot.  The number of events, median time to event 
(calculated from the Kaplan-Meier plot), and the proportion of patients without an event at 3, 
6, 12 and 18 months will be summarized. 
Subsequent anticancer treatment
Subsequent anticancer treatment will be summarized descriptively at the primary analysis.

8.5.3 Subgroup anal ysis (if applicable)
The analyses of ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS and OS will be repeated for patients in and not in the 
following two subgroups:
! patients carrying a somatic deleterious  or suspected deleterious variants 
in either of the BRCA genes ( BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) identified with current 
and potential future tumor based BRCA mutation assays 
! patients identified as having a deleterious or suspected deleterious 
variants in HRR-associated genes id entified with c urrent and potential 
future HRR gene mutation assays.
Other subgroups may be analyzed, as detailed in the SAP.
8.5.[ADDRESS_82955] after 20 evaluable (by [CONTACT_76377]) 
patients have received IPs and have been follo wed for at least 4 months.  The study may be 
stopped for futility if there are less than 4 responders (confirmed and/or unconfirmed 
responses) out of the first 20 patients in which case the predictive probability of observing 
30 responders or more at the end of trial is ≤4.6%.  Computation of posterior and predictive 
probabilities will use a ne utral prior ie, beta (1/3, 1/3) distribution ( Kerman 2011), for the 
ORR.  The predictive probability of observing a gi ven number of responses at the end of the 
trial given the observed responses at the interim analysis is computed using a beta binomial 
distribution. 
8.5.5 Sensitivity analysis 
ORR, DCR, DoR and PFS will be re-analyzed using the investigator assessment of tumor 
response instead of ICR assessment, as sensitivity analyses.

126(173)of study treatment.  Data cut-off will be followe d by [CONTACT_76463].  
The study is expected to start in Quarter 3, [ADDRESS_82959] after 20 evaluable patients (ie, with measurable 
disease [by [CONTACT_3138]] and received at least one dose of IP) have been recruited 
and followed for at least [ADDRESS_82960] a DoR greater than 6 months.  At this time, the clinical study database will close to new data and all 
efficacy, HRQoL and safety/tolerability inf ormation will be summarized for preparation of the 
CSR.  Patients are permitted to continue to receive IPs beyond the FPV if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], they are continuing to receive benefit from treatment with cediranib and/or 
olaparib and have not met any discontinuation criteria.  Such patients will complete a FPV, 
which will occur at their last scheduled visit prior to data cut-off.  For further information regarding the FPV please refer to Section 4.4. For patients who continue to receive treatment 
beyond the FPV, Investigators will assume a manual drug ordering process for IPs.
Patients who continue to receive treatment beyond the FPV are to be followed in accordance 
with the Medical Standard of Care and as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_32366].  Serious 
adverse event reporting (on paper) will continue to ensure safety data collection and 
monitoring of the patients while receiving the investigational product.  It is recommended that Investigators continue to observe ongoing patients at the frequency employed prior to the 
FPV.  Protocol dose modification and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76346] a patient is 
receiving cediranib and/or olaparib.  Restrictions regarding concomitant medications (Section 7.7) must be followed while the patient is receiving cediranib and/or olaparib.  A 
change in the dose/schedule of cediranib and/or olaparib should only occur for safety reasons, based on the Investigator’s judgement, and should generally follow the approach for dose reduction and discontinuation as described in this protocol.  Combining cediranib and/or 
olaparib with other anti-cancer therapy is not allowed.  
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], a patient is no longer receiving clinical benefit from the 
IPs beyond the FPV, then the IPs will be stopped.  The Investigator will inform [COMPANY_008] 
when a patient discontinues the IPs.  Patients must return unused medication during routine 
clinic visits; drug accountability information must continue to be collected in patient source documents until the patient discontinues treatment.  Patients will continue to be monitored for 
all SAEs and pregnancies while receiving IPs and for [ADDRESS_82961] dose of IPs.

FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death.  ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76355] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
! Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine
! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm

138(173)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
! Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?
! Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?
! De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76357]?
! No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_76476], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
! Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge.
! Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
! Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a revi ew of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship and includes any toxicities 
considered related, probably related, or possibly related to the drug.

141(173)Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
INTRODUCTION
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended t o be a comprehensive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alte rnative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_62684] (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline 
Phosphatase (ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
In order to identify cases of PHL it is import ant to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
RI
Clinical Study Proto olDrug Substance cediranib (AZD2171) plus olaparib (AZD2281)
Study Code D8488C00001
Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
142(173)! ALT ≥ 3xULN
! AST ≥ 3xULN
! TBL ≥ 2xULN
The Investigator will remain vigilant for local laboratory reports where the identification 
criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative
! Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) 
! Complete the appropriate unscheduled laborat ory CRF module(s) with the original 
local laboratory test result
When the identification criteria are met from the local laboratory results the Investigator will 
without delay:! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 0of this Appendix 
for definition) by [CONTACT_48886] 
! The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the 
identification criteria are met will:
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative
! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 0 of this Appendix for 
definition) by [CONTACT_48886]
! Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF
FOLLOW-UP
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Inform the [COMPANY_008] represent ative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
! Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.

143(173)Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study 
treatment (See Section 0)
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central St udy Team 
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_48887]:
! Monitor the patient until liver bioc hemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
! Investigate the etiology of the event a nd perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician.  Th is includes deciding which the tests 
available in the Hy’s law lab kit should be used
! Complete the three Liver CRF Modul es as information becomes available 
! If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures
REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_82972] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
! If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF

Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance cediranib (AZD2171) plus olaparib (AZD2281)

Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
144(173)! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
! Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard
processes. 
∀The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
∀As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
! Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causality assessment as per above
! Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the 
outcome of the review
ACTIONS REQUIRED WHEN POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CRITERIA 
ARE MET BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING STUDY TREATMENT 
This section is applicable to patients who meet PHL criteria on study treatment having 
previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met the Investigator will:
! Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condition#
compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met#
∀If there is no significant change no action is required
∀If there is a significant change notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will 
inform the central Study Team, then follo w the subsequent process described is 
Section 4.2 of this Appendix
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of

145(173)whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator, this 
may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.
Actions required for repeat epi[INVESTIGATOR_72921]’s Law
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:
! Was the alternative cause for the previous  occurrence of PHL criteria being met 
found to be the disease under study eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, 
severe infection or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to 
starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in 
Section 0?
If No: follow the process described in Section 4.2 of this Appendix
If Yes:
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition#compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met
! If there is no significant change no action is required
! If there is a significant change follow the process described in Section 4.2 of this 
Appendix
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this 
may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

147(173)Appendix F Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumour Response 
Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours)
INTRODUCTION
This appendix details the implementation of Re sponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009 ) for the D8488C00001 study with regards to 
the Investigator assessment of tumour burden including protocol-specific requirements for this 
study.
DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON-MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON-
TARGET LESIONS
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study.  
Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_76478] 1 measurable lesion that has not been 
previously irradiated. 
Measurable:
A lesion, not previously irradiated or biopsied per the protocol prior to 
enrollment/randomisation, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥[ADDRESS_82974] diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥15 mm) with computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.
Non-measurable:
! All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis at baseline
1).
! Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal 
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_76479].
! Lesion biopsied per the protocol prior to randomisation
! Previously irradiated lesions
2
                                               
1Nodes with <10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as 
non-target lesions (NTLs).
2Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been 
previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up 
as part of the NTL assessment.

148(173)! Skin lesions assessed by [CONTACT_12148]
! Brain metastasis.
Special cases:
! Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic–blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable.
! Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view , but if non-cystic lesions are present 
in the same patient; these should be selected as target lesions (TLs).
Target lesions:
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline.
Non-target lesions:
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at 
baseline.
METHODS OF ASSESSMENT
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits.
A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided in Table 20.

149(173)CT and MRI 
CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible 
methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and identification 
of any new lesions. 
In the D8488C00001 study it is recommended that CT examinations of the chest and abdomen 
(including liver and adrenal glands) will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and 
follow-up visits.  CT examination with intravenous contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or it is medically 
contra-indicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method.
Clinical examination 
In the D8488C00001 study, clinical examination will not be used for assessment of TL.  
Clinically detected lesions can be selected as TLs if they are assessed by [CONTACT_76480].  
Clinical examination can be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions.
Chest X-ray
In the D8488C00001 study, ches t X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as 
they will be assessed by [CONTACT_76481].  Chest X-ray can, however, be 
used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions.
Plain X-ray 
In the D8488C00001 study plain X-ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL 
and to identify the presence of new bone lesions. 
Ultrasound 
In the D8488C00001 study, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and 
NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examination can, however, be 
used to identify the presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an 
ultrasound is performed then new lesions should be confirmed by [CONTACT_76482].
Endoscopy and laparoscopy 
In the D8488C00001 study, e ndoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour 
assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment.
Tumour markers In the D8488C00001 study tum our markers will not be used for tumour response 
assessments as per RECIST 1.1.
Cytology and histology

150(173)In the D8488C00001 study histology will not be used as part of the tumour response 
assessment as per RECIST 1.1. 
Cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment is required when the measurable tumour has met criteria for response or stable disease.  In such circumstances, the cytology is necessary to 
differentiate between response/stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease (if the neoplastic origin of the fluid is confirmed).  Where cytology findings are not available, any effusion that 
significantly worsens (from trace to large) or appearance of clinically significant 
effusion (requi ring change in drug therapy) during the study treatment will be 
considered to be progression of NTL, or disease progression due to new lesions. 
Isotopic bone scan 
Bone lesions identified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], 
MRI or X-ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by [CONTACT_76483].  
In the D8488C00001 study isotopic bone scans may be used as a method of 
assessment to identify the presence of ne w bone lesions at follow-up visits.  New 
lesions will be recorded where a positive hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the study.  The Investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a 
significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in 
order to record the new lesion.  Confirmation by [CONTACT_4654], MRI and X-ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal.
FDG-PET scan
In the D8488C00001 study , 18-Fluoro-de oxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according 
with the following algorithm:  New lesions will be recorded where there is positive 
18-Fluoro-d eoxyglucose uptake
3not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a 
location corresponding to a new lesion on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If 
there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on 
CT/MRI scans then follow-up CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to confirm new lesions.

Study Code D8488C00001
Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
151(173)Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the 
disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based 
on signs and symptoms of individual patients and should be performed within the 28 days 
prior to randomisation and ideally as close as possible before the start of study treatment (see 
the Schedule of Assessments [Table 5] in the main body of the protocol).  Follow-up 
assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (±1 week), relative to first dose of 
investigational product(s) until confirmed objective disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (irrespective of the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76360]/or subsequent therapy).
Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at 
follow-up.
If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt 
should be made to perform the subsequent a ssessments at their scheduled visits.  This 
schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by [CONTACT_76484] a different frequency than other patients.
Target lesions
Documentation of target lesions
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph 
nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or 
short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.
The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in millimetres.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be 
calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters.
Special cases:
For TL measurable in [ADDRESS_82976]/MRI slice thickness used is >[ADDRESS_82977] the sum of the diameters of those parts. 
If 2 or more TLs merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be 
recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s).  
If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 
5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.

Edition Number 5.0Date 15 Jan 2019
152(173)If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. 
When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery, during the study, 
the size of the TL should still be provided where possible.
Evaluation of target lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour visit 
response for TL (see Table 21).
Table 21 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD
Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not evaluable 
or had a lesion intervention at this visit.  Note: If the sum of 
diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, progressive 
disease overrides not evaluable as a TL response
CR  Complete response; PR  Partial response; PD  Progression of disease; NE  Not evaluable; SD  Stable disease; 
TL  Target lesion.
Non-target lesions
Evaluation of non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as 
NTL at baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status 
should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the 
NTL response should be recorded by [CONTACT_737].  This section provides the 
definitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit (see Table 22).

153(173)Table 22 Evaluation of non-target lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline.  All lymph nodes must 
be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non CR/Non PD Persistence of 1 or more NTL.
Progression of disease (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.  Unequivocal 
progression may be due  to an important progression in [ADDRESS_82978] be clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) therapy.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when 1 or some of the NTLs were not assessed and, 
in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they are not able to provide an evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit.
CR  Complete response; PR  Partial response; PD  Progression of disease; NE  Not evaluable; NTL  Non-target 
lesion.
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of stable disease or partial response in TLs, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.
New lesions
Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 
one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. 
A lesion identified at a follow-up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumour.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour 
assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans 
confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.

154(173)Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it may be a reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].
Patients with ‘symptomatic deterioration’ requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should continue to undergo tumour assessments where possible until objective disease progression is observed.

155(173)CONFIRMATION OF PROGRESSION
While disease progression may require confirmation, it is not mandated in this study.  
Confirmation will be subject to the investigator’s discretion (eg. if investigator is not sure of 
progression at initial assessment).  The confirmat ory scan s hould occ ur preferably at the next 
scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of progression of 
disease (PD) in the absence of clinical deterioration.
If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent cancer therapy) prior to 
progression then the patient should still continue  to be followed until objective disease 
progression.
CONFIRMATION OF RESPONSE 
In Study D8488C00001, imaging for confirmation of response (CR or PR) should be performed at the next scheduled RECIST assessment, 8 weeks (certainly no less than 4 weeks) 
following the date the criteria for response were first met.

162(173)Appendix I List of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers
GUIDANCE REGARDING POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH CONCOMITANT 
MEDICATIONS
Note. While this is not an exhaustive list, it covers the known potent inhibitors and inducers, 
which have most often previously been reported to be associated with clinically significant 
drug interactions.  Please contact [CONTACT_76486].  For a more detailed lis t of CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, please visit 
FDA website: 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugIntera
ctionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm#4
INTERACTIONS WITH P450:
Olaparib is substrate of CYP3A4.  Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers will affect 
olaparib’s exposure.  Cediranib is not substrate of CYP3A4, but it is substrate of UGT and 
PgP.  Some CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers also inhibit or induce UGT/Pgp. 
POTENT INHIBITORS OF CYP3A4:
The following inhibitors of CYP3A4 must not be used during this study:
Table 30 Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 
Drug Minimum washout period prior to starting IP
Ketoconazole; Itraconazole; Indinavir; 
Saquinavir; Telithromycin; Nelfinavir; Clarithromycin; Ritonavir; Cobicistat; Indinavir; 
Saquinavir;  Nelfinavir; Boceprevir; Telaprevir and Clarithromycin2 Weeks
Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, 
verapamil) should be avoided with at least 1 week washout period.  
INDUCERS OF CYP3A4:
In addition, to avoid potential reductions in exposure due to drug interactions, the following 
CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided:

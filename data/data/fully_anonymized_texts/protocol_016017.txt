A. Objective  
The objective of this project is to leverage the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative’s  (MSQC) 
existing network and surgeon performance feedback platform to improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_823588] a manner discordant with published guidelines. This work will test how effective this intervention and mechanism are for changing surgeon prescribing behavior and will inform best practices for future surgical quality improvement initiatives.  
 
B. Specific Aim/Hypothesis  
To test the effectiveness of a provider -level feedback intervention in optimizing postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_172293]. Further, we will assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and adoption of this intervention through survey and qualitative interview mechanisms. We hypothesize that provider -level 
feedback will allow clinicians to  tailor postoperative prescribing more closely to patient consumption 
and reduce excess postoperative prescribing.  
 C. Background InformationC1 Project Rationale  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_823589] a national public health crisis, with [ADDRESS_1142064] rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_823590]2. While 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_823591], over -prescription of these same 
medications increases the risk of new persistent use for the patient and for diversion of excess pi[INVESTIGATOR_823592]. Decreasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_823593].  
 Provider -facing feedback interventions - such as the “push reports” utilized in this project - are a 
promising tool for decreasing post -surgical overprescribing. There is evidence of the success and 
effectiveness of similar interventions among other aspects of care, such as perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and electronic health record utilization 
3,4,5. Creating tools that integrate opi[INVESTIGATOR_823594]- specific recommendations could allow clinicians to tailor opi[INVESTIGATOR_823595].  
 C2 OPEN and the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative  
This project is a collaborative effort between the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_823596] (Michigan OPEN) and the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC).  
 
OPEN  
The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_823597]- based pain management recommendations for pr oviders, educating patients 
about safe use and disposal of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and reducing excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_823598]. OPEN has developed procedure specific prescribing recommendations to curb over -prescribing of 
postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. These recommendations for patients with no preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], were informed by [CONTACT_4676] -reported data, published studies, and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As of February 2020, 
Michigan OPEN has developed recommendations for [ADDRESS_1142065], and orthopedic procedures.  
 
MSQC  
The Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) is one of the largest surgical collaborative 
quality improvement programs in the U.S. and captures more than 90% of all general and vascular surgical procedures in Michigan. The MSQC includes surgeons and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823599]. They are also designated at a Patient Safety Organization designated by [CONTACT_823618] (Surgical Clinical Quality Reviewers (SCQRs)) from over 70 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823600] – including opi[INVESTIGATOR_823601] o utcomes – into the MSQC platform at regular intervals.  This data is 
used for quality improvement and to provide surgeons with regular surgeon specific reports on 
MSQC’s secure web -based platform. These reports contain real -time, risk adjusted, personalized 
feedback on both surgeon and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823602]. Providers can also use this platform to easily view their performance in comparison with other de- identified member institutions, drill down into specific cases, 
and export their own data for further analysis. Each MSQC site also has a surgeon champi[INVESTIGATOR_823603], promoting and participating in activities directed at improving surgical  
quality improvement and sharing best practices, and regularly attending the MSQC Quarterly 
Meetings, Annual Conference, and Surgeon Champi[INVESTIGATOR_823604]. The role of the MSQC and 
the Surgeon Champi[INVESTIGATOR_823605]. 
 
C3 Project Innovation and Impact  
Currently, MSQC provides a robust platform for quality improvement through tailored and modifiable feedback reports regarding important aspects of perioperative and postoperative care, including complications, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Each quarter, MSQC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823606]. In this study, we will harness this robust infrastructure to identify surgeons who are outliers in surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_823607].

D1 Identification of Surgeon Outliers  
Using existing MSQC data from 1/1/2019 – 2/28/2021,  [ADDRESS_1142066] been identified as outliers 
by [CONTACT_823619] . Only cases that had valid prescribing data and surgeon National Provider 
Identifier (NPI) were considered. Prescribing data for the following surgeries were included: Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy, Open Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic Appendectomy, Open Appendectomy, Minor Hernia, Abdominal Hernia, Laparoscopic Colectomy, Open Colectomy, Vaginal Identify outlier prescribers Collect Exhibit B -1 Send Push Reports

D2 Site Enrollment and Protections  
Prior to initiation of the research described in this protocol, the study team will contact [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_823612] . Sites that agree to participate in the research by [CONTACT_823621] B -[ADDRESS_1142067] (PSWP) pursuant to the purpose of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_823613]. This Exhibit B -1 will outline how the site’s data will be used 
in research but will not include information that would bias the study.  Exhibit B -[ADDRESS_1142068] 
appropriate approval from legal reviewers at the University of Michigan. The study team will work with the Surgeon Champi[INVESTIGATOR_823614] a document and to get the document signed and returned to the study 
team (either through directing the team to the appropriate individual or routing the paperwork to the 
appropriate individual and returning the paperwork to the study team depending on the preference of 
the site and the Surgeon Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]/SCQR). The individual administrator who signs the Exhibit  B-1 for 
the site will not be alerted as to which surgeon(s)  at their site may be receiving the intervention push 
report.  
 
For sites who do not complete this paperwork we will look only at de- identified data at the site level to 
examine prescribing changes. This control arm will not receive the push report intervention.  
 
 
D3 Control Arm  
The study team will enroll sites that did not sign the Exhibit B -[ADDRESS_1142069] information.  Sites who did not sign the 
Exhibit B -1 and/or surgeons for whom the team was unable to gather updated email addresses for 
push reporting and/or for whom the email address was no longer valid will be excluded from the 
intervention arm and moved to the control arm.  
 
The push report will be sent via using a secure em ail client . The email will be sent to the email the 
surgeon has provided to MSQC as their official email.  In the case of multiple email addresses, the 
study team will send the email to the most secure account available (e.g. .edu, .gov, .org rather than 
Yahoo, Gmail, etc).  
 
All surgeons who practice at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823615] a current email address who have 
signed the Exhibit B -[ADDRESS_1142070] otherwise and/or their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/health system revokes permission.  
 
D4C Push Report Data Collection  
We will collect prescribing data reported through the existing MSQC mechanism  for five months from 
the dat e of the first push report  In addition to the standard variables reported to MSQC, the study 
team will collect data on surgeon interaction with the email push report.  We will collect information 
such as  who opens the email, who logs into the MSQC platform after receiving the email, and who 
directly contacts the study team and why. This information will be used to inform who needs to 
continue receiving push reports, be used in research analyses, and inform quality improvement 
opportunities based on this methodology.  
 
D5 Feedback Surveys Following receipt of the push report(s), the study team will send up to two surveys to all prescribers who received the push report to collect information about usability and acceptability of the email push reports . Surgeons who open the push report will be sent a survey invitation the following day and 
another two weeks later. The first survey will ask about their reactions to the push report and ask surgeons for  permission to contact[CONTACT_823622] a qualitative interview whereas the second will 
ask about any actions taken after receiving the push report.  Surgeons who do not open any of the 
push reports will be sent a different survey invitation. These surgeons will be asked a single question 
regarding what could be improved. Each invitation will contain a link to the appropriate survey programmed in University of Michigan secure Qualtrics and will be preceded by [CONTACT_823623].

D7 Qualitative Interview  
In addition to receiving up to two surveys, surgeons who indicate in the first survey that they are 
interested in scheduling or learning more about scheduling a qualitative interview will be emailed by [CONTACT_823624]. The purpose of this fifteen minute interview is to 
examine the preferences and experiences of surgeons who have received this feedback. The study 

team will reach out to the surgeon individually and work with them to schedule a time to conduct the 
interview.  
   
The interview will take place via Zoom or on the phone at the mutually agreeable time. A trained 
member of the study team will obtain consent from the participant prior to the interview. The 
participant must consent to having audio from the interview recorded in order to participate and language indicating this will be included in the consent. The interview will be recorded on an encrypted recorder or directly in the Zoom platform and then saved directly to an encrypted study drive. Once the audio recording is obtained and saved a study team member or third party who have an agreement with the University of Michigan will transcribe the interview. The transcription will also be saved to an encrypted study drive with the participant’s study ID.  
 
E. Statistic al Design  
E1 Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome will be the average opi[INVESTIGATOR_263080] (measured in oral morphine equivalents [OMEs] adjusted for the surgery type following the intervention. Only cases with valid prescribing data and surgeon NPI [INVESTIGATOR_823616]. Prescribing data will be collected for  five months 
following the first push report.   
E2 Exploratory Outcomes  
Exploratory outcomes will be the rate of prescribing within the MSQC guidelines over the same year following the intervention. We will also evaluate the survey and interview items collected on acceptability, ease of use, relevance, utility, and appearance.

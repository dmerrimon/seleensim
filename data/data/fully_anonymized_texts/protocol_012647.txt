2.0 Background
Role of Intracavitary Brachytherapy in Treatment of Cervical Cancer 
Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is a critical component of definitive radiation therapy 
for cervical cancer.  ICBT is typi[INVESTIGATOR_45841] (EBRT).  Because of rapid dose fall-off, optimal implant placement allows for high dose delivery to the cervix and parametrial tissue while limiting dose to critical adjacent tissues, including the bladder, rectum and sigmoid colon.  Patients with small tumors have high central control rates and relatively low complication rates with this approach.  However, women with a larger volume of 
disease have higher rates of local recurrence.

Gy to the rectum and 70-75 Gy to the bladder) which are represented by [CONTACT_45847]. For patients with particularly challenging anatomy or implants, additional imaging (in the form of CT or MRI) is often obtained following the implant to verify placement of the system.
Image Guided Brachytherapy
The acquisition of 3D imaging at the time of brachytherapy allows for volumetric 
evaluation of dose to the target (the residual tumor and the whole cervix) as well as adjacent normal tissues. CT images taken with the intracavitary applicator in place are increasingly being used for brachytherapy treatment planning. Recently, a number of investigators have advocated the use of MRI-based treatment planning. Following acquisition, images can be exported to the radiation treatment planning system where dose to the target and normal tissues can be calculated (Figure 1).  Dwell times for the iridium steppi[INVESTIGATOR_45842].
CT- and MRI-based planning have advantages and disadvantages.  CT imaging 
provides excellent visualization of normal pelvic tissues, but the tumor is generally difficult to distinguish from normal cervix as a result of their similar electron density.  While still more expensive than 2D imaging, CT imaging is readily available to most radiation oncologists, and is the most common form of image-based treatment planning 
being used in the US today.

promising with 3-year local control rates of 82% for patients with tumors >5 cm and 96%

setup 3D image based gynecologic brachytherapy.
[ADDRESS_48402] quality was poor (with 4 mm slice thickness ) compared to current standards (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1-2 mm slice thickness).   To date, there are no studies evaluating the role of modern CT scanning in an adequate number of patients to determine if there is a select group in which CT may be equivalent to MRI in delineating a target volume.
MRI-Compatible Adaptive Applicator
Because utilization of MRI for treatment planning requires special MRI-compatible 
applicators, the shields that are used to reduce dose to the bladder and rectum in standard applicators have been eliminated.  The use of shields in standard applicators have been shown to reduce the dose to the bladder and rectum by [CONTACT_45848] 25%, 
but create extensive image artifacts hindering image based brachytherapy planning.
13,[ADDRESS_48403] images.15  Our group recently completed a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_45844].16  The applicator that we are using is based off  of Nucletron's FDA approved MRI compatibility applicators (see Appendix C).
3.[ADDRESS_48404] and MRI will also allow us to create additional 3D image based 
treatment plans which will be used only for comparison purposes (not for actual treatment).  We will compare the 3D image based treatment plans to the standard 2D treatment plan to determine if we are able to dosimetrically improve target coverage, while respecting adjacent tissue tolerances, with either form of 3D image guidance.  We will also keep track of the number of person-hours required for planning using each imaging modality by [CONTACT_45849].  We will also keep track of the amount of time that each additional imaging modality takes to acquire. Through the billing department, we will also capture the fees associated with the additional MRI and CT scan as well as the charge of the MRI compatible applicators for each patient and compare this to the fees for a routine implant in which a comparable standard applicator is used and MRI and CT at the time of implant are not obtained.  In combination, this will allow us to determine which imaging modalities are most efficient and practical and which add the most to the treatment planning process.  Additionally, we will determine if there are specific patient and tumor characteristics most and least likely to gain from image guided brachytherapy.

5.[ADDRESS_48405] practice which typi[INVESTIGATOR_45845], BUN/Cr, chest imaging, CT abdomen/pelvis, MRI of the pelvis, and physical examination.  Patients who are candidates for this protocol will have physical exam findings documented at the time of diagnosis and on the day of the implant.  Pertinent information including whether tumor is exophytic or bulky/endocervical, tumor diameter, parametrial involvement, pelvic sidewall, rectal, or vaginal involvement will be documented on a protocol specific form (Form A, Appendix D).  Patients will then be treated with external beam radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy as determined by [CONTACT_45850].  External beam irradiation may consist of conventional treatment or Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). 
Intracavitary Applicator Placement
On the day of the implant, an examination under anesthesia will take place per our 
standard approach.  The tumor characteristics will be documented on Form A (Appendix D).  The appropriate MRI-compatible applicator will be inserted using ultrasound guidance to verify tandem placement in the uterus.  Tandem and ovoids, tandem and cylinders, or tandem and ring will be chosen to accommodate the patient’s tumor and vaginal anatomy. Gel impregnated gauze packing will be placed in the vagina for stabilization of the applicator and displacement of rectum and bladder.
Per our standard treatment protocol, orthogonal plain films will be obtained in the 
operating room to assess appropriate applicator placement.  Optimized loadings will then be recommended according to standard rules. Following the reversal of anesthesia, patients will be taken to recovery.  After recovery from anesthesia, patients will be transported to diagnostic imaging for MRI acquisition and to the department of radiation oncology for CT imaging.
2012-[ADDRESS_48406] (3mm contiguous slices/FOV 18-22 cm/TR>3000/TE>100msecs). The coronal plane will be used to generate oblique sagittal and oblique axial images of the cervix and applicator – parallel and perpendicular to the applicator device within the cervix, respectively. Axial T2 weighted 
T2 FRFSE images of the entire pelvis will be obtained at the end of the exam.   
Additionally a T2 Axial Cube image with isotropic 1mm voxels will also be obtained.  On 
the day of the implant, MRI images will be evaluated for adequate applicator position within the uterus and cervix to rule out any possible rare major deviations in applicator placement such as uterine perforation. 
CT Acquisition
The same procedure used in previously approved protocol 2008-[ADDRESS_48407], our dosimetrists will develop a 2D plan according to the loadings 
recommended by [CONTACT_45851], initial diagnostic imaging ,and orthogonal films.  As is routine the treating physician will then evaluate the 2D plan looking at doses to specific points (rectal and bladder) delineated on the 2D imaging and make adjustments as they see fit.  Following acquisition of both MRI and CT and finalizing of the 2D treatment plan, images will be reviewed by [CONTACT_45852].  The 3D imaging will also be used to inform the physician prescribing the dose of the location and size of any residual disease and 
2012-[ADDRESS_48408] images will be 
uploaded into our brachytherapy treatment planning software, Oncentra.  After reviewing the patient’s initial diagnostic imaging and physical examination at the time of diagnosis and the time of implant the radiation oncologist involved in the procedure and one additional radiation oncologist will contour a HR-CTV based on the GEC-ESTRO guidelines (Appendix E) on the CT followed by [CONTACT_45853]. One of the primary investigators will also contour a HR-CTV as well as critical structures (rectum, bladder, sigmoid colon) on both the MRI and CT scan. The 2D plan will then be registered on the MRI and CT within the treatment planning software.  Based on the primary investigators approved contours several additional plans will be created for purpose of comparison (See Table 1).
The contours devised by [CONTACT_45854].  Contours will be imported into Computerized Environment for Radiation Research (CERR), an open-source MATLAB (TheMathWorks, natick, MA) - based radiation therapy planning analysis tool. The "apparant agreement" method will be used to calculate the apparant volume overlap such that a volume - agreement cumulative histogram can be generated.
 Dosimetric Treatment Planning Study
The first plan will be a CT based plan and will be optimized to improve the HR-CTV D90 
(dose received by 90% of the target volume) to as close to 85 Gy as possible without exceeding the known tolerance dose to rectum and bladder (D2cc of rectum <
 70 Gy 
and  D2cc of bladder <  90 Gy).[ADDRESS_48409].  
Table 1
Plan Description
1) 2D Plan This will be based on the standard loadings 
recommended by [CONTACT_45855]. The initial diagnostic imaging will be reviewed and help to inform this plan and adjustments will be made based on point doses. 
2) 2D Plan informed by 3D images at time This will be based on the standard loadings 
2012-[ADDRESS_48410] practice.
3) ICBT CT based optimized plan This plan will start with the above described 2D plan and will be optimized to target the CT based HR-CTV (also informed by [CONTACT_45856]) with the same objectives as the GEC-ESTRO MRI guidelines. 
4) GEC-ESTRO MRI based optimized plan This plan will start with the above described 2D plan and will be optimized according to GEC-ESTRO guidelines taking into account the patient’s initial diagnostic imaging as well as MRI scan with the applicator in place.
Each of the three treatment plans will be registered on the MRI, and the MRI contours 
will be used as the gold standard such that each treatment plan will be evaluated for its coverage of the HR-CTV and ability to meet constraints for the adjacent organs at risk.  For each of the three treatment plans, we will evaluate the D90, D100, V100, V150, V200, for the HR-CTV and IR-CTV as well as the D0.1, 1, 2 cc for bladder, sigmoid, and rectum (see Table 2). Conformality index (CI=V100%/VCTV) and dose homogeneity index (DHI= (V100%-V150%)/V100%) will be calculated for HR-CTV. 
Table 2
 Using the contours created on MRI (HR-CTV, IR-CTV, Rectum, Bladder, 
Sigmoid) the following parameters will be evaluated for each of the three treatment 
plans.

2012-[ADDRESS_48411] 2D treatment planning.  To address this, the D90 (or the dose to 90% of the HR-CTV volume) and maximally irradiated 2 cc of the bladder (D2 cc bladder) and rectum (D2 cc rectum) will be compared (these parameters have been reported in the past to correlate with toxicity). 
To better understand the dose distribution the other parameters listed in Table [ADDRESS_48412] were:
HR-CTV D90 - mean difference of 459.[ADDRESS_48413] film method was 1368.73 cGy.
D2 cc bladder – mean difference of 407.[ADDRESS_48414] film method was 1474.44 cGy.
D2 cc rectum – mean difference of 159.[ADDRESS_48415] film method was 962.50 cGy. 
We would like to demonstrate an improvement (i.e., increase) in HR-CTV D90 of at least 20% (i.e., at least 273.75 cGy) with MRI based planning over standard 2D planning. With a sample size of [ADDRESS_48416] 96% power with a 2-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_48417] 20% in the HR-CTV D90 with the MRI guided procedure using a t-test.
With a sample size of [ADDRESS_48418] 90% power to detect an increase in D2 
cc bladder of 0.[ADDRESS_48419] deviations, or 200 cGy (i.e., 14.4%) with a 2-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_48420] 90% power to detect an increase in D2 
cc rectum of 0.[ADDRESS_48421] deviations, or 155 cGy (i.e., 16.1%) with a 2-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_48422].
We use the Bonferroni correction to the significance level since we are testing 3 
methods × 3 dosimetry parameters = 9 hypotheses (e.g., 0.05/9 = 0.0056). These sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor ® 7.0 (Copyright ©

We anticipate that 25% of patients will not be evaluable due to inability to accommodate 
an MRI compatible applicator.  In addition, we anticipate that 30% of patients will receive tandem and cylinders or non-adaptive tandem and ovoids. The applicator type used significantly alters the dose distribution which is expected to impact the relative dosimetric benefit of MRI. As a result, the primary analysis will be limited to patients with the adaptive, shielded ovoid, which is the most commonly used applicator in non-protocol patients.  We would therefore like to accrue a total of 57 patients in order to achieve our goal of 30 evaluable patients treated with the adaptive tandem and ovoid system. 
Analysis
We will use summary statistics to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics 
of patients. We will similarly summarize the dosimetry parameters listed in Table 1 for each of the three planning methods noted above. 
We will compare the HR-CTV D90, D2 cc bladder, and D2 cc rectum for the MRI based 
treatment plan (method #4) and CT based treatment plan (method #3) to the standard 2D plan (method #1) and the 2D plan informed by 3D imaging (method #2).  We will use analysis of variance methods with Dunnett’s procedure to compare the outcomes from each of planning methods with the outcomes from planning method #1. We will similarly compare the other dosimetry parameters between the various planning methods.
We will also keep track of the number of person-hours required for planning using each 
imaging modality by [CONTACT_45849].  Through the billing department, we will also capture the fees associated with the additional MRI and CT scan as well as the charge of the MRI compatible applicators for each patient and compare this to the fees for a routine implant in which a comparable standard applicator is used and MRI and CT at the time of implant are not obtained.
Secondary Endpoint
As mentioned above, we will also track of the number of person-hours required for 
planning using each imaging modality by [CONTACT_45857].  We will also keep track of the amount of time each additional imaging modality take to acquire. Through the billing department, we will capture the fees associated with the additional MRI and CT scan as well as the charge of the MRI compatible applicators for each patient and compare this to the fees for a routine implant in which a comparable standard applicator is used and MRI and CT at the time of implant are not obtained.  For the purpose of comparison each of these data points will be compared to each other and to 2D orthogonal plans using.

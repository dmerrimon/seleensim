2. BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE
2.1  Background 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are malignant clonal disorders characterized by 
[CONTACT_12777], bone marrow dysplasia, peripheral cytopenias including 
thrombocytopenia, and a propensity to transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).(1, 
2) Classically, MDS is associated with apoptosis and excessive proliferation, resulting in
a paradoxical combination of a hyper-cellular marrow and peripheral cytopenias.(3)  The
incidence of MDS in the [LOCATION_002] is rising, with approximately 20,000 to 30,000
new cases of MDS diagnosed annually, and a median age at diagnosis of 70 years.(3,
4)
Over the past decade, clinical use of the hypomethylating agent azacitidine has been 
shown to improve patient quality of life, decrease transfusion requirements, and improve 
outcome parameters in MDS patients, and is now a standard of care for MDS patients 
requiring therapy.  With current HMA regimens, achievement of an ORR is estimated at 
28-70%, with a CR rate of only 6-34% in patients with MDS treated with front-line HMA
therapy, and with a median length of response in the HMA-responders of only 8 to 10
months.(5-10)
MDS patients requiring therapy include those with intermediate-2 or High-risk disease 
by [CONTACT_56623], or high or very-high risk by R-IPSS.(11)  In addition, patients with otherwise 
intermediate MDS with high-risk molecular features including TP53 , ASXL1 , EZH2 , 
and/or RUNX1  mutations have been identified as a subgroup that may benefit from 
early therapeutic intervention.(12)   
2.2 Rationale for Glutaminase Inhibition: 
Tumor cells including MDS cells exhibit an altered metabolic profile compared with 
normal cells, presumed to favor rapid growth and proliferation as well as augmented 
survival in hypoxic environment.  As first noted by [CONTACT_433433] 1924, tumor cells display 
“aerobic glycolysis” in lieu of oxidative phosphorylation, and thereby [CONTACT_433434].  Consequently, many tumor cells require a continuous supply of 
exogenous glutamine (GLN) that is used to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for the 
generation of ATP and as a precursor in the generation of amino acids, nucleic acids, 
and fatty acids.  This enhanced utilization of GLN requires the activity of glutaminase, a 
mitochondrial enzyme which converts GLN to glutamate (GLU).  GLU, in turn, has a 
number of important bioenergetic and biosynthetic functions including as an anaplerotic 
intermediate fueling the TCA cycle via conversion to α-ketoglutarate (αKG).  Many 
tumors have been found to have a pronounced upregulation of glutaminase.  These 
tumors are sensitive to withdrawl of GLN from growth medium, usually have a high 
cellular ratio of GLU to GLN, and are very sensitive to the inhibition of glutaminase by 
[CONTACT_433435] .

Anti-tumor activity of glutaminase knock-down with shRNA or inhibition with small 
molecules has been reported both in vitro  and in vivo .(13, 14)  Mutations in the TCA 
cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), either in the cytoplasm (IDH1) or 
mitochondria (IDH2), have been identified in both AML and MDS.  These mutations 
result in conversion of the TCA cycle intermediate aKG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG).  
2HG, considered an oncometabolite, accumulates in the cell resulting in dioxygenase 
blockade, DNA and histone hypermethylation, and ultimately, impaired cell 
differentiation.

Telaglenastat is a potent and selective reversible inhibitor of glutaminase activity.  Two 
alternative splice variants of glutaminase (GLS), GAC and KGA, are found in tumors 
and in normal tissues including lung, liver, heart, kidney, spleen, intestine and brain.  A 
separate gene encodes glutaminase-2 (GLS2), found mainly in the liver.  Telaglenastat 
is an allosteric and noncompetitive inhibitor of both GAC and KGA isoforms of 
glutaminase, but does not inhibit GLS2.  Incubation of recombinant human glutaminase 
with CB-839 results in time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibition of glutaminase 
activity (IC50 = 34 nM with 1 hour pre-incubation).  Glutaminase inhibition is associated 
with antiproliferative activity in a wide range of tumor cell lines.  Pro-apoptotic activity

mesothelioma, and many additional solid and hematologic tumors.   
Recent experimental data suggest that glutamine metabolism is very important for 
leukemic blasts.  Removal of glutamine from the culture media of AML cell lines inhibits 
mTORC1 and induces apoptosis, and shRNA knockdown of SLC1A5, a high-affinity 
transporter for GLN, inhibits tumor formation in mouse AML xenografts.  Leukemic cells 
may be dependent on glutamine utilization pathways to provide carbon skeletons for 
TCA activity (Matre et al, ASH 2013).   
The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of telaglenastat has been evaluated alone 
and in combination with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine in two different AML cell 
lines (data from OCI-AML3 cell line shown in Figure 2). Both telaglenastat and 
azacitidine showed significant antiproliferative effects in both cell lines. In combination, 
substantially greater inhibition of cell number and induction of apoptosis was observed. 
The mechanism whereby [CONTACT_433436]. 
However, recent findings indicate that telaglenastat significantly depletes the cellular 
pool of aspartate, which is a substrate for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine 
nucleotides. In multiple myeloma cells, telaglenastat caused a significant depletion of 
intracellular pools of aspartate, adenylosuccinate and total adenylate. Azacitidine is a 
prodrug that is metabolized to 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine-triphosphate, which is 
incorporated into DNA and result in DNA damage (Stresemann C and Lyko F, Int. J. 
Cancer 123:8-13 (2008).  The combination of nucleotide depletion and induction of DNA 
damage may result in enhanced impairment of DNA replication.

Center. 
2.3 In Vivo  Pharmacodynamics of telaglenastat : 
Telaglenastat inhibition of cellular glutaminase activity has been assessed in rodents.  
These studies have demonstrated that oral administration of Telaglenastat results in a 
rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of glutaminase in mice bearing established human 
tumor xenografts.  Moreover, all tissues examined with the exception of brain (where 
there is limited exposure) and liver (where GLS2 predominates) showed evidence of 
glutaminase inhibition, although less dramatic than in tumors. 
When telaglenastat was administered to immunocompromised mice bearing established 
human TNBC and myeloma xenografts, there was a significant inhibition of tumor 
growth, both as a single agent and in combination with standard of care 
chemotherapeutics.  Telaglenastat administration was well-tolerated up to 400mg/kg 
BID and resulted in substantial inhibition of tumor growth.   
2.4 PK and PD of telaglenastat in Tumors and Tissues in Mice 
The tissue distribution and PD response to CB-839 was evaluated in mice bearing the 
human TNBC tumor HCC1806 by [CONTACT_433437], respectively.  Telaglenastat was administered as a 200 mg/kg single oral 
dose to female SCID/bg mice.  Excellent exposure to telaglenastat was observed in 
plasma, in the tumor, and in all other tissues examined except brain, where exposure 
was 20-fold lower than in plasma.  GLN concentration increased, while GLU and ASP 
decreased substantially in tumors relative to untreated controls.  GLU and ASP 
remained essentially unchanged in non-tumor tissues, suggesting that despi[INVESTIGATOR_433417] , inhibition of glutaminase does not result in product 
depletion in normal tissues.  Other metabolic pathways appear to resupply the 
intracellular pools of GLU in non-tumor tissues with the exception of the spleen. 
2.5 Nonclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics: 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a more detailed description of the 
nonclinical metabolism and PK. 
Systemic exposure to telaglenastat following oral administration is highly species 
dependent due to significant cross-species differences in absorption and metabolism.

Based on the in vitro and in vivo ADME data, good oral exposure of telaglenastat  in 
humans is predicted. 
The oral exposure in female rats was found to be higher than in male rats because of 
more extensive metabolism in male rats . In vitro studies also showed more rapid 
metabolism of telaglenastat in male rat liver microsomes and hepatocytes than in 
female, whereas no differences were observed in vitro using human hepatocytes. Oral 
exposure of telaglenastat in rats was also affected by [CONTACT_433438]. Systemic 
exposure to telaglenastat was higher in fasted rats than in fed rats following oral 
administration. 
 
2.5.1 Absorption 
The api[INVESTIGATOR_2855]-to-basolateral permeability of telaglenastat in human Caco-2 monolayers 
was determined to be 9.6 x 10^-6 cm/s and is predictive of good absorption in humans. 
The oral bioavailability of 44-70% in mice and 66-157% in rats demonstrated good 
absorption of telaglenastat in these species.  
 
2.5.2. Distribution: 
 
High in vitro plasma protein binding of telaglenastat was observed in mouse, rat, dog, 
and human plasma using an ultracentrifugation approach. The mean plasma protein 
binding was 98.0, 97.0, 97.9, and 99.1%, respectively. As described in Section 2.4, 
following a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg to SCID/bg mice, telaglenastat was broadly 
distributed to tissues including heart, lung, spleen, muscle, and subcutaneously-
implanted tumors; brain had 20-fold lower telaglenastat levels.  
 
2.5.3. Metabolism: 
 
In vitro metabolic stability of telaglenastat was evaluated using cryopreserved 
hepatocytes derived from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys (cynomolgus, rhesus, and 
marmoset), and humans. Telaglenastat was most stable in human hepatocytes . Gender 
differences were observed only in rats; CB-[ADDRESS_549253] been identified in vitro 
in hepatocytes and in vivo : amide hydrolysis and P450-mediated hydroxylation. There 
are considerable differences in the mechanism of metabolism across species. All 
metabolites resulting from amide hydrolysis and hydroxylation of CB-[ADDRESS_549254] a low 
abundance (<10%) in human hepatocyte incubations up to 4 hr. Significant exposure of 
the human metabolites identified thus far is anticipated in the non-clinical GLP toxicity 
studies.

2.7 Clinical Data 
The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PDn) following oral 
administration of telaglenastat is being evaluated in three ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials 
in CX-839-001 (solid tumors), CX-839-002 (MM and NHL), and CX-839-003 (acute 
leukemia). Increasing doses of telaglenastat resulted in an increase in plasma 
concentration of telaglenastat and in inhibition of glutaminase activity in platelets and in 
tumors.  As of January 26, 2016, [ADDRESS_549257] been treated with telaglenastat 
monotherapy across the 3 studies, at doses of 100 – 1000 mg orally TID fasted, or 600 
– 1000 mg BID orally with food.  To date, 2 DLT events (elevated creatinine and
elevated LFTs) have been reported for the monotherapy.  Although a maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) has not been defined, [ADDRESS_549258] and GGT, although the frequency of Grade 3/[ADDRESS_549259] ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

In the CX-839-003 study the safety and tolerability of telaglenastat is being evaluated in 
patients with hematological malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) either as 
monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine.   A total of [ADDRESS_549260] 
received telaglenastat as monotherapy on the BID schedule with food and treatment 
related AEs are presented in TABLE 1. Overall, 81.8% of patients experienced an AE 
that was considered at least possibly related to CB-839.  The most frequent CB-839-
related AEs were hematological (thrombocytopenia and anemia) with other AEs 
including Grade 1/[ADDRESS_549261], elevated creatinine, constipation and dyspnea.  The 
hematological AEs were all Grade 3/4 whereas the non-hematological AEs were 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_433418] (Grade 1/2), reversible and manageable without 
dose interruption or modification.  No Grade 3/4 elevations in LFTs were noted.  CB-
839-related Grade 3/4 events included thrombocytopenia (4), neutropenia (2), anemia
(2), lymphopenia (1), hyponatremia (1) and stomatitis (1).

This is a Phase 1b/II clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy 
of telaglenastat in combination with AZA for the treatment of advanced MDS.  Patients 
will be treated with standard AZA (IV or SQ 75mg/m2 IV daily x 7 days) and 
telaglenastat orally twice daily continuously for [ADDRESS_549268] 
evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.  Other objectives include

4.4.1. Concomitant treatment is permitted if the medication is not expected to interfere 
with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of the study drug.  During the study, if the use of 
any concomitant treatment becomes necessary (e.g., for treatment of an adverse 
event), the treatment must be recorded on the eCRF, including the reason for treatment, 
name [CONTACT_18467], dosage, route, and start and stop dates of administration

Date: 06/03/[ADDRESS_549282] will not be eligible for a HI 
response assessment within one week of the receipt of epoetin alfa or filgrastim, tbo-
filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, or for one month after receipt of pegfilgrastim or darbopoetin. 
 
4.4.5. Telaglenastat is metabolized by [CONTACT_433444].  Telaglenastat does not appear to induce CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes 
and only weakly inhibits CYP2C9 (IC 50 1.8-6.7 µM) in vitro .  Therefore, drug-drug 
interactions are not expected.  Although CB-[ADDRESS_549283] a 
narrow therapeutic index.  (See Appendix A). 
 
Preliminary PK data generated in this and concurrent Phase [ADDRESS_549284] that 
concomitant use of agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-
receptor antagonists, antacids, etc.) may reduce absorption of telaglenastat , resulting 
in decreased systemic exposure. Although patients are not required  to discontinue their 
use of these agents, discontinuation is recommended whenever possible.  
 
 
4.5 Dosing Delays and Dose Modifications: 
 
4.5.1. Dose Adjustments: 
 
The doses of telaglenastat and AZA will be adjusted according to the guidelines shown 
in the following tables for study drug-related clinically significant toxicity.  If toxicity is not covered in the table, doses may be reduced or held at the discretion of the investigator 
for the patient’s safety.  
 
Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they fail to recover to CTCAE v4.03 grade 0 
to 1 (or within 1 grade of starting values for pre-existing laboratory abnormalities) from a 
clinically significant non-hematologic treatment-related toxicity within 6 weeks (leading 
to treatment delay of > 4 weeks) unless the investigator feels that the patient should 
remain in the study because of evidence that the patient is/may continue deriving 
benefit from continuing study treatment. Such instances will be discussed with the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a case by [CONTACT_433445].

Patients with study-drug related toxicities that are manageable with supportive therapy 
may not require dose reductions. For patients with other drug-related toxicities, the 
following dose adjustment rules apply: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5.2. 
Administration of subsequent cycles should be administered when neutrophils recover 
to > 1 x 10^9/L and platelets to >30 x 10^9/L, or to baseline levels prior to the start of the last cycle of therapy.  Patients with residual disease may start the next cycle with 
neutrophil and/or platelet counts lower than these if judged to be in the best interest of 
the patient.  The decision to treat should be documented in the patient’s medical record. 
 
5. STUDY PROCEDURES 
 
5.1 Screening (Visit 1) 
 
The following procedures are performed during screening, staging and workup.  These 
procedures are to be performed within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration, 
except where indicated.  All procedures for the Phase 1b and Phase 2 are 
interchangeable. 
 
A signed and dated IEC/IRB approved informed consent form must be obtained before 
any study specific procedures are performed.  Procedures that are part of routine care 
are not considered study specific procedures.  All subjects will be screened for eligibility 
before enrollment.  Once the subject has met all inclusion criteria, they will be enrolled 
onto the study.

reason for treatment discontinuation is relapse/disease progression following a PR or 
better. Patients with adequate numbers of leukemic blasts circulating in the peripheral 
blood may submit a whole blood sample instead of a bone marrow sample 
 
5.4 Long Term Follow Up 
 
All patients discontinued from study treatment for any reason other than withdrawal of 
consent for treatment and follow-up will continue to be assessed for survival.  Survival 
information (i.e. the date and cause of death) will be collected via quarterly

days from the date of initial response (PR or better) to the date of first documented 
disease progression/relapse or death, whichever occurs first. Event-free survival is 
defined as the number of days from the date of treatment initiation (i.e., C1D1) to the 
date of documented treatment failure, relapses from CR, or death from any cause, 
whichever occurs first, and will be calculated for all patients. In the event that neither 
disease progression or death is documented prior to study termination, analysis cutoff, 
or the start of confounding anticancer therapy, these endpoints will be censored at the 
date of last tumor assessment date. 
 
In addition, relationships between anti-tumor activity, PDn markers, exploratory 
biomarkers, and drug exposure levels will be explored. 
 
6.2.3. Primary Safety Endpoint 
 
Primary safety endpoint: The overall incidence and severity of all adverse events using 
Common Toxicity Criteria v 4.0.   
 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment 
with a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  Adverse events (AEs) will be collected using the Leukemia AE 
guidelines. 
Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which 
occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease 
or for the modification of physiologic function. 
All “suspected adverse reactions” (as defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a)) will be captured in 
the case report forms.  For abnormal chemical values grade 3 or 4, the apogee will be 
reported per course in the CRF. 
Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fundamental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not been administered, 1) the 
event would not have happened at all, 2) the event would have occurred later than it 
actually did, or 3) the event would have been less severe. 
The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for all 
subjects enrolled on the trial.

Page 26 of 39 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
- Death 
- A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the 
adverse experience as it occurred.  It does not include an adverse experience that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
- Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
(21 CFR 312.32). 
- Important medical events as defined above may also be considered serious 
adverse events.  Any important medical event can and should be reported as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND 
office. 
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined 
in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board 
Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated  Adverse Events for Drugs and 
Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, 
must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of 
knowledge of the event). 
Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_433422].  Following signature, the Case Report 
Form will be used as source documentation for the adverse events for attribution. 
All life-threatening or fatal events , that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of 
the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.

6.2.5. Procedure in Case of Pregnancy 
 
If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study 
dosing period or within [ADDRESS_549297] menstruation, 
estimated fertility date, pregnancy result and neonatal data etc., should be included in 
this information.  The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as 
the fetus, as if the pregnancy is an SAE. 
 
When the outcome of the pregnancy falls under the criteria for SAEs [spontaneous 
abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly (including 
anomaly in a miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the 
report procedure for SAEs. Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy

forwarded to Calithera within [ADDRESS_549300] be reported to Calithera if and when they occur.  Additionally, in 
order to fulfill international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study 
participation (e.g., procedures, invasive tests, change from existing therapy) or are 
related to a concurrent medication will be collected and recorded from the time the 
subject consents to participate in the study until he/she is discharged.

8.1. Statistical Design 
 
This is a single institution phase Ib/II study to determine the safety, tolerability and 
clinical activity of telaglenastat in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for patients with 
advanced MDS.  Up to [ADDRESS_549305] not experienced DLT, or considered non-evaluable 
for DLT or response. 
 
 
8.1.1 Phase Ib: 
The Phase Ib part of the study is performed to assess the safety of telaglenastat in 
combination with AZA.  We will first enroll [ADDRESS_549306] 2 
of 6 patients experience DLTs, then the MTD has been exceeded and 6 patients will be 
treated at the lower dose level (i.e. dose level -1).  If at least [ADDRESS_549307] six 
evaluable patients complete cycle one of study treatment, prior to the Dose modification 
or Phase II. 
 
 
8.1.2. Phase II: 
The Simon minimax two-stage design will be employed for the Phase II portion.(15)  We 
assume a target response rate of 60% and a response rate of 40% or lower will be 
considered not desirable.  Response is defined as complete remission (CR), partial 
remission (PR), marrow CR (mCR), or Hematologic Improvement (HI) by [CONTACT_433451].  For example a 29% CR/PR rate was reported in the 
azacitidine arm in the randomized AZA-001 trial, and a 23% CR/PR rate and 60% ORR 
(including 37% HI) was seen in the azacitidine arm of the CALGB 9221 trial.  To 
implement the Simon’s two-stage design, the assessment window for response 
(CR+PR+mCR+HI) is defined as response occurring within the first 6 cycles of 
treatment.  With a type I error rate of 10% and 80% power, we will enroll [ADDRESS_549308] been enrolled.  If 15 or more out of these 28 patients achieve 
response, the treatment will be considered efficacious and worthy of further 
investigation.  Under this Simon’s minimax two-stage design, the probability of early 
termination is 53% and the expected sample size is 22 if the true response rate is 40%.

A Response Summary will be submitted to the IND Office Medical Monitor after 15 
evaluable patients complete 6 cycles of study treatment. 
 
8.1.3. Toxicity: 
The method of Thall, Simon and Estey will be used for toxicity monitoring for the Phase 
II part of this study.(16)  For monitoring purposes, toxicity is defined as DLT which 
occurs  during the first cycle.  Denote the probability of toxicity by P T. We assume as a 
priori, P T ~ beta (0.6, 1.4).  Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433428](P T > 0.30 | 
data)>0.90.  That is, we will stop the trial for new patient enrollment if at any time during 
the study; we determine that there is more than 90% chance that the toxicity rate is 
more than 30%. This toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433429] 7, starting 
from the 7th patient.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433430] 1. The operating characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The design

8.2 Analysis Populations: 
 
8.2.1. Safety Population 
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of telaglenastat will be included in the analysis 
of safety regardless of the duration of treatment. Patients who experience adverse 
events during the Screening period but who do not start on study treatment due to 
reasons that include, but are not limited to ineligibility/screen failure, death or withdrawal 
of consent, will not be included in the safety population. 
 
8.2.2. DLT-evaluable: 
Unless doses are missed in Cycle 1 due to DLT(s), a patient must receive at least 85% 
of the planned doses of telaglenastat and at least > [ADDRESS_549311] 85% of 
the telaglenastat doses and at least [ADDRESS_549312] cycle of 
treatment will be considered non-evaluable for response and may be replaced.  
 
8.3. Analysis Plan: 
During Phase II portion, if [ADDRESS_549313] been enrolled.  If 15 or 
more out of these 28 patients achieve response, the treatment will be considered 
efficacious and worthy of further investigation.  The rates of response 
(CR+PR+mCR+HI) to therapy will be estimated along with the 95% confidence interval. 
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the probabilities of event-free 
survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and duration of response. Log-rank tests will be 
used to compare among subgroups of patients in terms of EFS, OS or duration of 
response. Anti-tumor activity, PDn markers, exploratory biomarkers and drug exposure 
levels will be summarized graphically and with descriptive statistics. Safety data will be 
summarized using frequency and percentage, by [CONTACT_115189].

APPENDIX B: PK Collection of Specimens 
Approximately 2ml of blood will be collected via peripheral venipuncture into an EDTA 
tube (lavender top). This blood sample will be used to measure concentrations of 
telaglenastat (CB-839) of each pharmacokinetic blood collection. The time of collection 
must be noted in the source documents and eCRFs.  
For collecting specimens, the following protocol should be followed: 
Label a 3.0 mL K2EDTA vacutainer tube.
Label 2 cryovials.
Prepare an ice bucket.
Draw blood into the 3.0 mL vacutainer tube. Ensure that tube is filled with a
minimum of 2 mL of blood.
Samples should be thoroughly mixed by [CONTACT_433454] [ADDRESS_549316] with a fresh vacutainer.
The whole blood samples should be placed on ice immediately after collection.
Try not to wet the label.
Plasma should be prepared within 30 minutes of collection by [CONTACT_433455] 2000 x g for 10 minutes at 4˚C.
Split the resultant plasma into two aliquots of approximately equal amounts (at
least 0.3 mL) and transfer into the two labeled cryovials.
Place each of the three samples immediately into the cryobox and store at -
70˚C until shipment.
Note: PK assay will be conducted at a central laboratory where the assay for CB-839 has 
been validated. Details are given below and in the laboratory manual:

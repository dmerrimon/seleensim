TITLE:  
Assessing the Feasibility of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Reimagine Primary 
Care Clinics  
 
SUMMARY : 
A parallel randomized, multi -site prospective trial was conducted at four Intermountain 
Healthcare Clinics using a new CGM device (Dexcom G6) compared to a standard of care finger 
stick glucometer (FSG) (Contour Next One). All participants received usual care in Primary Care 
clinics for six consecutive months while using these d evices. Data were  collected via  electronic 
medical record s, device outputs, exit surveys, and insurance company (SelectHealth) claims in 
accordance with Institutional Review Board approval.

Title:  Assessing the Feasibility of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in 
Reimagine Primary Care Clinics  
Location:  Intermountain Healthcare’s Reimagine Primary Care Clinics 
(Cottonwood Family Practice, Cottonwood Senior, Avenues Internal 
Medicine, and Holladay Internal Medicine)  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_367688], MD, MPH  
Co-Investigator:  Brad Isaacson, PhD, MBA, MSF  
Sponsor:  Intermountain Healthcare  
When:  13 Months (November 1, 2018 – December 31, 2019)  
Background:  Intermountain is conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_367689]  
(CGM) to understand if this study can help with diabetes 
management. Successful demonstration of CGM may allow patients 
to manage their condition, which may avoid the highs and lows of 
glucose monitoring and make patients feel better. This may reduce 
healthcare utilization and cost for the patients and the healthcare 
system on a whole.  
We are asking you to join because you have been identified as a 
patient in one of our Reimagine Primary  Care clinics who may 
benefit from enhanced diabetic management. You are being asked 
to track your glucose levels and share feedback and your clinical 
experience to improve our clinical workflows. Your contribution will 
involve downloading mobile applicati ons, entering/tracking your data, 
engaging with your physicians, and participating in an exit survey. As 
part of this study, you will be randomly put into one of two groups. 
The people in one of these groups will receive care as usual which 
involves checki ng sugars with a finger stick and a familiar 
glucometer. The people in the other group will check sugars with an 
FDA-approved device that monitors sugars continuously and does 
not involve finger sticks. Approximately 125 people will take part in 
this study  at Intermountain Healthcare. The length of participation in

IRB EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_2352]: 11/18/[ADDRESS_459710] a 50% chance of 
being in either study group. Group #1 will use the Dexcom G6 continuous monitor or “Dexcom CGM”. Group 
#[ADDRESS_459711] of care which means that you will check your sugars with a ContourNext One gluc ometer 
as many times as is determined appropriate by [CONTACT_367697]. If you are randomized into Group #1, your 
coordinator will instruct you on how to properly install the device. You will then be required to wear the patch 
for the duration of the stu dy (6 months). The patch will need to be changed every ten days and your 
coordinator will also instruct you on how to do this and will provide you with enough patches to last the duration 
of the study. The Dexcom CGM and ContourNext One devices are equippe d with Bluetooth and data will be 
automatically uploaded and sent to Intermountain Healthcare personnel through online portals. This will require 
downloading applications on your phone (apps) (e.g. Dexcom G6, Dexcom Clarity, ContourNext One) to view 
and tr ansmit your data. A pamphlet with pi[INVESTIGATOR_367690] 
(Appendix A). During your study participation two blood draws will be required to compare HbA1c levels at 
study start up at study closing. The first blood dra w will be performed on day of consent and the last blood 
draw will be performed upon study completion (6 month follow up ± 2 weeks). Cost of the first blood draw will 
be fully covered by [CONTACT_367698] . If your insurance 
will cover a [ADDRESS_459712] those samples for data comparison.  
Risks  
Patient safety is our number one goal, however wi th any research trial there may be risks involved. The 
primary risks of this study are to your privacy. All glucose -related data will be secured in approved  
Intermountain apps (REDCap, Contour Next and/or Dexcom Clarity). Data from Intermountain Healthcar e’s 
Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), which stores your standard health record information (medications, 
laboratory services used, clinical encounters, demographic information, etc.) will be combined to make a 
dashboard without your personal information (Ta bleau or similar) to understand the device use on care 
delivery. We may perform predictive analytics with a research partner of ours (Savvysherpa) to help future 
patients, however, your identifiable information will not be shared with that entity.  
You may also experience pain with obtaining a blood sample for the finger stick glucose readings, however it 
is just like you are already doing without any expectation for additional pain or bleeding. If you are in the 
Dexcom CGM group there is potential for pain on application of the patch every ten days, but the pain is 
about the same as a finger stick glucose. Unforeseeable risks may occur, outside of what is noted above, 
and the study team will report these findings to you if there is a health concern.  
Benefits  
You may benefit from this study if you are able to manage your glucose levels more carefully. This can improve 
your health/wellbeing and reduce doctor visits which are costly. Further, information that we learn from this 
study may help us to better treat patients in the future.

discontinue participation at any time. You can change your mind later and ask us to stop collectin g your 
information. You can give this notice to your study team or mail it to:

You may be voluntary terminated from this study if you fail to use the glucose devices and report data back on 
a daily basis. You will be notified by [CONTACT_941] s tudy personnel if this occurs. Further, if new study findings are 
discovered that may influence your decision to participate in this study (e.g. additional risks), then they will be 
communicated to you.  
Costs and Compensation  
You will not be charged for an y of the study costs nor will your insurance. You will not be paid for being in this 
study, but you will receive the appropriate glucose meter and replacements sensors/strips for participation 
during the study period. These devices/strips/sensors will be p aid for by [CONTACT_367699], we will ask you to please mail the device back upon 
study completion. A prepaid card will be given to you to cover the mailing expense at the time of consent ing. 
Alternative (Non -Research) Treatments  
In this study, we will be using devices that are commercially available. The ContourNext One glucometer is the 
current standard of care and is the most accurate of its kind available while the Dexcom G6 CGM is a n ovel 
FDA-approved device that will continue to measure your glucose every [ADDRESS_459715], 
but the only other alternative for d iabetic management is diet, exercise and blood draws for HBA1c levels.  
Aside from these options, you may choose to not participate in this study.  
Will the researchers be paid for running this study?  
This study is paid for by [CONTACT_367700]. The researchers do not receive extra payment for 
conducting this study.  
In research a conflict of interest (COI) can happen when someone has more than one interest in the study. For 
example, a physician doing research could also own stock in a company that is paying for his or her research 
or the development of a new drug or p roduct used in a study. In this study, the researchers have indicated that 
they do not have any conflicts of interest.  
Research Injury:  
If you become injured while taking part in this study, Intermountain Healthcare can provide medical treatment. 
We will b ill you or your insurance company in the usual way. Because this is a research study, some insurance 
plans may not pay for your treatment. If you believe you have been injured as a result of being in this study, 
please call the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_367691]. You may also contact [CONTACT_367701] (IRB) at 1 -[PHONE_7601] or [EMAIL_7071].

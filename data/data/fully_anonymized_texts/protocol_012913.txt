The content of this appendix is confidential and should only be viewed 
by [CONTACT_146565]- Vir and NIAID in 
relation to the ACTIV -3 study.   
 
This appendix provides detailed information pertaining to the study of this investigational 
agent. If not stated otherwise, the text in the master protocol gives  the approach that will be 
taken to study this agent.    
H.2.1. Introduction and rationale for studying the agent  
 
VIR-7831 is a fully human neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) -1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) derived from antibody S309 ( 1) from a survivor of SARS -CoV-1. Vir-7831  
targets a highly conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_146558]- CoV-1 and SARS- CoV-2, 
and potent ly neutralizes SARS- CoV- 2 in live virus assays,  preventing subsequent viral entry 
into human cells and viral  replication. VIR-7831 also contai ns a 2 amino acid Fc -modification  
(“LS”) that is designed to improve bioavailability in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_146559] -
life. VIR-7831 is expected to decrease viral replication,  mitigating the severity of disease in 
patients in whom ongoing viral replication i s an important driver of COVID -19 
pathophysiology . 
Whereas one antiviral agent (remdesivir ) has been demonstrated to have clinical benefit in 
the target population for this trial  and is now part of standard- of-care (see Appendix I), it is 
plausible that additional antiviral effects from VIR-7831 in combination with remdesivir  may 
provide additive , if not synergistic , antiviral effects and hence contribute to improvement in 
time to sustained recovery.  
VIR-7831 is being developed for treatment of COVID -19, by [CONTACT_139099], Inc. (Vir) and 
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]). Vir is a company that discovers and makes medicines.  [COMPANY_004]  is a 
global healthcare company that discovers and makes vaccines, medicines, and other health 
products. In April 2020, [COMPANY_004] and Vir entered into a collaboration to develop, register and 
commercialize VIR- 7831. Under the terms of the collaboration Vir will be the sponsor of the 
clinical studies. [COMPANY_004] will, however, be the applicant and subsequent marketing authorization holder in all countries where a marketing authorization is sought including the [LOCATION_003].  
[COMPANY_004]- VIR is  conducting a randomized, double- blind, multi -center, placebo- controlled trial of  
VIR-7831 (Study VIR -7831- 5001)( IND 1 [ZIP_CODE]) ( 2), which aims to demonstrate  the 
prevention of  progression of mild/moderate COVID -19 to severe/critical disease in adult 
participants  without need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146560] . Participants 
with early,  mild/moderate COVID -19 who are at high risk for progression of their COVID -19 
disease will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_167754] early, mild/moderate 
COVID- 19 and are at high risk of disease progression. These participants will be given a 
single intravenous infusion of VIR -7831 (500 mg)  and confined for 7 days for safety 
monitoring.  Following a safety assessment of unblinded data through 14 days (Day 15) of 
follow- up by [CONTACT_146566] (IDMC;  comparable with the 
DSMB for the TICO master protocol), the expansion phase of Study VIR -7831- 5001 will 
progress, where additional participants with early, mild/moderate COVID -[ADDRESS_167755] 21 participant s in the trial referred to above (VIR-7831-
5001) is summarized below (section H2.1.1) and included in the ACTIV -3 informed consent 
relating to the investigation of VIR -7831 in ACTIV -3.  
 
H2.1.1 Potential risk and benefits from VIR-7831  
VIR-7831 targets a highly conserved protein/glycan epi[INVESTIGATOR_146561] -CoV-[ADDRESS_167756] from the receptor- binding motif. VIR-7831 has been demonstrated in vitro to be a 
highly potent fully human IgG neutralizing SARS -CoV- 2 antibody which has the potential to 
be an effective therapeutic in severe to critically ill patients with COVID- 19 (1). 
The anticipated safety risk is considered low , based on the known mechanism of action for 
human derived neutralizing antibodies in acute viral disease states.  VIR-7831 is a highly 
specific m Ab directed at foreign (non- human) epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230](s).  The complementarity determining 
regions (CDRs) of VIR-7831 are identical - except for one amino acid substitution (N55Q) 
introduced to aid antibody developability - to the parent mAb (S309) derived from B 
lymphocytes of a naturally convalescent SARS -CoV-1- infected patient. The Fc domain of 
VIR-7831 also contains a two amino acid modification (LS) in order to increase lung tissue 
bioavailability ( 3) and extend half -life (4). Hence, VIR -7831 has undergone natural positive 
and negative selection pressures in vivo, unlike humanized antibodies generated in mice.  
Therefore, off -target binding and tissue cross -reactivity are considered unlikely , which is 
further supported by [CONTACT_146567] a tissue cross-
reactivity study . In addition, there were no VIR‑ 7831- related safety  findings identified in a 
GLP cynomolgus monkey 2- week repeat -dose IV infusion toxicology study up to 500 mg/kg, 
the no-observed- adverse- effect -level (NOAEL ) and highest dose tested. The study is 
currently in the 105- day (approximately 5 half -lives) recovery  phase (IB Section 4.3, ( 5)).      
 Potential risks associated with the infusion of an IgG1 mAb directed toward a microbial pathogen are primarily infusion -related immediate and non- immediate hypersensitivity 
reactions. In vitro  studies in which cells (moDC, PBMC and U937) infected with SAR -CoV-
2 were exposed to VIR -7831, did not reveal release of cytokines or chemokines  (IB Section 
4.1.2, (5)). Signs and symptoms of infusion- related immediate hypersensitiv ity reactions 
may include, but  are not limited to: anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, chills, 
diarrhea, hypotension, itching, skin rash, shortness of breath, urticaria, tachycardia, and throat irritation or chest  tightness.   
 The VIR -7831- [ADDRESS_167757]  the risk:benefit profile of VIR -7831. A review of blinde d data by 
[CONTACT_146568] 1 and maximally grade 2 (using the DAIDS adverse event scale), and this included 
dehydration and feeling cold.    
There is a theoretical risk that VIR-7831 may cause antibody -dependent enhancement 
(ADE) of viral replication or disease.   Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease 
theoretically can occur via one of three previously described mechanisms:  
1. By [CONTACT_146569];    
2. By [CONTACT_139129], enhancing viral replication in these 
cells.  
3. By [CONTACT_146570]- antibody related immune complex 
deposition or  complement activation and immune cell recruitment in target organs;  
The first two mechanisms are hypothesized to occur at sub- neutralizing antibody 
concentrations ( 6) and have been  observed with some monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_146562] .  Unlike ADE 
associated with Dengue and Zika virus infections, this phenomenon has not been clearly 
established for coronavir us infections, such as severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] ( SARS) 
and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] ( MERS) , and has not been reported to date with 
SARS- CoV-2.  This study will include participant follow -up for [ADDRESS_167758] mechanism is hypothesized to occur at high levels of antigen 
(i.e., viral load) and antibody potentially leading to immune complex deposition and 
complement activation or FcγR activation in tissue sites of high viral replication.  This may 
manifest as acute deterioration temporally associated with VIR -7831 infusion or as 
increased severity or duration of illness in VIR -7831- treated participants vs. placebo- treated 
participants .  Limited experience with the use of convalescent serum as a treatment for 
patients  with severe COVID -19 has not indicated safety concerns  related to this type of  ADE 
(7). VIR-7831 will be administered to patients at sufficiently high dose levels to neutralize 
SARS- CoV-2 and avoid sub- neutralizing concentrations in the presence of virus that are  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_146563].  Furthermore, n o evidence of ADE of infection was observed 
at sub- neutralizing concentrations of VIR-7831 in several  in vitro assays . Specifically, there 
was no increase in internalization of SARS -CoV- 2 and no increased replication of SARS -
CoV- 2 in VeroE6 control cells, monocyte- derived dendritic cells, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells, or the monocytic cell line U937 in the presence of VIR -7831 ( IB Section 
4.1.2, (5)). If ADE occurs, it will likely manifest clinically as an imbalance in the severity or 
duration of illness in the VIR -7831 arm  compared with the placebo arm . 
 
A Vir -mAb targeting Influenza A (VIR -2482) with the same LS modification as 7831 has been 
trialled in healthy volunteers.  Injection site reactions (erythema, pain, swelling and bruising) 
were uncommon, all were mild and generally resolved within 48 hours.  There were no 
treatment -related discontinuations and no SAEs  (unpublished data) ( 8). 
 Another NIH/NIAID  mAb (VRC01LS) with the LS modification targeting HIV  is in 
development  and was  administered to 70 healthy volunteers  in a phase 1 study  (9).  There  
were no SAEs  in this study .  Post administration symptoms were mild or moderate for both 
objective local and systemic reactions .  Six AEs were assessed as possibly related to 
VRC01LS administration and all were mild in severity.  Two reports of diarrho ea, one in 
group 1 (5 mg/kg IV)  and one in group 5 (5 mg/kg subcut), occurred on the day of VRC01LS 
administration and resolved the same day.  One group [ADDRESS_167759] administration.  Two AEs in group 5 were due to elevated alanine 
aminotransferase levels (56 and 69 IU/L) on day [ADDRESS_167760] injection and both resolved within 15 days after onset.  
 More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expec ted adverse events of VIR-7831 may  be found in the Investigator’s Brochure ( 14) and 
Participant Information Leaflet .   
 Given the safety profile of VIR 7831 in the nonclinical studies and the well -established safety 
profile of human- derived monoclonal antibodies  with similar Fc modifications, and the limited 
disease directed therapeutic options for patients with COVID -19 illness, the overall benefit -
risk assessment of this study is considered favorable.  
 
H2.1.2 Motivation for agent selection by [CONTACT_146571] (TOC)  
The ACTIV -2/3 Agent Selection Committee (ASC) reviewed the [COMPANY_004] -Vir SARS- CoV-2 
neutralizing antibody voted in favor of the agent proceeding into ACTIV -3, and the TOC 
endorsed that recommendation.  [COMPANY_004] -Vir’s Vir -[ADDRESS_167761]  SARS- CoV- 2 strain [LOCATION_003]- WA1/2020 yielded a mean IC
50 of 
79 ng/mL (Diamond Laboratory). VIR -7831 was found to neutralize [LOCATION_003]- WA1/2020 with a 
mean IC 50 and IC 90 of 100 ng/ml and 186 ng/ml, respectively (VIR Biotechnology).   VIR-
7831 binds to recombinant SARS -CoV-2- RBD protein  with an equilibrium constant (KD) of 
0.21 nM as determined by [CONTACT_146572].  Passaging of SARS -CoV- 2 for 
>1 month in the presence of fixed concentrations of antibody demonstrated no emergence 
of viral escape mutants even at the minimum antibody concentration tested (10x IC 50), 
indicating the potential for this antibody to have a high barrier to resistance. 
[COMPANY_004]- Vir also provided a strong rationale for their choice of dosing for their agent which was 
strongly supported by [CONTACT_146573]. The ASC also noted that the 
proposed LS mutation clearly increases the plasma half -life of mAbs, data to support an 
effect of the LS mutation on tissue distribution (and specifically lung distribution) of infused 
mAbs are more nascent. In addition, [COMPANY_004]- Vir was  the first company to perform in vitro  
testing of their candidate mAb with remdesivir, giving consideration to their desired entry to 
ACTIV- [ADDRESS_167762] of care for 
in-patient study participants.   Finally, the ASC found the manufacturing and scalability 
strategy for [COMPANY_004] -Vir sufficient for the full trial and beyond.   
[COMPANY_004]/Vir  statement regarding plans for licensure:  [COMPANY_004]  is a global pharmaceutical company 
and attempts to bring important medical breakthroughs to as many patients in as many 
countries as possible. It would therefore be their general intent to pursue licensure in 
countries where the trial is being conducted.  In the case of the COVID -19 pandemic, the 
actual decision to pursue licensure will be impacted by [CONTACT_146574]: 
status of the COVID -19 pandemic in the country and medical need, availability of other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_146564], available drug supply and other supply feasibility issues, and 
other regulatory considerations .  
H2.1.3 Justification for dose chosen for VIR- 7831  
A single dose of 500 mg was selected for the study based on in vitro neutralization data, in 
vitro resistance data, expected human PK extrapolated from a study in cynomolgus monkeys, and the results of the GLP monkey toxicology study.  
VIR-7831 neutralized SARS -CoV- 2 live virus with a n average EC
90 value of 186.3 ng/mL 
(range: 125.8 – 329.5 ng/mL) (IB Section [IP_ADDRESS], (5)). In resistance analyses, no viral 
breakthrough was observed through [ADDRESS_167763] dose tested (~10x EC 50), indicating the potential for VIR -[ADDRESS_167764] a high 
barrier to resistance (IB Section [IP_ADDRESS], (5)). 
Using an increasing concentration selection method to force resistance emergence, modest fold changes in EC
50 were observed during viral selection (5- to 6-fold change in EC 50) for 
some passages (IB Section [IP_ADDRESS], (5)). Sequencing and testing of spi[INVESTIGATOR_139066] a pseudotyped virus system did not identify causal var iants for this 
modest shift in potency. One passage of virus did demonstrate a >10- fold shift in EC 50 which 
correlated with an E340A mutation. Further assessment has identified E340A to be a 
monoclonal antibody -resistant mutant (MARM) that confers a >100-f old reduction in 
susceptibility to VIR -7831. Notably, E340 is 100% conserved among available SARS -CoV-
2 sequences  (IB Section 1.3.2, (5)). Due to the binary nature of the resistance selection 
results, a specific inhibitory quotient (IQ) was not informed by [CONTACT_139110]. 
However, as our understanding of the biology of SARS -CoV- 2 is currently still limited and 
very few strains are available to directly assess breadth of coverage, a conservative IQ (>10) 
is appropriate in thi s case.  
The cynomolgus monkey PK study (single IV dose, 5 mg/kg, IB section 4.2, (14)) was fit to 
a 2 compartment PK model. Human PK parameters were scaled from the cynomolgus monkey using an allometric scaling approach for fully human IgGs (allometric coefficient of 
0.85 and 1 for CL and V, respectively; 10). The predicted serum clearance of VIR -7831 in 
humans is estimated to be 141 mL/day and estimated volume of distribution is 6500 mL 
(~93 mL/kg) assuming human weight of 70 kg. The projected human terminal elimination 
half-life is approximately 32 days.  
In order to reduce risk to patients  (treatment failure, emergence of viral resistance),  a single 
therapeutic dose was selected that ensures VIR-7831 concentrations in the lung are 
maintained far  above levels anticipated to be protective for SARS- CoV- 2 infection for the 
duration of the 28- day treatment window  and beyond. A dose of 500 mg is expected to 
maintain serum levels at or above 38.5 µg/mL for the duration of the 28- day treatment 
period. Based on a conservative EC
90 (0.33 μg/mL) from the highest end of the EC 90 range 
(IB Section 4.2.7, (5)), and accounting for the lung:serum ratio for IgG (assumed 
conservative value of 0.25; reported range 0.25- 0.68 for whole lung and interstitial fluid, 
respectively; (11-14)) the serum trough concentration following a 500 mg dose is expected 
to result in lung concentrations associated with maximal (> 99%) antiviral activity; > 29 x tissue- adjusted EC
90 for the duration of the 28 day treatment period. This conservative 
inhibitory quotient (29- fold) in lung is believed to be appropriate to increase potential for 
treatment success and reduce risk for resistance.  
Additionally, a 500 mg dose is anticipated to result in protective levels of VIR -7831 in 
nasopharyngeal secretions (>5 x tissue adjusted EC 90 assuming NPS:serum ratio of 0.05, 
12) which could potentially reduce transmission.  
The NOAEL for VIR -7831 was 500 mg/kg, the highest dose tested, when VIR -7831 was 
administered via IV infusion once a week for 2 weeks in cynomolgus monkeys ( IB Section 
4.3, (5)). At this NOAEL, preliminary C max and area- under -the-curve ( AUC) 0-t (AUC from time 
[ADDRESS_167765] -end of infusion following the 2nd dose) were [ZIP_CODE] μg/mL and 
[ZIP_CODE] μg•day /mL, respectively. The human equivalent dose (HED) (HED calculated via 
direct mg/kg conversion according to FDA guidance on proteins administered intravascularly 
with Mr  > 100,000 daltons; (15)) is 500 mg/kg or a 30,000 mg fixed dose (using human body 
weight of 60 kg). Using a safety factor of 10, the maximum recommended starting dose in 
humans is approximately 50 mg/kg or a 3,000 mg fixed dose. Based on the proposed 
500 mg human dose, the margins based on the HED, C max, and AUC (cons ervative AUC 
margin based on partial AUC 0-t  from TX -7831- 0102 and expected AUC inf in humans) are 
60-, 87-, and 13.6- fold, respectively, supporting the proposed clinical dose of 500 mg.  
 
H2.2. Agent specific eligibility criteria  
In addition to the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the master protocol, the 
following patients  will be excluded: 1)  pregnant women;  and 2) nursing mothers.  In 
addition, prior to the initial futility assessment which is performed when approximately 
[ADDRESS_167766] been enrolled on VIR -7831 and 150 on placebo, patients  on high-
flow oxygen or non- invasive ventilation (category 5 of the pulmonary ordinal outcome) 
will be excluded.  These patients  may be eligible for the trial if the initial futility assessmen t 
is passed by [CONTACT_146575].  
H2.3. Description of investigational agent  
H2.3.1. Administration and duration

most current information on drug interactions, contraindications, and precautions.  
 
H2.3. 5. Precautionary medications  
The clinical site should have necessary equipment and medications for the management 
of any infusion reaction (see section H2.5 below).   
 
Premedication for infusions is not planned.  
 
If an infusion reaction occurs during administration or if the participant has a medical 
history suggesting a potential benefit from premedication, the study investigator(s) should determine the appropriate premedication.
 
 
The investigators and sponsor may decide to recommend premedication, if the frequency 
of infusion reactions among participants warrants it.  If minor infusion reactions are 
observed, administration of acetaminophen, 500 mg to 1000 mg, antihistamines and/or other appropriately indicated medications may be given prior to the start of infusions for subsequent participants. The decision to implement premedication for infusions in subsequent participants will be made by [CONTACT_146577]. Any pre- medications given will be documented as a 
concomitant therapy.
 
H2.4. Clinical and laboratory evaluations 
 H2.4.1 Timing of Assessments 
Appendix B outlines the clinical and laboratory monitoring of the master protocol . 
Assessment and reporting of AEs (section 10.1.1), SAEs (section 10.1.2) and 
unanticipated problems (section 10.1.3) and their severity, causality (sect ion 10.1.5) and 
expectedness (section 10.1.6) is performed as outlined in the relevant section of the 
master protocol
.  
 
H2.4.2 Immunogenicity Assessments  
At the visits specified in the master protocol  (Days 0, 28, and 90) venous blood samples 
will be collected to determine antibody production against VIR-7831. Immunogenicity 
may be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect ADAs in the presence of VIR-
7831. Antibodies may be further characterized for their ability to neutralize the activity of VIR-7831. Remaining volume from the PK sample  may also be used for immunogenicity 
assessments as needed.    
 
H2.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
At the visits specified in the master protocol (Days 0, 1, 5 , 28, and 90)  venous blood 
samples will be collected to determine VIR-7831 serum concentration for 
pharmacokinetic assessment. The PK/Immunogenicity assessment will require 2 mL of 
the serum collected, as described in the Master Protocol Appendix B as “Research 
Sample Storage”.   PK samples may be assessed by a validated assay at a bioanalytical 
lab. The PK assessment will use the same 2 ml serum specified for the Immunogenicity 
assessment (see section H2.4.2). Analysis of samples from placebo- treated subjects is 
not planned. Remaining sample used for PK  may be pooled and used for exploratory 
metabolism or bioanalytical method experiments as deemed appropriate. S amples 
maybe shipped to the lab for analyses in batches as the substudy is unfolding. Results 
from such analyses will be returned to the trial central database. This data and all other 
data on the participants will remain in the trial central database until the trial is unblinded.  
H2.5. Clinical management issues  
All participants should be monitored closely  for 2 hours  after the infusion, as there is a 
risk of infusion reaction and hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) with any biological 
agent.  
H2.5.1. Symptoms and Signs  
Symptoms and signs that may occur as part of an infusion reaction , include, but are not 
limited to , fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema, 
throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, and dizziness.  
H2.5.2. Site Needs  
The clinical site should have necessary equipment , medications , adequately qualified 
and experienced staff with appropriate medical cover  for the management of any infusion 
reaction, which may include, but is not limited to , oxygen, IV fluid, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  
(/adrenaline) , acetaminophen (/paracetamol)  and antihistamine.  
Pharmacy procedures in the PIM outlines needs of the study site pharmacy and/or local site pharmacy.  
H2.5.3. Management of Infusion Reactions  including D iscontinuation 
If the participant experiences  an infusion reaction, then supportive care should be used 
in accordance with the signs and symptoms. If a severe and potentially life- threatening 
infusion reaction occurs with VIR-7831/placebo, its use should be permanently 
discontinued.  
If a participant is not infused with VIR-7831/placebo or the complete infusion is not given, 
all follow- up procedures and reporting’s outlined in the master protocol (Appendix B for 
overview), should be adhered to as indicated.  
H2.5.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
 
The following are AESIs for the agent VIR-7831 or placebo for VIR-7831:  
• Infusion- related reactions  
• Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions

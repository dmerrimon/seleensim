RATIONALE Patients who are experiencing the effects of gastritis, which is an inflammation,
iritation, or srosion of thc lining of lhe stomach rcquirc an identification of thc
status and gcneration ofurcasc in the stomach to providc a dchnitivc diagnosis.
Historically, this has been achieved via an upper endoscopy, whcre a thin tube
containing a tiny camcra, is inserted througlt your mouth and down into your
stomach to look at thc stolnach lining. The doctor will check for inflanttnation and
may pertbnn a biopsy, a proccdure in which a tiny sample of tissuc is removcd and
then sent to a laboratory for analysis.
By [CONTACT_279794] a low dosage of C13 urea, the patients'exhaled breath is then measured
to record thc lcvcl of change of llc labclc(l urca dcloctablc in a paticut's brcatir. 'I'his

results shall be graphed per subject and overall ofall subjects per study group. This
is to illustate adversity from start oftesting through the most rccent testing pcr
study group.
Rationale for Number of
SubjectsThe clinical studies for the ARJ Cl3 Urea Breath Test predicate device Pylo-Plus
(K052708) included 100 study subjects.
The recent clearance (May 2013) of the Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. Breath ID Hp
System (K130524) included 79 pre-treatment study subjects.
The rationale to use approximately 100 - 300 study subjects shows equivalency to
the two (2) related clinical studies.

Protocol Number: ARJ 2014-[ADDRESS_1020594] that the
disease has relatively low mortality, it results in substantial suffering ofthose affected.
A shong association between H. pylori, chironic superficial gastritis and gaskointestinal disease has been well
established. H'pylori is associated with type B gastritis, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, and non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma.
H. pylori was first cultured successfully from human gastric mucosa in 1982. The organisms, spi[INVESTIGATOR_746152], are found in the human stomach between the gastric epi[INVESTIGATOR_746153]. Isolates implicateJin the
above mentioned diseased states are distinguished by [CONTACT_746164][INVESTIGATOR_746154] (urease). The enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of urea to iarbon dioxide and am-monia, which are
absorbed into the bloodstoeam.
Methods available for detecting current infection of the human stomach by H. pylori are generally divided into two
general types: Invasive and Non-invasive. Invasive methods are so called becauie they include, as a frst step, an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy ("EGD") with collection of gastric biopsies. These biopsies are then examined by
[CONTACT_746165]: histological examination of stained tissue, microbiological culture of the organism,
or direct detection of urease activity in the tissue (for example, the CLOtest@). Biopsy based methods are
expensive, entail some patient risk and discomfort, and may give false negafive resulti du" to sampling errors when
colonization of the gastric mucosa is patchy.
The Cl3 Urea Breath Test kit is intended for use with the ARI Breath Test Analyzer, which is a combined product
referred to as the ARJ Cl3 Breath Test System for the qualitative detection of urease associated with Helicobacterpylori as an aid in detecting H.pylori.
2 STUDY RATIONALE
Cashitis describes a group of conditions with one thing in common: inilammation of the lining of the stomach. Theinflammation of gashitis is most often the result of infection with the same bactsrium that cauics most stomach
ulcers, Injury, regular use of certain pain relievers and drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis
Flelicobacter pylori (l-1. pylori): A bacteria that livcs in the mucous lining of thc stornach; without trcatmcnt, the
inl'ection can lead to ulcers, and in sonre people, stomach cancer^
Patients who are experiencing the affects of gastritis, which is an inflammati6n, irritation, or erosion of the lining ofthc stomach require an identi tication of the status and generatiein of rrcase in the stomach to provide a tlefinitivc
diagnosis.
By.ingesting a low dosage ofCl3 urea, the patients'exhaled breath is then measured to record thc lcvcl olchangco[l]C labclcd urca dotcctable in a paticnt's brcath. I'his is mcasurcd belilre and alicr thc ingestion olrhe urea

II ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTTNG AND DOCUMENTATIONConfidential
f 1.l Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurence in a clinical investigation of a patient administered a
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE is
therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease
temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that
investigational product. An unexpected AE is one ofa type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the
current Investigator's Brochure or ofgreater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the
Investigator's Brochwe.
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence ofAEs during each subject visit and
record the information in the site's source documents. Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.
Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, trcatment and
relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.
AE Severi$
The National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 should
be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The
modified criteria can be found in the study manual. It should be pointed out that the term "seyere" is a measure of
intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.
AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines in Table 12.
Table 1. AE Relationship to Study Drug
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:
r death
r a life-threatening adverse experience
o inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746158]; or an evcnt that fbllows a reasonable tcmporal sequcncc
from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expccted response pattern to the
suspectcd drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_746159]; and that is
not explaincd by [CONTACT_746173].
Probably An cvcnt that follows a reasonablc temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that
tbllows a known or expected rc$ponse pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed try
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is untikely to be explained by [CONTACT_746174]'s clinical statc or by [CONTACT_746175].
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that
follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily
have been produced by a number ofother factors.
Unrelatcd An cvcnt that can bc determined with certainty to have no rclationship to thc study drug.

o a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
. a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment,
they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.
ll.2.l Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
The study site will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF -ellR Guidelines.
The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the
final study visit have been completed.
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies ofthe local Institutional Review Board
(IRB)ilndependent Ethics Committee (lEC), the site investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.

for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
Use of a prohibited concomitant medication
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol violation. The
Sponsor will determine if a protocol violation will result in withdrawal of a subject.
When a protocol violation occlus, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol Violation Form detailing
the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written describing all
analyses that will be performed. The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan described below.
14.[ADDRESS_1020618] one dose of the study drug (the Safety
Population) will be included in the safety analysis.
14.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized by: [CONTACT_545], gender, age, height and weight.
14.3 Interim Analysis
Interim study analysis shall be performed after the initial two weeks of testing and again at the end of one month of
testing. Analysis will continue on a monthly basis until the end of the study.
14.4 Sample Size and Randomization
The sample size for this protocol was determined by:
[CONTACT_746178]3 Urea Breath Test predicate device Pylo-Plus (K052708) included 100 study subjects.
Thc recent clearance (May 2013) of the Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. BreathlD Hp System (Kl30524) included 79
study subjects.
The rationale to use approximately 100 * [ADDRESS_1020619]'s visit into the
protocol-specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) OR paper CRF when the information corresponding to that
visit is available. Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_746179] (or designee), but will be identified by a site number, subject number and initials.

For eCRFs: If a conection is required for an eCM, the time and date stamps back the person entering or updating
eCRF data and creates an electronic audit trail. For paper CRFs; If a correction is made on a CRF, the study staff
member will line through the incorrect data, write in the correct data and initial and date the change.
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study. dll data collected
during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for completeness and accuacy by [CONTACT_737]. A
copy of the CRF will remain at the Investigator's site at the completion of the study.
14.[ADDRESS_1020620] been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data validation checks will be
implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. For EDC studies: Queries are entered, ffacked, and
resolved through the EDC system directly. For paper studies; Query reports (Data Clarification Requests)
pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to the Investigators and study monitors for
resolution. The study database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries. All changes to the study
database will be documented.
14.[ADDRESS_1020621] unauthorized access by [CONTACT_1627]; appropriate backup
copi[INVESTIGATOR_1493]. Databases are backed up by [CONTACT_746180].
At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), data for analysis is locksd
and cleaned per established procedures.
14.[ADDRESS_1020622] make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor
(or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request. A file for each subject must
be maintained that includes the signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization and Assent Form and copi[INVESTIGATOR_746161]. The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source
documents from which the information on the CRF was derived,
AII study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], Study File Notebook, etc.)
must be kept secured for a period of two years following marketing of the investigational product or for two years
after centers have been notified that the IND has been discontinued. There may be other circumstances for which
the Sponsor is required to maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_746181].
l4.l0Monitoring
Monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_223698] U.S. CFR Title 2l Parts 50,
56, and 312 and ICH Guidelines for GCP (E6). By [CONTACT_12570], the Investigator grant$ permission to the
Sponsor (or designee), and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-site monitoring and/or auditing ofall
appropriate study documentafion.

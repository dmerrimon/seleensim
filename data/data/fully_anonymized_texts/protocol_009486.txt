OL SYNOPSIS 
Name [CONTACT_790]/Company: The Medicines Company  
Name [CONTACT_2756]: ALN-PCSSC 
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  ALN-PCSSC is a synthetic, chemically modified small interfering ribonucleic acid  
(siRNA) targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9)  messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA 
[ALN-[ZIP_CODE]]) with a covalently attached triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc) ligand. The 
investigational product ( ALN-PCSSC) will be administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection as a formulation of 
ALN-[ZIP_CODE]. It will be supplied as a sterile  100 mg vial ( 200 mg/mL solution ) for SC injection.  
Title of Study : A placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized trial to compare the effect of different doses of 
ALN-PCSSC given as single or multiple subcutaneous injections in subjects with high cardiovascular risk and 
elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL-C). 
Phase of Development:  II 
Study Centers:  Multi-center study in North America and Europe  (approx 60 sites)  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_914737]:  
The estimated study period for the study will be [ADDRESS_1285673] completed.  
Objectives:  
Primary: 
 To evaluate the effect of ALN -PCSSC treatment on LDL -C levels at Day  180. 
Secondary:  
 To evaluate the effect of ALN -PCSSC on the following:  
o LDL-C levels at Day [ADDRESS_1285674] -PCSSC 
Exploratory:  
 To collect/evaluate  the effect of ALN -PCSSC on the following:  
o Cardiovascular ( CV) events such as CV death, non -fatal myocardial infarction (MI), resuscitated 
cardiac arrest, and non-fatal stroke ( ischemic and hemorrhagic)  
o Evaluation of a nti-drug antibodies (ADA) for the investigational product  
Methodology: This study will be a Phase II, placebo -controlled, double-blind, randomized trial in 480 subjects 
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents ( eg, diabetes and familial 
hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL -C despi[INVESTIGATOR_76578] -C lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_914738], safety,  and tolerability of AL N-PCSSC injection(s).  
Subjects will be screened and 480 eligible subjects will be randomized : [ADDRESS_1285675]-PCSSC dose groups plus 120 subjects total across the placebo groups (20 subjects each to match each of the 
six drug dose groups). Treatment allocation will be stratified by [CONTACT_875857] -
modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Each subject will either receive either one or two injections on Day [ADDRESS_1285676]-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01 
The Medicines Company Global Amendment 3  
Confidential  
4 Formation of ADA will be assessed on Day 1 (prior to and 4 hours after the injection)  and on Days 30, 60, 90, 120, 
150, 180 (Days 150 and 180 only in subjects who receive a second dose of study drug) , and [ADDRESS_1285677] not returned to 
>80% of baseline values, formation of ADA will also be assessed either when LDL -C has returned to normal limits 
or at the 1 -year follow-up visit.  
The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data beginning afte r the first [ADDRESS_1285678] an extra visit  on Day 104 (14 days after the second dose 
on Day 90) .  
Efficacy assessments will  include the  measure the effects of A LN-PCSSC on levels of  LDL-C lipi[INVESTIGATOR_914739] , triglycerides, high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), non-HDL-C, 
very low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol  (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein A1 (Apo -A1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), 
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP), and PCSK9.  
End of study (EOS) evaluations will be conducted at the EOS visit (Day 210 ). 
Subjects whose LDL -C levels have returned to baseline levels and who ha ve completed the study to Day [ADDRESS_1285679] not returned to >80% of baseline values will continue t o be followed as 
part of this study until either this level has been reached or until a maximum of Day 360 at which point they will be 
given the opportunity to enroll i n the long -term extension study . At each visit, LDL -C levels, adverse events (AEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), concomitant medications, and safety laboratory assessments will be collected.

Safety: AEs, SAEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory values (h ematology, coagulation  testing, chemistry, and 
urinalysis) , and electrocardiograms (ECGs)  will be collected at specified visits through the EOS visit (Day 210) . 
AEs, SAEs, and clinical laboratory values will continue to be assessed during the additional monthly f ollow-up 
visits (for subjects in whom LDL -C levels have not returned to >80% of baseline values ). Cardiovascular events 
will be reported  as AEs for the compi[INVESTIGATOR_914741], non -fatal MI, 
resuscitated cardiac ar rest, and non -fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) . In addition, ADA will be evaluated  
for the investigational product . 
Statistical Methods : 
Sample Size and Power  
The sample size calculation was performed with the assumption (which was based on the observed results from a 
Phase I trial) that the difference in change from baseline between the active dose groups and the placebo group for 
LDL-C will be no less than 30  mg/dL, with a standard deviation of 20 mg/dL , using a Dunnet multiple t -test 
procedure  for six comparisons.  
Assuming about a 15% drop out rate, the sample size will be approximately [ADDRESS_1285684] 
400 evaluable subjects will provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction of LDL -C levels in at least 
one ALN -PCSSC dose group.  
Primary Endpoint Analysis:  
Two sample t -tests will be performed to test the superiority of any dosing group over placebo. A Dun net multiple t -
test procedure will be applied to adjust for multiple comparisons with six different dosing regimens . 
Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint Analysis:  
The analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will be descriptive.  
Interim Analysis:  
An interim analysis of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_442083]9 , unblinded by [CONTACT_914762], will be prepared upon completion of

1.1. Background 
1.1.1. Disease Overview 
Acc
ording to the World Health Organization (WHO), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), comprised mainly of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, is the leading cause of 
death worldwide, resulting in 17 million deaths annually [ WHO Cardiovascular Statistics, 2011 ]. 
Data from the INTERHEART case-control study estimates that 45% of myocardial infarctions 
(MI) in Western Europe and 35% of myocardial infarctions in Central and Eastern Europe are 
due to abnormalities in blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] [ Yusef et al, 2004 ]. In particular, elevated LDL -C, has been 
shown in multiple studies to be one of the major risk factors for CHD with a continuous and 
graded relationship between plasma LDL-C concentration and CHD risk. For every 30 mg/dL 
(0.78 mmol/L) change in LDL-C, the relative risk for CHD changes by [CONTACT_3450] 30% 
[Grundy
 et al, 2004]. In addition a large meta-analysis of 21 statin studies concluded that for 
every 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C (with statin therapy) there is an approximate 
22% reduction in cardiovascular events [ CTT e
t al, 2010]. While statins are the treatment of 
choice fo
r hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_914744] a
nd secondary prevention of ASCVD there is still a 
need for additional lipid-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_914745]-C levels or 
sufficient percent reductions in LDL-C to attenuate their ASCVD risk. Furthermore, in many 
patients, statin therapy cannot be optimized as pa
tients are either intolerant of statins due to side 
effects (most commonly muscle pain, myopathy
 myositis) or because of other adverse effects 
such as elevations in liver enzymes. These limitations of contemporary therapy are particularly 
relevant among patients with pre-existing ASCVD such as diabetes, or patients with familial 
hypercholesterolemia who are at the highest risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events, and hence 
require the most intensive and aggressive management of hypercholesterolemia [ Davidson et al, 
2005; Nag et al, 2007 ; Reiner et al, 2011 ; Stone et al, 2014 ]. Among these high-risk subjects, less 
than 50% achieved the target LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL at [ADDRESS_1285700]-statin treatment 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_265251] [ Foley et al, 2003; Kearney et al, 2008 ; 
C
TT et al, 2010; Foody et al, 2010]. Thus, there remains a clear unmet medica l need for 
lowering LDL-C, especially in certain patient populations.  
1.1.2. PCSK9 Biology and Target Rationale 
Propr
otein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a member of the subtilisin serine 
protease family. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 is predominantly expressed by [CONTACT_265270]-density lipoprotein receptor 
(LDLR) expression [ Mousavi et al, 2009]. LDL-C levels in plasma are markedly elevated in 
humans with gain of function mutations in PCSK9, c
lassifying them as having severe familial 
hypercholesterolemia [ Abifadel et al, 2003]. Data from genetic association studies have 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01 
The Medicines Company Global Amendment 3 
Confidential 16 
 identified loss
 of function alleles in human PCSK9 that result in lower PCSK9 protein levels and 
lower LDL-C levels [ Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007 ; Horton et al, 2009]. In one published 
study, heterozygous individuals (carrying a single copy of a loss of function PCSK9 mutation) 
had significantly lower LDL-C with median levels of approximately 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) 
[Cohen et al, 2006]. Over a 15-year period of retrospective data analysis, this sustained lowering 
in LDL-C levels translated to an 88% lower risk of risk for CHD. Follow-up publications 
describe two adult individuals that are compound heterozygous for loss of function alleles of 
P
CSK9. These individuals lack detectable plasma PCSK9 protein, have LDL-C levels 
≤20 mg/dL, and yet are otherwise healthy [ Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007]. Additionally, 
recent human clinical trials with PCSK9 blocking antibodies have shown significant lowering of 
LDL-C in healthy volunteers and across a range of high CV risk populations and with elevated 
LDL-C both with and without statins [ Banerjee et al, 2012 ; Dias et al, 2012 ; Milazzo et al, 2012 ; 
Raal et al, 2012 ; Roth et al, 2012 ; Stein et al, 2012 ; Sullivan et al, 2012;  Hooper et al, 2013]. 
Thus, the overall
 scientific and clinical data suggests that PCSK9 is a well-validated drug target 
whose inhibition results in significant LDL-C lowering without otherwise negatively impacting 
overall health most recently culminating in the approval (in Europe and North America) of two 
monoclonal agents to inhibit PCSK9. 
1.1.3. Mechanism of RNA Interference 
Ribonucle
ic acid (RNA) interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for 
regulating gene expression that is mediated by [CONTACT_76611] (siRNAs). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
synthetic siRNAs are 19-base to 25-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered 
duplex with a two- to four-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3’ ends. Such siRNAs can 
be desig
ned to target an endogenous messenge
r RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene. When 
introduced into cells, the guide (or antisense) strand of the siRNA loads into an enzyme complex 
called the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex. This enzyme complex subsequently binds to its 
complementary mRNA sequence, mediating cleavage of the target mRNA and the suppression of 
the target protein encoded by [CONTACT_76612] [ Elbashir et al, 2001 ].  
S
ince unmodi
fied siRNAs are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_265252] [ Soutschek et al, 2004], various formulations are 
currently used to target their distribution to tissues, and to facilitate uptake of siRNAs into the 
relevant cell type. One approach that has been used successfully in vivo, in animal models 
(including in rodents and nonhuman primates) and humans employs intravenous delivery of 
siRNA in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ; Morrissey et al, 2005 ; 
Geisbert et al, 2006 ; Judge et al, 2006 ; Zimmermann et al, 2006 ; Coelho et al, 2013 ; Tabernero 
et al, 2013]. Another approach for liver-specific gene silencing is subcutaneously administered 
siRNA conjugated to a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) carboh
ydrate ligand [ Ashwell and 
Morell, 1974]. Conjugation of a triantennary GalNAc ligand to an siRNA enables hepatocyte 
binding and subsequent cellular uptake via the asialoglycoprotein receptor, resulting in 
engagement of the RNAi pathway and down regulation of hepatic proteins. Single and multiple 
doses of subcutaneously administered siRNA-GalNAc conjugates have b
een used to target 
transthyretin (TTR) mRNA for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis. ALN-TTRCSC has 
been found to be generally safe and well tolerated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in over

.  
1.2. ALN-P
CSSC, an RNAi Therapeutic for Hypercholesterolemia 
ALN-PCSSC Solution for Injection (subcutaneous [SC] use) is comprised of the PCSK9 siRNA, 
ALN-[ZIP_CODE], f
ormulated in phosphate buffer. The PCSK9 siRNA is a chemically synthesized 
double stranded oligonucleotide covalently linked to a ligand containing GalNAc residues. This 
synthetic investigational RNAi therapeutic has been designed to suppress the liver production o f 
PCSK9 when administered via SC injection. Inhibition of PCSK9 synthesis through an RNAi 
mechanism has the potential to lower tissue and circulating plasma PCSK9 protein levels, 
resulting in higher expression of LDLR in the liver, and consequently lower L DL-C levels in the 
blood stream. The initial proposed indication for ALN-PCSSC is the treatment of subjects with 
hypercholeste
rolemia who are not achieving therapeutic LDL-C goals despi[INVESTIGATOR_265253]-lowering therapy, or for subjects who are intolerant of statins. 
1.2.1. Preclinical Studies 
The safety pharmacology and toxicology of ALN-PCSSC was evaluated in a series of in vitro 
and in vivo nonclinica
l studies. 
The drug substance in ALN-PCSSC (ALN-[ZIP_CODE]) is designed to match the human and 
cynomolgous monkey mRNA transcripts for PCSK9, sharing a substantial partial match to the 
rat PCSK9 mR
NA. ALN-[ADDRESS_1285702]-PCSSC reduced 
the expression of PCSK9 in Hep3B liver cells with a median inhibitory concentration of 20 pM 
and inhibited hP
CSK9 serum protein levels in a transgenic mouse model with a single dose 
effecti
ve dose causing 50% inhibition of approximately 2 mg/kg and an effective dose causing 
80% inhibition of approximately 6 mg/kg. In single- and multi-dose regimen studies in 
cynomolgus m
onkeys, ALN-PCSSC exhibited dose-dependent sustainable suppression of 
PCSK9 protein that was paralleled by [CONTACT_265271]-C with the same kinetics. The 
time to reac
h PCSK9 and LDL-C nadir was approximately 20 days and there was no difference 
in time to nadir between different dose levels. In single-dose studies, the maximal mean PCSK9 
and LD
L-C inhibition was 85% and 68%, respectively, which was observed at the two highest 
doses of ALN-PCSSC administered (6 and 10 mg/kg); however, the duration of PCSK9 silencing 
and LDL-C lowering was markedly extended at the higher 10 mg/kg dose. In multi-dose studies, 
the maximal m
ean PCSK9 and LDL-C inhibition was 93% and 74%, respectively, which was 
similar to that observed in the single-dose study. Following discontinuation of ALN-PCSSC 
administration, recovery of PCSK9 levels was slow, returning to baseline after [ADDRESS_1285703]-PCSSC-related changes to the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C) or triglycerides in any of the groups. As expected, total cholesterol levels were reduced 
by [CONTACT_8622] 30% refle
cting the decrease in LDL- C. 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) compliant repeat-dose studies of [ADDRESS_1285704]-PCSSC at dose levels of 10, 50, and 
250 mg/kg and once a week administration of 10 mg/kg for rats and 30 mg/kg for monkeys. The 
GLP 15-week toxicology studies in rats and monkeys involved once monthly administration of 
ALN-PCSSC at dose levels of 10, 50, and 250 mg/kg and once every other week administration 
of 125 mg/kg for rats and 25 mg/kg for monkeys. Each toxicology study also included an 8-week 
treatment-free recovery period for all dose groups. ALN-PCSSC was well tolerated in all studies 
and there were no dose-limiting toxicities. The most common findings were related to the 
pharmacological effects of ALN-PCSSC on lipid profiles. There were consistent decreases in 
LDL-C and total cholesterol which were expected. Histopathological findings included 
vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of monkeys and the presence of 
basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats. These microscopic findings 
were not associated with changes in clinical pathology parameters and are consistent with cla ss 
effects of oligonucleotides and were not considered adverse. In a non-GLP dose-range-finding 
study conducted in monkeys, ALN-PCSSC did not stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
activate complement,  or impact coagulation. ALN-PCSSC also did not stimulate 
pro-inflammatory cytokines following single dose administration to mice. In a cardiovascular 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_914746],  ALN-PCSSC had no 
immediate or delayed effects on clinical observations, qualitative or quantitative 
electrocardiogram (ECG ) parameters, hemodynamic parameters, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], or body 
temperature at any dose level. In addition, ALN-PCSSC did not induce gene mutations or 
chromosomal damage in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. 
Further information is in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).   
1.2.2. Clinical Studies 
One ongoing Phase I study has been conducted to date (Study ALN-PCSSC-001). This was a 
randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation and multiple-dose study of 
ALN-PCSSC administered SC to subjects with elevated LDL-C. The study was conducted in two 
phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. During the SAD 
phase, [ADDRESS_1285705] 40%; at the 500 mg dose, LDL-C levels dropped as much as 78%. At 140 days after 
the treatment was given, subjects still had an average LDL-C reduction of about 40%. 
In the MD phase, [ADDRESS_1285706]-PCS (125mg weekly x4, 
250 mg bi-weekly x2 , 300 mg and 500 mg  twice given 1 month apart) or placebo. These subject s 
had maximal LDL-C reductions of 80% and average LDL-C reductions of 50% to 60%. To date, 
the drug appears to be generally safe and well tolerated. One subject on statin comedication had 
elevated liver enzymes with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >4x the upper limit of normal 
(ULN), which resolved on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265255]. 
1.2.3. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits 
Subjects taking part in this clinical study will receive guideline recommended standard of care as 
background therapy (including maximally-tolerated statin therapy and/or other L DL-C lowering 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) when administered ALN-PCSSC or placebo. Reduction of LDL-C has been 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-[ADDRESS_1285707] a dose(s) for future studies. 
1.3.2. Dose Rationale 
Previous studies using PCSK9-targeting siRNAs formulated in LNPs (ALN-PCS02) or using 
PCSK9 antibodies, and one Phase I study with ALN-PCSSC in which subjects received single-
doses a
scending from [ADDRESS_1285708] levels (NOAELs) based on body weight and body 
surface area (mg/m2). Collectively, the results of nonclinical studies with ALN-PCSSC 
supported a starting dose of [ADDRESS_1285709]-PCSSC doses of 300 mg or higher had maximal LDL- C 
reductions of up to 78.1% and average least squares mean group nadir reductions of 50 to 59%. 
In the MD phase, [ADDRESS_1285710]-PCS (125 mg weekly x4, 
250 mg biweekly, 300 mg and 500 mg twice given 1 month apart)  or placebo. Subjects at ALN-
PCSSC doses of 300 mg or higher had maximal LDL-C reductions of 83% and average least 
squares mean group nadir LDL-C reductions of 53.4% to 59.9% at all dose levels tested.   
Based on the interim results of the Phase I Study ALN-PCSSC-[ADDRESS_1285711] the efficacy of a single dose (200 mg, 300 mg, or 500 mg) or two 
doses 90 days apart (100 mg, 200 mg, o r 300 mg). This will allow dose selection for Phase III. 
The dosing regimens used in Phase II are therefore fully supported by [CONTACT_265273] I 
study. 
1.4. Study Population 
This study will include male or female subjects ≥18 years of age with a history of ASCVD or 
ASCVD-risk equivalents (symptomatic atherosclerosis, Type 2 diabetes, familial 
hy
percholesterolemia), or a >20% ten-year risk of a CV event assessed by [CONTACT_914763]-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.

diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, including subjects whose 10-year risk of a 
cardiovascular [CV] event assessed by [CONTACT_914760] * or equivalent has a 
target LDL-C of < 100mg/dL).   
3. Serum LDL-C ≥1.8 mmol/L (≥70 mg/dL) for ASCVD subjects or ≥2.6 mmol/L

Subjects excluded for any of the above reasons may not be re-screened for participation at any 
time if the exclusion characteristic has changed. 
4.4. Withdrawal Criteria 
All subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during treatment without prejudice. The 
investigator can discontinue any subject at any time if medically necessary. It will be documented 
whether or not each subject completed the clinical study. If for any subject study treatment or 
observations were discontinued, the reason will be recorded and the Sponsor should be notified 
promptly. Reasons that a subject may discontinue participation in a clinical study are considered to 
constitute one of the following: 
 AE 
 Death 
 Subject withdrew consent 
 Physician decision 
 Lost to follow-up 
Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the investigator or designee will make every 
possible attempt to confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the subject, and the DMC will 
be notified. 
It is imperative to obtain complete follow-up data for all randomized subjects whether or not 
they receive their assigned treatment or have discontinued study drug. Every attempt should be 
made to collect follow-up information except for those subjects who specifically withdra w 
consent release of such information. All procedures and laboratory specimens or tests requested 
for evaluation following administration of the Study Drug should be carried out when possible 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-[ADDRESS_1285725] withdraws or is withdrawn from the study medication (eg, receives first 
injection and not second injection), the investigator will inform the Medical Monitor and the 
Sponsor imme
diately. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the subject will remain under 
the supervision of the investigator for protocol-specified safety follow up procedures. The DMC 
may be notified.  
As noted in Section 4.4, it is imperative to obtain complete follow-up data for all randomized 
subjec
ts whether or not they receive their assigned treatment or have discontinued study drug.

Randomization should only occur once subject eligibility is confirmed. Randomization via an 
automated IWRS will be used to assign subjects to study drug. All treatment groups will be 
studied concurrently. A total of 480 randomized subjects are planned for inclusion in the study: 
[ADDRESS_1285736]-PCSSC treatment groups plus 120 subjects total across the 
placebo groups (20 subjects each to match each of the six drug groups).  
Study drug administration will occur at this visit for all subjects (only dose for those randomized 
to receive a single dose and the first of two doses for those randomized to receive two ). 
Study drug preparation: The pharmacist will prepare the study drug under aseptic conditions. 
The amount (in mL) of study drug to be administered will be determined based on the assigned 
dose level for the cohort. On study drug dosing days, the pharmacist or designee will withdraw 
the required amount of study drug into one or more syringes to be administered to the subject on

is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Study drug administration: Subjects will be administered placebo or ALN-PCSSC by S C 
injec
tion(s). Study drug injection will be administered by [CONTACT_914772]. The site of injection is the abdomen. If more than one injection is planned 
as per randomization, the first should be on one side of the abdomen and the second on the 
opposite side of the
 abdomen. Do not inject into areas of active skin disease or injury such as 
sunburns, skin rashes, inflammation, or skin infections. 
If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs of the injection site should be 
obtained at first pre
sentation and at each of the follow-up visits unti l the injecti on site reaction 
resolves. Injection site reactions must be reported as described in Section 8.5. Detailed

 8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1. Definitions 
8.1.1. Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations for an illness or disease that existed before the 
subject was randomized in a clinical study are not to be considered AEs. 
Adverse events or abnormal test findings will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the 
abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Sponsor/investigator. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. AE Severity 
The severity of an AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator should ensure that any 
subject experiencing an AE receives appropriate medical support until the event resolves. 
Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on the case report form. 
The intensity of an AE is defined as follows: 
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity. 
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity. 
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Causality 
The relationship of an AE to study treatment will be assessed with consideration to the following 
criteria: 
 Temporal relationship to the initiation of study medication 
 Response of the event to withdrawal of study medication 
 AE profile of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
 Clinical circumstances during which the AE occurred 
 Subject’s clinical condition and medical history  
 
Categorization of causality will be designated by [CONTACT_265282]: 
 Reasonable possibility  - There are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship between the event and study drug 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01 
The Medicines Company Global Amendment 3  
Confidential 45 
  No reasonable possibility  – There are few to no facts (evidence) or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship between the event and study drug 
8.1.2. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening, ie, the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death) 
 Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the subject's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of 
life 
 Requires in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is another medically significant event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (eg, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency department or home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse) 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is an estimate or measure of 
the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of adverse subject outcomes 
for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not necessarily be considered serious and a 
serious AE need not be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, an MI that may be considered minor 
could also be an SAE if it prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
8.1.3. Medication errors 
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and administration of the study product 
as per instructions in the protocol. Medication Errors generally fall into four categories as follows:  
1. Wrong medication 
2. Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount); 
3. Wrong route of administration; 
4. Wrong subject (ie, not administered to the intended subject) 
Medication Errors include occurrences of underdose of the study product(s). 
Underdose:  Unintentional administration of an insufficient quantity of study drug; ie, 
incomplete administration of study drug as drawn for injection. 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-[ADDRESS_1285739] (AESIs) 
An adverse event of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical concern 
specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, which warrants ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_68477].  The SAE/AESI form should be utilized for 
reporting the AESI even if a serious outcome may not apply.  
In this study, injection site reactions including individual signs or symptoms at the injection site 
reported following study drug administra
tion will be collected as an  AESI.  
Signs or symptoms of injection site reaction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_332842] (CTCAE) criteria of Injection Site Reaction (General disorders and administration 
site conditions) to determine the event ’s grade (severity) (see  Table 4).  
TABLE
 4: COMMON TERMINOLOGY CRITERIA FOR ADVERSE EVENTS 
(CTCAE) OF INJECTION SITE REACTION  
Grade I: Tenderness with or without associated symptoms (eg,  warmth, erythema, 
itching) 
Grade II: Pain; lipodystrophy; edema; phlebitis  
Grade III Ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage; operative intervention 
indicated 
Grade IV Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade V Death  
Reference source: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Published [ADDRESS_1285740] presentation and at each 
of the follow-up visits until the injection site reaction resolves.  
8.1.5. Other Safety Related Information 
A compre
hensive term that encompasses safety information for which global regulations require 
collection, evaluation, and/or reporting to Regulatory Authorities. Other safety-related 
information includes, but is not limited to, reports of the following: 
 Abnormal neurological examination, eg, peripheral sensory and motor evaluation, an 
assessment of
 gait, pain, position, strength and re
flexes (Appendix A)  
 Potential anaphylactic reactions assessed by [CONTACT_76623] ( Appendix  B) 
 Suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent 
 Drug interactions 
 Occupational exposure 
Report the occurrence of suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent, 
drug interactions, or occupational exposure to the Sponsor's GPV department as per Section 8.3, 
Proce
dure for Serious Adverse Event Reporting. Note: The Special Situations event does not 
need to be serious to be reported on the SAE/AESI Report form. 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-[ADDRESS_1285741] be reported 
to the Sponsor's GPV department using the SAE Report form. 
8.2. Procedure for Non-Serious Adverse Event Recording 
All nonserious AEs that occur during the designated study period from randomization up to EOS 
must be assessed a
nd recorded on the source documents and electric case report forms (eCRFs), 
regardl
ess of causal relationship to the study drug. Note: For subjects in whom LDL-C levels 
have not returned to >80% of baseline values by [CONTACT_2006] 210, AEs will continue to be assessed at 
additional monthly follow-up visits (Day 240, Day 270, Day 300, Day 330, and Day 360) until 
the final observa
tion.  
8.3. Procedure for Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
NOTE: This procedure may need to be followed for reporting AESIs or Other Safety Related 
information as noted in  Section 8.1.5 and Section 8.5. 
All SAEs that oc
cur during the designated study period (from randomization through the EOS 
visit) must be reported to the Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance Department (GPV) within 
24 hours of awareness of the event using the provided study specific SAE/AESI Report Form. 
The compl
etion and processing of the SAE/AESI Report Form should be per the instructions in 
the provided SAE/AESI Report Form completion guidelines. In addition to completing the 
SAE/AESI Report Form, each SAE/AESI must be entered on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
Note: For subjects in whom LDL-C levels have not returned to >80% of baseline values by 
[CONTACT_2006] 210, SAEs will continue to be assessed at additional monthly follow-up visits (Day 240, 
Day 270, Da
y 300, Day 330, and Day 360) until the final observation.  
When death occ
urs with an SAE, the cause of death must be reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be 
reported as the outcome for these events. 
The inve
stigator must assess the causality for each SAE/AESI. 
The Sponsor will contact [CONTACT_093], if necessary, to clarify any of the event information. 
The investigator should provide any follow-up information for the event to the Sponsor on an 
updated SAE/AESI report form as soon as it becomes available. 
If the investigator is notified of a SAE/AESI that occurs post-study period, that he or she wishes 
to report to the Sponsor ( eg, 
an event suspected to be causally related to study drug), the event 
should be reported through the process described above.  
Where appropriate, if required by [CONTACT_76625], the investigator should report 
these events to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national 
regulatory authority in addition to the Sponsor. 
8.4. Procedure for Medication Error Reporting 
Medication errors (with or without an associated AE) need to be recorded as medication errors in 
the eCRF a
s described in  Section 8.2. 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01 
The Medicines Company
 Global Amendment 3  
Confidential 48 
 Medicati
on errors with an associated SAE need to be recorded as medication errors in the eCRF 
and reported to the Sponsor’s GPV department as described in Sec tion 8.3. 
A mis-dosi
ng protocol deviation (refer to Section 12.3) would need to be reported as a 
medicati
on error if it was an “unintended error” as defined in Section 8.1.3.  
8.5. Pro
cedure For Reporting Adverse Events Of Special Interest 
(AESIs) 
The AESI of Injection Site Reaction has been identified for the study product(s) in this protocol 
as per Section 8.1.4. Nonserious AESIs should be reported to The Medicines Company (MDCO) 
GPV within 72 hours a
nd serious AESI
s should be reported to MDCO GPV within 24 hours. In 
both instances, the reporting procedure provided in Section 8.3 should be followed. The 
SAE/AES
I form should be utilized for reporting the AESI even if a serious outcome may not 
apply.  
8.6. Procedure For Reporting Pregnancies/Lactation Exposure 
Occurrences of pregnancy/lactation exposure in a study subject or study subject’s partner should 
be reported within 24 hours using the Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure Reporting form. In cases 
where a pregnancy/lactation exposure occurs with a SAE, the SAE reporting form should be 
used to report the SAE/AESI a
nd the Pregnancy Reporting form should be used to report the 
pregnancy. When a pregnancy occurs without any concurrent SAE, the Pregnancy Reporting 
form may be submitted alone. The pregnancy must be followed through to outcome of 
pregnancy. Any pregnancy discovered after consent to follow-up need to be reported.

 10. STATISTICAL PLAN 
10.1. Sample Size 
The sample size calculation was performed with the assumption (which was based on the 
observed results from a Phase I trial) that the difference in change from baseline between the 
active dose groups and the placebo group for LDL-C will be no less than 30 mg/dL, with a 
standard deviation of 20 mg/dL, using a Dunnet multiple t-test procedure for six comparisons. 
Assuming about a 15% drop out rate, the sample size will be approximately [ADDRESS_1285743] 400 evaluable subjects will provide more than 90% power to 
detect a 30% reduction of LDL-C levels in at least one ALN-PCSSC dose group. 
10.2. Randomization  
Subjects will be screened and 480 eligible subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_125070]: 
[ADDRESS_1285744]-PCSSC treatment groups plus 120 subjects total across the 
placebo groups (20 subjects each to match each of the six drug groups). Treatment will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_875857]-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Each 
subject will either receive either one or two injections on Day [ADDRESS_1285745]-PCSSC or placebo. 
10.3. General Statistical Considerations and Definitions 
10.3.1. General Statistical Methods 
All study-collected data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070], 
graphs, and/or raw data listings. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and 
percentages. Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the analysis set for whom there 
are non-missing data, unless otherwise specified. Continuous variables, including changes from 
baseline, will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median 
and interquartile range [first and third quartiles], minimum and maximum).  
A Statistical Analysis Plan  will be written after finalizing of the eCRF and before database lock. 
The specifications in this document will detail the implementation of all the planned statistical 
analyses in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol.  
Statistical analyses will be carried out using SAS statistical analysis software version 9.2 or 
higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, US).  
10.3.2. Analysis Population 
The following populations will be used for data analyses and/or presentation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population  
All subjects randomized into the trial. Treatment classification will be based on the randomized 
treatment. This population will be used to assess the randomness of treatment allocation. 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01 
The Medicines Company Global Amendment 3  
Confidential 51 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) Population 
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug and have both the baseline 
and the 180 day follow-up LDL-C assessment. Treatment classification will be based on the 
randomized treatment. This will be the primary population for analysis of the primary and 
secondary endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
All mITT subjects who received all randomized treatments and the 180 day follow-up LDL- C 
assessment. The PP population will be finalized during a data review before database lock. This 
will be the supportive population for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Population 
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Treatment classification will be based 
on the actual treatment received. This will be primary population for the safety analyses.  
10.3.3. Analysis Windows and Baseline 
The observational period for each subject includes the screening period (from Day -14 to 
Day
 -1), the EOS visit (Day 210 or withdrawal date). The time at which LDL-C levels have 
returned to >80% of baseline values will be the last observation. Any lab results collected after 
the last observation will not be included in the planned efficacy analysis. Safety events after the 
last observation,  even if collected on the eCRF, will not be included in the planned statistical 
analysis. However, all data, including that reported after the defined observational period, will be 
included in the subject data listings .  
Unless otherwise specified, for evaluations that are collected at multiple occasions prior to 
initiation of study drug, the last evaluation will be considered the "Baseline" evaluation for 
analysis. 
Two samples for lipi[INVESTIGATOR_442083]9 will be taken prior to initiation of study drug (one at 
screening and one prior to randomization on Day 1). The average value of the two samples will 
be used as the baseline evaluation. 
10.3.4. Missing Data Handling 
Unless otherwise specified, missing data will not be imputed and will be excluded from the 
associated analysis. 
10.4. Statistical Analyses 
10.4.1. Demographic and Background Characteristics 
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics (including medical history) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_391969], mITT, PP, and safety populations. 
10.4.2. Study Drug and Concomitant Medications 
Summaries of each prior (pre-baseline) medication and concomitant (baseline or later) 
medication will be provided by [CONTACT_3148]. Separate summaries will be provided for prior 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01

 medication use. Medications will be coded using the WHO drug dictionary. Subjects will be 
counted only once within each period by [CONTACT_12617]. 
10.4.3. Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary endpoint is the percentage change in LDL- C from baseline to Day 180. 
Two sample t-test s will be performed to test the superiority of any dosing group over placebo. A 
Dunnet multiple t-test procedure  will be applied to adjust for multiple comparisons with six 
different dosing regimens.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of ALN-PCSSC on the 
following: 
 Percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 90 
 Percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Days 14, 30, 60, 104, 120, 150, and 
210 
 Proportion of subjects in each group with LDL-C greater than 80% of the baseline 
value at Day 180 and Day 210 
 Duration of time on treatment for subjects to return to 80% of baseline or greater 
LDL-C or PCSK9 protein  
 Individual responsiveness defined as the number of subjects reaching on treatment 
LDL-C levels of <25 mg/dL, <50 mg/dL, 70 mg/dL, and <100 mg/dL at Days 90, 
120, and 180  
 Proportion of subjects in each group with greater or equal to 50% LDL-C reduction 
from baseline at Days 90, 120, and 180 
 Percentage change in PCSK9 levels from baseline to Days 14, 30, 60, 90, 104, 120, 
150, 180, and 210 
 Percentage change in other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins from baseline at 
each subsequent visit to Day 210 
 Proportion of subjects in each group who attain global lipid modification targets for 
their level of ASCVD risk 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_442083]9, unblinded by [CONTACT_914762], will be prepared upon 
completion of D ay [ADDRESS_1285746]
-PCSSC. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse
 Events 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary will be used for coding 
AEs. An AE (
classified as preferred term) occurring during the double-blind treatment period 
will be counted as a treatment emergent AE (TEAE) either if it is not present at baseline or if it is

12.1. Monitoring 
The Sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to carefully follow this study in 
acc
ordance with established research principles and applicable regulations. The investigator, as 
part of his responsibilities, is expected to cooperate with the Sponsor in ensuring that the study 
adheres to the protocol and GCP requirements.  
As part of a concerted effort to fulfill these obligations, the Sponsor's monitor will visit the 
center(s) during the study in accordance with the Monitoring Plan set forth for this trial. The 
investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed necessary 
and provide access to medical records/source documents to ensure that data are being recorded 
adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
12.2. Auditing 
The Sponsor may conduct audits at the study center(s). Audits will include, but not be limited to, 
drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of 
eCRFs with source documents. The investigator agrees to permit audits conducted at a 
reasonable time in a reasonable manner. 
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also inspect the investigator during or after the study. The 
investigator should contact [CONTACT_76631], and must permit regulatory 
authority inspections. 
12.3. Protocol Deviations 
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency situation in 
which the protection, safety, and well-being of the subject requires immediate intervention, 
based on the jud
gment of the investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional 
designated by [CONTACT_093]). In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an 
emergency, accident, or mistake, the investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_1034], or their 
agent, at the earliest possible time by [CONTACT_756]. This will allow an early joint decision regarding 
the subject’s continuation in the study. The investigator and the Sponsor will document this 
decision. The IRB/EC will be informed of all protocol changes by [CONTACT_265291]/EC established procedure. No deviations from the protocol of any type will be 
made without complying with all the IRB/EC established procedures. 
The following Protocol Deviations will require additional information in the eCRF explaining 
why the deviation occurred and what will be done to prevent it from re-occurring: 
 Injection not administered for any reason other than subject safety or withdrawal 
 Wrong dose (dose concentration, wrong dose, wrong treatment, wrong regimen, 
wrong injection site)* 
 Missed assessment as per the Schedule of Events/Assessments ( Table 3) at Baseline,

 APPENDIX A. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION 
MOTOR FUNCTION  
When assessing motor function, from a neurological perspective, the assessment should focus on 
arm and leg movement. You should consider the following:  
1. Muscle size  
2. Muscle tone  
3. Muscle strength  
4. Involuntary movements  
5. Posture, gait  
Symmetry is the most important consideration when identifying focal findings. Compare one 
side of the body to the other when performing your assessment.  
Limb assessment of a conscious patient usually involves a grading of strength.  
Grade Strength  
Grade strength Description  
[ADDRESS_1285758] gravity and resistance; normal muscle strength  
[ADDRESS_1285759] gravity and a moderate amount of resistance; 
slight weakness  
[ADDRESS_1285760] gravity only, moderate muscle weakness  
2 Full range of motion when gravity is eliminated, severe weakness  
1 A weak muscle contraction is palpated, but no movement is noted, very 
severe weakness  
0 Complete paralysis  
NB: In a conscious patient, the single best test to quickly identify motor weakness is the 
“drift test”. Have the patient hold their arms outward at [ADDRESS_1285761] the patient close their eyes and hold the arms for a couple of minutes. 
“Drifting” will occur if one side is weak.  
Lower Extremities  
Assess the patient in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Ask him/her to separate both legs to test for hip 
abduction. Then ask the patient to bring the legs back together to test for hip adduction. Sit the 
patient on the side of the bed to assess knee flexion and extension. Ask the patient to flex and 
extend the knee. If able to do this, apply resistance as these movements are repeated. Test plantar 
and dorsiflexion by [CONTACT_914782]. Remember to compare the left side to the right side.  
Upper Extremities  
Assess ability to flex elbow (biceps) and straighten (triceps). Assess ability to raise shoulders and 
return to a resting position. Assess wrist flexion and extension. Test each function with 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-01 
The Medicines Company Global Amendment 3  
Confidential 64 
 resistance. For focused upper extremity assessment, assess each digit for flexion, extension and 
lateral movement.  
SENSORY FUNCTION  
When assessing sensory function remember that there are three main pathways for sensation and 
they should be compared bilaterally:  
1. Pain and temperature sensation.  
2. Position sense (proprioception).   
3. Light touch.  
Pain can be assessed using a sterile pin. Light touch can be assessed with a cotton wisp. To test 
proprioception, grasp the patient's index finger from the middle joint and move it side to side and 
up and down. Have the patient identify the direction of movement. Repeat this using the great 
toe.  
Sensory Tests:  
A number of tests for lesions of the sensory cortex can be done. Examples include the following :  
 Stereognosis : The ability to recognize an object by [CONTACT_265295]. Place a common object 
in the persons hand and ask them to identify the object.  
 Graphesthesis: “Draw” a number in the palm of the person’s hand and ask them 
to identify the number.  
 Two-Point Discrimination: Simultaneously apply two pin pricks to the skin 
surface. Continually repeat the test while bringing the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_265261], 
until the individual can no longer identify two separate stimuli. The finger tips are 
the most sensitive location for recognizing two point differences while the upper 
arms, thighs and back are the least sensitive.  
 Extinction: Touch the same spot on both sides of the body at the same time (eg, 
the left and right forearms. Ask the individual to describe how many spots are 
being touched. Normally, both sides are felt; with sensory lesions the individual 
will sense only one.  
 Point Locations: Touch the surface of the skin and remove the stimulus quickly. 
Ask the individual to touch the spot where the sensation was felt. Sensory lesions 
can impair accurate identification, even if they retain their sensation of light 
touch.  
TONE and REFLEXES 
Upper motor neuron problems (brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) are associated with increased tone. Lower 
motor neuron problems are associated with decreased tone.  
Look at the muscles on each side of the body in pairs. Assess for symmetry of bulk.  
Evaluation of the stretch reflexes assesses the intactness of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_265262]. The limb should be relaxed while applying a short and snappy blow with a reflex 
ALN-PCSSC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-15-[ADDRESS_1285762] action. Allow the 
hammer to bounce.  
Reflex responses:  
0 No response  
1+ Diminished, low normal  
2+ Average, normal  
3+ Brisker than normal  
4+ Very brisk, hyperactive  
Lower motor neuron disease is associated with 0 or 1+, upper motor neuron disease is associated 
with 3+ or 4+.  
Biceps Reflex (C5 –  C6)  
Support the forearm on the examiners forearm. Place your thumb on the bicep tendon (located in 
the front of the bend of the elbow; midline to the anticubital fossa). Tap on your thumb to 
stimulate a response.  
Triceps Reflex (C7-C8)  
Have the individual bend their elbow while pointing their arm downward at 90 degrees. Support 
the upper arm so that the arm hangs loosely and “goes dead”. Tap on the triceps tendon located 
just above the elbow bend (funny bone).  
Brachioradialis Reflex (C5-C6):  
Hold the person’s thumb so that the forearm relaxes. Strike the forearm about 2-3 cm above the 
radial styloid process (located along the thumb side of the wrist, about 2-[ADDRESS_1285763]). Normally, the forearm with flex and supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263].  
Quadriceps Reflex (Knee jerk) L2 – L4  
Allow the lower legs to dangle freely. Place one hand on the quadriceps. Strike just below the 
knee cap. The lower leg normally will extend.and the quadriceps will contract.  
If the patient is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: Stand on one side of the bed. Place the examiners forearm under the thigh 
closest to the examiner, lifting the leg up. Reach under the thigh and place the hand on the thigh 
of the opposite leg, just above the knee cap. Tap the knee closest to the examiner, (the one that 
has been lifted up with the examiners forearm).  
Achilles Reflex (ankle jerks) L5 –  S2:  
Flex the knee and externally rotate the hip. Dorsiflex the foot and strike the Achilles tendon of 
the heel. In conscious patients, kneeling on a chair can help to relax the foot.  
Heel Lift  
While the patient is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bend the knee and support the leg under the thigh. Have the leg “go 
dead”. Briskly jerk the leg to lift the heel of the bed. Normally, the leg will remain relaxed and 
the heel will slide upward; increased tone will cause the heel and leg to stiffen and lift off the 
bed.

Confidential 66 
 Babinski Response:  
Dorsiflexion of the great toe with fanning of remaining toes is a positive Babinski response. This 
indicates upper motor neuron disease. It is normal in infants.  
CEREBELLAR FUNCTION  
The cerebellum is responsible for muscle coordination and balance on the same side. To test 
cerebellar function use the following tests:  
1. Finger to finger test: have the patient touch their index finger to your index finger (repeat 
several times).  
2. Finger to nose test: perform with eyes open and then eyes closed.  
3. Tandem walking: heel to toe on a straight line.  
4. Romberg test: stand with feet together and arms at their sides. Have patient close his/her 
eyes and maintain this position for [ADDRESS_1285764] is “positive” or suggestive of cerebellum 
problems.  
Dizziness that occurs in response to position changes is usually blood pressure initiated. If the 
patient sways during a Romberg test, but stops when the eyes are opened, the problem is 
probably visual or CN VIII (vestibular ).

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-
uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze, bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, painful abdominal cramps, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to a known allergen for that patient (minutes to 
several hours): 
a. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or > 30% decrease in 
systolic blood pressure* 
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or >30% decrease from that person’s 
baseline 
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is age specific and defined as: <70 mmHg for age 
1 month to 1 year; <70 mmHg + [2 x age] for age 1 to years; <90 mmHg for age 11 to 17 years.

 APPENDIX C. CLARIFICATION OF LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS 
TO BE PERFORMED IN THE SCREENING PHASE ( DAY 
-14 TO -1)  
Screening Labs  Local / 
central Lab  Comments  
Hematology  
 Local lab  Standard panel to include Hb, WBC and platelets as a minimum  
Chemistry  Local lab  
 Standard chemistry panel to include BUN and electrolytes, serum 
creatinine, glucose. (Taken at same time as fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_914757]).  
Liver function tests to include ALT, AST and total bilirubin which 
are exclusion criteria  
Coagulation  
 Local lab  Standard coagulation panel to include PTT or aPTT, INR and PT 
(if part of local coagulation panel)  
Inflammatory 
biomarkers  
 Central lab  hsCRP and inflammatory markers (IL6, IFN -γ, and TNF -α) will be 
measured only at the central lab  
HbA1c 
 Local lab  HbA1c is an exclusion criteria  
Fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_914758] -C and 
triglyceride which are inclusion criteria  
Fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_914759]. (With the sample from the randomization visit these two 
samples will provide the baseline lipid measurements for the 
study). 
PCSK9 Central lab  Sample taken at same time as l ocal lab sample and shipped to 
Medpace.  
(With the sample from the randomization visit these two samples 
will provide the baseline PCSK9 measurements for the study).  
Urinalysis  Local lab  Done using dipsticks provided by [CONTACT_35970].  Abnormal specimens 
sent to local lab for further testing.  
Urine 
Pregnancy 
testing Local lab  Done using dipsticks provided by [CONTACT_35970].  To be conducted for 
eligible women at all visits.  
Note: Local lab assessments for eligibility are not expected to include the full panel measured by 
[CONTACT_233570], which are measured for the purpose of the study and the study report.

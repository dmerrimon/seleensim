Title of Study:  A Phase II Trial of the Aurora Kinase A Inhibitor MLN8237 in Patients with Metastatic Castrate 
Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer  
 
Study Chair:  Himisha Beltran  
 
Study Center(s):  WCMC and  up to 10 additional sites  
 
Number of Patients:  60 (multi-institutional, estimated accrual 3 per month, duration of enrollment - 24 months)  
 
Concept and Rationale:   
The amount of neuroendocrine differentiation increases in late stages of prostate cancer and after exposure to 
androgen deprivation therapy, and contributes to the development of castrate resistance.  Transformation to a 
predominantly androgen receptor (AR) - negative, neuroendocrine phenotype occurs in approximately 25% of late 
stage prostate cancer; these have been termed neuroendocrine or anaplastic prostate cancer.  As more potent anti -
androgen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683580], it is predicted that the incidence of neuroendocrine 
prostate cancer (NEPC) will escalate. Th ere is currently no proven effective therapy for NEPC, and most patients 
survive less than one year. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and N -myc (MYCN) are significantly overexpressed and 
amplified in NEPC compared to prostate adenocarcinoma, and these proteins coop erate to directly induce 
neuroendocrine differentiation (Beltran et al, Cancer Discovery  2011). In preclinical models, aurora kinase 
inhibition resulted in dramatic and preferential anti -tumor activity in NEPC with suppression of neuroendocrine 
marker expr ession. MLN8237  is an orally administered Aurora kinase A inhibitor that has demonstrated broad 
antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and the RP2D as monotherapy in adults with refractory solid tumors was 50 
mg BID for 7 days in 21 -day cycles . 
 
Primary Objective(s):  The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from radiographic 
progression  6 months following initiation of treatment with MLN8237.  
Secondary Objective(s): To determine the radiologic response rate, overall survival  (OS), radiographic 
progression free survival  (rPFS), PSA response rate, circulating tumor cell (CTC) response, and serum 
neuroendocrine markers in response to therapy.   
 
Exploratory objectives:   To evaluate molecular biomarkers archival and metastatic tissue, including IHC and 
FISH for Aurora kinase A and N -myc overexpression and amplification, neuroendocrine markers, AR status, ERG 
fusion, and other genomic mutations determined by [CONTACT_36086].  To evaluate plasma DNA for AURKA and 
MYCN amplification.   
 
Primary Endpoint(s): Radiographic progression  is measured using  modified RECIST 1.1  criteria. 
 
Secondary Endpoint(s):   
Overall Survival is defined as time from first treatment until death.  
rPFS will be defined as the time from first treatment day until objectiv e or symptomatic radiologic progression.  
Progression will be determined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1  and bone progression is per PCWG2 criteria . PSA progression will 
be evaluated but will not be considered PD; PSA progression is defined as increase in PSA value of > 25% and an 
absolute increase of > 2 ng/mL over baseline or nadir. Serum chromogranin A and neuron specific enolase 
response is defined as obtaining >50% reduction from baseline.  CTC enumeration counts will be classified into 
favorable ( <5) or unfavorable (>5 ); baseline and post -cycle 2 classification will be compared.  In addition, % 
changes in counts will be assessed.   Molecular analysis will be performed on pre -treatment tissue specimens and

Study Design:   
This is a multi -institutional single -arm, open -label Phase 2 trial evaluating MLN8237 in patients with 
histologically confirmed or clinically suspected metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer (see inclusion criteria 
for full list of eligibility).  All subjects will have a mandatory metastat ic tumor biopsy at time of enrollment for 
research purposes.  Subjects will be treated with MLN8237  at [ADDRESS_925575]/MRI scan and bone scan after every [ADDRESS_925576] v1.1.  PSA 
and investigational tumor markers (assessed centrally)  will be followed every cycle.  CTC counts by [CONTACT_683599], at 4 -6 weeks, and upon progr ession.  Patients will be followed for survival 
endpoints following completion of this study until death.

PSA and serum chromogranin A and NSE will be followed every cycle.  CTC counts will be performed at 
baseline, at 4 -6 weeks, and upon progression .  Patients will be followed for survival endpoints following 
completion of this study until death.  
 
Statistical Methods:  
 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from radiographic progression  at 6 months, 
following treatment with  MLN8237.  Based on the phase II trial by [CONTACT_683601] ( BJUI 2012 ), the proposed 
null hypothesis (H0) is that ≤15% of patients will be radiographic progression -free at 6 months and the alternative 
hypothesis (Ha) is that ≥30% of patients will be radiographic progression -free at 6 months.  
 
Sample size recommendations for the phase II design are determined according  to Ahern’s exact single -stage 
phase II design (A’Hern RP, 2001).  We project a 6 -month radiographic progression -free proportion of 1 5%, 
below which the response will be unacceptable, and a 6 -month radiographic progression -free proportion of 30%, 
above whi ch the regimen will be considered worthy  of further exploration.  The null hypothesis that the 6 -month 
radiographic progression -free proportion is less than or equal to 1 5% will be tested against the alternative 
hypothesis that the 6 -month radiographic progression-free proportion is greater than or equal to 30% . 
 
The sample size computations were performed assuming a 5% level of significance and 80% power.  A total of [ADDRESS_925582] single -stage design yields a ≥ 0.80 probability of a positive result if the true percentage 
of patients who are free from radiographic progression at 6 months is ≥30%.  It yields a ≥ 0.95 probability of a 
negative result if the true percentage of patients who are free from radiographic progression at 6 months is ≤15%.  
Assuming 10 -20% of patients will be unevaluable/ineligible, we anticipate that a total 60 patients will be enrolled 
in the study.  
   
Approximately 2 0% of patients are expected to have histologic entry criteria.  With a sample size of 
approximately 12 patients meeting such criteria (i.e., 20% of 60 enrolled patients), a 95% confidence interval for 
the 6-month radiographic progression -free proportion in  this subgroup of 12 patients can be expected to be within 
± 25.9% of the true 6 -month radiographic progression -free proportion in this subgroup.  This calculation assumes 
a 6-month radiographic progression -free proportion of 30% in patients with biopsy po sitive NEPC.  This 
calculation is for descriptive/exploratory purposes only, with the intent of estimating the 6 -month radiographic 
progression -free proportion among the small subgroup of patients with biopsy positive NEPC.   
 
Analysis Plan for Endpoints : 
 
Primary Endpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint of 6-month radiographic progression -free proportion will be estimated and a 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated via binomial proportions.  
 
Secondary Clinical Endpoints:  
With adequate follow -up time , secondary  endpoints of response rate and overall survival (OS) will be assessed.  
Radiologic response rate will be estimated and a 95% confidence interval will be estimated via binomial 
proportions . For OS  and rPFS , Kaplan -Meier survival analysis and 95% confidence  intervals will be calculated 
using Greenwood’s formulae.

IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, [ADDRESS_925583] 95% confidence intervals around the tox icity proportions will be 
calculated to assess the precision of the obtained estimates.  
 
Exploratory objectives/correlative studies will be evaluated using descriptive statistics, graphical methods, and 
statistical modeling, as appropriate, to explore the relationship between response and Aurora –A and N -myc 
overexpression and/or amplification in circulating tumor cells or archival tissue.  
 
Funding, Regulatory, and Feasibility Issues:  
Study drug will be provided by [CONTACT_24312].  A research grant from Millennium Pharmaceuticals 
to WCMC will be used to fund start up costs and per -subject reimbursement for additional sites (i.e. additional 
sites will be funded through WCMC).  Correlative studies will be supplemented with f unding from other gran ts of 
the investigators, including the Prostate Cancer Foundation , Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, and the 
[LOCATION_002] Department of Defense . 
 
Patient Acceptability/Ethics and Consent Issues:  
The patients eligible for this study have an aggres sive subtype of prostate cancer that is currently incurable with a 
poor prognosis of less than [ADDRESS_925584] treatment.  Based on extensive preclinical data, 
there is strong biologic rationale for this study . MLN8237 is orally giv en and conveniently administered for 
patients.  The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation to safeguard the rights , safety, and well -being of the 
patients. After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from either the 
patient or his/her guardian or legal representative before study participation.

   12 Background 
 
1.1 Neuroendocrine prostate cancer 
 
Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in men worldwide (Siegel et al, Cancer Statistics , 
2012).  Those that die from prostate cancer die from metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC), tumors that progress after surgical or medical castration.  We know now that many CRPC 
tumors remain dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling due to AR gene amplification, intra-
tumoral androgen production, constitutive activation of AR, or other proposed mechanisms (Knudsen et 
al, Clin Cancer Res  2009).  This knowledge has led to the clinical development of novel and highly 
potent drugs that block AR signaling, through inhibition of hormone production (e.g. abiraterone 
acetate) or AR receptor binding (e.g. enzalutamide ). 
 
An often under-recognized late manifestation of prostate cancer is the development of neuroendocrine 
prostate cancer (NEPC), which is considered a hormone refractory (AR negative) subtype of prostate 
cancer (Tagawa et al, Textbook of Uncommon Cancer , 4th Ed, 2012). These tumors do not secrete 
prostate specific antigen (PSA), and should be suspected in a patient with progressive disease (especially 
visceral or lytic bone metastases) in the setting of a low or modestly elevated PSA.   Based on autopsy 
series and other studies, NEPC may represent approximately 25% of late stage prostate cancer (Aparicio 
et al, Cancer Discovery  2011).  Transformation from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC is believed to 
be promoted by [CONTACT_683603] (Hirano et al, Eur Urol 2004), and many are concerned 
that with the introduction of novel potent AR-targeted drugs into the clinic for CRPC the incidence of 
NEPC will escalate (Beltran et al, J Clin Oncol  2012).    
 
Histologically NEPC can appear like small cell carcinoma of other primary sites, does not express AR or 
secrete PSA (Palmgren et al, Semin Oncol  2007), and can sometimes be misdiagnosed.  
Immunohistochemical staining of tumors are often positive for neuroendocrine markers chromogranin 
A, synaptophysin, or neuron specific enolase (NSE), and elevated serum levels of chromogranin A, 
NSE, and carcinoembryonic antigen can support the diagnosis.  Gene fusions involving the ERG gene 
(most commonly rearranged with the TMPRSS2  gene), are prostate-specific molecular alterations and 
present in approximately 50% of all prostate cancers (Tomlins et al, Science 2005), with a similar 
frequency in prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC (Lotan et al, Mod Pathol  2011, Scheble et al, 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   13 Histopathology  2010). This suggests that the molecular events associated with NEPC pathogenesis 
differs from small cell carcinomas of other primary sites, and likely has same cell of origin as prostate 
adenocarcinoma.  
 
There is little prospective data regarding treatment of patients with NEPC.  Platinum based 
chemotherapy regimens similar to those used to treat small cell lung carcinomas are often used 
(Papendreou et al, JCO 2002).  However, relapses are common and most patients with NEPC survive 
less than one year.  
 
1.2 Aurora kinase A and Neuroendocrine prostate cancer 
In attempts to identify biomarkers and develop new treatment strategies for patients with NEPC, we 
performed massively parallel, paired end RNA- sequencing (RNA-Seq) and genomic analysis using 
oligonucleotide arrays of prostate tumors and compared the expression profile of NEPC with prostate 
adenocarcinoma (PCA) and benign prostate (Beltran et al,  Cancer Discovery 2011).    
 
There were significant molecular differences between NEPC and PCA, despi[INVESTIGATOR_683582] 
(based on concordance of molecular alterations between primaries and metastases and between NEPC 
and PCA foci of mixed tumors).  Aurora kinase A (AURKA) was significantly overexpressed and 
amplified in NEPC vs PCA (P<0.001), and this was independent of tumor proliferation (Ki67 
expression).  AURKA encodes Aurora kinase A, a serine/threonine kinase involved in mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_683583], centrosome separation, and G2-M transition during the cell cycle (Marumoto et al, Genes to 
Cells 2002). Beyond its role mitosis, Aurora- kinase A also displays oncogenic properties (can transform 
rat fibroblasts in vitro and produce tumors in athymic mice), though its full range of function is not well 
elucidated (Katayama et al, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews  2003).  In neuroblastoma, AURKA is found 
to stabilize N-myc, an oncogene frequently amplified in neuroblastoma and associated with poor 
prognosis (Otto et al, Cancer Cell 2009).  N-myc is not normally present in prostate, but we also found 
its gene (MYCN) to be overexpressed and amplified in NEPC compared to PCA (P<0.001). We 
validated these findings by [CONTACT_683604] a large cohort of patients using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and discovered gene 
amplification of AURKA and MYCN in 40% of NEPC, 5% of PCA, and none of the benign prostate 
tissue. Furthermore, concurrent AURKA and MYCN amplification is seen in 75% of primary prostate

Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   14 tumors from patients that late develop NEPC and with a high concordance between primary tumor and 
metastases (suggesting that these lesions are early events and may be prognostic). 
 
When we introduced AURKA or MYCN into benign prostate epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (RWPE-1) and prostate 
adenocarcinoma cells (LNCaP), MYCN induced AURKA expression and kinase activity by [CONTACT_683605] A protein , and AURKA induced MYCN. Furthermore, either AURKA or MYCN could induce 
expression of the neuroendocrine markers, synaptophysin or neuron-specific enolase, not normally 
expressed in RWPE-1 or LNCaP cells.  This data suggests that AURKA and MYCN are involved in 
prostate neuroendocrine differentiation.   
 
LNCaP transfected with N-myc were phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_683584], with downregulation of AR and 
androgen regulated genes (NKX3-1, TMPRSS2), and chromatin immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_683585] N-
myc directly binds promoters of NSE, SYP, and AR to regulate their expression and modulate the 
neuroendocrine phenotype.  N-myc amplified neuroblastoma cells (IMR-32) also demonstrated N-myc 
binding to NSE and SYP but not AR, suggesting that N-myc binding of AR promoter is prostate 
specific. 
 
Based on these data, we hypothesized that aurora kinase inhibition would demonstrate preferential anti-
tumor effect in NEPC compared to PCA. In support of this, we observed enhanced in vitro and in vivo 
sensitivity of NEPC cells and xenografts treated with the aurora kinase inhibitor PHA-739358 
(Danusertib, Nerviano) , compared to PCA models  and benign prostate cells, with > 50% tumor 
shrinkage in NEPC xenografts and minimal to no effect in PCA. Notably, neuroendocrine marker 
expression (synaptophysin) was completely suppressed in the treated NEPC xenografts, again 
supporting a role of Aurora kinase in modulating the neuroendocrine phenotype. Knockdown of 
AURKA with siRNA in NEPC cells (NCI-H660) also resulted in significant cell death (50-60% 
decreased viability) and suppression of neuroendocrine marker expression.  
 
MLN8237 is an orally administered Aurora kinase A inhibitor that has demonstrated broad antitumor 
activity in vitro and in vivo, and the RP2D as monotherapy in adults with refractory solid tumors was 50 
mg BID for 7 days in 21-day cycles (Dees et al., ASCO 2010).

Version 2: May 14, 2014

We hypothesize that NEPC patients (and a subset of PCA) will preferentially benefit from MLN8237, 
based on: 
1) Aurora-A and its inducer, N-myc, can drive the NEPC phenotype and are overexpressed and 
amplified in NEPC and a small subset of PCA;  
2) Knockdown of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) resulted in decreased viability and suppression of 
neuroendocrine marker expression in NCI-H660 (NEPC) cells;  
3) Aurora kinase inhibitor therapy demonstrate significant and preferential anti-tumor effect in NEPC 
xenografts and results in complete reversal of neuroendocrine marker expression.  
 
1.3.  Study Drug (MLN8237, alisertib) 
1.3.1.  Aurora A Kinases and the Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor MLN8237 
MLN8237 is a selective small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase that is being developed for the 
treatment of advanced malignancies.  Aurora A kinase belongs to a highly conserved family of 
serine/threonine protein kinases that also includes Aurora B and Aurora C.  Aurora A and Aurora B are 
expressed in all actively dividing cells, while Aurora C expression is largely restricted to dividing germ 
cells (Nigg et al, Nature Reviews  Molecular Cell Biology 2001). Aurora A localizes to centrosomes and 
the proximal mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_683586] a diverse set of mitotic processes.  
Aurora A overexpression in human cancers has been correlated with increased aneuploidy and 
centrosome amplification (Sen et al, Journal of National Cancer Institute  2002). Forced overexpression 
of Aurora A kinase in experimental models results in the transformation of normal cells, suggesting that 
Aurora A overexpression may be oncogenic.  In a number of different experimental systems, Aurora A 
inhibition leads to mitotic delays and severe chromosome alignment and segregation defects, followed 
by [CONTACT_283511] (Hoar et al, Molecular & Cell Biology  2007).  Overall, the essential role of Aurora A in 
mitotic progression and its dysregulation in certain cancers made it an attractive therapeutic target, and 
therefore has been initially developed for treatment of a wide variety of tumor types.  MLN8237 has 
demonstrated activity against a variety of nonclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models 
grown in vitro and in vivo (Goldberg et al, Blood 2010), as described below.  MLN8237 is also expected 
to be toxic to proliferating normal tissues, such as the bone marrow, gastrointestinal (GI) epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   16 hair follicles because any cell that is in mitosis, where Aurora A is expressed and active, should be 
susceptible to the effects of an Aurora A kinase inhibitor. 
 
1.3.2. Preclinical Experience with MLN8237 
[IP_ADDRESS]. In Vitro Studies.  MLN8237 is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and reversible 
inhibitor of Aurora A kinase in vitro with an inhibition constant (K i) of 0.[ADDRESS_925593]-116 
human colorectal tumor cells, MLN8237 produces 50% inhibition of Aurora A kinase activity at a 
concentration of 6.7 nM.  It is approximately 200-fold more selective for Aurora A kinase than the 
structurally related family member, Aurora B kinase (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50] = 
1534 nM).  Moreover, in enzyme assays, MLN8237 is selective for Aurora A kinase when compared to 
other kinases and receptors.  MLN8237 has affinity for the gamma acid alpha 1 (GABA A 1) receptor 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BZD) binding site (K i = 290 nM).  The consequences of GABA A binding in rat and dog 
safety pharmacology studies are discussed below. 
Consistent with the mechanism of action for an Aurora A kinase inhibitor, MLN8237 treatment results 
in formation of abnormal mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], an accumulation of mitotic cells, and a decrease in the 
proliferation of a broad range of tumor cell lines grown in culture.  
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, [ADDRESS_925594] of MLN8237 was quantified in tumor cell lines derived from a 
variety of malignancies, including colon (3 cell lines), breast (1 cell line), lung (1), ovary (1), prostate 
(1), pancreas (1), and lymphoid (1).  MLN8237 inhibited proliferation with lethal concentrations for 
50% cell-growth inhibitor concentrations (GI 50 values) ranging from 16 to 469 nM, demonstrating that 
MLN8237 is a potent inhibitor of proliferation in diverse human tumor cell lines. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  In Vivo Studies 
MLN8237 has demonstrated broad antitumor activity in a diverse array of experimental human  tumor 
xenografts when dosed QD or BID.  These include 2 colon models (HCT-116 and DLD-1), 2 lung 
models (H460 and Calu-6), [ADDRESS_925595] model (MDA- MB-231 FP4), 1 prostate model (CWR22 RV-1 
Luc1.17) and 4 DLBCL models (Ly19, WSU, Ly7, PHTX-22-06).  Statistically significant tumor 
growth inhibition (TGI) was observed with MLN8237 given at 30 mg/kg QD or less in all models but 
the Calu-6 model.  At 20 mg/kg BID or less, statistically significant TGI was observed in all models 
tested, including Calu-6.  Taken together, these results demonstrated that MLN8237 has broad antitumor 
activity in many experimental human tumor models. 
To define the plasma concentration of MLN8237 that inhibits Aurora A, the relationship between 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics was assessed at the steady-state concentration (C ss).  
Steady-state MLN8237 concentrations were achieved using osmotic mini-pumps implanted 
subcutaneously (SC) in mice bearing HCT-[ADDRESS_925596] (E max) model with an estimated 
efficacious concentration producing 90% of the maximal possible response (EC 90) of approximately 1 
M. 
The HCT-116 tumor model was also used to determine the antitumor activity of MLN8237 given either 
QD or BID.  MLN8237 demonstrated dose-dependent   TGI whether administered QD or BID.  TGI with 
BID administration of 3 mg/kg (TGI = 70%) and 10  mg/kg (TGI = 102%) was greater than with QD 
administration when measured on the last day of treatment (Day 21).  
The relationship between efficacy and systemic exposure was investigated using osmotic mini-pumps 
implanted SC to deliver sustained release of MLN8237 over [ADDRESS_925597]-116 xenografts.  The 
relationship between the efficacy (TGI) on Day 12 and the average plasma concentration (C avg) values 
on Days 1, 3, 6, 8 and 12 fit the sigmoid E max model.  At a C avg of 1 M sustained exposure in the 10 
mg/mL group the TGI was 88.3%, which was between that observed in the 10 mg/kg (TGI 82.1%) and 
30 mg/kg (TGI 93.1%) orally dosed groups.

   18 1.3.3.  Safety Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Drug Metabolism 
Safety pharmacology studies evaluating the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects of 
MLN8237 did not reveal significant adverse effects at the exposures anticipated to be required for 
human efficacy.  MLN8237 has a low potential to prolong the QT interval on the electrocardiogram 
(ECG), based on its low in vitro activity against the potassium ion channel encoded by [CONTACT_529730]-à-
go-go related gene (hERG) and its lack of an effect on the QTcV interval in dogs.  MLN8237 had 
minimal activity (< 40% inhibition) against all receptor ligand interactions examined except GABAA 1 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Although MLN8237 did elicit behavioral CNS effects attributed to its binding to the 
GABAA1 benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], these effects occurred at dose levels which exceeded the repeat-
administration daily oral maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237. 
The predominant effects of MLN8237 in Sprague-Dawley rats included peripheral blood cytopenias 
secondary to myelosuppression and increased mitotic figures/single cell necrosis (apoptosis) in tissues 
with a high basal cellular replication rate, consistent with the known mechanism of action of MLN8237.  
These effects were also the effects that predominated in repeat-dose studies in beagle dogs.  CNS 
effects, consistent with the activity of MLN8237 at the GABAA 1 benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_32538], were 
observed only in beagle dogs following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg, which exceeds the daily oral 
repeat-administration MTD in this species. 
MLN8237 is metabolized by [CONTACT_283513] I (cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
CYP1A2) and phase II (uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase [UGT] 1A1, 1A3, and 1A8) 
enzymes.  Using human liver microsomes with the appropriate cofactors, the percent contribution of 
CYP and UGT was calculated to be 13.1% and 86.9%, respectively, showing that CYP isozymes play a 
minor role in the metabolism of MLN8237.  MLN8237 is unlikely to inhibit the 5 major CYP enzymes, 
1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 (IC 50 > 100 M) when administered at the projected human 
efficacious dose.  MLN8237 is not a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  MLN8237 inhibited the 
P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated efflux of paclitaxel (Taxol) in Caco 2 cells with an IC 50 of 4.0 M. 
Detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of MLN8237 may be 
found in the IB.

IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   19 1.3.4.  Clinical Experience 
Clinical experience with MLN8237 (alisertib) includes phase 1 and 2 studies in both solid tu mors and 
heme lymphatic malignancies, described below. A phase 3 study in Peripheral T -cell Lymphoma 
(PTCL) began in early 2012.  
MLN8237 for clinical studies is being developed in 2 dosage formulations:  enteric -coated-tablet (ECT), 
and oral solution (OS:  for pediatric use).  Initial studies employed a powder-in-capsule (PIC ) 
formulation, and more recent studies using current formulations all have evaluated safety, PK, relative 
bioavailability (in reference to the PIC), and antitumor activity after adminis tration of the ECT 
formulation.  
Using the ECT formulation, the dose-escalation, phase [ADDRESS_925598] formulation employed 
in this study, multiple dose levels up to 840 mg total cycle dose (60 mg BID for 7 days) were evaluated.  
At the maximum administered dose of 60 mg BID for 7 days administered to patients with advanced 
solid tumors, 3 patients (out of 3 enrolled) developed myelosuppression during the treatment-free period 
which was considered intolerable and above the MTD of 50 mg BID.  In summary, 700 mg total cycle 
dose (eg, 50 mg BID administered daily for 7 days) represents the ceiling for dose escalation in these 
combinations with MLN8237 planned for this current study. 
The predominant toxicities reflect the mechanism of action in proliferating tissues (bone marrow, GI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and hair follicles).  The suggested management of these toxicities is based on standard 
clinical paradigms for an anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent.  Using a treatment-free period for 
recovery between each cycle of drug administration, the clinical experience from multiple phase 1 
through 2 studies indicate that major toxicities can be managed to allow repeat treatment cycles over 
periods extending beyond 12 months. 
MLN8237 is structurally related to the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (BZD) (eg, diazepam, lorazepam) and also has 
activity against the GABAA 1 BZD receptor.  BZD-like effects (eg, somnolence, confusion, memory 
loss) have been observed to be associated with the onset of maximal plasma concentration (eg, T max 
[time to maximum plasma concentration]).  CNS effects associated with peak plasma levels have been 
generally managed by [CONTACT_683606] (eg, BID administration), although dose 
reductions have sometimes been required.  While CNS effects attributed to MLN8237 were also 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   20 generally reversible and manageable by [CONTACT_283515], the causal relationship, and thus 
optimal approach to management, were sometimes confounded by [CONTACT_683607], but not 
limited to, concomitant medications (eg, narcotic analgesics, antianxiety medications), comorbidities 
(eg, infection, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities), or progressive malignancy (eg, brain metastases). 
The clinical experience with MLN8237 includes treatment with multiple doses and schedules as 
described in the IB.   
 
1.3.5.  Pharmacokinetics 
Based on an integrated assessment of the currently available PK data from PIC formulationacross two 
solid tumor studies C14001 and C14002, it can be concluded that MLN8237 absorption is fast, with 
overall median T max of 2 hours postdose. Overall mean steady-state terminal half-life following multiple 
dose administration in patients with non-hematologic malignancies was 23 hours. The overall mean 
peak/trough ratios were 2.5 and 5.2 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. The overall mean 
accumulation ratios were 2.9 and 1.8 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic steady-state 
conditions were approximately achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 7 following daily oral administration. The steady-state 
exposure of MLN8237 increases approximately in a dose proportional manner over the range from 5 to 
200 mg daily dose. Pharmacokinetic variability was high following administration as PIC (%CV in 
steady-state dose-normalized AUC 0-24hr of 78%). At the recommended phase 2 dose of 50 mg BID, the 
mean stea dy-state average concentration (Css,avg) exceeded the preclinical projected efficacious plasma 
concentration associated with saturating levels of pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity in HCT-116 
mouse xenograft studies (1 μM). The pharmacokinetic properties of MLN8237 in Protocol C14003 in 
patients with hematologic malignancies are generally consistent with those observed in patients with 
non-hematologic malignancies. 
Glucuronidation is expected to be a major route of MLN8237 clearance and in vitro metabolism studies 
indicate that UGT1A1 is a contributor to MLN8237 glucuronidation. Preliminary results of dose-
normalized steady-state exposure of MLN8237 by [CONTACT_15924]1A1 genotype are available in 67 patients in 
Protocols C14001 and C14002. The geometric mean of dose-normalized steady-state AUC 0-24hr in 
*28/*28 genotype group (N = 9) was approximately 40% higher than that observed in the wt/wt 
genotype group (N = 36). 
The MLN8237 molecules exhibits pH-dependent solubility, and the variability in gastric pH likely 
represents an important source of variability in MLN8237 oral absorption following administration of an 
immediate release formulation like the PIC.  Emerging clinical data from enteric-coated tablet (ECT) 
formulation indicated that the steady-state systemic exposures of MLN8237 administered as the ECT 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, [ADDRESS_925599] formulation in reference to the PIC formulation is estimated to be 
approximately 90%. Therefore the MTD of [ADDRESS_925600] formulation in the ongoing and future 
clinical development of MLN8237. 
Further details regarding the clinical PK of MLN8237 are provided in the MLN8237 Investigator 
Brochure. 
1.3.6.  Potential Risks and Benefits 
The safety risks of MLN8237 (alisertib) treatment are:  (1) leukopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
and lymphopenia with a potential increased susceptibility to infecti on, (2) thrombocytopenia with a 
potential increased risk of bleeding; (3) anemia; (4)  gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity resulting in 
stomatitis/mucositis, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, dehydration, and 
potentially mucosal/GI  bleeding, and sepsis; (5) alopecia; (6) asthenia/fatigue; and (7) fever, and 
(8) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- like effects including sedation, somnolence, sleep disorders, confusion, 
disorientation and associated memory loss and gait disturbances (which were reversible  in clinical 
studies with cessation of treatment or dose reduction).  Skin changes including hand -foot syndrome have 
been reported in some patients.  Clinical safety data includes experience from patients who received 
multiple cycles followed by [CONTACT_3148] -free periods between each cycle, and from patients who reduced 
or discontinued treatment.  Based on the available clinical data, drug abuse, dependency, and withdrawal 
were not observed.   
While these toxicities are potentially associated with risk or discomfort to the patient, they are 
anticipated to be reversible.  MLN8237 has not led to major neurotoxicities or fluid retention as a single 
agent.  However, because there is only limited human experience with MLN8237, it is possible that 
MLN8237 will have other toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in 
rats and dogs and from ongoing studies in humans.  MLN8237 has a low potential to prolong the QT 
interval in vivo based upon its extremely weak in vitro binding to hERG (IC 50 and Ki both > 100  M).   
To mitigate the inherent risks in clinical studies of MLN8237, patients are evaluated frequently while 
they are receiving treatment.   
Because MLN8237 inhibits Aurora A kinase, it is possible that MLN8237 may interfere with cance r 
growth and cause cancer cell death through a potentially non-cross resistant pathway as compared to 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC

International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines. 
 
1.4. Correlative Studies Background.   
 
Blood: Shedding of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into the circulation is common in advanced prostate 
cancer. The CellSearch (Veridex LLC, Warren, NJ) automated enrichment system capture device is an 
FDA-cleared technology for detecting and quantifying EpCAM expressing tumor cells in the blood and 
has prognostic value. A CTC count > 5 per 7.5 mL of blood is considered unfavorable and <5 is 
favorable; furthermore, changes in CTC count on therapy is reflective of prognosis and therefore serial 
CTC counts are being validated prospectively as alternative biomarker of tumor response for patients 
with advanced prostate cancer.  CTC counts by [CONTACT_683608], but are 
not ma
ndatory.  Blood will also be obtained on day 1 of each cycle and evaluated for neuroendocrine 
markers (serum chromogranin and NSE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and prostate specific antigen 
(PSA). 
 
In addition, blood for research (plasma and PBMC’s) will be collected for research on C1D1, C1D8, and 
at progression or end of study.  Plasma DNA will be evaluated for Aurora A and N-myc amplification 
and correlated with response to therapy and tumor tissue status.  In addition, we will evaluate for 
concordance between plasma DNA molecular alterations and matched primary prostate cancer tissue 
and metastatic samples. We will correlate these results with clinical response to MLN8237.  
 
Archival Tissue:   Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) archival prostate tumor tissue will be 
obtained from all patients (prostatectomy specimens or prostate biopsies) and evaluated for AR, ERG, 
aurora kinase A, N-myc protein expression, copy number changes, and/or translocation (in case of 
ERG). We hypothesize that high-risk primary prostate tumors harbor genetic alterations that predispose 
to clinical progression and the development of NEPC.  Using the MiSeq technology (Illumina), we will 
perform targeted exome sequencing of matched primary tumors from 30 patients that later developed 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   23 metastatic NEPC. We will take a focused approached to examine non-synonymous recurrent mutations 
in FFPE tissue. Through molecular classification and correlation with clinical features and between 
matched primary tumors and metastases, we will gain insight into genetic alterations that arise early and 
predispose to the development of NEPC and will correlate with outcomes and clinical response to 
MLN8237. 
 
Metastatic Tissue:  A tumor biopsy of metastatic site is required for all patients and will also be 
evaluated for AR, ERG, aurora kinase A, N-myc protein expression, copy number changes, and/or 
translocation (in case of ERG).  Biopsy is performed for research and must be performed prior to Cycle 
1 Day 1, but results not needed before proceeding.  We will perform exome and transcriptome 
sequencing of approximately 30 metastatic tumors from patients enrolled on study. We will determine 
the spectrum of mutations associated with NEPC, and compare to >150 localized prostate cancer whole 
exomes (n=120) and whole genomes (n=30) that we recently sequenced in collaboration with the Broad 
Institute.  Highly ranked and potential driving mutations will be integrated with gene expression data 
(RNA-Seq) and protein expression (IHC) and correlated with clinical features, treatment response to 
MLN8237, and outcomes. We will generate a comprehensive genetic profile and characterize the 
spectrum of actionable and informative mutations in NEPC. An optional metastatic biopsy at time of 
progression will be obtained in consenting patients; these tumors will be evaluated for molecular 
changes associated with progression on MLN8237.   
Extensive genomic profiling of metastatic and primary tumor specimens will help establish novel 
prognostic biomarkers and those that may predict response to MLN8237. This study will also identify 
molecular alterations associated with disease progression and treatment resistance, bring new insight 
into the mutational spectrum of advanced disease, and identify additional therapeutic targets.   We 
hypothesize that advanced prostate tumors acquire driving mutations in response to therapy that allows 
them to evade therapy and transform to a NEPC phenotype.

5.2.13  Long term follow up  
 
Subjects should be followed for survival every 3 months for up to 3 years following end of study visit 
(in-office visits at study institutions are not necessary) 
 
 
 
6.0  Correlative Studies  
6.1 CTC enumeration by [CONTACT_209548] (encouraged, but not required) 
CTC counts by [CONTACT_209548] (Veridex) methodology will be performed prior to study drug initiation 
(within 1 month), after study drug completion C2, and at progression.  Samples should be analyzed by a 
CLIA certified lab and billed to subject’s insurance.  CTC counts are optional for institutions not able to 
perform this procedure due to insurance reimbursement or may arrange for central CTC enumeration (in 
this case, subjects will not be billed, but funding will be taken out of per-subject reimbursement for that 
site). 
 
6.2 Blood for research analysis:   
PBMCs and plasma for research will be collected on C1D1 (or within 4 weeks prior to treatment). 
Plasma will also be collected at the following time points: C1D8, and at progression or end of study.  
This will be collected for research purposes only and will not be billed to the subject.  Blood samples 
should be collected, processed and shipped to the central laboratory per specifications in the Lab 
Manual. 
6.3 Serum tumor markers 
Serum for central analysis of chromogranin A and neuron specific enolase (and CEA at some time 
points) will be collected on D1 of every cycle and at progression/end of study.  Blood samples should be 
collected, processed and shipped to the central laboratory per specifications in the Lab Manual. 
 
6.4 Archival Tissue. Tissue blocks or 10 unstained slides (10 microns each) and 5 unstained

 Bone scan, CT/MRI abdomen/pelvis, and CT of chest at baseline 
 Bone scan, CT/MRI of abdomen/pelvis, and CT of chest will be repeated after every 3rd 
cycle until the subject is off-study 
 In addition, scans will be performed for subjects with clinical signs or symptoms of 
progression at the investigators discretion 
 Every effort should be made to use the same imaging technique for follow up evaluation as 
was utilized at baseline 
 Should RECIST criteria for PR or CR be met at any imaging time point, investigators are 
urged to consider a repeat scan at least 4 weeks following the scan demonstrating response.  In this 
instance, or if imaging is performed for clinical purposes earlier than scheduled per protocol, it is 
permissible to “reset” future imaging time points to every 3rd cycle following the last scan. 
 
8.0  Treatment Plan 
8.1.  Administration of MLN8237.  Treatment will be administered only to eligible patients under the 
supervision of the investigator or identified co-investigator(s). Treatment will be administered on an  
outpatient basis.  MLN8237 will be given PO in a dosage of 50 mg BID for 7 Days (Days 1-7) of each 
21-day treatment cycle.  The study drug will be administered on an empty stomach with the patient 
remaining NPO (nothing by [CONTACT_1966]), except for water and prescribed medications, for 2 hours before and 
1 hour after each dose.  Patients will be instructed to take each oral dose of MLN8237 with 8 ounces (1 
cup, 240 mL) of water. Appropriate dose modifications/delays for MLN8237 in section 5.2.   
 
MLN8237 drug product is supplied as the ECT dosage form in 10 mg strength, with dose strength 
expressed as the milligrams of active drug (free acid).  The key formulation excipi[INVESTIGATOR_683587]8237 
tablet formulation that aid in the in vivo absorption of the drug are the buffer (sodium bicarbonate), the 
surfactant (sodium lauryl sulfate), and the enteric coating.  MLN8237 ECT are packaged in a 60- cc 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a rayon coil, induction seal, desiccant packs, and a

   36 polypropylene child-resistant cap.  MLN8237 is an anticancer drug, and as with other potentially toxic 
compounds, caution should be exercised when handling MLN8237. 
All tablets are to be ingested whole; patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets will be excluded 
from the study.  Antiemetogenic agents may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Although not prohibited, the use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_227014]-like effects of MLN8237. 
Study drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or 
identified subinvestigator(s) 
 
8.2.  Dose Modification and Delay  
Toxicity will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0 3.  These criteria are avai lable online at

IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   37 8.2.1  Criteria for Retreatment and Dose Delay 
Treatment with MLN8237 will be repeated every 21 days.  In order for a new cycle of therapy to begin, 
the patient’s ANC must be ≥ 1,500/mm3 and the platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3.  In addition, all 
other non-hematologic toxicity considered by [CONTACT_683609]8237 
must have resolved to ≤  Grade 2 or to the patient’s baseline values before a new cycle of therapy may 
begin. 
If the patient fails to meet the above-cited criteria for retreatment, then initiation of the next cycle of 
therapy should be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_925624] been met.  Should treatment need to be delayed 
for more than 1 week (ie, a rest period of more than 21 days) because of incomplete recovery from 
treatment-related toxicity, the dose of MLN8237 will be reduced 1 level ( Table 0-1) to 40 mg BID when 
therapy resumes.  A second dose reduction to 30 mg BID may occur should treatment need to be 
delayed for more than 1 week because of incomplete recovery from treatment-related toxicity on the 
reduced dosage of 40 mg BID.  Patients who require further dose reductions will be removed from the 
study.  Should treatment need to be delayed for more than 3 weeks at any dose, therapy with MLN8237 
will be discontinued.

   38  Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC  500 cells/mm3) lasting more than 7 consecutive days. Patient s 
experiencing Gr 4 neutropenia at any time  should undergo repeat CBC within 5 days  
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding 
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/µL) lasting more than 7 consecutive days.  
 Patients experiencing Gr 4 thrombocytopenia at any time  should undergo repeat CBC within 5 
days. 
 Platelet count less than 10,000/µL at any time 
8.2.4.  Dose Modifications for Nonhematological Toxicities 
If a patient experiences any of the following toxicities during the dosing period  (i.e. D1-7 of the cycle), 
dosing will be discontinued for the remainder of that c ycle and the dose will be decreased [ADDRESS_925625] resolved to 
≤ Grade 1 or to baseline.  
 Any Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that is considered by [CONTACT_683610]: 
o Grade 3 arthralgias/myalgias 
o Grade 3 or greater nausea or emesis, or both, that occurs in the absence of optimal 
antiemetic therapy (5-hydroxytryptamine 3 [5-HT3] serotonin receptor antagonist) 
o Grade 3 or greater diarrhea that occurs in the absence of optimal supportive therapy 
with loperamide 
o Grade 3 fatigue that lasts less than 1 week

hematologic toxicity.  If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_227005]’s interest 
to continue therapy with MLN8237, then after recovery from the toxicity or toxicities in question to 
≤ Grade [ADDRESS_925626] 1 dose level with 
subsequent cycles of therapy.  When a dose reduction of MLN8237 is required, no re -escalation of dose 
will be permitted.  If a patient requires more than 2 dose reductions, therapy with  MLN8237 will be 
discontinued.   Any additional dose delays or dose modifications should be discussed with the Study 
Chair. 
 
8.3.  Packaging and Labeling 
The study drug, provided by [CONTACT_20555], will be labeled and handled at the investigative site as open-
label material; packaging labels will fulfill all requirements specified by [CONTACT_20556].  
MLN8237 will be supplied as ECT in [ADDRESS_925627] tablets. 
 
8.4.  Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
The following medications and procedures are prohibited during the study: 
 Any antineoplastic therapy, other than LHRH agonists/antagonists. Bisphosphonates and 
denosomab are allowed.  
 Any investigational therapy other than MLN8237  
 Requirement for constant administration of any proton pump inhibitor.  Patients may be 
administered alternative agents to manage gastric acidity or reflux (eg, H2 receptor antagonists, 
antacids) with exceptions described below. 
 Histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists are not permitted from the day prior (Day -1) through to 
the end of MLN8237 dosing (Day 7)

Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   40 8.5.  Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
Myeloid or erythroid growth factors to treat patients with neutropenia or anemia according to the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guidelines. Antiemetic agents may be administered at 
the discre tion of the investigator but are not commonly required as a prophylactic agent.  All other 
manifestations of the patient’s malignancy should be treated at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Antacids are permitted; however, they should be administered more than 2 hours before or 2 hours after 
administration of MLN8237.   
 
Medications with potential CNS effects are not prohibited in this study, but it is recommended that their 
use be minimized to avoid confusion in the interpretation of CNS effects should they occur during the 
course of treatment with MLN8237.  Because of MLN8237’s structural and pharmacological similarity 
to the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], concomitant therapy with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_227011]. 
 
In appropriate settings, such as combinations with agents known to produce frequent thrombocytopenia, 
restricted uses of anticoagulants should be considered. 
 
All other medical conditions should be treated at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with 
local community standards of medical care. 
 
8.6.  Precautions and Restrictions  
Food and drinks other than water and prescribed medications are not permitted for [ADDRESS_925628], operate dangerous tools or machinery, or engage in any other potentially 
hazardous activity that requires full alertness and coordination if they experience sedation while enrolled 
in this study.

It is not known what effects MLN8237 has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus.  
Therefore,  patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.  Even if surgically sterilized (ie, status 
postvasectomy) must agree to one of the following:  Practice effective barrier contraception during the 
entire study treatment period and through four months after the last dose of study drug, or completely 
abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 
   
8.7  Management of Clinical Events 
8.7.1.  Nausea and Vomiting 
Prophylactic antiemetic therapy will not be used in this study unless it becomes clear that MLN8237 
causes acute nausea and vomiting.  If prophylactic antiemetic therapy is needed, 5- HT3 receptor 
antagonists (without corticosteroids) should be tried first.  Because of the potential of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_683588], the use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_683589].  Although this study will not initially employ 
prophylactic antiemetics, there is no prohibition against antiemetic use in the management of a patient 
who develops nausea or vomiting, or both. 
8.7.2.  Diarrhea 
Antidiarrheal medications will not be used prophylactically; however, patients will be instructed to take 
loperamide, [ADDRESS_925630] 12 hours.  During the night, patients may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 
hours.  Fluid intake should be maintained to avoid dehydration.

   42 8.7.3.  Central Nervous System Effects 
If a patient experiences excessive sedation believed to be related to MLN8237, treatment with 
MLN8237 should be interrupted.  Patients whose sedation is not considered immediately life-threatening 
should be carefully monitored and given appropriate supportive care.  If the patient’s level of 
consciousness is considered to be life-threatening, necessary measures should be instituted to secure the 
airway, ventilation, and intravenous access.  Flumazenil (Romazicon®) is a selective benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_683590], not as a substitute for, the proper management of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80311].  Although there is neither preclinical nor clinical experience with flumazenil 
and MLN8237, the use of flumazenil should be considered if the level of MLN8237-associated sedation 
is considered to be life-threatening.  Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and other residual benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_683591].  Continued monitoring is particularly important in the case of MLN8237 given its half-life 
and the comparatively brief half-life of flumazenil in the CNS (20-30 minutes).  Flumazenil should be 
administered according to its label. CNS stimulants such as modafinil (Provigil®), 100 mg/day to 300 
mg/day or methylphenidate (Ritalin®), 10 mg/day to 60 mg/day, may be used to counteract daytime 
somnolence. 
 
8.8.  Treatment Compliance 
All drug will be administered to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or identified 
sub-investigator(s).  The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt (if applicable), drug 
preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers, patients’ study ID number , and total 
drug administered in milligrams.  Any discrepancy between the prescribed  dose and dose administered 
and the reason for the discrepancy must be recorded in the source documents.  
 
8.9    Duration of Treatment and Patient Participation 
Patients will continue therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity as a result of MLN8237, 
investigator’s discretion, or withdrawal of patient consent.  Patients will be followed with history, 
physical, and blood tes ts at each visit to monitor for toxicity.  Patients will be followed for survival

   43 endpoints following completion of this study until death  for up to 3 years after completion of other study 
drug procedures .   
 
8.10  Termination of Treatment and/or Study Participation 
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, 
without prejudice to their medical care.  The investigator will withdraw patients from the study for any 
of the following reasons: 
 Occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event 
 A treatment cycle delay of >3 weeks because of toxicity 
 Patient request 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition unacceptable for further treatment in the 
judgment of the investigator 
 Progressive disease at any time 
At the time of withdrawal, all study procedures outlined for the End of Study visit should be completed.  
The primary reason for a patient’s withdrawal from the study is to be recorded in the source documents. 
       
9.0  Study Drug Administration 
MLN8237 will be administered PO at a dosage  of  50 mg BID for 7 days in each treatment cycle, 
followed by a 14-day, treatment-free period.  The study drug will be administered on an empty stomach 
with the patient remaining nothing by [CONTACT_1966] (NPO), except for water and prescribed medications, for 
2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose.  Patients will be instructed to take each oral dose of 
MLN8237 with 8 ounces (1 cup, 240 mL) of water.  For BID dosing, the doses must be taken at least 
[ADDRESS_925631], with the dose strength expressed as milligrams of active drug 
(free acid); this strength will support the  need for dose reduction  if applicable . All tablets are to be 
ingested whole; patients who have difficulty swall owing tablets will be excluded from the study.

   46 10.0.  ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse Event Definition 
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes 
any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the 
administration of study drug. 
 
For this protocol an abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by [CONTACT_149630] a clinically significant change from baseline. 
 
Serious Adverse Event Definition 
Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe). 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  (Disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately 
life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, [ADDRESS_925635] of an infectious agent; 
any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathy), whether pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an 
infectious agent.   
Clarification should be made between the terms serious and severe because they ARE NOT the same.  
The term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and is usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  
For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may be 
considered mild but would be defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
All SAEs occurring on this study will be reported to WCMC within 24 hours of Investigator notification 
of the event.  SAEs should be reported to individual site’s IRB per local guidelines.  SAEs reported to 
WCMC will be reported on the institutional SAE reporting form and comprehensive AE & IND 
Reporting table and will be distributed to all study sites.  WCMC forms may be downloaded 
http://www.med.cornell.edu/research/for_pol/ins_rev_boa.html  
 
Adverse events (AEs) may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open 
question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
MLN8237 for CRPC and NEPC 
IRB : [PHONE_14220] 
Version 2: May 14, [ADDRESS_925636] be reported to WCMC (which will notify Millennium Pharmacovigilance).  AEs which 
are serious must be reported to WCMC from first dose of MLN8237  up to and including [ADDRESS_925637] dose of MLN8237 .  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology s hould be noted as one comprehensive event.  Any SAE that occurs at any time 
after completion of MLN8237 treatment or after the designated follow -up period that the investigator 
and/or sub- investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to the WCMC for 
further reporting to Millennium Pharmacovigilance.  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_683595] (eg, surgery was 
performed earlier or later than planned).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are 
clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or interc urrent illness(es).  
This is an investigator-initiated study.  The principal investigator, Himisha Beltran (who may also 
sometimes be referred to as the sponsor-investigator), is conducting the study and acting as the sponsor. 
Therefore, the legal/ethical obligations of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_91779] a sponsor and 
those of an investigator. 
 
Sponsor-investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of expectedness or relationship with any study 
drug, to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar 
days of the sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.  In the event that this is a 
multisite study, the sponsor-investigator is responsible to ensure that the SAE reports are sent to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all sites participating in the study.  Subinvestigators 
must report all SAEs to the sponsor-investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet his/her 
foregoing reporting obligations to Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the 
sponsor-investigator and subinvestigator(s).  Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) may request 
follow-up information to a reported SAE, which the sponsor-investigator will be responsible for 
providing to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee). 
 
Millennium will provide a sample SAE Report Form representative of the information Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance may request in follow-up.

This study will utilize the Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) Institutional Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) and follow its policies and procedures for monitoring this multicenter study for safety 
concerns, with ongoing updates from the Study Chair on a continuous basis.  
 
The Weill Cornell DSMB is comprised of medical specialists and advisors on human rights issues in 
human subjects research.  The DSMB currently has [ADDRESS_925640] (IRB) and is recommended for 
oversight by [CONTACT_4318], an independent research monitor will be assigned. 
 
The DSMB evaluates the accumulated data from the study in order to monitor the safety of subjects 
throughout the trial and reviews the risks and benefits, as well as the efficacy, of the study.  The DSMB 
will also evaluate the overall trial conduct and progress.  Ultimately, the DSMB validates the 
continuation of the trial or determines if a study needs modification or termination.   
 
Reports to the DSMB will include the following items for review: 
1.  Completed DSMB Periodic Review Form. 
2.  Synopsis of the study to date. 
3.  IRB approved consent form. 
4.  IRB current protocol. 
5.  Summary table of study results. 
6.  Adverse event table. 
7.  Data safety monitoring plan. 
 
Safety monitoring is carried out to ensure and maintain the scientific integrity of human subject research 
projects and to protect the safety of human subjects.  Safety monitoring can be viewed as any process 
during a clinical trial that involves the review of accumulated outcome data for groups of patient-
subjects to determine if any of the treatment procedures practiced should be altered or stopped.  NIH

Version 2: May 14, 2014 
   51 Guidelines (1998, 2000) specify that all clinical trials should have a system in place for appropriate 
oversight and monitoring to ensure the safety of participants and the validity of the data. 
 
Monitoring activities will be commensurate with the nature, size, and complexity of the trial in 
accordance with institutional policies and will be determined after IRB and DSMB review of the 
protocol immediately prior to study activation.  For a small, single-center study, the monitoring is 
usually performed by a statistician in conjunction with a Safety Officer.  For those single-site, high risk 
trials, a DSMB may be appropriate.  For larger, single or multi-site studies, the monitoring is usually 
performed by a committee, often called a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  Ongoing review of 
the data by [CONTACT_683612], the IRB, the study’s 
sponsor, and the funding agency that the trial can continue without jeopardizing subjects’ safety.   
 
Weill Cornell Medical College requires that all research approved by [CONTACT_683613].  The research 
monitor, Peter Martin, MD, will be providing an unbiased written report to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC Office of 
Research Protections (ORP) Human Research Protection Office (HRPO). Research supported by [CONTACT_683614]. 
 
For this study, the initial planned report to be submitted to the DSMB will occur no later than after [ADDRESS_925641] received therapy on study or every 12 months (whichever event occurs sooner).

interest 
 Withdrawal of patient consent 
 Noncompliance with protocol-specified procedures which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_683596] 
 
12.   Statistical Considerations. 
 
12.1. Sample Size Justification: 
 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who are free from radiographic 
progression at 6 months following treatment with MLN8237.  Based on the phase II trial by 
[CONTACT_683601] (BJUI 2012), the proposed null hypothesis (H0) is that ≤15% of patients 
will be radiographic progression-free at 6 months and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that 
≥30% of patients will be radiographic progression-free at 6 months. 
 
Sample size recommendations for the phase II design are determined according to Ahern’s  
exact single- stage phase II design (A’Hern RP, 2001).  We project a 6 -month radiographic 
progression-free proportion of 15 %, below which the response will be unacceptable, and a 
6-month radiographic progression-free proportion of 30%, above which the regimen will be 
considered worthy of further exploration.  The null hypothesis that the 6-month radiographic 
progression-free proportion is less than or equal to 15% will be tested against the alternative 
hypothesis that the 6-month radiographic progression-free proportion is greater than or equal 
to 30%. 
 
 
 54 The sample size computations were performed assuming a 5% level of significance and 80% 
power.  A total of [ADDRESS_925644] single- stage design yields a ≥ 0.8 0 probability of a positive result if the true percentage 
of patients who are free from radiographic progression at 6 months is ≥30%.  It yields a ≥ 
0.95 probability of a negative result if the true p ercentage of patients who are free from 
radiographic progression at 6 months is ≤15 %.  Assuming 10-20% of patients will be 
unevaluable/ineligible,  we anticipate that a total 60 patients will be enrolled in the study. 
 
Approximately 20% of patients are expected to have histologic entry criteria.  With a sample 
size of approximately 12 patients meeting such criteria (i.e., 20% of 60 enrolled patients), a 
95% confidence interval for the 6-month radiographic progression-free proportion in this 
subgroup of 12 patients can be expected to be within ± 25.9% of the true 6-month 
radiographic progression-free proportion in this subgroup.  This calculation assumes a 6-
month radiographic progression-free proportion of 30% in patients with biopsy positive 
NEPC.  This calculation is for descriptive/exploratory purposes only, with the intent of 
estimating the 6-month radiographic progression-free proportion among the small subgroup 
of patients with biopsy positive NEPC.  
 
Analysis Plan for Endpoints : 
 
Primary Endpoint: 
 
The primary endpoint of 6-month radiographic progression -free proportion  will be estimated 
and a 95% confidence interval will be estimated via binomial proportions.  
 
Secondary Clinical Endpoints: 
With adequate follow-up time, secondary endpoints of response rate and overall survival 
(OS) will be assessed.  Radiologic response rate will be estimated and a 95% confidence 
 
 55 interval will be estimated via binomial proportions . For OS, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using Greenwood ’s formulae.    
 
The frequency of subjects experiencing toxicities will be tabulated.  Toxicities will be 
assessed and graded according to CTCAE v. 4.[ADDRESS_925645] 95% confidence 
intervals around the toxicity proportions will be calculated to assess the precision of the 
obtained estimates. 
 
Exploratory objectives/correlative studies will be evaluated using descriptive statistics, 
graphical methods, and statistical modeling, as appropriate, to explore the relationship 
between response and Aurora –A and N-myc overexpression and/or amplification in 
circulating tumor cells or archival tissue.

12.3.   Measurement of Effect  
Progressive standard prostate cancer is often manifest by [CONTACT_683615], new lesions on 
bone scan, new disease-related symptoms and increasing size of a measurable soft tissue 
mass.  Response is commonly assessed either biochemically (PSA change) or by [CONTACT_683616] a measurable lesion/s.  Given that patients with NEPC do not often secrete PSA and 
all patients on study will have measurable disease, the primary outcome will be determined 
by [CONTACT_683617].  PSA response rate is a secondary endpoint. 
 
12.3.1 Change in lesion size 
C
omplete response (CR) is defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and 
evaluable lesions by [CONTACT_683618] > 1 month.  Partial response (PR) is defined as a 30% 
 
 [ADDRESS_925646] unidimensional diameter of all measurable lesions.  
There may be no new lesions.  Stable Disease (SD) is characterized by [CONTACT_683619] 1 month.  
Disease Progression (DP) is defined as a greater than 20% increase in the sum longest 
unidimensional diameters of the indicator lesions or the appearance of new lesions.  Bone 
scan progression (evaluable disease only) is defined by [CONTACT_43877]2 criteria.  Per consensus 
guidelines in CRPC, to be considered measurable, lymph nodes need to be at least [ADDRESS_925647] dimension and 1.5 cm in short axis. [[ADDRESS_925648] 1.1] 
 
12.3.2 Serum marker response (PSA, chromogranin, neuron specific enolase) 
Se
rum PSA, chromogranin, and neuron specific enolase (NSE) responses are 
determined by [CONTACT_683620], pre-treatment 
level determined just prior to initiating therapy.  Declines of  30% and 50%, 
confirmed by a value  2 weeks later, will be reported. Serum marker progression 
will be defined as a rise of > 25% above either the pretreatment level or the nadir 
level (whichever is lowest). PSA must increase by > 2 ng/ml to be considered 
progression. Confirmation requires a second consecutive rising PSA, chromogranin, 
or NSE at least 2 weeks apart.  Marker stabilization is referred to as any set of values 
that do not meet the criteria for response or PSA progression.

has been described: 
 Baseline < 5, follow up < 5

14.0 ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 
 Good Clinical Practice 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the appropriate regulatory 
requirement(s).  The investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the 
drug as described in the protocol and Investigator’s Brochure.  Essential clinical documents 
will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the data 
collected.  Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for 
the duration of the study and retained according to the appropriate regulations.   
Ethical Considerations 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration 
of Helsinki (see Section 0).  The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation 
in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well-being of the patients.  The study will only be 
conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.  The protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, informed consent, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the 
patients (including diary cards), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to 
these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_093].  Millennium requests 
that informed consent documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_207122]/IEC 
submission.   
 
 58 Patient Information and Informed Consent 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from 
either the patient or his/her guardian or legal representative prior to study participation.  The 
method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent 
will comply with ICH-GCP and all applicable regulatory requirement(s).    
Patient Confidentiality 
In order to maintain patient privacy, all data capture records, drug accountability records, 
study reports and communications will identify the patient by [CONTACT_51768].  The investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from WCMC or its 
designees and regulatory authority(ies) access to the patient’s original medical records for 
verification of data gathered on the data capture records and to audit the data collection 
process.  The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly 
available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913].  
 
Protocol Compliance 
The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol given 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies).  
Significant c hanges to the protocol will require approval from Millennium and written 
IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51703], except when the modification 
is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients.  The I RB/IEC may provide, if 
applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_502224](s) in ongoing studies that have the approval /favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_216397]/IEC.  The investigator will submit all protocol modifications to Millennium and the 
regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source documents.   
 
 59  
On-site Audits 
Regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB , WCMC pers onnel or their delegates and/or 
Millennium’s clinical quality assurance group may request access to all source documents, 
data capture records, and other study documentation for on -site audit or inspection.  Direct 
access to these documents must be guarant eed by [CONTACT_093], who must provide support 
at all times for these activities.  
 
Drug Accountability 
Accountability for the drug at all study sites is the responsibility of the principal 
investigator.  The investigator will ensure that the drug is used only in accordance with this 
protocol.  Drug accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery date to the site (if 
applicable), inventory at the site (if applicable), use by [CONTACT_6904], and return to

APPENDIX 1 
    Declaration of Helsinki 
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_925654] the health of the people.  The 
physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code 
of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when 
providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental 
condition of the patient." 
4. Medical progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects. 
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology 
and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
methods must continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, 
accessibility and quality. 
7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens. 
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and 
protect their health and rights.  Some research populations are vulnerable and need special 
protection.  The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must be 
recognized.  Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for those who will 
not benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the research is combined 
with care. 
9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for 
research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international 
requirements.  No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to 
reduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
 
 B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH 
1. It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and 
dignity of the human subject. 
2. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant 
sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal 
experimentation. 
3. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
4. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects 
should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol.  This protocol should be submitted 
for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially 
appointed ethical review committee, which must be independent of the investigator, the 
sponsor or any other kind of undue influence.  This independent committee should be in 
conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is 
performed.  The committee has the right to monitor ongoing trials.  The researcher has the 
obligation to provide monitoring information to the committee, especially any serious 
adverse events.  The researcher should also submit to the committee, for review, information 
regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and 
incentives for subjects. 
5. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate that there is compliance with the principles enunciated in this 
Declaration. 
6. Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by [CONTACT_683622] a clinically competent medical person.  The 
responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and 
never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given consent. 
7. Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by [CONTACT_683623].  This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical 
research.  The design of all studies should be publicly available. 
8. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects 
unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be 
satisfactorily managed.  Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are found to 
outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial 
results. 
9. Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance o f 
the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject.  This is especially 
important when the human subjects are healthy volunteers. 
10. Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in 
which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research. 
11. The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project. 
12. The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected.  Every 
precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality of the 
patient's information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
 
 13. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations 
of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort 
it may entail.  The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the 
study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring that 
the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's 
freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be obtained in 
writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
14. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-
informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely 
independent of this relationship. 
15. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent 
from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups 
should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of 
the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally 
competent persons. 
16. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition 
to the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
17. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents 
obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population.  The 
specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to 
give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and 
approval of the review committee.  The protocol should state that consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized 
surrogate. 
18. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations.  In publication of the results of 
research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results.  Negative as 
well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available.  Sources of 
funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in 
the publication.  Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down 
in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE 
1. The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the 
research is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic value.  When 
medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the 
patients who are research subjects. 
2. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those 
of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods.  This does not exclude 
the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or 
therapeutic method exists. 
 
 3. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of 
access to the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by [CONTACT_10748]. 
4. The physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the 
research.  The refusal of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the 
patient-physician relationship. 
5. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods 
do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the patient, 
must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in 
the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating 
suffering.  Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed 
to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, 
where appropriate, published.  The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be 
followed.

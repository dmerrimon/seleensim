CLINICAL STUDY SY NOPSIS: Study RAP -MD-04
Title of StudyA Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, 
Multicenter Study of Rapastinel as Adjunctive Therapy in the 
Prevention of Relapse in Patients with Major Depressive 
Disorder
Study Centers (Country) Approximately 105 to 110 study centers ([LOCATION_002])
Development Phase 3
ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy ,safety , and tolerability of rapastinel 
relative to placebo in the prevention of relapse in patients 
with major depressive disorder (MDD)
MethodologyThis study comprises the following periods:
An8-to 16 -week, open -label treatment period (OLTP) 
during which patients will receive 450 mg intravenous 
(IV) rapastinel once weekly adjunctive to ongoing 
antidepressant therapy (ADT) to identify stable 
responders. Individual treatment duration in the period 
will be at least 8 weeks and up to 16 weeks to 
accommodate variability among patients and adequately 
identify stable responders (patients treated for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_432111] 6 weeks)
A 26-to 104 -week, double -blind randomized -withdrawal 
period during which stable responders from the 
open -label period will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 
3double -blind treatment arms: 
oWeekly adjunctive IV administration of 450 mg 
rapastinel
oAdjunctive IV administration of 450 mg 
rapastinel once every 2 weeks
oWeekly adjunctive IV administration of placebo
Individual double -blind treatment period (DBTP) durations 
will vary with a minimum duration of 26 weeks and a 
maximum duration of 104 weeks (the study ends when all 
randomized patients have either met relapse criteria, early 
terminated for other reasons, or completed 26 weeks of the 
double -blind treatment period [ DBTP ]).
Upon completion of the DBTP, patients will be eligible to 
enroll in the open -label safety extension study, RAP -MD-06.  
The last visit in the DBTP will become the first visit of Study 
RAP -MD-06 for suc h patients.  Patients who do not enroll in 
RAP -MD-06 will enter a 2 -week safety follow -up period.

Statistical MethodsThe primary and secondary  efficacy analyse s will compare 
the time to relapse between placebo and rapastinel groups in 
the respective time -frame (within the first 52 weeks of the 
DBTP for the primary endpoint and during the entire DBTP 
for the secondary endpoint) usi ng the log -rank test using the 
Double- blind modified Intent -To-Treat (mITT) Population. 
Estimates of the hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals 
will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model with 
treatment group as an explanatory variable. The cumulative 
distribution function of time to relapse will be characterized 
by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier curves.
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively for the 
Open -label Safety Population and the D ouble -blind Safety 
Population.
The Open- label Safety Population will consist of all patient s 
who signed the informed consent form ( ICF)if they 
participated in the lead -in studies, and all de novo patients

7.1 DISEASE B URDEN OF MAJOR DEPR ESSIVE DISORDER 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highl y disabling , serious condition which is 
associated with significant morbidity  and mortality . MDD manifests as a major 
depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (which may  be singular or recurrent) in which the affected i ndividual 
experiences 1) depressed mood ,or 2) loss of interest or pleasure (as well as other 
symptoms) for most of the day , nearl y ever y day, for at least 2 weeks. MDD affects 
approximately  14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7 % of the US population 
18years of age and older , in a given year(Kessler et al, 2005 ).Worldwide, about 15% of 
the adult population is at a lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_153866] ( Kessler et al, 1994 ). 
Depression may  cause serious, long -lasting s ymptoms and often disrupts a person’s 
ability  to perform routine tasks. I n 2000, unipolar depressive disorders were by  [CONTACT_242299] (11.9%) of worldwide years of life lived with disability  (World Health 
Organization, 2001 ), and the total economic burden of treating depression in the 
[LOCATION_002] was $83.[ADDRESS_432120] of the total economic burden (62%). 
Other economic burdens in 2000 included $26.1 billion (31%) for treatment costs and 
$5.4 billion (7%) for suicide -
related costs ( Greenberg et al, 2003 ). 
MDD is a leading cause of dis ability  in the [LOCATION_002] (Murray  et al, 2013). Moreover, 
MDD is known to be a significant risk factor for suicide and ischemic heart disease, as it 
accounted for 16 million of the disability -adjusted life y ears (DAL Ys) associated with 
suicide and 4 million of the DALYs associated with ischemic heart disease. Research has 
shown that untreated depression has both a functional (social and work role) as well as a 
neuroanatomical (hippocampal shrinkage) effect on the patient (Videbech and Ravnkilde , 
2004). Given the disease burden and link to suicidality  as well as increased mortality  with 
other comorbid conditions, MDD is a serious and life -threatening condition anda leading 
cause of disabilit y in the world.
7.2 SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE I NHIBITORS AND 
SELECTIVE SEROTONIN AND NOREPI[INVESTIGATOR_347743] I NHIBITORS IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE 
DISORDER
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s) and selective serotonin and 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRI s) currently  represent the first line of treatment 
ofdepression in the [LOCATION_002]. Unfortunatel y, a large number of patients do not 
experience therapeutic benefit from these first- line agents ( Rosenzweig -Lipson et al, 
2007 ). Lack of sufficient response to adequate treatment remains a critical problem in the 
management of patients with MDD. Up to two-thirds of patients treated with first- line 
[ADDRESS_432121] become 
treatment resistant ( Fava and Davidson, 1996; Trivedi et al, 2006 ). Not achieving 
remission has been shown to be predictive of poo rer ps ychosocial functioning, high er 
rates of relapse, and higher rates of rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( McInt yre and O’Donovan, 2004 ). 
The results of the STAR*D study  suggest that with successive failures of treatment, 
patients are less and less likely  to respond to subsequent treatment, and those who do 
respond are more likel y to relapse ( Rush et al, 2006 ). Present strategies available to treat 
patients who do not respond to first- line antidepressant monotherap y include switching 
of 
antidepressant (either within or between classes); combination therap y in which multiple 
antidepre ssants are used simultaneously ; augmentation of ongoing antidepressant 
monotherap y with adjunctive use of drugs such as mood stabilizers or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_347744] ( Boland and Keller, 2006 )
;and the use of nonpharmacologic treatments 
including ps ychotherap y and phototherap y, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial 
magnetic stimulation, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) . Clearly, there remains a 
critically  important unmet medical need for this patient population.
Existing antidepressants have a number of limitations, leading to considerable unmet 
medical need in the effective treatment of MDD ,with up to 50% of patients with MDD 
having an inadequate response to or failing current antidepressant therap y (ADT ). 
Currently  available first -line antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs) t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_19236] 3 to 4 weeks 
or more of continuous daily  dosing to relieve s ymptoms of MDD and are assoc iated with 
side effects related to their pharmacological mechanisms of action (sexual dy sfunction, 
weight gain, jitteriness, sleep disturbances) ,which are further associated with poor 
patient compliance ( Masand, 2003; Ashton et al, 2005 ). Patients often experience 
undesirable side effects before they  experience an improvement in depressive sy mptoms, 
which could lead to premature discontinuation of therap y. Taken together, these factors 
define significant areas for improvement of ADT. 
Patients vary  greatl y in their response to antidepressants and it is not possible to reliably 
predict whether an individual patient will respond to a given antidepressant. This leads to 
clinicians often using a trial- and-error approach to i dentify  an effective antidepressant. 
Due to the gradual devel opment of the full therapeutic effect of currently  available 
antidepressants, each antidepressant needs to be administered for [ADDRESS_432122] substantial safet y and 
efficacy  limitations. The drugs currently  approved for use as adjunc tive therapy  to 
23
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov 2018antidepressants for the treatment of MDD —namely , the at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_242291]®
(aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]), Seroquel XR®(quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_123111]), and Rexulti® (brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253])—are 
associated with significant adverse reactions, as well as a number of serious warnings and 
precautions. Originall y developed for the treatment of psychotic disorders, these drugs 
share a number of clinically  relevant adverse effects based on their mechanisms of action.
As all current antipsy chotic agents modulate central dopaminergic s ystems, they  all carry  
a risk of extrap yramidal symptoms such as muscular rigidity, acute d ystonia, as well as 
akathisia, which is a particularly relevant adverse event (AE) that complicates clinical 
management in a significant number of treate d individuals, as high as 45% 
(Sachdev, 1995 ). In addition, these compounds are associated with a risk of neuroleptic 
malignant s yndrome and tardive d yskinesia. Depending on their individual 
pharmacological profile, ant ipsychotics also carry  a risk for metabolic changes including 
hypergly cemia/diabetes mellitus, dy slipi[INVESTIGATOR_242292]; blood dy skrasias 
such as leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocy tosis; orthostatic hy potension; cognitive 
and motor impairment ; cataracts; and insomnia ( Abilify ,2014; Seroquel, 2013; 
Rexulti, 2015 ). The range of clinicall y relevant side effects with antips ychotics has to be 
balanced carefull y against the potential for therapeutic benefits in patients with major 
depression. In this context, it is important to highlight that for the approved aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_246823], the full therapeutic benefit required several weeks of daily  adjunctive 
dosing to become apparent, and in many  patients, adverse effects occurred substantially  
earlier than the mood -alleviating effects of these drugs. 
Furthermore, the drugs currentl y approved for adjunctive treatment of MDD also have 
limited efficacy . The pi[INVESTIGATOR_153872] , the at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_242294], showed a delay ed onset of effect 
(1-2 weeks), a modest magnitude of effect (effect sizes were 0.35- 0.39 after 6 weeks of 
repeat dosing) , and modest rates of response and remission after 6 weeks of re peat dosing 
(response rates were 32 %-34% and remission rates were 25%- 26%) ( Berman et al, 2007; 
Marcus et al, 2008 ). 
Clearly , there is a substantial need for the development of novel treatments with a better 
safet y/tolerability  profile and a faster onset of full therape utic benefit. Rapastinel has 
initially  shown substantially  improved safet y/tolerability as well as promising efficacy , in 
both speed of onset and overall magnitude, for adjunctive therap y in MDD. 
7.4 RAPASTI NEL AS A N OVEL APPROACH TO THE 
TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER
The mechanism of action of rapastinel is entirel y different from that of at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_246823]. Rapastinel is an N-methy l-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulator 
with a novel and comple x pharmacological mecha nism of action , acting as a nonselective 
agent at NR2 subunits and display ing properties as a functional partial agonist in a 
number of pharmacological assay s. 
[ADDRESS_432123] to 
ketamine, no signal of abuse liability  was detected in informative animal models. 
Rapastinel is available as an intravenous (IV) formulation only . In 2 Phase 2 clinical 
studies in patients with MDD, single IV doses of rapastinel at 5 mg /kg and 10 mg/kg have 
been shown to produce marked antidepressant effects within [ADDRESS_432124], accompanied b y brief ps ychotomimetic and dissociative 
effects ( Newport et al, 2015 ). 
The available Phase [ADDRESS_432125] of vary ing the treatment frequency  after initial stabilization. This 
study is intended to support an application for regulatory  approval of rapastinel as an 
adjunctive treatment for MDD.

9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTIO N
Study  RAP -MD-04 is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, pla cebo -controlled, 
parallel -group study  to evaluate the efficacy , safety ,and tolerability  of rapastinel as
long-term maintenance treatment for patients with MDD who either completed 1 of the 
rapastinel lead -in studies (RAP -MD-01, RAP -MD-02, or RAP -MD-03) or who are de 
novo patients (patients who di d not participate in one of the lead -in studies) . Enrollment 
of de novo patients may be considered at some study  centers if enrollment of rollover 
patients does not meet targeted projections and will no t be allowed unless specified in an 
official communication from the Sponsor.
The study  will be conducted in the following periods:
A screening period of up to 14 day s (for de novo patients only )
An 8 -to 16 -week open -label treatment period (OLTP )
A randomized DBTP of at least 26 weeks (and up to 104 weeks)
A 2-week safety  follow -up period (for patients who do not enter the RAP- MD-06 
extension study  only)
Individual treatment durations will vary , as patients enrolled early  in the study  will be 
allowed to continue double -blind treatment until a relapse occurs or the study is 
terminated. The maximum duration of the study  will be 104weeks (the study  ends when 
all randomized patients have either met relapse criteria, earl y terminated for other 
reasons, or completed 26 weeks of the DBTP).

The screening period will occur up to 2 weeks prior to Visit 2:
For completers of 1 of the lead -in studie s RAP -MD-01, RAP -MD- 02, orRAP -MD- 03
(rollover patients ), the final/ Early Termination ( ET)visit of the lead-in study  will 
serve as the S creening Visit/V isit1 for RAP -MD- 04. Rollover patients wil l receive 
the first dose of open -label investigational product (IP)(ie,rapastinel 450 mg IV) at 
Visit 1of the OL TP to ensure continuity  of treatment .
Upon providing written informed consent, de novo patients will enter a screening 
period of up to 14 day s.  Screening procedures may be condu cted on up to 2 separate 
dates where necessary  to accommodate patient and study  center schedule; however, 
every  effort should be made to conduct all procedures as earl y as possible in the 
screening period and the rater -administered MADRS and computer -admin istered 
MADRS must be collected on the same date. Following the screening period , patients 
enter the 8 -to 16-week OLTP.

period, patients will be treated w ith weekl y IV injections of 450 mg rapastinel in addit ion 
to the continued unchanged ADT . The purpose of this period is to identify  stable 
responders who will be eligible for th e randomized -withdrawal period.
A patient will be considered a stable responder upon achieving both:
MADRS total score ≤ [ADDRESS_432127] MADRS excursion 
(MADRS > 12 but ≤ 16) during 6 consecutive weeks, and   
MADRS total score ≤ 12 for 2 consecutive visits prior to randomization
Stability criteria may  be met at any  point from Study  Week 7 to Study  Week 15 for 
rollover patients and at any  point from Study  Week 8 to Study  Week 16 for de novo
patients.  
Patients who do not meet stability  criteria within these timeframes will undergo the End -

RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov [ZIP_CODE].4.2 Treatments Administered
During the OLTP and DBTP, IPwill only  be administered to eligible patient s by a
medically  qualified person as per the local state regulations. The range of persons who 
can administer an IV can be a ph ysician, a ph ysician assistant, nurse, or nurse 
practitioner, etc, depending on the local and/or state law.  
IP should be administered after all efficacy  and safety  assessments with the exception of 
the post -dose assessments described below. IP will be administered in a “slow bolus”

After a patient signs the consent at Screening (Visit 1), study  personnel will register the 
patient in the interactive web response sy stem (IWRS )which will assign the patient a 
sequential PID number. 
All rollover patients will be identified using the same PI D that was assigned by  [CONTACT_347750] -in study . 
 
 
 
 
The IP will be labeled with medication kit num bers.  The I WRS will provide the study  
center with the specific medication kit number(s) for each randomized patient at the time 
of randomization.  S tudy centers will dispense IP according to the IWRS instructions. 
Study  centers will also log onto the IWRS at subsequent visits to obtain a study  
medication kit number for dispensing IP .  Study  centers will receive the IWRS 
confirmation notifications for each transaction.  All notifications are to be maintained 
with the study  source doc uments.
9.4.6 Selection of Dosages in the Study
A rapastinel dose of 450 mg was chosen for this study  was based on results from 2 Phase 
2 studies of patients with MDD in which single IV doses of rapastinel 5 mg/kg and 
10mg/kg demonstrated marked antidepressant effects within [ADDRESS_432140] of weekl y and once -every -2-weeks
administration after initial stabilization, and found no differences, the comparison was 
only carried out for 6 weeks in that study .Assessing a less frequent dosing regimen over 
this more substantial time period of 26 weeks to 2 y ears is expected to y ielda better 
understanding of the long- term efficacy  and safety  characteristics of rapastinel treatment 
and allow proper guidance to phy sicians regarding treatment bey ond initial stabilization.

training and experience in the diagnosis of mental illness and who meets the training 
requirements and qualifications standards set b y the Sponsor and rater training vendor.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 The Montgomery -ÅsbergDepression Rating Scale
The MADRS ( Montgomery  and Åsberg, 1979 ) is a clinician -rated scale. The MADRS 
will be used to assess depressive s ymptomatology during the past week . Patients are rated 
on [ADDRESS_432148]. Each item will be 
scored on a 7 -point scale. A score of 0 indicates the absence of s ymptoms, and a score of 
6 indicates sy mptoms of maximum severity . This instrument will be administered by  [CONTACT_347754]-training vendor.    
At each visit with a MADRS assessment, the rater- administered MADRS interview will 
be audio recorded; a computer- administered MADRS interview will also be c ompleted 
by [CONTACT_1962]. The computer -administered interview will involve a series of probe and 
follow -up questions with multiple -choice response options. At the screening visit of the 
OLTP,for de novo patients only,the computer administered MADRS will be conducted 
prior to the rater -administered MADRS. At all other visits, the rater- administered 
MADRS will be conducted first.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 The Clinical Global Impressions -Severity 
The CGI -S (Guy, 1976 ) is a clinician -rated scale used to rate the severit y of the patient’s 
current state of mental illness compared with a patient population with MDD. The patient 
will be rated on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 indicating a “normal , not at all ill ” and 7
indicating “among the most extremely  ill patients.” The CGI -S will be administered by

causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A).
For the purpose of the study  center’s data collection responsibilities, any  untoward event 
that was reported from the time the I CF was signed until [ADDRESS_432150] known dose of IP (if the final visit does not occur) is to be 
considered an AE.
Examples of AEs are as follows:
Changes in the general condition of the patient
Subjective sy mptoms offered by  [CONTACT_44742]
Objective signs observed by  [CONTACT_153894]
All diseases that occur after signing inform edconsent, including an y change in 
severit y or frequency of pre -existing disease
All clinically  relevant abnormalities in laboratory  values or clinicall y relevant 
physical findings that occur during the study  schedule
Please note medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the 
study  should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history  if related 
to a pre -existing condition.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_432151] be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the 
patient’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed by [CONTACT_134868]:
Is there a reasonable possibility  the IPcaused the event?
Yes:There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IPand AE,ie,

No:There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IPand AE, 
ie:
There is no reasonable temporal relationship between the IPand 
the event, or
The patient did not take the IP, or
The event is likel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent 
disease or other factors, or
The event is commonl y occurring in the (stud y) population 
independent of IPexposure
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Severity Assessment
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severit y of each AE b y recording a 
severit y rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Severity,
which is a description of the intensity  of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from 
seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE -required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionalit y (Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). Severit y will be 
assessed according to the following scale:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually  transient and may  require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  
interfere with usual activities of daily  living.
Moderate: A type of AEthat is usually  alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, 
causing discomfort , but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to 
the research particip ant.
Severe: A type of AEthat interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_432152] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death

Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity , or
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Important medical events that may  not re sult in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44719], based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may  jeopardize the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of IPdependency or drug abuse.
Emergency  room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44720].
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ( eg, elective procedures for pre -existing condition s that did 
not worsen, such as cosmetic surgery  and hy sterectomy ) are excluded from SAE 
reporting.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_432153] occurred 
since the previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading 
question such as, “How do y ou feel since your last visit?” Study  center personnel will 
record all pertinent information in the patient’s eCRF. 
All AEs must be recorded on the approp riate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF 
whether or not they  are considered causally  related to the IP.
For every  AE, the Investigator must:
Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event ( ie, is it an SAE?), as well as 
the severit y and casual relationship
Document all actions taken with regard to the IP
Detail an y other treatment measures taken for the AE
Document the outcome of the AE

Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov 2018In addition, patients are to be reminded, as described in the I CF and in accordance with 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , to notify  study  center personnel of any  AEs occurring durin g the [ADDRESS_432154]-study  period. Any AEs reported by [CONTACT_102] (or patient representative) dur ing this 
period are to be recorded in original source documents. They  are also to be recorded in 
the eCRF if at least oneof the following conditions are met: 1) those that meet the criteria 
for an SAE (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS].3 and [IP_ADDRESS].4 ), and/or 2) those judged b y the 
Investigator to be potentially  causall y related to IP.
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol -defined stud y visit will be 
followed until the condition returns to prestud y status, has resolved or stabilized, or can 
be explained as being unrelated to the IP. If a follow -up visit is deemed necessary  for 
appropriate safet y surveillance, it will take place within 30 days of the final protocol -
defined stud y visit .
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Events of 
Special Interest
The Sponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory  authorities of SAEs that meet 
specific criteria. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately  regarding an y SAE 
that occurs after informed consent is obtained.
Within [ADDRESS_432155] be 
recorded on the appropriate pages of the patient’s eCRF. All SAEs are to be followed b y

[ADDRESS_432156] report the event to Global Drug Safet y on the Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy  Form and fax it to the SAE/ pregnancy  fax number stated in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of male 
patient s occurring during the time frame described above must also be reported. 
Any pregnancy  of a patient treated with IP (or in female partners of male patients 
occurring during the time frame described above) must be followed to term and the 
outcome reported by [CONTACT_12550] a follow -up Clinical Trial Pregnancy  Form. If the 
pregnancy  is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), a

RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov [ZIP_CODE].6 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
9.6.1 Data Monitoring
Before an y patient enters the study , a representative of the Sponsor will meet with the 
Investigator and the study  center staff to review the procedures to be followed during the 
study . Electronic data capture (EDC) functionality  training is provided via 
computer- based training to train investigators and authorized designees on recording the 
data in the eCRFs using the EDC sy stem. After the first patient is enrolled, the Sponsor
representative, a Regional Site Manager or designee , will periodicall y monitor the 
progress of the stud y by [CONTACT_143505] -site visits. This Regional Site Manager or 
designee will review query  statuses remotel y, possibly  warranting more frequent 
communication and/or study  center visits with the Investigator and the study  center staff.
The Investigator will make available to the Regional Site Manager or designee source 
documents (written notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, 
and all other stud y-related documents. The Investigator and the study  center staff will be 
responsible for data entry of patient data into the eCRFs via the EDC sy stem, resolving 
data queries generated via the EDC s ystem and providing missing or corrected data. The 
Investigator or designee will be responsible for approving all changes performed on the 
data, and endorsing the patient data within the EDC sy stem. This approval method will 
include appl ying an electronic signature [CONTACT_153914] a uniquely  assigned username [CONTACT_242320] a traditional handwritten signa ture used in the past.
9.6.[ADDRESS_432157] access. Patient’s data are to be entered into the EDC system b y the 
Investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account. After data entry  into the 
EDC sy stem by  [CONTACT_18370], a combination of manual and programmatic 
edit checks will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to 
study  protocol. As a resul t of these edit checks, data monitoring ,and reviews, queries 
may be electronicall y issued to the study  center and should be answered electronicall y via 
the EDC sy stem.
Each query  will carry  identify ing information (assigned username, date, and time) to 
assist the Sponsor and the Investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and 
the response provided b y the Investigator. All data changes made to the patient’s data via 
a data query  will be approved by  [CONTACT_941] I
nvestigator prior to final database lock.
After all data have been reviewed and all issues have been resolved, the database will be 
locked.
[ADDRESS_432158]  as to guarantee patient confidentiality  in accordance with the 
legal stipulations apply ing to confidentiality  of data. Study  records ( eg, copi[INVESTIGATOR_1495], 
laboratory  reports, andregulatory  documents) w ill be retained at the study  center , along 
with adequate source documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All study  
records must be available for inspection b y the Sponsor, its authorized representatives, 
the FDA, or other health authorities.
 
  may  be captured 
using an electronic source tablet -based sy stem. Source documents will be used at the 
study  centersand may  include a patient’s medical record, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, 
the Investigator’s patient study  files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as 
laboratory  tests, ECGs, etc. A centralized clinical laboratory  will be used for the anal ysis 
of all blood samples. Additional information on the collection and handling of samples is 
detailed in the Lab Procedure Manual.
9.7 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
9.7.1 Analysis Populations
The following anal ysis populations will be considered in the statistical analysis of the 
study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Open-label Safety Population
The Open -label Safet y Population will consist of all patients who signed the ICF if they 
participated in the lead -in studies, and all de novo patients who signed the ICF and 
underwent OLTP Screening Visit procedures and receive at least 1 dose of open -label 
rapastinel during the OLTP of the study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Open-label Intent -to-Treat Population
The Open -label Intent -to-Treat (Open- label ITT) Population will consist of all patients in 
the Open -label Safet y Population who ha veat least [ADDRESS_432159] 1 dose of IP during the DBTP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Double-BlindModifiedIntent-to-Treat Population
The Double -blind modified Intent -to-Treat (Double -blind mITT) Population will consist 
of all patients in the Double -blind Safet y Populati on.
9.7.2 PatientDisposition
The number of patients in the Open -label Safet y, and Open -label ITT Population s will be 
summarized overall by  [CONTACT_313367]. The number of patients in the Double -blind Safety  
and Double -blind mITT Populations will be summarized overall, by  [CONTACT_347757].
For de novo enrolled patients, screen failures (ie, patients who were screened but not 
included in the Open -label Safet y Population) and the associated reasons for failure will 
be tabulated overall.
The number and percentage of patients who entered the OLTP , who prematurely  
discontinued from the OLTP , who completed the OLTP, who met or did not meet the 
criteria to enter the DBTP at the end of the OLTP , and who entered the DBTP will be 
summarized overall and by  [CONTACT_347758] -label 
Safety  Population. Similarly , the number and percentage of patients who completed the 
DBTP and who prematurely  discontinued from the DBTP will be summarized overall, by

RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov [ZIP_CODE].7.4 Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of Exposure
Exposure to open- label rapastinel for the Open -label Safet y Population during the OLTP
will be summarized for treatment duration, calculated as the number of days from the 
date of the first dose of open-label rapastinel taken to the date of the last dose t aken 
during the OLTP , inclusive. Descriptive statistics (n umber of patients ,mean, SD, 
minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented.
Exposure to double -blind IPfor the Double -blind Safety  Population during the DBTP 
will be summarized for treatment dura tion, calculated as the number of days from the 
date of the first dose of double -blind IPtaken to the date of the last dose taken during the 
DBTP , inclusive. Descriptive statistics (n umber of patients , mean, SD , minimum, 
median, and maximum) will be prese nted b y treatment group.
Prior medication isdefined as an y medication started before the date of first dose of 
open -label IP. Concomitant medication during the OLTP isdefined as an y medication 
taken on or after the date of the first dose of open- label IPduring the OLTP . Concomitant 
medication during the DBTP will be defined as any  medication taken on or after the date 
of the first dose of double- blind IP.
The use of prior medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_347760] -label Safety  
Population. The use of concomitant medications during the OLTP will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_347761]- label Safety  Population. The use of concomitant medications during 
the DBTP will be summarized by [CONTACT_347762] -blind 
Safety  Population. Multiple use of the same medication by  a patient will only  be counted 
once.
The number and percentage of patients taking each qualify ing ADT in the OLTP wi ll be 
summarized for the Open -label ITT Population; t he number and percentage of patients 
taking each qualify ing ADT in the DBTP will be summarized by  [CONTACT_65752] -blind treatment 
group for the Double- Blind mITTPopulation. Mean daily  dose and duration of previous 
treatment with each qualify ing ADT will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(number of patients, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) for the OLTPand b y 
double -blind treatment group for the DBTP for the respective ITT or mITT populations.
[ADDRESS_432160] dose of open -label I P will be used as baseline. All statistical 
tests will be 2 -sided hy pothesis tests performed at the 5% level of significance and all 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be 2 -sided 95% CIs , unless stated otherwise.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Parameter
The primary  efficacy  parameter is the time to first relapse during the first [ADDRESS_432161] 52 weeks of the DBTP . Relapse during the DBTP is defined as meeting 
any of the following criteria:
MADRS total score ≥ 18 at 2 consecutive visits
≥ 2 increase in CGI- S score compared with that obtained at randomization
Risk of suicide as d etermined by  [CONTACT_737]

Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov 2018Need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347745] b y the 
Investigator
Need for alternative treatment of depressive s ymptoms as determined by  [CONTACT_347763] [ADDRESS_432162] ratio and 95% 
CIwill be based on the Cox proportional hazards model with treatment group as an 
explanatory  variable. The cumulative distribution function of time to rela pse will be 
characterized b y the Kaplan- Meier curves.
Three sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the primary 
analysis results to the possible violation of the noninformative censoring assumption. 
The first sensitivity analysis assumes that patients who discontinued without meeting 
any of the relapse criteria during the DBTP relapsed instead of being censored. The 
second sensitivity analysis will be based on the delta- adjusted method examined by 
[CONTACT_347764]. (2014). The third sen sitivity analysis is an extension of the placebo -based 
pattern mixture model proposed by [CONTACT_145874] ( 2014, 2015). The placebo -based pattern 
mixture model assumes that patients who discontinued from the rapastinel treatment 
groups would have disease progression after discontinuation similar to that of placebo. 
The extended placebo -based pattern mixture model uses a s ensitivity parameter to 
characterize the gradual deviation from the noninformative censoring underlying the 
primary analysis toward the informative censoring underlying the placebo -based 
pattern mixture model.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Parameter
The secondary  efficacy  parameter is the time to first relapse during the entire DBTP, 
defined as the number of day s from the randomization date to the relapse date during the 
entire DBTP. For patients who did not meet the relapse criteria during the DBTP, their 
time to relapse will be censored at the time of completion or discontinuation from the 
study .
The same anal ysis methods for the primary  endpoint will be applied to the secondary  
endpoint.
In order to control the overall Type I error rate for the prim ary and secondary 
hypotheses, the following sequential testing procedure will be implemented in the 
following order:
96
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-04 Protocol Amendment 2 06 Nov [ZIP_CODE])The comparison of time to relapse during the first 52 weeks between rapastinel 
450 mg weekly and placebo
2)The comparison of time to relapse during the entire DBTP between rapastinel 
450 mg weekly and placebo ,
3)The comparison of time to relapse during the first 52 weeks between rapastinel 
450 mg biweekly and placebo
4)The comparison of time to relapse during the entire DBTP between rapastinel 
[ADDRESS_432163] their respective null hypotheses. This testing strategy will control the 
overall Type I error rate at 0.05 significance level.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities .
For rollover patients, an AE (classified b y preferred term) that occurs during the OLTP or 
thereafter will be considered a t reatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it was not 
present before the date of the first dose of IP in the lead -in study  or was present before 
the first dose of IP in the lead -in study  and increased in severit y during the OL TP or 
thereafter. If more than [ADDRESS_432164] severity  will be 
used as the benchmark for comparison with the AEs occurring during the OL TP or 
thereafter that wer e also coded to that preferred term. An AE that becomes serious 
during the OLTP or thereafter will also be considered asa TEAE.
For de novo patients, an AE (classified b y preferred term) that occurs during the OLTPor 
thereafter will be considered a TEAE if it was not present before the date of the first dose 
of open -label IPor was present before the date of the first dose of open -label IPand 
increased in severit y during the OLTPor thereafter. If more than [ADDRESS_432165] dose of IP will not be 
counted as a TEAE .

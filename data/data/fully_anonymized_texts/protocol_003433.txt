Efficacy and Safety of the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors 
BGB -3111 and Ibrutinib in Subjects with Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia (WM)  
Protocol No:  BGB -3111 -302 
Study Centers:   Approximately 82 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US), Australia (AUS), the 
European Union (EU), and others  
Study Phase:  Phase 3  
Treatment Duration:  Subjects will receive daily treatment during the study until progressive 
disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity  or death, withdrawal of consent, 
loss to follow -up, or study termination by [CONTACT_2728].  
Objectives:  
Primary (Cohort 1)  
 To compare the efficacy of zanubrutinib (also known as BGB -3111) vs ibrutinib in subjects with 
activating mutations in the myeloid differ entiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) 
(MYD88MUT) WM  
Secondary (Cohort 1)  
 To further compare the efficacy, clinical benefit, and anti -lymphoma effects of zanubrutinib vs 
ibrutinib in subjects with MYD88MUT WM 
 To evaluate safety and tolerability of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in subjects with MYD88MUT 
WM, as measured by [CONTACT_852129] (NCI) Common Termin ology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.[ADDRESS_1184771] 2019  
 
                          
Page 4 Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open -label, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of the 
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in subjects with Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia (WM) who require therapy according t o the consensus panel criteria from the Seventh 
International Workshop on Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (Seventh IWWM, Dimopoulos et al 2014 ). 
The study is composed of an initial Screening Phase (up to 35 days), a  Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up 
Phase.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1184772] 
baseline bone marrow samples (bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]) collected and assayed at a central 
laboratory fo r sequencing of the MYD88  gene. Approximately one hundred eighty -eight WM subjects 
(Approximately 150  relapsed/refractory and approximately 38  treatment -naïve  subjects) with the MYD88  
mutation ( MYD88MUT), which is characteristic of WM and present in approx imately 90% of cases, will be 
enrolled onto Cohort 1 and randomized to one of two treatment arms (Cohort 1: zanubrutinib treatment 
[Arm A] or ibrutinib treatment [Arm B]) in a 1:1 ratio and stratified using CXC -chemokine receptor 4 
(CXCR4 ) gene sequencing status ( CXCR4WHIM vs CXCR4WT vs missing ) and prior line of therapy for WM 
(0 vs 1 -3 vs >3 lines of therapy).  
Subjects found to have MYD88 wild-type ( MYD88WT) by [CONTACT_657260], which is estimated to be 
present in approximately 10% of enrolled subjects, will be enrolled to Cohort [ADDRESS_1184773], non -randomized, study arm (Arm C).  In addition, those subjects whose 
MYD88 mutational status is missing or inconclusive will be assigned to Cohort 2, Arm C.  Approximately 
22 total subjects (including relapsed/refractory and treatment -naïve subjects) are anticipated to be enrolled 
in this cohort.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_1184774] relapsed/refractory 
subject is randomized.   
 Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_79029] (IRC) according to an adaptation 
of the response criteria updated at the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia (Sixth IWWM, Owen et al 2013  and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network [NCCN] Guidelines, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia 2015: v2 ). Response assessments will occur at the beginning of every cycle 
(i.e., every 4 we eks starting from C2D1) for the first 48 weeks and then every 3 cycles thereafter 
until PD.  
 Serum IgM and M -protein levels will be measured at Screening, on Day [ADDRESS_1184775] 48 weeks, then every 3 cycles thereafter (each cycle is 28 days) . 
 For subjects with evidence of extramedullary disease (defined as lymphadenopathy [lymph nodes 
having a long axis of > 1.5 cm] and/or splenomegaly) detected by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) 
scan at baseline:  
o Response assessment by [CONTACT_456221] [ADDRESS_1184776] 
48 weeks of the study and within 24 wee ks of the response assessment date thereafter.  
 QOL will be measured every [ADDRESS_1184777] 48 weeks, and then every 24 weeks 
thereafter by [CONTACT_20368] -C30 and EQ -5D in  MYD88MUT WM subjects.  
 Bone marrow involvement by [CONTACT_852130], at the end 
of Cycle 12 (Week 48), at time of suspected complete response (CR), and as clinically indicated.  
 All subjects will be followed for adverse events (AEs) until [ADDRESS_1184778] dose of study 
drug. All treatment -related AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. Efficacy evaluations will continue until documented PD for subjects who 
discontinued for reasons other than PD.  
Planned Number of Subjects:  Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled. This includes 
approximately 188  subjects (approximately 150  subjects with 
relapsed/refractory WM and approximately 38  subjects with treatment -
naïve WM) with MYD88MUT enrolled in Cohort 1 and randomized 1:1 to 
either Arm A or Arm B, and approximately 22 total subjects (both 
relapsed/refractory and treatment -naïve) who are MYD88  wild-type

Study Drug:  Zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2 capsules) twice daily (BID), 
administered orally (PO)  
Comparator:  Ibrutinib 420 mg (140 mg x 3 capsules  or in other applicable dose 
forms ) once daily (QD), administered PO  
Study Treatment:  
Subjects will be divided into two cohorts according to MYD88  sequencing at Screening.   
Subjects in Cohort 1 (subjects with MYD88 MUT by [CONTACT_657260]) will be randomized 1:1 to receive:  
Arm A  
Zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2  capsules ) administered PO BID at approximately the same time 
each day with at least 8 hours’ interval. A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.  
Arm B  
Ibrutinib 420 mg (140 mg x 3  capsules  or in other applicable dose forms ) administered PO QD at 
approximately the same time each day. A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.  
Dose Modifications:  
The guidelines set forth in the table below should be followed for dose interruption or modification of 
zanubrutinib or ibrutinib for hematologic or non -hematologic toxicities noted on investigator assessment 
of study drug relatedness.   
Study drug (zanubr utinib or ibrutinib) may be held for a maximum of 2 consecutive cycles and restarted 
upon resolution of toxicity and per investigator discretion.  If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is in the 
subject’s best interest to restart study drug after dose has been held for more than [ADDRESS_1184790] 2019

BID=twice daily; QD=once daily  
Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity for Zanubrutinib  
For zanubrutinib, dosing will be held for hematologic toxicity suspected to be related to study drug 
treatment under any of the following conditions:  
 Grade 4 neutropenia (lasting >10 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_193575])  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (lastin g > 10 days)  
 ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  
 ≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_1184792] occurrence of hematologic toxicity, treatment may restart at full dose upon recovery of the 
toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. If the same event reoccurs, subjects will restart at one dose level lower 
upon recovery of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed.  
Dose Modifications for Non -Hematologic Toxicity for Zanubrutinib  
For non -hematological toxicities ≥ Grade 3, other than hypertension that is adequately controlled with oral 
medication  or asymp tomatic laboratory events (laboratory events indicating liver or renal dysfunction will 
not be considered asymptomatic laboratory events) suspected to be related to study drug treatment, study 
drug will be held until recovery to ≤  Grade 1 or baseline, and then restarted at the original dose level. If the 
event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1or baseline and restarted at Dose 
Level -1.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1or baselin e and 
restarted at Dose Level -2.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1184793] will be 
discontinued from study treatment. For subjects experiencing atrial fibrillation that is symptomatic and/or 
incompletely controlled: after atrial fibr illation is adequately controlled the study drug may be restarted at 
either the original dose or Dose Level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator.   
Zanubrutinib should be held for any ≥ Grade 3 bleeding.  The drug should be permanently discontinu ed for 
any related ≥ Grade 3 hemorrhage with the exception of those where the underlying condition can be fully 
treated (e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in gastrointestinal [GI] bleed) and the risk of a re -bleed is deemed 
acceptable.  For any intracranial hemo rrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship to the study drug , the 
study drug should be held and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed. If the risk of rebleeding is deemed 
unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of cases, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed  unless event resolution has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_852133], the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, and the patient does not have a need for concurrent 
anti-coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_852096] -[ADDRESS_1184794] 2019  
 
                          
Page 10 used to prevent venous thromboembolism) .  Study drug resumption can only occur after a discussion and 
approval by [CONTACT_138830].  
Dose Modifications for Ibrutinib  
For dose modification of ibrutinib, local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of 
Product Characteristics) should be followed throughout the study.  The major dose modifications for 
ibrutinib are described below:   
Ibrutinib should be interrupted for any new onset or worsening of ≥  Grade  3 non -hematologic toxic ities, 
≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1184795] resolved to Grade 1 or baseline, ibrutinib therapy may be re -initiated at the starting dose.  
If the toxicity recurs, drug dose  will be reduced to Dose Level -1 (280 mg orally QD).  A second dose 
reduction to Dose Level -2 (140 mg orally QD) may be considered as needed.  If these toxicities persist or 
recur following [ADDRESS_1184796] will be discontinued for study tr eatment.   
As with zanubrutinib, ibrutinib should be interrupted for any Grade ≥ 3 bleeding.  The drug should be 
permanently discontinued for any related Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage with the exception of those where the 
underlying condition can be fully treated ( e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in GI bleed) and the risk of a re -bleed 
is deemed acceptable.  For any intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship to the study 
drug, the study drug should be held and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed. If the risk of rebleeding 
is deemed unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of cases, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed unless event resolution has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_852133], the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, and the patient does not have a need for concurrent 
anti-coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_852097]) .  Study drug resumption can only oc cur after a discussion and 
approval by [CONTACT_138830].  
Use of ibrutinib in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet 
function may increase the risk of bleeding, and particular care should be taken if ant icoagulant therapy is 
used.  
Concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.  If the 
benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, ibrutinib dose must be reduced or 
withheld temporarily (7 days or less).  Ibrutinib do se must be reduced when administered with moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors.  Refer to the local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of 
Product Characteristics) for specific instructions on dose modifications with these inhibitors.  
For pati ents with mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A) and patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Class B), refer to the local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or 
Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific instructions o n dose modifications for ibrutinib. It is not 
recommended to administer ibrutinib to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class C).  
Concomitant Therapy and Clinical Practice:  
Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks or less) are permitted, if used to treat a concomitant 
(non-cancer) medical condition.  
Bisphosphonates can be coadministered with zanubrutinib.  
Infection prophylaxis should be as per institutional standa rds. 
Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Any anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, corticosteroids given with antineoplastic intent, 

 
Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184797] 2019  
 
                          
Page 11 experimental therapy, and radiotherapy are prohibited.  Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks 
or less) are permi tted, if used to treat a concomitant (non -cancer) medical condition. The chronic use of 
corticosteroids at doses equivalent to adrenal replacement (2.5 mg to 7.5 mg prednisone) is prohibited 
without previous discussion and approval from the Medical Monitor  or designee.  
Use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
Supplements such as fish oil or supplements and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.   
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wo rt should be avoided.  
Concomitant Use of CYP Inhibiting /Inducing  Drugs  
The primary metabolic pathway for both zanubrutinib and ibrutinib involve the cytochrome P450, family 
3, subfamily A  (CYP3A) isoform.  Administration of zanubrutinib with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
or CYP3A inducers (refer to  Appendix [ADDRESS_1184798] of these medications) and grapefruit juice 
and Seville oranges should be used with caution as they may affect the metabolis m of zanubrutinib / 
ibrutinib .  If at all possible, patients are encouraged not to use strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers and consider using alternative agents. If these agents will be used, follow the dose modification 
guidelines for zanubrutini b in Table 2  and refer to the ibrutinib  local prescribing information .  The medical 
monitor should be consulted in these situations.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Response will be evaluated using an IRC based on an adaptation of the response criteria updated a t the 
Sixth IWWM ( Owen et al. 2013  and NCCN Guidelines, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia 2015:v2 ). The modified criteria are listed in Appendix [ADDRESS_1184799] of medical interviews, recording of AEs, 
physical examinations, and laboratory measurements (i.e., complete blood count, chemistry, and 
urinalysis).  
Subjects  will be evaluated for AEs (all grades, according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 [ NCI-CTCAE v4.03 ]) and SAEs. Subjects who, at 
time of progression, have an ongoin g AE that leads to treatment discontinuation will be followed until the 
event resolves, the investigator assesses the event as stable, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject 
starts a different antitumor therapy.  
An independent data monitoring com mittee (DMC) will monitor safety and efficacy data periodically 
throughout the study. One interim analysis is planned, and will occur approximately [ADDRESS_1184800] 50 relapsed/refractory subjects in Cohort 1 are randomized to Arms A or B. This ana lysis is for 
futility only. A stop in recruitment is not planned for this interim analysis.  At regular safety reviews, data 
review will include but not be limited to deaths, SAEs, adverse events leading to dose reduction, dose 
interruption, or drug discon tinuation. The DMC may recommend study modification, including 
termination of the study due to efficacy and safety concerns.  Details of safety data review will be outlined 
in DMC charter.

Page 13 Statistical Methods:  
All inferential statistics described in this Section refer to the efficacy comparisons of Arms A and B in 
Cohort 1, which represent the primary/secondary objectives of the study. Separate descriptive statistics in 
Cohort 2 will be used to report the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in Arm C.  
Analysis Sets : 
The Intent to Treat analysis set (ITT) includes all enrolled subjects who are assigned to a treatment arm. 
The Relapsed/Refractory  analysis set  (a subset of the ITT analysis set ) includes all randomized subjects 
with at least 1 prior line of therapy as determined by [CONTACT_852136]. The 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set for Cohort  1 will be the primary analysis set  used for efficacy analyses.  
The Safety analysis set  includes all subjects who received any dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. Subjects 
will be assigned to the treatment arms as treated. The S afety analysis set  will be used for all safety 
analyses.  
The Per -Protocol analysis set (PP) includes subjects who re ceived any dose of study medication and had 
no major protocol deviations. Criteria for exclusion from the PP analysis set will be determined and 
documented before the database lock for the primary analysis. The PP analysis set will be the secondary 
analysi s set for efficacy analyses.   
The PK analysis set  includes all subjects who have at least one post -dose zanubrutinib concentration.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary endpoint of CR/VGPR rate will be assessed by [CONTACT_26708], based upon the best overall re sponse  
(BOR) , defined as the best response recorded from the cohort assignment date until data cut or start of new 
antineoplastic treatment, and will be analyzed in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set and ITT analysis set 
of Cohort 1.  
Comparison of the pr imary endpoint between Arm A and Arm B in Cohort 1 will be tested using 
hierarchical fixed -sequence procedure under the null and alternative hypotheses as follows:  
H0: RR A=RR B 
Ha: RR A> RR B 
where RR A is the CR/VGPR rate in relapsed/refractory subjects in Ar m A (zanubrutinib) and RR B is the 
CR/VGPR rate in relapsed/refractory subjects in Arm B (ibrutinib).  
Testing for above hypotheses will be performed in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set first at 1 -sided 
alpha of 0.025. If the result is in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set is statistically significant, the 
primary objective has been met and further testing will be performed in the ITT analysis set at 1-sided 
alpha of 0.025.  
A Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test of rate difference adjusting for stratification factors (CXCR4

Page 14 status [WHIM vs WT/missing] and prior line of therapy [1 -3 vs >3 for Relapsed/Refractory analysis set 
analysis and 0 vs 1 -2 vs >3 in ITT  analysis set  analysis]) will be  performed for hypothesis testing at the 
level of 0.025 (1 -sided) in corresponding analysis sets .  
A CMH 95% stratified confidence interval (CI) of rate difference (RR A-RR B) with each rate weighted by 
[CONTACT_852137]. A Clopper -Pearson 
95% CI of CR/VGPR rate within each arm will be constructed.  
The primary efficacy analysis in Cohort [ADDRESS_1184804] relapsed/refractory sub ject.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
If the primary efficacy analysis is significant in Cohort 1, secondary endpoints will be tested in the 
analysis set where the null hypothesis for primary efficacy endpoint is rejected.  
MRR will be tested for non-inferiority (NI) (Arm A vs Arm B). The null and alternative hypotheses of 
MRR are set as follows:  
H0: MRR A-MRR B≤-8% 
Ha: MRR A- MRR B>-8% 
where MRR A is the major response rate in Arm A (zanubrutinib) and MRR B is the major response rate in 
Arm B (ibrutinib ).  
MRR assessed by [CONTACT_852138] A and B.  It will be analyzed using the same 
methods as described for the primary endpoint, based upon the best overall response, defined as the best 
response recorded from the date of cohort assignment  until data cut or start of new antineoplastic 
treatment.  Subjects with no post -baseline response assessment (regardless of reason) will be considered 
non-responders for best overall response.   
A CMH test of rate difference adjusting for stratification f actors ( CXCR4  status [WHIM vs WT/missing] 
and prior line of therapy [1 -3 vs >3 for Relapsed/Refractory analysis set and 0 vs 1 -2 vs >3 in ITT analysis  
set]) will be performed for hypothesis testing.  Non -inferiority will be concluded when the one -sided p -
value is less than or equal to 0.025, or equivalently, when the 2 -sided 95% CI for the weighted rate 
difference (weighted by [CONTACT_852139]) excludes -8%. 
Furthermore, superiority can be claimed if the lower  limit excludes 0.    
Justification of non -inferiority margin  
Since no randomized trial has been conducted in WM, the ibrutinib treatment benefit over placebo can 
only be estimated from the single -arm ibrutinib Phase 2 trial in which the MRR is 0.73 with 95% CI (0.60, 
0.83). As a ≥ 50% reduction of IgM is impossible without treatment, MRR can be considered 0% in the 
placebo treated subject. Therefore, the lower bound of 95% CI (i.e., 60%) can be used as the treatment 
effect of ibrutinib over placebo (M1). A NI margin of 8% (M2) is proposed assuming 86.7% of the 
ibrutinib benefit over a placebo is retained. With close to 90% of the ibrutinib effect preserved, the 8% NI 
margin in MRR is clinically justified.  The loss of the ibrutinib treatment benefit is well  within the 
clinically acceptable range.   It is worth noting that the NI of MRR will only be performed after the 
superiority of zanubrutinib over ibrutinib in CR/VGPR rate, which is closely correlated with MRR, has 
been demonstrated. Hence, a numerically h igher MRR in zanubrutinib is certainly expected if the NI test 
of MRR is to be performed. The inclusion of the NI test of MRR is mainly based on the sample size 
consideration in a rare disease setting where statistical significance might not be shown in a superiority test 
with a clinically meaningful MRR difference (e.g., 12% higher MRR in zanubrutinib over ibrutinib) in 150 
randomized relapsed/refractory subjects.

VGPR, PR, Minor Response, stable disease [SD], and PD) by [CONTACT_852140].  
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) method. PFS censoring 
rule will follow FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs 
and Biologics (2007) . 
A stratified log -rank test with CXCR4  mutational status and number of prior lines of therapy as strata will 
be used to test the PFS differences between Arms A and B. The Cox regression will be used to estimate 
the hazard ratio (HR) of PFS A vs PFS B. A 95% CI of HR in PFS will be constructed.   
Median PFS, if estimable, will be estimated using the KM method. Its 2 -sided 95% CI, if estimable, will 
be constructed with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.  KM estimates of PFS will be plotted 
over time.  The PFS at 12 and 18 months, defined a s the percentages of subjects in the analysis set who 
remain alive and progression -free at the specified time points, will be estimated using KM method along 
with the corresponding 95% CI constructed using Greenwood’s formula.  
The duration of CR/VGPR/PR w ithin subjects who have achieved a major response will be analyzed 
similarly as PFS.  
Indications for initiation of therapy (see Table 4) will be documented for all sub jects at baseline visit.  
Symptoms that triggered treatment will be followed at, during, and end of treatment visits until resolution. 
Percentages of subjects with resolution of each and all baseline symptom(s) will be summarized; and 
compared between Arms  A and B using Fisher’s Exact test.  
Maximum decrease in percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes by [CONTACT_852141] (A vs. B) as group variable. Percentage of 
subjects with decreased percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes after the start of study medication 
will also be compared using Fisher’s Exact test. Percentages of subjects with resolution and/or reduction of 
pretreatment lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly accordi ng to CT scan will be summarized separately; 
and compared using Fisher’s Exact test.

Page 16 Safety Analysis:  
Safety analysis will be  performed by [CONTACT_2939], as well as by [CONTACT_852142] A and C.  
Drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939], including duration, dosage, and dose intensity.   
Verbatim description of AEs will be mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Acti vities 
(MedDRA®) terms and graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 . All treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
will be summarized.  A TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date on or after the first dose of study 
drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation or was worsening in severity from baseline 
(pretreatment) or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes  first.  SAEs, deaths, TEAEs with 
Grade 3 or above, related TEAEs and TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or dose 
interruption will be summarized.  
Multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted once at the maximum severity w ithin a system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Clinical laboratory data with values outside of the normal ranges will be identified.  Select laboratory data 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_479]. Vital signs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_765].  
Correlation between trough plasma zanubrutinib concentration and safety endpoints may be explored.  
Sample Size:  
The sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the primary endpoint CR/VGPR rate in 
relapsed/refractory subjects in Cohort  1. Assuming RR A=0.35 and RR B=0.15, seventy -five subjects per 
arm (approximately 150 total) provide a power of 0.814 in testing RR A versus RR B in the 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort [ADDRESS_1184807] with a two -
sided significance of 0.05 . Assuming MRR A=0.90 and MRR B=0.80, the power of demonstrating NI of 
zanubrutinib in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set is 85.5% when a NI margin of 0.08 is used.  
In addition to 150 replased/refractory subjects, approximately 20% (38) treatment -naïve su bjects with 
MYD88MUT will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  
Assuming MYD88MUT  mutation is present in 90% of the enrolled subjects, approximately a total of

Page 27 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Current Status of Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia  
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare B -cell malignancy, characterized by [CONTACT_852144] M secreting lymphoplasmacytic cells.  The 
incidence is 5 -8 cases per millio n, with about 1000 -1500 new patients diagnosed in the [LOCATION_003] 
annually.  Incidence increases with age with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years for Caucasians, 
and slightly lower in other ethnic groups. There is a male to female preponderance, and an incidenc e 
higher in Caucasians than Africans or Asians ( Gertz et al 2000 ; Gertz et al 2015 ).  Activating 
mutations in the MYD88  gene ( MYD88MUT), which trigger downstream interleukin -1-receptor 
associated kinase ( IRAK )-mediated nuclear factor -kappa B ( NF-κB) signaling ( Treon et al 2012 ), 
are seen in approximately 90% of cases.  A second set of mutations with prognostic significance is 
found at CXC -chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4 ), the receptor for stromal -derived factor 1a ( SDF-1a), 
which are either frameshift or nonsense mutations, are similar to those seen in the 
immunodeficiency syndrome WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and 
myelokathexis), and also lead to constitu tive activation. Either or both of these mutations can be 
found in patients and lead to different clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], outcomes, and response to therapy  with best 
response to the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib found in MYD88MUT CXCR4WT(Treon et al 2015 a).  
According to the International Prognostic scoring system for WM (ISSWM), patients are stratified 
into low, intermediate, and high risk groups with respective 5 -year survival rates of 87%, 68%, and 
36%, base d upon age, IgM level, β2 -microglobulin level, hemoglobin, and platelet count. ( Morel et 
al 2009 ). 
About 75% of initially asymptomatic WM patients will require therapy within 15 years of follow -
up, with a median time to initia tion of therapy of over 7 years; a lower hemoglobin ( Hgb), extensive 
bone marrow infiltration, serum M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], and β2 -microglobulin levels are significant predictors of 
an eventual need for therapy ( Gertz et al 2015 ). Indicatio ns for treatment as per the IWWM -7 
consensus meeting are either clinical symptoms or laboratory findings. Clinical indications for 
treatment include any of the following: fever, night sweats, weight loss and fatigue, hyperviscosity 
syndrome, bulky/symptoma tic lymphadenopathy, significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, other 
symptomatic organomegaly, or peripheral neuropathy.  Laboratory indications for therapy include 
symptomatic cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin anemia, immune hemolytic cytopenias, 
nephropa thy, amyloidosis, or significant anemia/thrombocytopenia due to marrow replacement.  
Current treatment strategies include single agent rituximab or rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R -CHOP ) (Jacobson et al 2013 ).  Bendamustine plus 
rituximab has been shown to be an active agent with similar overall response rates to R -CHOP  but 
with enhanced progression -free survival and better tolerability ( Rummel et al 2013 ). Experimental 
agents studied in WM include bortezomib, lenalidomide, everolimus, enzastaurin, and panobinostat.

BGB -[ADDRESS_1184824] 2019  
 
                          
Page 28 Recently, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of patients with WM by [CONTACT_852145] ( EMA) in adults who have received prior treatment 
for their disease, or in previously untreated patients for whom treatment with chemoimmunotherapy 
is not suitable .  
1.2 Ibrutinib  
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a signaling molecule within the B -cell antigen  receptor (BCR) 
and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling through the B -cell surface receptors results 
in activation of pathways necessary for B -cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical 
studies show that ibrutinib inhibits mali gnant B -cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell 
migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.  
Ibrutinib is a first -generation small -molecule BTK inhibitor that forms a covalent bond to cysteine 
at position 481 in the BTK active site, leading t o inhibition of BTK phosphorylation at Tyr223 and 
thus inhibiting enzymatic activity.  
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions  
Ibrutinib is absorbed after oral administration with a median time to maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Tmax) of 1 to 2 hours. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The 
steady -state area under the plasma concentration time curve  (AUC ) (mean ± standard deviation) 
observed in patients at 560 mg is 953 ± 705 ng ⋅h/mL and in patients at 420 mg is 680 ± 517 
ng⋅h/mL.   Administration with food increased ibrutinib maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and AUC by [CONTACT_3450] 2 - to 4- and 2 -fold, respectively, compared with administration 
of ibrutinib after overnight fasting. The oral clearance is app roximately 2000 and 1000 L/h in fasted 
and fed condition. The half -life of ibrutinib is 4 to 6 hours. The 420 mg dosage was selected to treat 
WM.  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver. In a hepatic impairment trial, a single dose of 140 mg of 
ibrutinib wa s administered in non -cancer subjects, ibrutinib C max increased 5.2 -, 8.8- and 7.0 -fold, 
respectively, in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment relative to subjects with 
normal liver function. Thus , subjects with moderate and severe li ver impairment should avoid using 
ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib is not significantly cleared renally, the exposure of ibrutinib is not altered in 
patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) >25  mL/min.  Ibrutinib can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman ; it must not be taken during pregnancy and  pregnancy should be 
avoided  for 1 month after cessation of therapy.   
Ibrutinib is metabolized to several metabolites primarily by [CONTACT_9058] P450  (CYP) , CYP3A, and 
to a minor extent by [CONTACT_097]2D6. Refer to upda ted Imbruvica® (Ibrutinib) Prescribing Information,

Page 29 1.3 Zanubrutinib (BGB -3111)  
Zanubrutinib (also known as BGB -3111 ) is a novel second -generation small -molecule oral BTK 
inhibitor,  which forms an irreversible covalent bond at Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) binding pocket of the BTK protein.  Zanubrutinib is highly potent against BTK; however, as 
opposed to ibrutinib, zanubrutinib has significantly less epi[INVESTIGATOR_852101] 
(EGFR)/Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)/tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(TEC)/interleukin -2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) inhibitory activity.  
1.3.1 Non-Clinical Data  
Zanubrutinib inhibits BTK with a 50% maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 0.3 nanomolar 
(nM) in biochemical assays.  Cellular assays confirmed that zanubrutinib inhibited  BCR  
aggregation -triggered BTK autophosphorylation, and blocked downstream phospholipase C -beta-2 
(PLCβ2) signaling in mantle cell lymph oma ( MCL ) cell lines. Zanubrutinib potently and selectively 
inhibited cellular growth of several MCL cell lines (REC -1, Mino, and JeKo -1) and activated B -cell 
(ABC) type of diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell line transmembrane domain 8 
(TMD -8), wit h IC 50s from 0.[ADDRESS_1184826] REC -1 
MCL xenografts engrafted either subcutaneously or systemically in m ice.  Zanubrutinib was more 
selective than ibrutinib for inhibition of kinase activity of BTK vs. EGFR, Garden -Rasheed feline 
sarcoma viral (v -fgr) oncogene homolog (FGR), fyn -related kinase (FRK), human epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] (HER)2, HER4, ITK, JAK3, lymphocyte -specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), and 
TEC.  Cellular assays also confirmed that zanubrutinib is significantly less active than ibrutinib in 
inhibiting ITK (10 -fold) and EGFR (> 6 -fold). Inhibition of ITK has been reported to reduce 
rituximab -induced antigen -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  Zanubrutinib was shown 
to be at least 10 -fold weaker than ibrutinib in inhibiting rituximab -induced ADCC, consistent with 
zanubrutinib being a more selective BTK inhibitor, with much we aker ITK inhibition activity than 
ibrutinib in both biochemical and cellular assays, thus preventing the potential for antagonism with 
rituximab that has been seen preclinically with other BTK inhibitors. Refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB)  for more detailed information o n zanubrutinib.  
1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions  
In the Phase 1 study, PK was linear between 40 mg and 320 mg daily.  The absorption of 
zanubrutinib is rapid with median time to maximum plasma  concentration  (Cmax) of [ADDRESS_1184827], and was increased by 30 -60% with standard breakfast when compared to 
fasting. The magnitude of incr ease in exposure with food was well within doubling of exposure 
associated with [ADDRESS_1184828] 2019  
 
                          
Page 30 additional safety findings. The terminal elimination half -life is approximately 4 hours at 320 mg 
daily. 
Full occupancy of BTK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was achieved in all subjects in the 
study, while occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed only at 160 mg BID and 320 mg daily.  
At the 160 mg BID dose, full BTK occupancy was observed at trough, suggesting that sustained 
target occupancy could be achieved in disease -originating tissues, thus more efficiently inhibiting 
BTK on a continuous basis, further preventi ng breakthrough signaling despi[INVESTIGATOR_852102].  Activity has been observed across indications at all tested dose levels; thus, a minimum 
effective dose cannot be established at this time.  Conversely, there is now extensive experience at 
the 160 mg BID and 320 mg daily dose; both schedules show a high level of activity without 
compromise of the tolerability profile as compared to lower doses of zanubrutinib.   
Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A  (CYP3A) was the major CYP isoform responsib le for 
zanubrutinib metabolism.  Based on in vitro  data, z anubrutinib is a moderate inhibitor for CYP2C8 
(IC 50 = 4.03 µM) .  Zanubrutinib is not a time -dependent CYP inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A.    Zanubrutinib is  not an inducer of human 
CYP1A2  or CYP2B6 but has weak CYP3A induction potential at a concentration equal to or higher 
than 3 µM in primary human hepatocytes.   
1.3.3 Safety Pharmacology  
The potential risk of zanubrutinib on QT interval prolongation was assessed  using a battery of 
preclinical studies. A GLP compliant hERG assay was conducted.  Based on the clinical steady -
state, unbound Cmax of 0.042 μM (total Cmax 346 ng/mL; plasma protein binding 94.2%) observed 
at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 160 mg BID, there is more than a 200 -fold exposure 
margin compared with the hERG IC50 of 9.11 μM.   
No effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, including QT and 
QTc intervals, were noted in telemetry -instrumented conscious dogs following single doses of 
zanubrutinib up to 100 mg/kg.  In addition, no abnormal changes in ECG or cardiovascular function 
were noted in 28 - and 91 -day repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs at doses up to 100 mg/kg.  In 
these studies, the systemic exposure  of zanubrutinib was 10 -fold higher than that observed at the 
human therapeutic dose.   
1.3.4 Clinical Pharmacology  
The QT interval prolongation potential of zanubrutinib was evaluated in healthy subjects in a 
thorough QT study (BGB -3111 -106).  Results from this  study demonstrated that single oral doses of 
zanubrutinib at a therapeutic dose of [ADDRESS_1184829] 2019  
 
                          
Page 31 Because of the s hort half -life and no accumulation seen upon multiple -dosing, these results are also 
applicable for steady -state conditions.  
Results from a dedicated clnical drug-drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -104) indicate that 
coadministration of zanubrutinib with the  strong CYP3A inducer rifampin (600 mg every day for 8 
days) decreased exposure of zanubrutinib by 13.5 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 12.6 -fold for maximum 
observed plasma concentration  (Cmax), in healthy subjects.  Coadministration of zanubrutinib with 
the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg every day for 4 days) increased exposure of 
zanubrutinib by 3.8 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 2.[ADDRESS_1184830] for zanubrutini b. Additionally, 
preliminary simulations from a physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model suggest that 
coadministration of multiple doses of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (eg, diltiazem, erythromycin, 
and fluconazole) may increase the C max and AUC of  zanubrutinib by [CONTACT_3450] 2 -fold.  For 
coadministration with a moderate CYP3A inducer (eg, efavirenz), PBPK simulations suggest that 
the C max and AUC of zanubrutinib may decrease by [CONTACT_3450] 2 - to 3-fold. 
A clinical drug -drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -108) was conducted to assess the effect of 
zanubrutinib on the PK of substrates of CYP3A (midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 
(omeprazole), P -gp (digoxin), and BCRP (rosuvastatin) using a cocktail approach .  The results show 
that zanubrutinib does not significantly affect drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 (warfarin) or 
transported by [CONTACT_69811] (statins).   Zanubrutinib has a mild induction effect on CYP3A and CYP2C19 
enzymes , but not an inhibitor of CYP2C19 .  AUC 0-t and C max values were approximately 47% and 
30% lower, respectively, when midazolam was coadministered with zanubrutinib.   AUC 0-t and C max 
values w ere approximately 36% and 20% lower, respectively, when omeprazole was coadministered 
with zanubrutinib.  Repeat ed dosing of zanubrutinib increased exposure of digoxin (P -gp substrate) 
with a mean increase of 11% for AUC 0-t and 34% for C max.  
Based a validated PBPK model to simulate the effect of zanubrutinib on the pharmacokinetics of 
CYP2B6 sensitive substrate , the potential for  zanubrutinib to induce CYP2B6 is considered low.  
Based on resu lts of two clinical DDI studies above, a validated PBPK model was developed and 
was employed to simulate the effect of zanubrutinib on the pharmacokinetics of sensitive CYP2C8, 
and CYP2B6 substrates.  The simulation findings show that concomitant use of zanubrutinib has a 
minimal or no effect on the exposure of CYP2C8 substrate (eg, rosiglitazone) or CYP2B6 substrate 
(eg, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]).  The predicted AUC ratios of  repaglinide and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (with versus without 
zanubrutinib coadministration) are predicted to be close to 1.

Page 32 1.4 BTK Inhibitors in the Treatment of Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia 
Study Rationale and Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, a member of the TEC family kinases, is a critical component of BCR 
signaling cascade.  Inhibition of BTK has emerged as a promising strat egy for targeting B -cell 
malignancies.  
Ibrutinib, given at a dose of 420  mg PO daily, was evaluated in a 63 -patient single -arm Phase 2 
study. The responses were assessed by [CONTACT_852146] a 
modification of the Sixt h IWWM response criteria. (IWWM,  Owen et al 2013  and NCCN Guidance 
Insights, 2012 ). The MRR (defined as achieving partial response or better at any time over the 
course of study treatment) was 61.9% . No patients achieved a CR. A very good partial response 
(VGPR; a > 90% reduction in IgM) occurred in  11.1% of patients and a partial response (PR; 50 -
89% reduction in IgM) in 50.8%. The median time to response was 1.2  months (range 0.7 -13.4 
months). In this trial, the median reduction in IgM level was from 3520  mg/dl to 880 mg/dl, and 
median improvement in hemoglobin was from 10.5 g/dl to 13.8 g/dl. However, there are limitations 
to ibrutinib in the treatment of WM. By [CONTACT_852147], 27% of subjects failed  to achieve a response, 
and the nadir IgM level exceeded 3000  mg/dl in 10% of responding subjects. Only 25/35 (71%) 
subjects presenting with adenopathy had reduction in adenopathy by [CONTACT_4654], 4/7 (57%) subjects 
presenting with splenomegaly had reduction in spleen size, and the bone marrow response was 
usually incomplete ( median reduction in bone marrow lymphoplasmacytoid cell percentage from 
60% to 25%). In the initial report of this study, 2 of 7 (29%) of subjects with wild -type MYD88  
(MYD88WT) by, were reported to have achieved a major response to ibrutinib; however, a 
subsequent report ( Treon et al 2015 b) noted that activating non -MUT mutations were found in both 
responding patients. Therefore, to date, major responses have not been reported in patients with 
wild-type MYD88  WM. Of adverse e vents  (AEs)  potentially associated with ibrutinib treatment, 
Grade 2 or greater bleeding occurred in 6% of patients and atrial fibrillation was reported in 5% of 
patients. Six percent of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events and dose reduct ion 
due to adverse events occurred in 11% of patients.   In addition, [ADDRESS_1184832] -marketing settings of which the role of ibrutinib could not be 
ruled out in 2 cases. ( EMA CHMP scientific conclusions for ibrutinib, 2017 ). 
Zanubrutinib is a novel second -generation, potent, specific and irreversible BTK inhibitor.  In the 
ongoing first -in-human Phase 1 study of zanubrutinib  (BGB -3111 -AU-003) in subjects with 
advanced B -cell malignancies, as of 03 November  2017, a total of 67 subjects with WM were 
enrolled in the study. All 67  subjects with WM were fully evaluable for safety and 51 subjects were 
evaluable for efficacy.  The median follow -up in these patients was 15.5 months ( 0.1 to 
37.6 months).  No subjects had CR, 43% had very good PR (VGPR), and 37% had PR, for a major 
response rate (CR+VGPR+PR) of 80%.  Preliminary gene sequencing data was available for all [ADDRESS_1184833] 2019  
 
                          
Page 33 patients  evaluable for efficacy  and suggests a high frequency o f deep responses in patients with 
MYD88MUT WM, with 16 of 30 (53%) MYD88MUT  WM patients achieving VGPR  (Tam et al 2018 ). 
Zanubrutinib was well tolerated across histologies and dosages.  As of [ADDRESS_1184834] 
common (≥  10%) treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) for [ADDRESS_1184835] infection  (39.7%);  contusion (32.8%); constipation (20.7%); diarrhea (19.0%); 
cough (15.5%); nausea, back pain, headache, anemia, urinary tract in fection  (13.8% each), and rash 
(12.1%) .  Of the 58 evaluable subjects with WM , 6 subjects  (10.3%) discontinued BGB - 3111 due 
to adverse events ( AEs).  No deaths were considered related to treatment.   Refer to the 
Investi gator’s Brochure (IB)  for more detailed information o n zanubrutinib.  
Zanubrutinib was designed to be a more specific inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase than 
ibrutinib.  Preclinical data in cell lines and primary patient samples show specific BTK inhibition 
with less inhibition of off -target kinases such as EGFR, ITK, JAK3, HER2 and TEC than the 
first-generation BTK inhibitor ibrutinib.  We hypothesize that this improved selectivity may result 
in a better safety profile than ibrutinib.  Based on sa fety data of zanubrutinib above we perceive the 
risk of taking zanubrutinib to be similar or superior to those of ibrutinib and the benefit to be 
potentially greater.  However, to minimize the risks associated with BTK inhibitors we have put 
rules in place .  To minimize the risk of bleeding, subjects will hold study drug for [ADDRESS_1184836] - surgery depending on the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.  Subjects will be 
closely monitored for infection and drug will be held and may be subseque ntly reduced, depending 
on recurrence, in the event of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenias associated with significant bleeding as 
well as grade 4 thrombocytopenias lasting >  10 days, Grade 4 neutropenia (lasting > 10 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_852103]), and ≥ Grade 3 feb rile neutropenia.  Furthermore, study drug will be held for 
any ≥ Grade 3 bleeding, and permanently discontinued for any related ≥ Grade  3 hemorrhage with 
the exception of those where the underlying condition can be fully treated (e.g. gastric ulce r 
resulting in gastrointestinal [GI] bleed) and the risk of a re -bleed is deemed acceptable. For any 
intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship to the study drug , the study drug should 
be held and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed . If the risk of rebleeding is deemed 
unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of cases, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed unless event resolution has been demo nstrated by 
[CONTACT_852148], the risk o f rebleeding is deemed low, and the patient does not have a need for 
concurrent anti -coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_852104] ).  Study drug resumption can only occur 
after a discussion and approval by [CONTACT_138830]. Subjects will be monitored for these 
adverse events.  
We hypothesize that zanubrutinib will have sustained tissue penetration that may result in a deeper 
response than ibrutinib.  Twice -daily zanubrutinib dosing results in high plasma exposure of 
zanubrutinib.  Close to 100% sustained BTK occupancy was found in studies where paired patient

Page 34 lymph node biopsies and blood samples were examined suggesting a deep tissue penetration of the 
drug.  Phase 1 clinical data presented at the European Hematology Association meeting support this

92% (47 of 51), a major response rate of 81% (41 of 51), and a VGPR in 43% (22 of 51) of subjects 
with WM (Tam et al, 2018).  To test these hypotheses more formally we have designed this  head to

4.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open -label, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in subjects with 
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM) who require therapy according to the consensus panel 
criteria from the Sev enth International Workshop on Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia 
(Dimopoulos et al 2014 ).  Subjects may be treatment -naïve (TN) or have relapsed or been refractory 
to prior therapy.  Relapsed means a subject previousl y achieved a CR or VGPR/PR but after a 
period of [ADDRESS_1184842] experienced 
prior treatment failure or disease progression within 6 months of therapy initiation. Subjects with no 
prior therapy (TN) w ill comprise no more than 20% of the study analysis set in Cohort 1.  The st udy 
is composed of an initial Screening Phase (up to 35 days), a Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up 
Phase.  The study schema is presented in  Figure  1.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1184843] the MYD88  gene sequenced by a central laboratory using the baseline bone marro w.  
Approximately o ne hundred  and eighty -eight WM subjects (150  relapsed/refractory subjects  and 
approximately 38  treatment -naïve subjects)  who have the MYD88MUT mutation, which is 
characteristic of WM and present in approximately 90%  of cases, will be enrolled on to Cohort 1 
and randomized to one of two treatment arms (Cohort 1; zanubrutinib treatment [Arm A] or 
ibrutinib treatment [Arm B]) in a 1:1 ratio using CXCR4  mutational status ( CXCR4WHIM vs. 
CXCR4WT vs missing ) and number of pr ior lines of therapy for WM (0 vs. 1 -3 vs. >3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) 
as stratification factors.  Subjects found to have MYD88WT by [CONTACT_657260], which is estimated 
to be present in approximately 10% of enrolled subjects, will be enrolled to Cohort [ADDRESS_1184844], non -randomized study arm (Arm C).  This non -
randomized arm is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of zanubrutinib in MYD88WT WM subjects, among 
whom suboptimal efficacy has been observed (i.e. , shorter median survival and lower MRR and 
CR/VGPR rates versus MYD88MUT) when treated with ibrutinib. In addition, those subjects whose 
MYD88  mutational status is missing or inconclusive  will be assigned to Cohort 2, Arm C.  Arm C

marrow will be assessed by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_852105], after 12  cycles (C13D1),  at time of 
suspected CR , and as clinically indicated.  
Response assessments will occur in all subjects at the beginning of every cycle (every 4  weeks ) 
starting from C2D1  during the first 12 cycles ( 48 weeks ), and then every 3 cycles (every 12  weeks ) 
thereafter  e.g., C2D1, C3D1, etc . For those with extramedulla ry disease at baseline response 
assessments must occur in conjunction with CT scans until resolution of extramedullary disease.   
For response assessments that occur during cycles where a CT scan is not required then results from 
prior scans (up to 12 weeks /[ADDRESS_1184849] 48 weeks/12 cycles and up to 24 weeks/6 cycles 
thereafter) can be carried forward in those subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline.  Quality 
of life (QOL) will be measured every [ADDRESS_1184850] 48 weeks, and th en every 24 weeks 
thereafter by [CONTACT_20368] -C30 and  EQ-5D in MYD88MUT WM subjects  (Cohort 1) . 
All subjects will be followed for AEs for [ADDRESS_1184851] dose of study drug.  All 
treatment -related AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be follow ed until resolution or stabilization. 
Efficacy evaluations will continue until documented PD for subjects who discontinued for reasons 
other than PD.   
Screening Phase: Screening evaluations will be performed within [ADDRESS_1184852] enrolls based on a bone marrow biopsy that was obtained within 
the 42 days of randomization, then a fresh bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_852106].  Subjects who agree to participate wil l sign the informed consent form prior to 
any screening evaluations.  Screening procedures are outlined in  Table 3.  Screening evaluations can 
be repeated within the screening period.  
Treatment Phase:   Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 ( MYD88MUT) or Cohort 2 
(MYD88WT/missing) based on the muta tional status of the MYD88 gene.  Cohort 1 subjects will be 
randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system by [CONTACT_852150] 1 Day 1. Cohort 2 subjects 
(MYD88WT/missing) will be assigned by [CONTACT_852151]. Subjects randomized to Arm 
A will take 160 mg (80 mg x 2 capsules) of zanubrutinib PO BID .  Subjects randomized to Arm B 
will take 420 mg (140 mg x 3 capsules , or in other applicable do se forms ) of ibrutinib PO QD.  
Subjects assigned to Cohort 2 (Arm C) will take zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2 capsules) PO BID.

Follow -up Phase:  In all study arms, subjects will return approximately [ADDRESS_1184854] dose 
of study drug for Safety Follow -up Visit(s) for the collection of  AEs and SAEs that may have 
occurred after the subject discontinued from the study.  For subjects that had extramedullary disease 
at baseline, a CT scan is also require d at the Safety Follow -up Visit.  All treatment -related SAEs 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  The investigator or his/her designee will also 
continue to collect information on new anticancer therapy given after the last dose of study dr ug.  
Efficacy evaluations will continue until documented PD.  If study drug is discontinued due to 
reasons other than PD, serum IgM and M -protein levels will continue to be followed every 12 
weeks while other efficacy evaluations will be followed as per in vestigator’s discretion. Efficacy 
assessments will be continued, as per protocol, until PD, withdrawal of consent, death, lost to 
follow -up, end of study or study termination by [CONTACT_3211], whichever occurs first.  Follow -up will 
continue to occur even though  a subject may have started a new anticancer therapy after the last

Page 46 6 STUDY TREATMENT PHAS E AND FOLLOW -UP PHAS E  
6.1 Study Treatment and Dose Rationale  
Subjects randomized to Arm A or assigned to Arm C will receive zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2 
white capsules) PO BID .  The dose of 320 mg total daily, given as div ided dose of 160 mg PO BID 
was selected as the recommended Phase 3 dose based on PK/PD data, sustained target occupancy, 
high rates of objective response in multiple histologies, and a favorable safety and tolerability 
profile.  Full occupancy of BTK in per ipheral blood mononuclear cells was achieved in all subjects 
starting at 40 mg zanubrutinib in the Phase 1/2 study, while occupancy in lymph node tissue was 
assessed only at 160 mg BID and 320  mg daily. At the 160 mg BID dose, full BTK occupancy was 
observ ed at trough, suggesting that sustained target occupancy could be achieved in disease -
originating tissues, thus more efficiently inhibiting BTK on a continuous basis, further preventing 
breakthrough signaling despi[INVESTIGATOR_69773]. Activity h as been observed across 
indications at all tested dose levels; thus, a minimum effective dose cannot be established at this 
time. Conversely, there is now extensive experience at the 160 mg BID dose; which shows a high 
level of activity without compromise of the tolerability profile as compared to lower doses of 
zanubrutinib.  
Subject s randomized to Arm B will rec eive ibrutinib 420 mg (140 mg x 3 capsules , or in other 
applicable dose forms ) PO QD as per prescribing information .  For example, as available, o ne 
420 mg tablet or 140  mg x 3 tablets.   
6.2 Study Treatment Preparation and Dispensation  
6.2.1 Packaging and Labeling  
Zanubrutinib capsules  will be provided in a child -resistant  high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle 
with induction seal and bottle label.  Commercial supplies of ibrutinib will be provided by [CONTACT_852155]. In the case of local procurement, the cost for provision 
of ibrutinib may be covered by a patient’s insurance or via reimbursement by [CONTACT_456].  The 
contents of study treatment labels will be in accordance with all applicable local regulatory 
requirements.  
All study treatments  will be consistent  with those described in the Pharmacy Manual for this study . 
6.2.2 Handling and Storage  
Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT) system will be used for drug supply management. The 
study drug will be dispatched to a study center only after receipt of the required documents in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the sponsor’s procedures. The Investigator  
or pharmacist/designated personnel is responsible for maintaining the drug supply inventory and 
acknowledgment receipt of all study drug shipments. All study drug must be stored in a secure area 

 
Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184870] be dispensed or administered according to procedures described 
herein.  Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study drug, in accordan ce with all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  Only authorized study center personnel may supply or 
administer study drug.   
6.2.3 Compliance and Accountability  
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_1755]/or study personnel by [CONTACT_852156]/or guardian.  
The investigator and/or study personnel will keep accurate records of the quantities of study drug 
dispensed   All subjects enrolled in the study will be provided with patient diaries.  The subjec t is 
responsible for maintaining the patient diary.  The subject will record the number of capsules  (or in 
other dose forms as applicable, eg , tablets)  taken and if any were missed.  The site personnel 
responsible for drug accountability will record the quantity of drug dispensed and quantity of drug 
returned at periodic visits by [CONTACT_102] , or at any cycle visit if dosing non -compliance is suspected.   
The patient diaries and the pharmacist record of drug dispensation will be assessed by [CONTACT_3786]/study personnel at each visit .  The investigator is responsible for study drug 
accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance.  In accordance w ith all applicable regulatory 
requirements, the investigator or designated study center personnel must maintain study drug 
accountability records throughout the course of the study. This person will document the amount of 
study drug received from the spons or, the amount supplied, and/or administered to and returned by 
[CONTACT_1766], if applicable.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1184871] of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and scanned 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_252415]’s source data/documents will need to be provided to the Medical Monitor or 
designee for review during the screening period .  Medical Monitor or designee will confirm wheth er 
the subject is eligible for the study and confirmation will be sent to the site.  Subject can not be 
randomized until confirmation  from the M edical Monitor  or designee is received . 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1184872] will be enrolled into 
either Cohort 1 ( MYD88MUT) or Cohort 2 ( MYD88WT). Those subjects with either missing or 
inconclusive MYD88 gene sequencing results will be assigned to Cohort 2 by [CONTACT_15094].  
Approximately 210  subjects will be enrolled into the study. Aproximately 188 subjects from 
Cohort  1 (MYD88MUT), including 150 subjects with relapsed refractory WM and approximately 
38 subjects with treatment -naïve WM, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the IRT system to 
receive either zanubrutinib (Arm A) or ibrutinib (Arm B).  Stratification factors include CXCR4  
mutational status ( CXCR4WHIM vs. CXCR4WT vs missing ) and the number of prior lines of therapy 
for WM (0  vs. 1 -3 vs. >3).  A computer -generated randomization list including stratification factor 
values and treatment arm assignments will be produced, r eviewed and approved by [CONTACT_69852]. The randomization scheme and identification for each subject will be included in the 
final clinical study report (CSR) for this study. Subjects from Cohort 2 (approximately 22 subjects  
who are  MYD88WT/missing) will be assigned to Arm C using IRT to receive zanubrutinib capsules.  
Cohort 2 assignment and stratified randomization of Cohort 1 will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_852157] 1 Day 1. The investigator or his/her de legate will call 
the IRT after confirming that the subject has fulfilled all the eligibility criteria. At randomization, 
the IRT will assign each subject a unique number. This unique patient number will be used to 
identify the patient in the electronic dat a capture (EDC) system and other data sources. The 
randomization list will be kept by [CONTACT_605480], responsible (or designee) monitors, project statisticians, or to the project team at  
BeiGene.   The time from randomization of the subject to the initiation of therapy should be no more 
than [ADDRESS_1184873] 2019

on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Subjects randomized  or assigned  to zanubrutinib (Arms A and C) will be instruc ted to take 160 mg 
(80 mg x 2 capsules) orally with a glass of water twice a day  at approximately the same time each 
day. The time difference between two consecutive doses should be a minimum of 8  hours .  Subjects 
randomized to ibrutinib (Arm B) will be in structed to take 420 mg (140  mg x 3 capsules  or in other 
applicable dose forms ) orally with a glass of water, once a day at the approximately same time each 
day.   
Zanubrutinib (Arms A and C) or ibrutinib (Arm B) should be taken within [ADDRESS_1184875] . Zanubrutinib capsules or ibrutinib in any applicable dose forms 
should not be opened, broken, or chewed at any time.  
In subjects undergoing pharma cokinetics (PK) blood sampling, study drug administration for 
subject s randomized  or assigned  to Arms A and C (zanubrutinib) will occur on the specified days at 
the center after the pre -dose blood sampling has occurred under the supervision of the investig ator 
or his/her designee.  The investigator or his/her designee must instruct the subject not to self -
administer the study drug prior to the office visit on those days.   
Subjects on Arms A and C (zanubrutinib) should be instructed that if a dose of the st udy drug is not 
taken at the scheduled time, they should skip the study drug if the time to next dose is [ADDRESS_1184876] 2019  
 
                          
Page 50 Subjects o n Arm B (ibrutinib) should be instructed that if a dose of the study drug is not taken at the 
scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to normal dosing 
the next day, or to take ibrutinib according to local prescribi ng guidelines.  The patient should not 
take extra capsules (or in other applicable dose forms) to make up the missed dose.  If subjects 
vomit after taking the capsules, they should not repeat that dose.  
Any dose of study drug in excess of that specified i n this protocol is considered to be an overdose.  
AEs associated with an overdose of study drug should  be recorded as an AE in the patient's chart 
and on the appropriate eCRF.  Any SAEs associated with an overdose  are required to be reported 
within 24 hour s of awareness via SAE reporting process as described in Section 9.2.2 .  There is no 
specific antidote for either zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. In an event of an overdose , subjects should be 
closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.  
6.5 Dose Interruption and Modification  
The guidelines set forth in Table  1 should be followed for dose interruption or modification of 
zanubrutinib or ibrutinib for hematologic ( Section 6.5.1 ) or non -hematologic ( Section 6.5.2) 
toxicities based on investigator assessmen t of study drug relatedness.   
Study drug may be held for a maximum of 2 consecutive cycles  and restarted upon resolution of 
toxicity and per investigator discretion.   If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is in the subject’s best 
interest to restart treat ment after being held for more than [ADDRESS_1184877] be obtained from the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  or designee . More than one study

 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  (lasting >10 days)  
 Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia  
 Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_1184880] occurrence of hematologic toxicity, treatment may restart at full dose upon recovery of 
the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.  If the same event reoccurs, subjects will restart at one dose 
level lower upon recovery of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.  A maximum of 2 dose 
reductions will be allowed.  
6.5.2 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematologic Toxicity for Zanubrut inib 
For non-hematological toxicities ≥ Grade 3 , other than hypertension  that is  adequately controlled 
with oral medication  or asymptomatic laboratory events (laboratory events indicating liver or renal 
dysfunction will not be considered asymptomatic labor atory events ) suspected to be related to study 
drug treatment, study drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1  or baseline , and then restarted at 
the original dose level .  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be held until recovery to 
≤  Grade  1 or baseline and restarted at Dose L evel -1.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3  at Dose 
Level  -1, drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and restarted at Dose L evel -2.  If 
the event recurs at ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1184881] will be discontinued from study 
treatment.  For subjects experiencing atrial fibrillation that is symptomatic and/or incompletely 
controlled:  after the atrial fibrillation is adequately controlled the study drug may be restarted at 
either the original dose or Dose Level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator.  
Zanubrutinib should be held for any ≥ Grade3 bleeding.  The drug should be permanently 
discontinued for any related ≥ 3 Grade hemorrhage with the exception of those where the 
underlying condition can be fully treated (e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in GI bleed) and the risk of a 
re-bleed is deemed acceptable.  For any intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship 
to the study drug , the study drug should be held and the risk of rebleedin g should be assessed. If the 
risk of rebleeding is deemed unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of case s, the study 
drug should be permanently discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed unless event 
resolution has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_3610] s or MRI, the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, and the 
patient does not have a need for concurrent anti -coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low 
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_852107] ).  Study 
drug resumption can only occur after a discussion and approval by [CONTACT_138830].

initiated at the starting dose.  If the toxicity recurs, drug dose  will be reduced  to Dose Level -1 (280 
mg orally QD).  A second dose reduction to Dose Level -2 (140 mg orally QD) may be considered 
as needed.  If these toxicities persist or recur following [ADDRESS_1184884] will be 
discontinued for study treatment.   
As with zanubrutinib, ibrutinib should be interrupted for any ≥ Grade3 bleeding.  The drug should 
be permanently discontinued for any related ≥ Grade 3 hemorrhage with the exception of those 
where the underly ing condition can be fully treated (e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in GI bleed) and the 
risk of a re -bleed is deemed acceptable.  For any intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or 
relationship to the study drug , the study drug should be held and the risk of rebleeding should be 
assessed. If the risk of rebleeding is deemed unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of 
cases, the study drug should be permanently discontinued. S tudy drug should not be  resumed unless 
event resolutio n has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_852148], the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, 
and the patient does not have a need for concurrent anti -coagulation or anti -platelet medications  
(except low dose aspir in or low molecular weight heparin used to prevent venous 
thromboembolism ).  Study drug resumption can only occur after a discussion and approval by [CONTACT_119111].  
Use of ibrutinib in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medicinal product s that inhibit platelet 
function may increase the risk of bleeding, and particular care should be taken if anticoagulant 
therapy is used.   
As described in Section 6.6.[ADDRESS_1184885] be reduced or withheld temporarily (7 days o r less).  Ibrutinib dose 
must be reduced when administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.  Refer to the local 
prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific 
instructions on dose modifications with these  inhibitors.  
For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A) and patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Class B) , refer to the local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information 
or Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific instructions on dose modifications  of ibrutinib .

6.6 Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
6.6.1 Permitted Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with indication 
and dates of administration.   
Subjects with high tumor burden sho uld be monitored closely and prophylactic measures, including 
allopurinol, may be instituted per institutional standards. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) has not 
been currently reported with zanubrutinib treatment, but has been reported rarely with ibrutinib.  
Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks or less) are permitted, if used to treat a 
concomitant (non -cancer) medical condition.  
Bisphosphonates can be coadministered with zanubrutinib.  
Patients with hematologic malignancies , particularly those having received prior lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy or having prolonged corticosteroid exposure,  are predisposed to opportunistic 
infections as a result of a number of disease  and treatment -related factors.   In patients with a high 
risk of opportunistic in fections, including pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), prophylaxis 
should be considered  as per institutional standards . 
6.6.2 Prohibited Medications  
Subjects should not receive other anticancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, or hormone other than for 
replacement) while on treatment in this study.  Other anticancer therapy, experimental therapy and 
radiotherapy are prohibited and should not be administer ed until PD (as per clinical practice 
standards at the study center), unmanageable toxicity, or no further clinical benefit occurs which 
requires permanent discontinuation of the study drug.  
Any anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, corticosteroids give n with antineoplastic intent, 
experimental therapy, and radiotherapy are prohibited.  
Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2  weeks or less) are permitted, if used to treat a 
concomitant (non -cancer) medical condition. The chronic use of corticostero ids at doses equivalent 
to adrenal replacement (2.5 mg to 7.5 mg prednisone) is prohibited without previous discussion with 
and approval from the Medical Monitor or designee.    
Use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered conco mitantly with 
ibrutinib.  Supplements such as fish oil or supplements and vitamin E preparations should be 
avoided.   
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort should be avoided.  

 
Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184887] for ibrutinib involve the CYP3A isoform.  Administration of 
ibrutinib  with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers should be avoided  and consider using 
alternative agents . In addition, star fruit, pomegranate and grapefruit and their juices and Seville 
oranges (bitter oranges) should be avoided since they are known to affect the CYP3A pathway.   
Co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with ibrutinib  may lea d to increased 
ibrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity.  On the contrary, co -administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased ibrutinib  exposure and consequently a risk for lack of 
efficacy.  Therefore, concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers should be avoided.  
If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, reduce the  ibrutinib 
dose or withhold treatment temporarily (for 7 days or less).  If a moderate CYP3 A4 inhibitor must 
be used, reduce ibrutinib treatment for the duration of the inhibitor use.  Refer to the local 
prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific 
guidelines on dose modifications.   
Refer t o Appendix 3  for examples of strong and moderate CY3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  Please 
refer to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ for a more complete list.  
6.6.3 Medications to be Used with Caution  
Ibrutini b is metabolized to a minor extent by [CONTACT_097]2D6. Other than strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor and inducers, CYP 450 enzyme class drug is not restricted in ibrutinib prescribing 
information Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A (see Section 1.3.4 ), 
Administration of zanubrutinib with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers (refer 
to Table [ADDRESS_1184888] of these medications) and grapefruit juice and Seville oranges should be used 
with caution as they may affect the metabolism of zanubrutinib.   If at all possible, patients are 
encou raged not to use strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers and consider using 
alternative agents. If these agents will be used, follow the dose modification table in  Table 2.  The 
medical monitor should be consulted in these situations. Please refer to 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ for a more complete list.   
Based on in vitro data, zanubrutinib may have the potential to affect the human isoenzy mes 
CYP2C8 activity  (Section 1.3.2 ).  A clinical drug -drug interaction study (Study BGB -3111 -108) 
indicated that zanubrutinib does not inhibit CYP2C9 , however, is a mild inducer of CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C19 ( Section 1.3.4 ).  Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 
(alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus 
and tacrolimus), and CYP2C19  (eg, S-mephenytoin) or CYP2C8 should be used with caution  
(Appendix 4 ), as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. Because 
ethinylestradiol (a key ingredient in a variety of combined oral contraceptives) is partly metabolized 

 
Zanubrutinib

Page 56 by [CONTACT_097] 3A4, patients using hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_5178]) must use a 
barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) as well (see Section 5.1).  
Repeated dosing of zanubrutinib increased exposure of digoxin (P -gP substrate) with a mean 
increase of 11% for AUC 0-t and 34% for C max .(Section 1.3.4 ). The coadmini stration of oral P -gp 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin) should be used with caution as zanubrutinib 
may increase their concentrations.  
6.6.[ADDRESS_1184890] is to undergo surgery during Treatment Phase.  
6.7 End of Treatment  
All subjects, regardless of reason for discontinuation of study treatment will undergo an End of 
Treatment (EOT) visit within 7 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743].  A visit should be scheduled as soon as 
possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for t he EOT visit will be performed (see Table  
3).  The reason for  discontinuation from treatment will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Subjects may discontinue study drug for any one of the following reasons : 
 Disease progression  
 Adverse event(s)  
 Subject withdrew consent  
 Investigator Decision   
 Other  
Subject s may voluntarily withdraw consent from treatment at any time.  Subject s will continue in to 
the Follow -up Phase if subject withdraws consent from the Treatment Phase.    
Subjects who are continuing to receive benefit from zanubrutinib after disease progressi on may 
remain in the study upon discussion with the Medical Monitor or designee.  These subjects that 
remain in the study will continue to follow the required assessments during the treatment phase.

Page 57 followed until resolution or stabilization.  The investigator or his/her designee will also continue to 
collect information on new anticancer therapy given after the last dose of study drug.  For subjects 
that had extramedullary dise ase at baseline, a CT scan is also required at this visit.  A laboratory 
assessment is only required if the subject had an ongoing laboratory abnormality at the previous 
visit that the investigator considered to be related to study drug.  If the subject is  unable to return to 
the clinic and no laboratory assessment is necessary, the investigator or his/her designee will contact 
[CONTACT_852158].  
6.8.2 Efficacy Follow -Up 
Subjects who are discontinued from study drug for any reas on other than PD will be followed every 
12 weeks (±14 days) until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, lost to follow -up, end 
of study or study termination by [CONTACT_3211], whichever occurs first. Follow -up will continue to occur 
even though a sub ject may have started a new anticancer therapy after the last dose of study drug.  
IgM will continue to be followed every 12 weeks while other efficacy evaluations will be followed 
as per investigator’s discretion.  
For full efficacy assessment schedules, please refer to Section  7.[ADDRESS_1184892]’s guardian by [CONTACT_852159]’s disease status and survival.  
6.8.[ADDRESS_1184893] (with the subject’s guardian, if  applicable) every 12 weeks (±14 days) as per 
Section 4.1 until study end.  
6.9 End of Study  
Premature discontinuation from the study (including all fol low-up visits) will occur under the 
following circumstances:  
 Subject withdrew consent  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Death  
 Study termination by [CONTACT_3211]

weeks (12 cycles) then every 12 weeks (3 cycles) thereafter as indicated in Section 7.3. Assessments will be based on physical examination (i n cases in which 
organomegaly is present), laboratory evaluations, quantitative immunoglobulins and SPEP, radiologic assessment, and bone marr ow studies. For response 
assessments during cycles when a CT scan is not required, the results of the most recent CT scan(s) may be used for the response assessment only if the prior 
scan date is within [ADDRESS_1184916] 48 weeks until Day 1 of Cycle 13 with the C1D1 
sample drawn at pre -dose, then every 3 cycles starting on Cycle 16 (C16, C19, C22 etc.) and thereafter. The Screening serum im munoelectrophoresis, with 
M-protein quantitation by [CONTACT_5296] (SPEP), performed within [ADDRESS_1184917] administration of study drug do not need t o be repeated on C1D1.   
h. Cold agglutinins, cryoglobulin; anti -MAG (myelin associated glycoprotein) and serum viscosity will be performed at Screening. If there are abnormal findings 
for any of these laboratory assessments at Screening, follow -up is required every cycle (every 4 weeks) for the first 48 weeks, then every 3 cycles (every 12 
weeks) starting on Cycle 16 (C16, C19, C22, etc.) and at time of suspected CR. Once these labs have normalized, they should be repeated every [ADDRESS_1184918] for cryoglobulinemia throughout the study to ensure that the same methodology is used 
throughout the study .  In addition, serum immunoglobulins should be retested using the residual cryoglobulin blood sample, which is to be collected  and 
processed und er warm  conditions at the local laboratory throughout the study. If serum immunoglobulins cannot be quantified, the serum 
immunoelectrophoresis sample will need to be re -collected, processed, and analyzed at the local laboratory under warm conditionsThese blood samples  
(cryoglobulin/serum IgM/SPEP/serum immunofixation)  are to be collected and processed under warm conditions .

hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and hepatitis B s urface antigen ( HBsAg ) as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by [CONTACT_852163] (regardless of HBsAb status). The hepatitis C testing includes Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody as w ell as HCV RNA by [CONTACT_852164]. Subjects with positive HBsAg and/or detectable level of HBV DNA or detectable level of HCV RN A are not eligible.  
Subjects negative for HBsAg, HBcAb positive, and HBV DNA negative must undergo monthly HBV DNA screening by [CONTACT_159754] R.  Subjects positive for HCV 
antibody but negative for HCV RNA must undergo monthly HCV RNA screening. Subjects with known HIV are excluded from the study . 
k. Urinalysis will be assessed using urine dipstick.  Urine microscopy will be performed if urine dips tick is abnormal (may be at investigator discretion except 
when urine protein ≥ 2+).  Urinalysis includes pH, glucose, protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, and specific gravity.  If uri ne protein is ≥ 2+ by [CONTACT_5230], a 
24-hour urine for total protein and a random urine for total protein and creatinine will be obtained and evaluated. All these tests will be performed in a local 
laboratory.

effects of plasmapheresis on PK, including collection of additional PK samples immediately before the start of plasmapheresis , approximately an hour after the start of 
the procedure, and 3 0 min after the end of procedure (please also see Section 7.6.2 ).  Subjects are recommended to receive zanubrutinib in the clinic on day of 
plasmap heresis and plasmapheresis is to commence between 2 to 3 hours (T max) following zanubrutinib dosing.   
13. Zanubrutinib and ibrutinib will be dispensed by [CONTACT_852165], approximately every 4 weeks (every cycle), to ensure adequate drug 
supply for each cycle throughout the Treatment Phase. Subjects randomized to Arm A, or assigned to Arm C will receive zanubru tinib at a dose of 160 mg (80 mg x 2 
white opaque capsules) PO BID. Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg ( e.g.140 mg x 3 capsules). Zanubrutinib or ibrutinib will be

Change in serum IgM level from baseline will be based upon the IgM value from the central  
quantitative serum immunoglobulin assay, unless for  assay limitations this is not possible, in which 
case the central M-protein level by [CONTACT_5296]  (SPEP) will be used.    
The serum IgM value (quantitative serum immunoglobulin/SPEP methodology) at C1D1 will serve 
as the baseline (last value prior to drug administration) for all assessments throughout the study 
except for patients who have undergone plasmapheresis . For patients who have undergone 
plasmapheresis, the pre -plasmapheresis serum IgM value (if available at screening) should be used. 
In the case o f multiple prior consecutive plasmapheresis procedures during screening , the highest 
predose value (least confounded by [CONTACT_535602]) should be used as the baseline.   
For patients with cryoglobulinemia, blood sample s (cryoglobulins/serum  IgM/SPEP/serum 
immunofixation) should be collected and processed under warm conditions for baseline assessment 
and throughout the study .   
Response assessments should  be performed using results based on the same methodology  in the

All lesions found by [CONTACT_852176] (up to 10 lesions in 
extramedullary CRF) or non -target.  Measureable lesions will be recorded in the eCRF at each 
imaging timepoint in 2 perpendicular dimensions: LDi and short diameter (SDi).  SDi is defined as 
the longest diameter perpendicular to LDi.  
Target lesions may become “too small to measure”  (TSTM) .  While on study, all lesio ns (nodal and 
extra nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2  mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which 
are recorded as target lesions at baseline become  so faint on a CT scan that the radiologist may not 
feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measure”.  
When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF.  If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_852120], the measurement should be recorded as 0  mm.  If 
the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 
5 mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small

7.4.2 Physical Examination, Vital Signs, Height, Weight, Assessment of B symptoms, 
Re-evaluation of Baseline Reason(s) for Initiation of Therapy, and Review for 
Arrhythmia Signs/Symptoms  
Physical examination, vital signs (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, and b ody temperature), weight, 
B symptoms examination  will be performed at the timepoints specified (See Table 3).  Additionally, 
a brief questionnaire to review signs and symptoms of ventricular arrhyt hmia (e.g., shortness of 
breath, d izziness, or fainting)  will be completed by [CONTACT_852177].  These signs and symptoms will be monitored throughout the study at every 
visit.   Height (cm) is determined at Screening only.  B symptoms includes unexplained weight loss 
> 10% over previous 6  months, fever ( ≥ 38°C), and/or drenching night sweats.   
Body systems (e.g. cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_852119].) should be evaluated at each visit when a 
physical examination is performed and any abnormali ties recorded. A complete physical exam 
includes assessments of cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and neurological systems as well as the 
examination of the abdomen, lymph nodes, spleen, skin, oropharynx and extremities.   As part of the 
tumor assessment, physical examination should also include the evaluation of the presence and 
degree of enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly.   For a lymph node to be considered enlarged , 
the longest diameter should measure >  1.5 cm. Spleen should be measured craniocaudal.  
In addition, baseline reason(s) for treatment initiation must be reviewed and documented at each 
visit (Day [ADDRESS_1184948] 48 weeks [until C13D1), then every 3 cycles (every 
12 weeks), and at EOT and Safety Follow -up Visits ).  Symptoms th at triggered treatment will be

toxicity, these assessments will be conducted as frequently as the investigator feels it necessary until 
toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 2.  
7.5.3 Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins and β2 -microglobulin  
Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) and β2 -microglobulin will be measured at the 
Screening Visit, on Day [ADDRESS_1184954] 48 weeks with Cycle 1 Day 1 sample drawn at 
pre-dose, then every 3 cycles during the T reatment Phase. If subjects discontinue study drug due to 
reasons other than PD, serum immunoglobulin (i.e. , IgG, IgM, IgA) will continue to be followed 
every [ADDRESS_1184955] administration of study drug, they do not need to be repeated 
on Cycle 1 Day 1. It is recommended that sequential response assessments for individual subjects 
are performed in the same laboratory using the same methodology.  
7.5.4 Serum Immunoelectrophor esis with M -Protein Quantitation by [CONTACT_852178] 
(SPEP) and Serum Immunofixation  
Serum immunoelectrophoresis with M -protein quantitation by [CONTACT_5296] (SPEP) and serum 
immunofixation will be performed at Screening, on Day [ADDRESS_1184956] administration of study drug, it does not need to be repeated on 
Cycle 1 Day 1.   Additionally, see note below in Section 7.5.5  regarding retesting serum 
immunoglobulins in subjects with cryoglobulinemia.  
7.5.5 Cold Agglutinins, Cryoglobulin, Anti -MAG, Serum Viscosity  
Cold agglutinins, cryoglobulin, anti -MAG (myelin associated glycoprote in), serum viscosity blood 
tests will be performed at Screening.   If there are abnormal findings for any of these laboratory 
assessments at Screening, follow -up is required every cycle for the first [ADDRESS_1184957], should be 
tested for the presence of cryoglobulins  at the local laboratory prior to C1D1 .  The C1D1 sample 
will serve as the baseline.  Repeat testing is required at every visit at the local lab oratory  or central 
laboratory  until cryoglobulin testing has normalized  (negative result) , and then be assessed every 3 
cycles and at time of suspected CR .  When samples are collected and tested at local lab oratorie s, the 
local results should be recorded in the eCRF.  In addition, the s erum immunoglobulins /SPEP and 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184958] 2019  
 
                          
Page 77 serum immunofixation assays  should also be retested prior to C1D1,  using the residual cryoglobulin 
blood sample  if available, at the local laborat ory, which should be collected and processed similarly 
to the cryoglobulins under warm conditions.  Only when serum immunoglobulins cannot be  
quantified, the serum immunoelectrophoresis sample will need to be re -collected, processed, and  
analy zed at the lo cal laboratory under warm conditions. If neither the local laboratory baseline 
serum IgM  nor SPEP M -protein  was available, then the central laboratory serum IgM should be 
collected in addition and may be used for response assessment throughout the study. I f central 
serum IgM has shown to be reliable despi[INVESTIGATOR_852124], the local laboratory serum IgM 
may no longer be required.   
The samples (cryoglobulin and serum immunoglobulins) should always be collected and processed 
under warm conditions at the local  or central  laboratory throughout the study to ensure that the same 
methodology is used throughout the study.  The results of all local testing should be entered into the 
EDC once they are available.  If it is not possible  to perform the cryoglobulin or serum 
immunoglobulin testing at the local lab oratory , the Clinical Research Associate or BeiGene should 
be contact[CONTACT_112073].   
7.5.6 Iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), and Ferritin Tests  
Iron, TIBC and ferritin tests will be performed at Screening only. If abnormal, iron supplementation 
should be provided per investigator’s discretion prior to initiation of study treatment.  
7.5.7 Coagulation  
The coagulation profile includes prothrombin time (PT), which will also be reported as international 
norm alized ratio (INR).  The coagulation profile will be performed at Screening only.   
7.5.8 Urinalysis with Dipstick  
Urinalysis will be assessed using urine dipstick.  Urine microscopy will be performed if urine 
dipstick is abnormal  (may be at investigator discret ion except when urine protein  ≥ 2+). Urinalysis 
includes pH, glucose, protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, and specific gravity. If urine protein is ≥ 2+ 
by [CONTACT_5230], a [ADDRESS_1184959] who is pregnant will not be 
eligible for the study.  Laboratory -based highly sensitive  pregnancy tests  (urine or serum)  will be 
performed on Cycle 1 Day 1 , and then on Day 28 of every cycle (which can be performed on Day 1 
of the following cycle) .  Pregnancy tests must be continued every 4 weeks (cycle) for at least [ADDRESS_1184960] is 
required (for practicality, it will be performed at End of Treatment Visit).  If a urine  pregnancy test 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184961] result at any time after the study drug administration will be immediately withdrawn from 
participation in the study.  
7.5.10  HIV and Hepatit is B/C Testing  
Hepatitis B/C serologic markers and/or viral load will be tested at Screening.  The hepatitis B 
testing includes hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsA b), hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb), and 
hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsA g) as well as hepa titis B virus (HBV) DNA by [CONTACT_12036] ( PCR ) if the subject is negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb 
status). The hepatitis C testing includes Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody as well as HCV RNA by 
[CONTACT_852179] H CV antibody positive.  Subjects with positive HBsAg and/or detectable level 
of HBV DNA or detectable level of HCV RNA are not eligible.  Subjects HBsAg negative, HBcAb 
positive and HBV DNA negative must undergo monthly HBV DNA Screening PCR.  If, during 
monthly monitoring of HBV DNA by [CONTACT_954], the value is between 20 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL then the 
HBV DNA level should be rechecked within 2 weeks.  Study drug should be held and anti -viral 
therapy initiated if the repeat level is between 20 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL.  If the HBV DNA by [CONTACT_852180] 100 IU/mL or higher then study drug should be stopped and anti -viral therapy initiated.   Subjects 
positive for HCV antibody but negative for HCV RNA must undergo monthly HCV RNA 
Screening.   Subjects with known HIV are excluded from the study.  Subjects with detected HCV 
RNA should stop study drug and anti -viral therapy should be initiated.  The Medical Monitor or 
designee should be informed of any suspected hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactiv ation.

7.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood will be collected to characterize the PK of zanubrutinib and/or its major metabolites from all 
subjects on Arms A and C. Close monitoring of zanubrutinib drug co ncentrations may be needed by 
[CONTACT_852181] -drug interactions (eg, 
when a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer must be used for control of infection).  
7.6.[ADDRESS_1184963] es will be collected from subjects randomized to Arms A and C 
(zanubrutinib) only at the following time points: pre -dose (within 30 min prior to dose), 2 hours 
(± 30 min) post -dose and before subject discharge ([ADDRESS_1184964] -dose) on Cycle [ADDRESS_1184965] be recorded on 
the eCRF.  
Blood samples (2 mL) for PK analysis will be collected via the intravenous cannula pre -dose and at 
the time points specified in  Table 3.  The actual time each sample was collected will be captured to 
the nearest minute in the eCRF and recorded in the database.  
Details concerning handling of the PK plasma samples, including la beling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_852125].   
Samples will be shipped to the central laboratory where they will be stored and batch shipped to 
designated bioanalytical lab for quantification of plasma zanubrutinib concentrations using a 
validated method.

Page 80 7.6.2 Effects of Plasmapheresis on PK of Zanubrutinib  
For subjects receiving plasmapheresis (in Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 or beyond), below are additional 
procedures to follow:  
 Subjects are recommended to come in the clinic to receive zanubrutinib dosing on the day of 
plasmapheresis.  To properly assess the impact of plasmapheresis on zanubrutinib PK, 
plasmapheresis session is to commence between 2 to 3 hours (T max) following zanubrutinib 
dosing.  
 Zanubrutinib dosing time and the start and end time of each plasmapheresis session must be 
recorded in the database.  
 For subjects receiving plasmapheresis, additional PK samples (in addition to those noted in 
Section 7.6.1 ) will be collected at the following time points: immediately before the start of 
plasmapheresis, approximately an hour after the start of the procedure, and 30 min after the 
end of the procedure.  PK collection time wil l be recorded in the database.  
 For each plasmapheresis session, the volume of removed plasma will be measured and 
recorded in eCRF and an aliquot will be stored at a temperature of -20ºC or lower until 
analysis.  
 Zanubrutinib concentrations in both circulat ing and removed plasma will be measured using 
a validated method.

organization’s (CRO’s) qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from 
the study team responsible for conduct of the study.   
8.1 Data Collection  
Data required by [CONTACT_852182] a validated data 
management system that is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  As defined by [CONTACT_852183] (ICH) guidelines, the CRF is a printed, optical,  or electronic 
document designed to record all of the protocol -required information to be reported to the sponsor 
on each study subject.  
Data collection on the CRF must follow the instructions described in the CRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator h as ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all 
clinical data entered on the CRF.  The investigator or designee as identified on Form FDA [ADDRESS_1184970] parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized representatives 
of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
8.2 Data Managemen t/Coding  
All software applications used in the collection of data will be properly validated following standard 
computer system validation that is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  All data, both CRF 
and external data (e .g., laboratory data), wi ll be entered into a clinical system.  
The Data Management Plan defines and documents the procedures necessary to ensure data quality.  
These activities must be followed to ensure that data are properly entered, validated, coded, 
integrated, reconciled, and  reviewed.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) 
Version 18.1 or higher.  Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD).  Concomitant diseases/medi cal history will be coded 
using the MedDRA® Version 18.1 or higher.  
8.3 Quality Assurance  
To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements, the sponsor may conduct a quality assurance audit.  Regulatory agencies  may also

or after completion of the study.  If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution 
agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct  access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her 
time and the time of his/her personnel to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant 
issues.  
 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184972] to follow -up. 
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1 Definitions and Reporting  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abno rmal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
The investigator or designee will ask about adverse events by [CONTACT_7939] t he following standard 
questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Worsening of chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition in cluding an increase in severity, 
frequency , duration,  and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome .   
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a 
concurrent medication.  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator  to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the AE or SAE .  The 
investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or SAE in the eCRF.  
However, there may be instances wh en copi[INVESTIGATOR_852126] -[ADDRESS_1184973] identifiers will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_397687].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will ma ke an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study.  When applicable, AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the 
NCI-CTCAE v4.03 .  
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI-CTCAE v4.03  will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL  
 Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5: Death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2] , severe [Grade 3], or life -
threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by [CONTACT_556801]. Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from the 
Sponsor to applicable regulato ry authorities as described in Section 9.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of 
each AE or SAE.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationshi p of the event to the study drug will be considered and 
investigated.  The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred  and the investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is very important that the investigator 
always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE report to 
the spons or, since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements .    The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_852127] -up information, amending the SAE report accordingly.   

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184974] 2019  
 
                          
Page 86 The cau sality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related” or “not 
related”. An AE is considered related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_5257] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, o r arguments to suggest possible 
causation). A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study procedure  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been id entified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered ‘related’ to study drug if any of the following are met, otherwise the 
event should be assessed as not related:  
 There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing 
factors can be ruled out  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely  
 There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the AE occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of other 
factors may have contributed to the AE (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition or other 
concomitant AEs).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the subject’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_5258] , will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwise explained, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent . The 
investigat or will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated 
to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory 
tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consul tation with other health care 
professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE.  T he investigator is obligated to assist.  If a subject dies during participation in the 
study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings, including histopathology.

changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093].  The updated SAE report  form  should be resent to the 
sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and the eCRF should be updated 
accordingly.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1184976] Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e .g., clinical chemistry, CBC, coagulation, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (e .g., ECGs, X -rays, vital signs, etc.) that are judged by [CONTACT_852184] (as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ) or an SAE (as defined in Section 9.2).  The definition of  clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings is left to the judgment of the investigator.   In general, these 
are the laboratory test abnormalities  that are associated with clinical signs or symptoms, require 
medical intervention, l ead to dose interruption or discontinuation, require close observation,  more 
frequent follow -up assessments , or require further diagnostic investigation.   The investigator will 
exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnorma l laboratory finding 
or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
9.[ADDRESS_1184977] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in death.  
 Is life -threatening.  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the d efinition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
NOTE:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate  in the physician’s office or out . 
 Results in disability/incapacity.  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, 
but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a subject, he/she will report the 
information to the sponsor within 24 hours as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  The SAE  report form will 
always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event,  signed by [CONTACT_1275] (or designee), and forwarded to the sponsor or designee within the designated 
timeframes.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE , he/she is not to wait to receive 
additional information before notifying the sponsor or designee of the SAE  and completing the 
form.  The form will be updated when additional information i s received.

Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The sponsor will provide  contact [CONTACT_852186] . The SAE must also 
be reported in the EDC System by [CONTACT_852187].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, bot h the 
local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation.   
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requireme nts related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up safety  report or other safety information (e .g., 
revised IB) f rom the sponsor,  the investigator or designated  responsible person according to local 
requirements is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only SAEs 
should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reported until [ADDRESS_1184981] -study AE or SAE is defined as any AE that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period 
defined above.  Investigators are not obligated to actively se ek AEs or SAEs in former subjects.  
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the 
investigator will notify the sponsor.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Disease Progression  
Disease progression (including fatal disease progression)  is expected in this study population, and is 
measured as an efficacy endpoint, therefore  should not be reported as an AE term. Instead, the 
signs, symptoms or clinical sequelae  that result from  disease progression should be reported as the 
AE term.   
For instance, a subject with pleural effusion presents with shortness of breath.  The cause of the 
shortness of breath is a pleural effusion resulting from disease progression.  The AE term should be 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1184982] 2019  
 
                          
Page 90 reported as “pleural effusion” instead of disease progression or metastasis to lungs.  If a subject has 
a seizure that is determined to be associated w ith a brain metastasis, the term “seizure” should be 
recorded as the AE instead of disease progression or brain metastasis.   If a subject experienced 
multi -organ failure due to disease progression, the term “multi -organ failure” should be reported as 
the A E instead of disease progression.   
Deaths that are assessed by [CONTACT_852188].  They should not be reported 
as an SAE. A patient d eath not solely due to disease progression,  as assessed by [CONTACT_093],  
should be reported as an SAE immediately, regardless of relationship to the study drug.  
If there is any uncertainty regarding whether an AE is due to disease progression, it shoul d be 
reported as an AE.  
Death  
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event.   If the only information available is death 
and the cause of death is unknown, then the death should be reported as an event, e.g. , “Death”, 
“Death of unknown cause”, or  “Death unexplained.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event Related to Study Participation  
An SAE considered related to study participation (e .g., procedures, invasive tests), even if it occurs 
during the post -treatment period, will be reported promptly to the sponsor ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigator, Institutional Review 
Boards and Ethics Committees  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAE against cumulative study drug experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate new safety findings to health authorities, investigators, institutional 
review boards and ethics committees based on applicable legi slation.  
To determine reporting requirements for individual adverse event cases, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events using the following reference documents:  
 Zanubrutinib (BGB -3111) Investigator’s Brochure  
 Local prescribing informatio n for ibrutinib

study , a pregnancy report form is required to be completed .  The investigator, or his/her designee, 
will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the spo nsor within [ADDRESS_1184984]’s or male subject’s female partner’s pregnancy.  The subject or male 
subject’s female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Information on the status of the mother and child w ill be forwarded to the sponsor.  Generally, 
follow -up- will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any 
premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, an y pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as 
described in Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 and will be followed as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic or  spontaneous , should  always be reported  as an SAE 
as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study 
pregnancy and is considered reasonably related to the study drug by [CONTACT_093], will be 
reported to the sponsor as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth 
defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the study drug should be recorded and reported as an 
SAE.  
9.4 Lack of Efficacy  
“Lack of effic acy” will not be reported as an AE.  The signs and symptoms or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the AE or SAE definition (including 
clarifications).

subjects randomized from Cohort 1, will be implemented in the study.  A stop in recruitment  is not 
planned for this interim safety review. At regular safety reviews, data review will include but not be 
limited to deaths, SAEs, adverse events leading to dose reduction, dose interruption, or drug 
discontinuation. The DMC may recommend study modifi cation, including termination of the study 
due to efficacy and/or safety concerns.  Subsequent safety data review is outlined in DMC charter.

Page 92 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYTICA L 
PLAN  
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_852189].   
Details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
10.1 Primary, Secondary and Exploratory Study Endpoints  
Please refer to Section 3 for a full listing of study endpoints.  
10.2 Statistical Analysis  
All inferential statistics described in this Section refer to  the efficacy comparisons of Arms A and B 
in Cohort 1 which are the primary/secondary objectives of the study. Separate descriptive statistics 
in Cohort 2 will be used to report the efficacy of zanubrutinib in Arm C.   
10.2.1  Analysis Sets   
The Intent to Treat analysis set  (ITT) includes all enrolled subjects who are assigned to a treatment 
arm. The Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort 1  will be the primary analysis set  used for 
efficacy analyses.  
The Relapsed/Refractory analysis set  (a subset of the ITT analysis set ) includes all randomized 
subjects with at least 1 prior line of therapy as determined by [CONTACT_82550].  
The Safety analysis set  includes all subjects who received any dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib.  
Subjects will be assigned to the treatmen t arms as treated. The S afety  analysis set  will be used for 
all safety analyses.  
The Per -Protocol analysis set  (PP) includes subjects who received any dose of study medication and 
had no major protocol deviations.  Criteria for exclusion from the PP analys is set will be determined 
and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis.  The PP  analysis set  will be the 
secondary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
The PK analysis set  includes all subjects who have at least one post -dose zanubrutini b 
concentration.   
10.2.[ADDRESS_1184987] Disposition  
The number of subjects enrolled, treated, prematurely discontinued from study drug (defined as 
those who discontinued study drug due to any reason except for progressive disease) and those with 
major protocol deviation s will be counted by [CONTACT_2939].  The primary reason for study drug 
discontinued will be summarized according to the categories in the eCRF.  The end of study status

Page 93 (alive, dea d, withdrew consent or lost to follow -up) at the data cutoff date will be su mmarized using 
the data from the eCRF.  
Major protocol deviations will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_338546].  
10.2.3  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_852190] s using descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables include age, weight, vital 
signs, time since initial WM diagnosis; categorical variables include sex, age group (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 
years), race, disease stage, ECOG -PS, prior line of thera py for WM (0 vs. 1 -3 vs. >3 prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), geographic region, MYD88/CXCR4  gene mutation status, presence of extramedullary 
disease (yes vs. no), baseline bone marrow involvement (< 50% vs. ≥  50%), WM IPSS (low, 
intermediate, high), and β2 microglobulin (≤3 mg/ L, vs. >3 mg/ L). 
10.2.4  Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary drug codes.  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical The rapeutic Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic classification.  Prior and 
concomitant medications will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_852191].  Prior medications will be defined as medications that stopped before the first dose of 
study drug.  Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that (1)  started before the first 
dose of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on 
or after the date of the first dos e of study drug up to [ADDRESS_1184989]’s last dose.  A listing 
of prior and concomitant medications will be included in the CSR of this protocol.  
10.2.5  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Comparison of the primary endpoint CR/VGPR rate  in Cohort  1 assessed by [CONTACT_852192] -sequence procedure under the  null and alternative 
hypotheses as follows:  
H0: RR A=RR B 
Ha: RR A>RR B 
where RR A is the CR/VGPR rate in Arm A ( zanubrutinib ) and RR B is the CR/VGPR rate in Arm B 
(ibrutinib ).   
Testing for above hypotheses will be performed in the Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set  first at 
1-sided alpha of 0.025.   If the result is in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set is statistically 
significant, the primary objective has been met and further testing will be performed in the ITT 
analysis set  at 1-sided alpha of 0.025.

WT/missing) and prior line of therapy  (1-3 vs. >3 for Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set analysis and 
0 vs 1-2 vs >3 in ITT analysis) will be performed for hypothesis testing at the 0.025 level (1 -sided) 
in the  corresponding analysis set of Cohort 1 .   
A CMH 95% stratified confidence interval (CI ) of rate difference (RR A-RR B) with each rate 
weighted by [CONTACT_852193]/Refractory analysis set  and the ITT analysis set , respectively . A Clopper -Pearson 95% CI 
of CR/VGPR rate within each arm will be constructed  for the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set and 
the ITT analysis set , respectively . 
The primary efficacy analysis in Cohort [ADDRESS_1184991] method will also be performed in the sensitivity analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
If the primary efficacy analysis is statistically significant in Cohort 1, secondary endpoints will be 
tested in the analysis set where the null hypothesis for primary efficacy endpoint is rejected.  
MRR  
MRR will be tested for non -inferiority of Arm A vs Arm B.  The null and alternative hypot heses of 
MRR are set as follows:  
H0: MRR A-MRR B≤-8% 
Ha: MRR A- MRR B>-8% 
where MRR A is the major response rate in Arm A ( zanubrutinib ) and MRR B is the major response 
rate in Arm B ( ibrutinib ) based on respective analysis sets .   
MRR will be compared between Arms A and B.  It will be analyzed using the same methods as 
described in the primary endpoint.  A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test of rate difference 
adjusting for stratification factors (CXCR4 status [WHIM vs WT/missing] and prior line of therapy  
[1-3 vs >3 for Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set  analysis and 0 vs 1 -2 vs >3 in ITT analysis set  
analysis ]) will be performed at the  0.025  level (1 -sided).  Equivalently, the 2 -sided 95% CI for the 
weighted rate difference (weighted by [CONTACT_852194]) will be constructed to examine whether it excludes -8%.  Furthermore, superiority can 
be claimed if the lower limit excludes 0.

Page 95 Justification of non -inferiority margin  
The same non -inferiority margin will be used for both ITT and Relapsed/Refractory analysis sets.  
Since no randomized trial has been conducted in WM, the ibrutinib treatment benefit over placebo 
can only be estimated from the single -arm ibrutinib Phase 2 tr ial in which the MRR is 0.73 with 
95% CI (0.60, 0.83).  As a ≥ 50% reduction of IgM is impossible without treatment, MRR can be 
considered 0% in the placebo treated subject.  Therefore, the lower bound of 95% CI (i.e., 60%) can 
be used as the treatment effect of ibrutinib over placebo (M1).  A NI margin of 8% (M2) is 
proposed assuming 86.7% of the ibrutinib benefit over a placebo is retained. With close to 90% of 
the ibrutinib effect preserved, the 8% NI margin in MRR is clinically justified.   The loss of the 
ibrutinib treatment benefit is well within the clinically acceptable range.   It is worth noting that the 
NI of MRR will only be performed after the superiority of zanubruti nib over ibrutinib in CR/VGPR 
rate, which is closely correlated with MRR, has been demonstrated.  Hence, a numerically higher 
MRR in zanubrutinib is certainly expected if the NI test of MRR is to be performed.  The inclusion 
of the NI test of MRR is mainly  based on the sample size consideration in a rare disease setting 
where statistical significance might not  be shown in a superiority test with a clinically meaningful 
MRR difference (e .g., 12% higher MRR in zanubrutinib over ibrutinib) in 150 randomized  
relapsed/refractory  subjects.  
Best overall response (BOR) which is defined as the best response recorded from cohort assignment 
date until data cut or start of new antineoplastic treatment.  Subjects with no post -baseline response 
assessment (regardless of r eason) will be considered non -responders for best overall response.  The 
proportion and its corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for each of the response categories (CR, 
VGPF, PR, Minor Response , SD, and PD) will be presented.  
Other secondary endpoint anal yses:  
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be analyzed at the time of the primary analysis of VGPR/CR 
rate. In addition, subjects will continue to be followed for PFS  events after the primary analysis of 
VGPR/CR tate, until the final analysis of PFS. Durin g this period, the sponsor will keep maintaining 
trial integrity according to the Data Integrity Protection Plan (DIPP). Timing of the final analysis of 
PFS will be specified in the statistical analysis plan . 
Distribution of PFS will be estimated using the  Kaplan -Meier (KM)  method  per treatment  arm.  PFS 
censoring rule  will follow FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of 
Cancer Drugs and Biologics (2007) . 
A stratified log -rank test with CXCR4 and prior line of therapy as strata (CXCR4 status [WHIM vs 
WT/missing ] and prior line of therapy [1-3 vs. >3 for Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set  analysis and 
0 vs 1-2 vs >3 in ITT analysis set  analysis ]) will be used to test the PFS differences between Arms 
A and B.   The Cox regression will be used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of PFS A vs PFS B.  A 
95% CI of HR in PFS will be constructed.

Page 96 Median PFS, if estimable, will be estimated using the KM method.  Its 2-sided 95% CIs, if 
estimable, will be constructed with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.  KM estimates 
of PFS will be plotted over time.  The PFS rate at selected timepoints such as,  12, 18 and 36 
months, defined as the percentages of subjects in th e analysis set who remain alive and progression -
free at the specified time points, will be estimated using KM method along with the corresponding 
95% CI constructed using Greenwood’s formula.  
For responders with PR or above, t he duration of CR/VGPR /PR within subjects who have achieved 
major response will be analyzed similarly as PFS.  
Indications for initiation of therapy (see Table 4) will be documented for all subjects at baseline 
visit.  Symptoms that triggered treatment will be followed at during and end of treatment visits until 
resolution. Percentages of subjects wit h resolution of each and all baseline symptom(s) will be 
summarized; and compared between Arms A and B using Fisher’s exact test.  
Maximum decrease in percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes in bone marrow will be 
compared using analysis of variance mo del with treatment arm (A vs. B) as group variable. 
Percentage of subjects with decreased percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes after the 
start of study medication will also be compared using Fisher’s exact test. Percentages of subjects 
with resolut ion and/or reduction of pretreatment lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly according 
to CT scan will be summarized separately; and compared using Fisher’s exact test.

Extent of exposure to study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cycles received 
(number and percentage of subjects), duration of expos ure (days), cumulative total dose received 
per subject (mg), dose intensity (mg/day) and relative dose intensity.  
The number (percentage) of subjects requiring dose reductions, dose interruption, and drug 
discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized.  The  cycle in which the first dose 
reduction/interruption occurred will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Frequency of 
reductions and dose interruptions will be summarized by [CONTACT_10611].  
Subject data listings will be provided for all dosing records  and for calculated summary statistics.  
10.3.2  Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into standardized 
medical terminology using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®).  Adverse 
events wil l be coded to MedDRA® (Version 18.1 or higher) lower level term closest to the verbatim 
term.  The linked MedDRA® preferred term (PT) and primary system organ class (SOC) are also 
captured in the database.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug up to 
30 days following study drug discontinuation or was worsening in severity from baseline 
(pretreatment) or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.  Only those AEs that 
were treatment emerge nt will be included in summary tables.  All AEs, treatment  emergent or 
otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_3592].  A subject will be counte d only once by [CONTACT_852196]-CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_1184997] experienced more than 1 TEAE

temperature, weight) and changes from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_852198].  Vital signs will be listed by [CONTACT_3598].  
10.3.[ADDRESS_1184999] e Size Consideration  
The sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the primary endpoint CR/VGPR rate in 
the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort 1.  Assuming RR A=0.35 and RR B=0.15, seventy -five 
subjects per arm  (150 total)  provide a power  of 0.814 in testing RR A versus RR B in the 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort [ADDRESS_1185000] with a 
two-sided significance of 0.05.  Assuming MRR A=0.90 and MRR B=0.80, the power of 
demonstrating non -inferiority of za nubrutinib  in the Relapsed/Refractory analysi set  is 85.5 % when 
a NI margin of 0.08 is used.    
In addition to 150 replased/refractory subjects, approximately 20% (38) treatment -naïve subjects 
with MYD88MUT will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  
Assuming MYD88MUT  mutation is present in 90% of the enrolled subjects, a total of approximately  
[ADDRESS_1185001] 50  relapsed/refractory 
subjects  are randomized from Cohort 1, will be implemented in the study.  This analysis is for 
futility only. No recruitment stop is planned for this interim analysis. If futility is demonstrated in 
the interim analysis , enrollment will be halted and safet y and efficacy data will be further evaluated 
before making the decision of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852128]. Otherwise, the enrollment will be

Investigator attests that the information contained in the CRFs is true by [CONTACT_852203]. After final database loc k, the Investigator will receive a copy of 
the subject data from that site (e.g., paper, CD, or other appropriate media) for archiving the data at 
the study site.

Page 104 11.2.7  Drug Accountability  
The investigator or designee (i.e. , pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of 
all used and unused study drug.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study 
product (quantity and condition), subject dispensing records and returned or destroyed st udy 
product.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from BeiGene, quantities dispensed 
to subjects, including lot number, date dispensed, subject identifier number, subject initials  (if 
allowed) , the initials of the person dispensing the med ication, and quantities destroyed or returned 
to BeiGene . At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
study drug disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with BeiGene requirements.  At 
the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_2037], the study site will 
dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to 
these procedures.  If the site cannot meet BeiGene’s requirem ents for disposal, arrangements will be 
made between the site and BeiGene or its representative for destruction or return of unused study 
drug supplies.  
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_852204].   A patient diary will be provided to each subject to 
record the study drug dose taken each day. Any missed doses with explanation should be recorded 
in the diary. The diary should be returned to the site personnel  for review , and will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_852169] a regular basis.  
11.2.8  Inspections  
The investigator should understand that the facilities used for this trial and all  source documents for 
this trial should be made available to appropriately qualified per sonnel from BeiGene or its 
representatives, to IRBs/IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_1185011] be submitted to competent authorities and 
to the IRB/IEC  together with, if applicable, a revised model ICF  in accordance with local 
requirements. Written documentation of competent authorities (as applicable according to local 
requirements), IRB/IEC and required site approval must be obtained by [CONTACT_852205].

Page 105 Information on any change in risk and /or change in scope must be provided to subjects already 
actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand and sign each revised ICF 
confirming willingness to remain in the trial.  
11.3.2  Study Report and Publications  
A CSR will be prepared and provided to the regul atory agency(ies).  BeiGene will ensure that the 
report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study 
Reports (ICH E3).  Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases.  
As this is a multi -center stud y, the first publication or disclosure of study results shall be a complete, 
joint multi -center publication or disclosure coordinated by [CONTACT_456].  Thereafter, any secondary 
publications will reference the original publication(s).  
Each  investiga tor agrees to submit all manuscripts, abstracts, posters, publications and presentations 
(both oral and written) to the sponsor for review before submission or presentation in accordance 
with the clinical study agreement . This allows the sponsor to protect  proprietary information, 
provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the 
investigator, and ensure scientific and clinical accuracy.  Each investigator agrees that, in accordance 
with the terms of clinical study  agreement, a further delay of the publication/presentation may be 
requested by [CONTACT_852206]/presentation.   
If a written contract for the conduct of the study, which includes publication provisions i nconsistent 
with this statement is executed, that contract’s publication provisions shall apply rather than this 
statement.  
11.[ADDRESS_1185013] the following activities in conjunction with 
the investigator or study center personnel, as appropriate:  
 Return of all study data to the sponsor.  
 Data queries.  
 Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for unused study drug(s).  
 Review of study records for completeness.  
 Return of treatment codes to the sponsor.  
 Shipment of PK samples to assay laboratories.  
In addition, the sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study either at a single study center or at all study centers at any time for reasons including, but not 
limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non -compliance with this protocol, GCP, the clinical 
study agreement or applicable laws and regulations .  If the sponsor determines such action is

BGB -[ADDRESS_1185014] 2019  
 
                          
Page 106 needed, the sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons for taking such 
action) at that time.  When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notification to the investigator 
of the impending action prior to it taking effect.  
The sponsor will promptly inform all other in vestigators and/or institutions conducting the study if 
the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the regulatory 
authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If required 
by [CONTACT_5279], the investigator must inform the IEC/IRB promptly and provide the 
reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must be provided to the sponsor.  In addition, 
arrangements will b e made for all unused study drug(s) in accordance with the applicable sponsor 
procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the agreement 
established between the investigator and the spons or. 
11.[ADDRESS_1185015] the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file, and (2) subject 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, IRB/IEC, 
and governmental a pproval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum 
vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Subject clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_5280]/safety parameters independent of the CRFs) would include (although not be limited to) the 
following: subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original 
laboratory reports, ECG, Screening ECHO/MUGA, electroenceph alogram, X-ray, pathology and 
special assessment reports, consultant letters, Screening and enrollment log, etc.  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe and secure 
location.  The records must be maintaine d to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed (e .g., 
audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction 
with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel.  Where permitted by [CONTACT_306067]/ regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format 
other than hard copy (e .g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised 
before such action is taken.  The investigator must assure that all reproductions are legible, are a 
true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -[ADDRESS_1185016] applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_1212], or the sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the retention period will 
default to [ADDRESS_1185017] notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but 
not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of ownership of or 
responsibility for the records in the event  the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the 
documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to store these 
in sealed co ntainers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case 
of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, 
appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786].  
Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
When the CSR is completed, the sponsor will provide the major findings of the study to the 
investigator.  
In addition, details of the study drug assignment will be provided to the investigator to  enable 
him/her to review the data to determine the outcome of the study for his/her subject(s).  
The sponsor will not routinely inform the investigator or subject the test results, because the 
information generated from this study will be preliminary in na ture, and the significance and 
scientific validity of the results will be undetermined at such an early stage of research.   
11.6 Information Disclosure and Inventions  
All information provided by [CONTACT_852207] c enter 
as part of the study (other than a subject’s medical records) is the sole property of the sponsor.  
All rights, title, and interests in any inventions, know -how or other intellectual or industrial property 
rights which are conceived or reduced to prac tice by [CONTACT_852208] a result of the study are the sole property of the sponsor, and are hereby [CONTACT_852209].  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes ownership provisions inconsi stent 
with this statement is executed between the sponsor and the study center, that contract’s ownership 
provisions shall apply rather than this statement.

Page 115 Guidelines for specific clinical or laboratory circumstances:  
 
1. Baseline serum total IgM value above the central laboratory limit of quantitation  
 
If the baseline central laboratory serum total IgM value exceeds the upper limit of 
quantitation, the M -protein value, by  [CONTACT_165889], will be used for response 
determination throughout the study.  
 
2. Baseline serum total IgM value, by [CONTACT_165889], is not interpretable due to technical 
reasons  
 
If the baseline central laboratory serum total IgM value is not interp retable due to technical 
reasons, the central laboratory serum M -protein value will be used of response determination 
throughout the study. In cases where both the central laboratory total serum IgM and M -
protein values are not interpretable due to technic al reasons, the local serum total IgM (or 
local M -protein value, in cases where the local serum total IgM value exceeds the upper 
level of quantitation) will be used for response assessment throughout the study.  
 
3. Subjects with documented cryoglobulinemia  
 
For subjects with abnormal cryoglobulin result at Screening and confirmed by [CONTACT_852216], the local laboratory will retest for the presence of cryoglobulins prior to C1D1. The 
C1D1 sample will serve as the baseline. In addition, serum quantitative im munoglobulins 
should be retested using the residual cryoglobulin blood sample at the local laboratory, 
which should be collected and processed under warm conditions. Only when serum 
immunoglobulin cannot be quantified, serum immunoelectrophoresis sample wi ll need to be 
re-collected, processed, and analyzed at local laboratory under warm conditions. The blood 
samples (for cryoglobulin and serum immunoglobulins) should be collected and processed 
under warm conditions at the local laboratory throughout the stu dy to ensure that the same 
methodology is used throughout the study. The results for cryoglobulin and serum 
immunoglobulins would need to be recorded in the eCRF at all required visits. It is 
recommended that the blood samples (cyroglobulins/serumIgM/SPEP/ serum 
immunofixation) should be sent to central lab for analysis in addition to the local lab and 
collected and processed under warm conditions throughout the study.  
  
4. Plasmapheresis  
 
Subjects may undergo plasmapheresis, when clinically indicated, during the first two cycles 
of study treatment. A pre -plasmapheresis serum total IgM and M -protein must be obtained 
during the screening period, or the highest predose value (least confounded by 
[CONTACT_535602]) will serve as the baseline value for response assess ment throughout the 
study. IgM response and nadir determination should be at least [ADDRESS_1185033] 
plasmapheresis procedure). Subjects requiring plasmapheresis after Cycle [ADDRESS_1185034] 7 consecutive days and there is a rapid rise in serum IgM level (or an increase in known 
extramedullary disease for resonse that includes extramedullary disease assessment) leading 
to an “apparent” response of PD. The period that this is applicable begins on the day of the 
first missed dose and ends when the subject has IgM levels or extramedullary disease that no 
longer qualify as “apparent ” PD* (e.g. there is a drop in IgM level below 25% and 500 
mg/dL from nadir) or the subject has a confirmed response of PD*, whichever comes first.  
When assigning response for IgM flare after drug is restarted, the following conditions must 
be met:  
 If IgM levels and/or known extramedullary disease continues to decrease from peak IgM 
level (off study drug) or peak (highest SPD) in extramedullary disease, when drug was 
held, PD will not be recorded. If, however, while on study drug the IgM level or SPD 
increa ses above the peak level that occurred when drug was held, and IgM level or SPD 
increase is confirmed with a repeat assessment [ADDRESS_1185035] PD and IgM will not be assessed.  
 If, after 10 weeks of study drug re -initia tion (to allow for fluctuation), the next assessed 
IgM level shows either a continued rise at each timepoint from the initiation of the drug 
hold or no decrease from the previous visit, then a serum IgM level obtained [ADDRESS_1185036] be used to confirm PD. PD will be confirmed if the subsequent IgM 
measurement is greater than or equal to the previous IgM assessment (first IgM 
assessment post 10 weeks study drug initiation). The response assessment of PD* will be 
recorded at the first visit 10 weeks after  study drug re -initiation.  
 Similarly, if apparent PD was due to an increase in extramedullary disease and after 
[ADDRESS_1185037] 
visit 10 weeks after study drug re -initiation.  
 If during drug re -inititation the IgM level decreases and then rises at any timepoint 
there after:  
o If at the time of the IgM rise, the IgM level still qualifies as PD* then a 
confirmatory serum IgM level obtained [ADDRESS_1185038] be used to confirm 
PD*. PD will be confirmed if the subsequent IgM measurement is greater than or 
equal to the previ ous IgM assessment (IgM at the time of the initial IgM rise 
following IgM decrease). The response of PD will be recorded at the time of the 
initial IgM rise following the IgM decrease.   
o If at the time of the IgM rise, the IgM level does not qualify as PD*  then continue 
response assessments as described above.  
Of note, in the setting of multiple drug holds the nadir continues to be the lowest achieved 
serum IgM level on study for purposes of response assessment.  
 
PD* is defined per protocol as an increase in serum IgM level of at least 25 percent and 
500 mg/dL from lowest nadir

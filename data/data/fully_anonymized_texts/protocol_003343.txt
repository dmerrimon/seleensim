Title of Study : A placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized trial to evaluate  the effect of 300  mg of 
inclisiran sodium given as subcutaneous injections in subjects with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)  and elevated  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) 
Phase of Development:  III 
Study Centers:  Multicenter , international study (appro ximately 100 sites) ; specific list is maintained by 
[CONTACT_1034].   
Central Facilities: This list is maintained by [CONTACT_76605]: Approximately 400 eligible subjects will be randomized ( 200 subjects 
randomized to inclisiran and 200 subjects randomized to placebo). Assuming about a 5% drop out  rate, 
the sample size will be approximately 380 subjects that are evaluable for efficacy across the placebo and 
inclisiran dose groups . Due to faster than expected enrol lment, actual enrol lment was 482 subjects.  
Principal Investigator: 
[INVESTIGATOR_391932]:  The estimated study period for the study will be [ADDRESS_1223189] complete s the study . 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
The primary objective is t o evaluate the effect of inclisiran treatment on : 
 LDL -C levels at Day  510 
 Time adjusted percent change in LDL -C levels from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 
levels  
 
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives are t o evaluate  the effect of inclisiran on : 
 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  (PCSK 9), total cholesterol, ApoB , and non -high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL -C) at Day 510  
 LDL -C and PCSK9 levels over time  to Day 540  
 Mean maximum reduction in LDL -C levels  
 LDL -C and PCSK9 levels over time in individual subjects  
 Other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins, apolipoproteins

infarction (MI), and non -fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic)  
 Response of LDL -C reduction by [CONTACT_875854] -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4 
Confidential   4 Methodology: This study is a Phase III, placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized study  in 
400 subjects  with HeFH and elevated LDL -C despi[INVESTIGATOR_76578] -C lowering 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_875844] y, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous inclisiran injection(s).  
Subjects will be screened and approximately 400 eligible subjects will be randomized: [ADDRESS_1223190] subcutaneous ( SC) injection 
of investigational product  (inclisiran or placebo ). After the first SC injection , the subject will be 
observed in the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_1223191]  in-clinic visits on 
Day 30, Day 150, Day  330, and Day 510 for follow -up and limited laboratory  assessments.  The end of 
study (EOS) visit will be conducted on Day 540.  
Pharmacodynamic  assessments  will be collected at various visits and  include LDL -C levels  as well as 
other  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_6520] (eg, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL -C, non -HDL -C, very low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol [VLDL -C], apolipoprotein A1 [Apo-A1], apolipoprotein B [ApoB ], 
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], high sensitivity C -reactive protein [hsCRP ], and PCSK9 ). 
All subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetic analyses, unless underlying causal mutations 
of HeFH are well documented by a validated specialized laboratory. A blood sample will be collected, 
preferably during screening, only from subjects who sign a separate consent for pharmacogenetics.  
Safety assessments including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), electrocardiograms 
(ECGs ), concomitant medic ations, and safety laborator y parameters will also be collected during the 
study.  In addition,  formation of anti-drug antibodies ( ADA ) and further characterization of ADA will be 
evaluated . 
End of study evaluations will be conducted at the Day [ADDRESS_1223192] long -term safety and efficacy data for inclisiran .  
The independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will  review safety data after the first [ADDRESS_1223193] completed 1 month follow -up. Thereafter 
the IDMC will review safety data every 3 months until the end of study ( EOS ) unless requested 
otherwise  by [CONTACT_31849] . A recommendation may be taken to stop or amend the study at any of these 
reviews.

Other Secondary Endpoints:  
 Mean maximum percentage change in LDL -C 
 Absolute c hange from baseline to Day 510 in PCSK9, total cholesterol, ApoB and non -HDL -C 
 Absolute c hange and  percentage change in LDL -C from baseline to each assessment time up to 
Day 540 
 Individual responsiveness defined  as the number of subjects reaching on treatment LDL -C 
levels of <25  mg/dL, <50  mg/dL, <70  mg/dL, and <100  mg/dL at Day 510  
 Proportion of subjects in each group with greater or equal to 50% LDL -C reduction from 
baseline  
 Absolute c hange and percentage chan ge in other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and

 Proportion of subjects in each group who attain global lipid targets for their level of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  (ASCVD ) risk 
 
Expl oratory Endpoints : 
 Incidence of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest , non-fatal MI, and non -fatal stroke (ischemic 
and hemorrhagic)  
 Response of LDL -C reduction by [CONTACT_875855]:  Adverse event , SAEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory values (hematology, coagulation testing, 
chemistry, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected at specified visits through 
the EOS visit (Day  540). Cardiovascular events will be reported as A Es for the compi[INVESTIGATOR_391935], resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, and non -fatal 
stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic). In addition , formation of ADA and subsequent characterization of 
ADA will be evaluated for the investigational product . 
Statistical Methods : 
Sample Size and Power  
The sample size calculation was performed with the assumption (which was based on the observed 
results from a Phase II study ) that the difference in change from baseline between the active dose group 
and the placebo group for LDL -C will be no less than 30 mg/dL, with a standard deviation of 20 mg /dL.  
Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size will be approximately [ADDRESS_1223198] 380 
evaluable subjects, will provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction of LDL -C levels in the 
inclisiran group compared to the placebo group at one -sided significance level of [ADDRESS_1223199] power calculations.  
Primary End point Analysis:  
The family -wise type I error rate is controlled at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1223200]. 
If the null hypothesis is rejected at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025 and superiority of 
inclisiran over placebo is claimed, then the time adjusted percentage change in LDL -C from baseline 
after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be tested, also at one -sided significance level o f alpha=0.025. 
Mixed -effect models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be performed on the percent change in 
Inclisiran   ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment [ADDRESS_1223201] the superiority of inclisiran over placebo. Missing data will be 
imputed using a multiple imputation washout model. Results will be combined using Rubin’s method. 
Time adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be 
calculated 
from the MMRM with imputed data discussed above. Linear combinations of the estimated 
means after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be used to compare treatments. Results will be combined 
using Rubin’s method.
Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis : 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will not be tested if either one of the co-primary efficacy endpoints’  
null hypothesis failed to be rejected. 
The Hochberg procedure  will be applied to control the family -wise type I error rate at one-sided 
significance level of alpha=0.025  for the key secondary endpoint s. The key secondary endpoints will be 
analyzed using the same methods  as in the primary efficacy analysis.  
Other Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint Analysis:  
The analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will include descriptive and graphical 
summaries by [CONTACT_1570] . Least squares  means (95% Confidence Intervals) will be provided for 
continuous variables. Nominal p -values will be provided when applicable.  
Interim Analysis:  
No interim analysis will be performed in this study.

The Medicines Company is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference 
(RNAi) therapeutic, Inclisiran for Injection (subcutaneous [SC] use) for the treatment of 
hypercholesterolemia. This protocol describes a study to evaluate the effect  of inclisiran  
treatment on low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C) levels at Day  510. This study will 
be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) including the Declaration of 
Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
1.1. Backg round  
1.1.1.  Disease Overview  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76572], cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death  
worldwide, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually [ WHO , 2016 ]. Eighty percent of all  
CVD deaths are due to coronary heart disease (CHD) o r strokes. Elevated low -density  
lipoprotein associated cholesterol (LDL -C) is a major risk factor for the development of 
CVD  [Grundy et al, 2004; Go et al, 2014 ]. Lowering LDL -C has been shown to reduce the 
risk of  death or heart attack and within the range of effects achieved so far, the clinical risk 
reduction is  linearly proportional to the absolute LDL -C reduction [ Baigent et al 2005 ]. 
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  
predominantly statins, to red uce LDL -C and the associated risk of death nonfatal myocardial  
infarction (MI) and nonfatal stroke or associated events [ Decision Resources Group, 2015 ]. 
Yet residual risk for cardiovascular (CV) events remains and statins are associated with well -
known  limitations. First, not all patients reach LDL -C levels associated with optimal 
protection against  clinical events [ Davidson et al, 2005; Foley et al, 2003; CTT Collaborators 
et al, 2008; Foody et al, 2010; Baigent et al 2005 ]. Second, not all patients toler ate statins or 
are able to take statins at  sufficiently intensive doses. And third, observational studies have 
demonstrated that >50% of  patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than 6 months 
[Mann et al, 2010; Poluzzi et al, 2008 ]. 
There is an un met need for additional treatment options beyond currently available 
treatments for lowering of the LDL -C level to reduce cardiovascular risk.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76573], current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_875847] -C remain insufficient in some patients 
[Fitzgerald et al, 2017; Barkas et al 2015; Jameson et al, 2014; Jones et al, 2012 ]. This is 
particularly true in patients with pre -existing CHD and/or diabetes or a history of familial 
hypercholest erolemia (FH), who are at the highest risk and require the most intensive 
management [ Davidson et al, 2005 ]. 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  (PCSK9 ), a member of the serine protease 
family, plays a key role in controlling the levels of low -density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) 
on the surface of hepatocytes [ Khorova, 2017 ]. PCSK9 is expressed and secreted into the 
bloodstream predominantly by [CONTACT_4852], binds LDLR both intracellularly and extracellularly 
and promotes the lysosomal degradation of  these receptors in hepatocytes, [ Lakoski et al, 
2009; Mousavi et al, 2009 ] thereby [CONTACT_76609] -C levels. Loss of function 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment [ADDRESS_1223217] been found to lead to increased LDLR in liver, reduced serum 
LDL -C, and a lower risk for C HD [ Berge et al, 2006; Cohen et al, 2006; Kotowski et al, 
2006; Zhao et al, 2006 ] with no apparent negative health consequences. [ Zhao et al, 2006; 
Hooper et al, 2007; Horton et al, 2009 ]. 
Recently developed and approved PCSK9 -blocking monoclonal antibodie s reduce circulating 
PCSK9 levels and lower LDL -C levels. Preliminary reports indicate that treatment with such 
antibodies can lead to reduction of cardiovascular events compared with placebo [ Hooper et 
al, 2005; Navarese et al, 2015; Zhang et al, 2015; Ro binson et al, 2015; Sabatine et al, 2015 ]. 
Results from  the first completed  large CV outcomes trial (FOURIER) were  reported in 
March 2017. Repatha® (evolocumab) significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. 
The study in approximately 27,000 pati ents with clinically evident atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391938]) and the key secondary com posite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal 
MI or nonfatal stroke) [ Sabatine et al, 2015 ]. 
The data from PCSK9 blocking antibodies such as Repatha® (evolocumab) and Praluent® 
(arilocumab) are very encouraging. However, these products are dosed SC every  2 to 4 
weeks necessitating up to 26 injections per year [ Hooper et al, 2005; Navarese et al, 2015; 
Zhang et al, 2015 ]. In contrast, one injection of inclisiran is anticipated to be given three 
times in the first year and every 6 months thereafter.  
1.1.2.  PCSK9 B iology and Target Rationale  
PCSK9 is a membe r of the subtilisin serine prote ase family. Proprotein convertase subtilisin 
kexin type 9 is predominantly expressed by [CONTACT_391956]-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression [ Mousavi et al, 2009 ]. 
LDL-C levels in plasma are markedly elevated in humans with gain of function mutations in 
PCSK9, classifying them as having severe familial hypercholesterolemia [Abifadel et al, 
2003]. Data f rom genetic association studies have identified loss of function alleles in human 
PCSK9 that result in lower PCSK9 protein levels and lowe r LDL-C levels [Zhao et al, 2006 ; 
Hooper et al, 2007 ; Horton et al, 2009 ]. In one publi shed study, heterozygous individuals 
(carrying a single copy of a loss of function PCSK9 mutation) had significantly lower LDL- C 
with median levels of approximately 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) [ Cohen et al, 2006] . Over a 
15-year period of retrospective data analysis, this sustained lowering in LDL-C levels 
translated to an 88% lower risk of risk for CHD. Follow-up publications describe two adult 
individuals that are compound heterozygous for loss of function alleles of PCSK9. These 
individuals lack detectable plasma PCSK9 protein, have LDL -C levels ≤20 m g/dL, and yet  
are otherwise healthy [ Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007 ]. Additionally, recent human 
clinical trials with PCSK9 blocking antibodies have shown significant lowering of LDL-C in 
healthy volunteers and across a range of high cardiovascular (CV)-risk populations and with 
elevated LDL-C both with and without statins [ Banerjee et al, 2012 ; Dias et al, 2012 ; Milazzo 
et al, 2012;  Raal et al, 2012 ; Roth et al, 2012 ; Stein et al, 2012 ; Sullivan et al, 2012; Hooper 
et al, 2013 ]. Two monoclonal agents to inhibit PCSK9 are currently approved in Europe and 
North America.  Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials have further confirmed that PCSK9 is 
a validated drug target whose inhibition results in LDL-C lowering and

Confidential  20 significant outcomes benefit without ot herwise negatively impacting overall health  [Ridker et 
al, 2017; Sabatine et al, 2017 ]. 
1.1.3.  Mechanism of RNA Interference  
Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for regulating 
gene expression that is mediated by [CONTACT_76611] (siRNAs). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], synthetic 
siRNAs are 19-base to 25-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex 
with a two- to four-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3’ ends. Such siRNAs can be 
designed to target an endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene. When 
introduced into cells, the guide (or antisense) strand of the siRNA loads into an enzyme 
complex called the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex. This enzyme complex subsequently 
binds to its complementary mRNA sequence, mediating cleavage of the target mRNA and the 
suppression of the target protein encoded by [CONTACT_76612] [Elbashir et al, 2001].  
Since unmodified siRNAs are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_875848] [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ], various formulations are 
currently used to target their distribution to tissues, and to facilitate uptake of siRNAs into 
the relevant cell type. One approach that has been used successfully in vivo, in animal 
models (in cluding in rodents and nonhuman primates) and humans employs intravenous 
delivery of siRNA in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ; 
Morrissey et al, 2005 ; Geisbert et al, 2006 ; Judge et al, 2006 ; Zimmermann et al, 2006 ; 
Coelho et al , 2013 ; Tabernero et al, 2013 ]. Another approach for liver -specific gene silencing 
is subcutaneously administered siRNA conjugated to a N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
carbohydrate ligand [ Ashwell and Morell, 1974 ]. Conjugation of a triantennary GalNAc 
ligand to an siRNA enables hepatocyte binding and subsequent cellular uptake via the 
asialoglycoprotein receptor, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and down 
regulation of hepatic proteins. Single and multiple doses of subcutaneously administered 
siRN A-GalNAc conjugates have been used to target transthyretin (TTR) mRNA for the 
treatment of TTR -mediated amyloidosis. ALN -TTRCSC has been found to be generally safe 
and well tolerated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in over 40 healthy volunteers and  
18 subjects with familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy and senile systemic amyloidosis 
[ALN -TTRSC -001; EudraCT 2012 -004203 -12; and ALN -TTRSC -002; EudraCT 
2013 -002856 -33]. 
1.2. Inclisiran, an siRNA Therapeutic for Hypercholesterolemia
Inclisiran sodium is a chemically synthesized small  interfering RNA (siRNA) 
double -stranded oligonucleotide, covalently linked  to a ligand containing three 
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues.  
Inclisiran is a long -acting, subcutaneously delivered, synthetic siRNA directed ag ainst 
PCSK9 that is conjugated to triantennary GalNAc carbohydrates. These carbohydrates bind 
to abundant liver -expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), leading to inclisiran 
uptake specifically into hepatocytes.  
When introduced into the hepatocyte, inclisiran engages the natural pathway of RNAi by 
[CONTACT_76613] -induced silencing complex (RISC), enabling it to cleave 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  21 messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules encoding PCSK9 specifically. The cleaved PCSK9 
mRNA is degraded and thus unavailable  for protein translation, which results in decreased 
levels of the PCSK9 protein. A single siRNA -bound RISC is catalytic and cleaves many 
transcripts and the duration of action is anticipated to be longer than other mechanisms.  
1.2.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
Inclisiran was specifically designed with molecular and biochemical characteristics to 
minimize untowa rd side effects whic h are reflected by [CONTACT_391957]. For example, GalNAc ligands were added to the RNA strands in order 
to target inclisiran to receptors on hepatocytes, thereby [CONTACT_391958]. This is highlighted by [CONTACT_391959], inclisiran exposure in other tissues was 36- to 1076-fold lower than liver. 
In addition, once inclis ira n is inside the cell, there is a low likelihood of off-target binding 
because inclisiran is sequestered within RISC and guided to its complementary PC SK9 
mRNA sequence which is highly conserved across diverse ethnic and geographical 
populations. The spe
cificity of the active antisense strand of inclis iran wa s determined by 
[CONTACT_746] a comprehensive search against the human transcriptome using an exhaustive 
“brute-force” algorithm implemented in the python script ‘BruteForce.py’. The search  
revealed 20 possible off-target transcripts, two of which are not normally expressed in liver 
cells. The other 18 transcripts were subsequently assayed in an in vitro study to 
experimentally assess their response to inclisiran. The 18 gene transcripts were transfected 
into liver cells along with inclisiran and expression analysis indicated a ≥45-fold difference 
between the “on target” suppression of PCSK9 and the suppression of any of the “off-target”  
transcripts. 
Inclisir an was well tolerated in all studies. The most common findings were related to the 
expected pharmacological effects of inclisiran on lipid profiles and histopathological findings 
of vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of monkeys a nd the 
presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats. These 
microscopic findings are not considered adverse because they are not associated with 
changes in clinical pathology parameters. Liver function enzymes were only mini mally to 
mildly increased, and were reversible following treatment -free periods, and there were no 
changes in urinalysis or urine chemistry parameters.   
Additional non -clinical studies are ongoing or planned.  
1.2.2.  Clinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical pharmacology  
Inclisiran is inactive in plasma and acts directly in the hepatocytes leading to inhibition of 
PCSK9 protein synthesis. After SC administration of inclisiran, peak plasma concentrations 
were observed by [ADDRESS_1223218] 
elimination half -life (t 1/2) of 7.3 hours and dose -proportional increase in exposure parameters 
of maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the curve (AUC). There was no 
accumulation of inclisiran plasma concentrations following  multiple weekly, biweekly or 
monthly dosing. Mean fraction excreted unchanged in the urine was around 25%. In vitro 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  22 studies using hepatic P450 metabolic enzymes showed that inclisiran neither inhibited nor 
induced common hepatic metabolic pathways.  
Addit ional clinical pharmacology studies are ongoing or planned . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical  
Inclisiran has been studied in one completed Phase I (ALN -PCSSC -001) study (N=69) and 
one Phase II (ORION -1) study (N=501); dosing has completed in ORION -[ADDRESS_1223219] -PCSSC -001: Doses up to 800 mg as a single dose and two doses or more doses up to 
500 mg were administered . 
ORION -1: Up to 500 mg as a single dose on Day 1 or two doses on Day 1 and Day 90 (100 
mg, 200 mg or 300 mg) were administered . 
The effic acy data generated in these two studies show robust and prolonged reductions in 
PCSK9 and LDL -C levels in plasma. PCSK9 was reduced from baseline by [CONTACT_129743] 75%. 
Mean LDL -C was reduced by [CONTACT_129743] 50% with one dose of 300 mg and 55% with two doses 
of [ADDRESS_1223220] is still significant 210 days after a single dose and remains at around 
a mean of 50% when measured 120 days after the second dose given at Day 90 in the 
ORION -1 study. Other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_391939] a 
drug acting on PCSK9 with a potentially beneficial modification of the overall atherogenic 
lipid profile  [Ray et al, 2017 ]. 
To date, no clinically relevant safety concerns have arisen in these studies of inclisiran; 
collection and analysis of data up to Day 360 is ongoing in the ORION -1 (Phase II) study.  
Based on these efficacy and safety data, 300 mg has been selected as the dose for subsequent 
clinical studies with a dosin g at Day 1, Day 90, and every 6 months subsequently .  
Safety:  
In the ongoing Phase II (ORION -1) study with a follow up of more than 210 days, single 
doses of up to 500 mg on Day 1 or two doses (100 mg, 200 mg or 300 mg) (given 90 days 
apart) were also gene rally well tolerated and the majority of adverse events (AEs) in 
inclisiran -treated subjects with ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents were mild or moderate 
in intensity. Injection site reactions have been reported in around 5% of subjects receiving 
either one  or two doses of inclisiran  [Ray et al, 2017 ]. The emerging safety profile will be 
further evaluated in the ongoing Phase II (ORION 1) study and the subsequent planned 
studies.  
Efficacy:  
In the ongoing Phase II (ORION -1) study, in all single dose groups, m aximal LDL -C 
reduction was observed between Day 30 and Day 60. At Day 30 the mean LDL -C reduction 
from baseline was approximately 45% to 55% and at Day 60 was 44% to 51% in a dose 
dependent fashion with doses of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg. Mean LDL -C remain ed 
significantly reduced from baseline over the course of the study in all inclisiran groups to 
Day 210.

The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  23 In all groups, maximal reduction is PCSK9 levels was observed at Day 30 and the mean 
reduction from baseline was 66%, 71% and 74% in the 200 mg, 300 m g and 500 mg groups 
respectively.  
In all double dose groups, maximal LDL -C reduction was observed after the second dose 
given at Day 90. At Day 120 the mean LDL -C reduction from baseline was 41% to 55% in a 
dose dependent fashion with doses of 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg.  
At Day 180, the mean LDL -C reduction was between 35% and 53% in a dose dependent 
fashion across the dose range.  
For subjects treated on Day 1 and Day 90, maximal reduction in PCSK9 levels was observed 
at Day 120 and the mean reduction from baseline was 60%, 73% and 75% with the [ADDRESS_1223221] of 
care as background therapy (including maximally -tolerated statin therapy and/or other 
LDL -C lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) when administered inclisiran or placebo . Reduction of LDL -C 
has been associated with reduced CV risk both by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_391940]. Injection site reaction is the only event known to be attributed to inclisiran treatment. 
The safety profile of inclisiran observed to date is considered acce ptable for this clinical trial.  
An expanded risk -benefit summary is provided in the IB  [Investigator ’s Brochure ].
1.4. Study Rationale  
1.4.1.  Study Rationale  
The overall safety data from inclisiran in nonclinical studies a nd clinical data from the 
Phase  I and Phase II  study  (ORION -1), and multiple PCSK9 antibody studies demonstrated 
that potent lowering of PCSK9 is well  tolerated in human subjects  and support the dose and 
dosing schedule proposed in this Phase III study .  
1.4.2.  Dose Rationale  
Previous s tudies have shown that  a 300 mg dose of inclisiran sodium is well tolerated and 
provides maximum efficacy (ie, doses higher than 300 mg did not provide additional efficacy 
in LDL -C lowering). The [ADDRESS_1223222] and sustained reduction in PCSK9 (and LDL -C) and has the 
potential to tackle the lack of adherence generally seen in the chronic management of 
subjects with  hypercholesterolemia.  The 300 mg dose of inclisiran will be used for the entire 
duration of this study for subjects receiving inclisiran.  
1.5. Study Population 
This study will include male or female subjects ≥18 years of age with a history 
of Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeF H) and elevated LDL-C.

A blood sample will be collected, preferably during screening, only from subjects who sign a 
separate consent for pharmacogenetics. Samples will be processed as described in the 
Laboratory  Manual and stored. Genetic assess ment will be performed by [CONTACT_875861]. This  assessment will determine if there is a different response for LDL -C

treatment . An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or  disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening, ie , the subject w as, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate  
risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death),  
 Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the subject's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of 
life, 
 Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908],  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is another medically significan t event where medical and scientific judgement should 
be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered  serious 
reactions, such as important medical e vents that might not be immediately life 
threatening or result in  death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_875849]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391946] . Any suspected transmission 
via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse  
reaction.  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and sever e AEs. Severity is an estimate or 
measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of 
adverse subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not 
necessarily be considered serious and a serious AE n eed not be considered severe. For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an 
SAE. On the other hand, a MI that may be considered minor could be an SAE if it prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

Examples include, but are not limited to, reports of  pregnancy/lactation exposures with or 
without any AEs related to the parent or child ; medication errors – actual and potential ; 
accidental exposure ; suspected transmission via an investigational product  of an infectious 
agent ; drug interaction.  
8.2. Collection and Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Pre-existing Conditions  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations for an illness or disease that existed at 
baseline and did not aggravate during the study should not be reported as AEs.  
8.2.2.  Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_210923] 3 -point scale below:  
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.  
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal  daily activity.  
8.2.3.  Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship between the AE and the investigational product  will be assessed by [CONTACT_2329] a 
binary assessment. The investigator should determine whether there is a ‘ Reasonable 
possibility’ or ‘No re asonable possibility’ that the investigational product  caused the event  
based on the definitions below . 
Reasonable possibility  - There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
investigational product  caused the AE. There is evidence to su ggest a causal relationship 
between the investigational product  and the AE.  
No reasonable possibility  - There is no reasonable possibility that the administration of 
the investigational product  caused the AE. There is no temporal relationship between the 
investigational product  and event onset, or an alternative etiology has been established.  
8.3. Requirements For Additional Safety Data  Collection  
8.3.1.  Special Situations  
Special Situations designated for this study include :

Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size will be approximately [ADDRESS_1223265] 380 evaluable subjects, will provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction 
of LDL -C levels in the inclisiran group  compared to the placebo group at one -sided 
signif icance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1223266] power calculations . 
10.2. RANDOMIZATION  
Subjects will be screened and approximately 400 eligible subjects will be randomized  by [CONTACT_259126]: [ADDRESS_1223267] will receive four subcutaneous (SC) injection s 
of blinded inclisiran or placebo on Day 1, Day 90 , Day 270, and Day 450 . 
10.3. General Statistical Considerations and Definitions  
10.3.1.  General Statistical Methods  
All study -collected data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070], 
graphs, and/or raw data listings. Descriptive statistics for conti nuous variables will include 
number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), 
minimum (min) and maximum (max) values. Analysis of categorical variables will include 
frequency and percentage . 
10.3.2.  Analysis Population  
The foll owing populations will be used for data analyses and/or presentation.  
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol  – Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  58 [IP_ADDRESS].  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
All subjects randomized into the study  will comprise the intent -to-treat (ITT) population . 
Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The ITT population will 
be used for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
All subjects who are randomized into the study, take any study medication and  have at least 
one post treatment lipid data measured. Treatment classification will be based on the 
randomized treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of investigational product  and have 
both the baseline and the 510 day follow -up LDL -C assessment  will comprise the modified 
intent -to-treat (mITT) population . Treatment classification will be based on the randomized 
treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Population  
All subjects who received at least one dose of  investigational product . Treatment 
classification will be based on the actual treatment received. This will be primary population 
for the safety analyses . 
10.3.3.  Analysis Windows and Baseline  
The observational period for the study includes  the screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), the 
treatment period (Day 1 to Day 510), and the EOS visit (Day 540) . Any event occurring 
beyond the defined observational period, even if collected on the eCRF , will not be included 
in the planned statistical ana lysis. However, all data, including that reported after the defined 
observational period, will be included in the subject data listings . 
Analysis windows will be defined to maximize the amount of data that are included in the 
analysis models. Full details will be provided in the SAP.  
Unless otherwise specified, for evaluations that are collected at multiple occasions prior to 
initiation of investigational product  administration , the latest evaluation will be considered 
the "Baseline" evaluation for analysis . 
10.3.4.  Missing Data Handling  
Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will have missing data imputed using multiple 
imputation techniques (a primary method and sensitivity/exploratory methods). The primary 
imputation method will utilize a washout model for subjects in the inclisiran arm where it 
will be assumed that early terminating inclisiran sodium  [ADDRESS_1223268] observed assessment (monotone missing data) return to baseline values. The 
baseline values will be randomly sampled from a population estimated using baseline data 
from all subjects. One sensitivity technique includes control -based pattern mixture models 
which utilize placebo data for monotone missing inclisiran sodium  300 mg treatment data. 
Additional sensitivi ty data imputation techniques will be utilized. Retrieved data will be

10.4.2.  Investigational Product  and Concomitant Medications  
Summaries of investigational product and each prior (pre -baseline) medication and 
concomitant (baseline or later) medication will be provided by [CONTACT_3148]. Separate 
summaries will b e provided for prior  medication use. Medications will be coded using the 
World Health Organization ( WHO ) drug dictionary. Subjects will be counted only once 
within each period by [CONTACT_12617].  
10.4.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
The ITT population will be the primary population for the efficacy analysis. Efficacy analysis 
will also be performed for the FAS and mITT population s as supportive analysis . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoint s are described in Section 3.3. 
The family -wise type  I error rate is controlled at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1223270]. If the null hypothesis is rejected at one -sided significance level of 
alpha=0.025 and superiority of inclisiran over placebo is claimed, then the time adjusted 
percentage change in LDL -C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be tested, 
also at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025.  
Mixed-effect models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be performed on the percent 
change in LDL -C from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_1223271] for treatment, visits, baseline value, interac tion between 
treatment and visits, and current use of statins or other lipid -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The 
Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation approach will be used with covariance 
structure set as “Unstructured”.  Missing data will be imputed using a multiple imputation  
washout 
model as noted in Section  10.3.4. A total of 100 imputed datasets will be created 
and results will be combined using Rubin’s method. Full details on the model and 
imputation  will be provided in the SAP. 
The time adjusted percen tage change in LDL -C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 
540 will be calculated from the MMRM with imputed data discussed above. Linear 
combi nations of the estimated means after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be used to

[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Sensitivity Analysis for Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
As noted in Secti on 10.3.4 , additional methods to impute and analyze data will be utilized as 
sensitivity/exploratory analyses for the co -primary endpoints. A MMRM wi thout any 
imputation (assuming data are missing at random) will also be performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will not be tested if either one of the co-primary efficacy 
endpoints’ null hypothesis failed to be rejected.
Key secondary and other efficacy endpoints are described in Section  3.4. 
Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis:  The Hochberg procedure will be applied to control the 
family -wise type I error rate at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025 for the key 
secondary endp oints. The key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same methods  
as in the primary efficacy analysis.  
The two -sided 95% confidence interval for least squares means  will be provided  for 
continuous variables . Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio will be 
provided for binary variables. Nominal p -values will be provided when applicable.  
Descrip tive and graphical summaries  by [CONTACT_391970].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory  Endpoints  
The exploratory  objectives are described in Section  3.5. 
The analysis of the exploratory  endpoints will be similar to that of the secondary endpoints . 
10.4.4.  Safety Analysis  
The safety objectives  of this study are to evaluate t he safety and tolerability profile of 
inclisiran.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) dictionary will be used for 
coding AEs . An AE (classified by [CONTACT_11702]) occurring during the investigational 
product  treatment p eriod will be counted as a treatment emergent AE (TEAE) either if it is 
not present at baseline or if it is present at baseline but increased in severity during the 
treatment period.  
The number (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs for each preferred te rm will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_57501] -organ class, by [CONTACT_57501] -organ class and severity, and by [CONTACT_57501] -organ 
class and relationship to investigational product . If more than one event occurred with the 
same preferred term for the same subject, the subject will be co unted only once for that 
preferred term using the most severe or related occurrence for the summary by [CONTACT_926], or 
relationship to investigational product , respectively.

Confidential  73 APPENDIX B: REQUIREMENTS FOR BAC KGROUND LIPID 
LOWERING TREATMENT  
There should be no plans at the time of screening and randomization to modify the dose of 
statin or other lipid lowering medication such as ezetimibe for the duration of the trial. 
Unless the background lipid lowering treatment exceptions described below are met, subjects 
must have been treated with one of th e following highly effective statins at the specified 
daily doses and at a stable dose, preferably for [ADDRESS_1223290] 30 days, prior to 
screening for the study:  
 
1. atorvastatin, 40 or 80 milligrams (mg) once a day;  
2. rosuvastatin, 20 or 40 mg, once a  day; 
3. simvastatin [ADDRESS_1223291] has been on that dose for >1 year,  
80 mg, once a day.  
 
Combination medications that contain atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin components 
described at the aforementioned doses will be permitted.  
 
Background lipid lowering treatment exceptions  
 
The following background lipid lowering treatment exceptions are permitted:  
 
1. Lower doses of statins due to partial statin intolerance:  
Subjects may be on a lower dose of one of the highly effective statins d escribed above if 
there is documented intolerance to any one of them (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or 
simvastatin) at the aforementioned doses. Intolerance to any dose of any statin must be 
documented as historical adverse events attributed to the statin in  question, in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
 
2. Regulatory limitations:  
Subjects may be on a lower dose of one of the highly effective statins described above if the 
highest locally approved dose for one of the stated statin s is lower than those doses shown 
above (eg, in some countries, atorvastatin [ADDRESS_1223292] locally approved 
dose).  
 
3. Alternative statins:  
Subjects may be treated with other statins (pravastatin, fluvastatin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2830], or 
lovastatin), different from the highly effective statins listed above, if there is documented 
intolerance to any two different highly effective statins (atorvastatin, ro suvastatin, 
simvastatin) at the lowest available daily dose for at least one of those highly effective 
statins. Intolerance to any statin must be documented as historical adverse events attributed to 
the statin in question, in the source documentation and eCRF.

4. No background statin therapy:  
Subjects may be enrolled who are only on non -statin lipid lowering therapy, if complete 
statin intolerance has been documented. Subjects with complete statin intolerance must be 
unable to tolerate at least two stati ns: one statin at the lowest available daily dose AND 
another statin at any dose. Intolerance to any statin must be documented as historical adverse 
events attributed to the statin in question, in the source documentation and eCRF. The sole 
exception, for which a subject may participate in the study with documentation of intolerance 
to only one statin, is a documented history of rhabdomyolysis attributed to that statin .

Confidential  75 APPENDIX C: GENETIC INFORMED CON SENT  
Purpose and Selection of subjects:  
The purpose of the genetic test is to confirm the subject’s diagnosis of HeFH and to assess  
the response of inclisiran on LDL-C reduction by [CONTACT_875869]. 
The 
genetic research analysis is an optional test that will be offered to all patients. 
Speci men collection:  
For subjects that agree to participate, a blood sample will be taken at any visit throughout the 
study and the Central lab will utilize a validated, next generation sequencing pi[INVESTIGATOR_875852] (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP1) that are 
associated with familial hypercholesterolemia to confirm the subject has HeFH.   
Blood samples taken for this optional research will not be used for any additional study or 
purpose and be destroyed one year after the main study  is complete. A single -coded system 
will be used for all blood samples during the study and will be taken without using names of 
the subjects, medical record numbers, or other common identifiers that would allow for the 
linking of the code to the subject’s  identity.   The blood sample for the genetic research
analysis will be labeled with the same code number.  
Results:  
Currently, the information obtained from the genetic testing does not contain clinical or 
therapeutic implications for the individual subjec t.  Results will only be reported to the 
attending physician, Sponsor, and patient (if requested). No additional follow up beyond 
what is required in the main study is required.  
Withdraw of consent:  
A subject can withdraw their consent for participation in  this optional portion of the study at 
any time.  If consent is withdrawn when the blood sample has been taken but before it is sent 
for genetic research analysis, the study doctor will arrange to have it destroyed.   If consent is 
withdrawn after the blood  sample has been sent for genetic research analysis, The Medicines 
Company and the study doctor will ensure that the blood sample and any DNA that has been 
extracted from it are destroyed.   If consent is withdrawn after the genetic research analysis 
has al ready been performed, The Medicines Company is not obliged to destroy the results of 
this research.   In this case only the blood sample and any DNA extracted will be destroyed.

Confidential  76 APPENDIX D: RECOMMENDED NEUROLOG ICAL EXAMINATION  
MOTOR FUNCTION  
When assessing motor function, from a neurological perspective, the assessment should 
focus on arm and leg movement. You should consider the following:  
1. Muscle size  
2. Muscle tone  
3. Muscle strength  
4. Involuntary movements  
5. Posture, gait  
Symmetry is the most i mportant consideration when identifying focal findings. Compare one 
side of the body to the other when performing your assessment.  
Assessment of a Conscious Patient  
Limb assessment of a conscious patient usually involves a grading of strength.  
Grade Str ength  
Grade 
strength  Description  
[ADDRESS_1223293] gravity and resistance; normal muscle 
strength  
[ADDRESS_1223294] gravity and a moderate amount of 
resistance; slight weakness  
[ADDRESS_1223295] gravity only, moderate muscle weakness  
2 Full range of motion when gravity is eliminated, severe weakness  
1 A weak muscle contraction is palpated, but no movement is noted, very 
severe weakness  
0 Complete paralysis  
NB: In a conscious patient, the single best test to quickly identify motor weakness is the 
“drift test”. Have the patient hold their arms outward at [ADDRESS_1223296] the patient close their eyes and hold the arms for a couple o f 
minutes. “Drifting” will occur if one side is weak.  
Lower Extremities  
Assess the patient in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Ask him/her to separate both legs to test for hip 
abduction. Then ask the patient to bring the legs back together to test for hip adduction. Sit 
the patient on the side of the bed to assess knee flexion and extension. Ask the patient to flex 
and extend the knee. If able to do this, apply resistance as these movements are repeated. 
Test plantar and dorsiflexion by [CONTACT_391980]. Remember to compare  the left side to 
the right side.  
 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol  – Global Amendment 4
Confidential  77 Upper Extremities 
Assess ability to flex elbow (biceps) and straighten (triceps). Assess ability to raise shoulders 
and return to a resting position. Assess wrist flexion and extension. Test each function with 
resistance. For focused upper extremity assessment, assess each digit for flexion, extension 
and lateral movement.  
Assessment of an Unconscious Patient 
Upper Extremities 
1.Observe the patient for spontaneous/involuntary movement .
2.Apply painful stimuli to elicit a motor response (start with central pain; move to
peripheral pain if no response occurs).
3.Assess for paralysis of the limb by [CONTACT_875870]. If
one limb is paralysed it will fall more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_301983].
Lower Extremities 
1.Observe for spontaneous/involuntary movement .
2.Apply painful stimuli to elicit a motor response. Begin with central pain. Nailbed or  
peripheral pain can be attempted if the patient doesn’t respond to central pain (caution 
needs to be used when interpreting peripheral pain as it may stimulate spi[INVESTIGATOR_391952]).
3.To assess for p aralysis of the one limb you can position the patient on their back and
flex the knees so that both feet are flat on the bed. Release the knees simultaneously.
If the leg falls to an extended position with the hip externally rotated, paralysis is
present. The normal leg should stay in the flexed position for a few seconds and then
gradually assume its previous position.
SENSORY FUNCTION  
When assessing sensory function remember that there are three main pathways for sensation 
and they should be compared bi laterally:  
1.Pain and temperature sensation .
2.Position sense (proprioception) .
3.Light touch .
Pain can be assessed using a sterile pin. Light touch can be assessed with a cotton wisp. To 
test proprioception, grasp the patient's index finger from the middle joint and move it side to 
side and up and down. Have the patient identify the direction of movement. Repeat this using 
the great toe.

Confidential  78 Sensory Tests:  
A number of tests for lesions of the sensory cortex can be done. Examples include  the 
following :  
Stereognosis : The ability to recognize an object by [CONTACT_265295]. Place a common object in
the persons hand and ask them to identify the  object.
Graphesthesis: “Draw” a number in the palm of the person’s hand and ask  them to  
identify 
the number.
Two -Point Discrimi nation: Simultaneously apply two pin pricks to the skin surface.
Continually repeat the test while bringing the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_265261], until the
individual can no longer identify two separate stimuli. The finger tips are the most
sensitive location for recognizing two point differences while the upper arms, thighs
and back are the least sensitive.
Extinction: Touch the same spot on both sides of the body at the same time (eg,  the
left and right forearms. Ask the individual to describe how many spots are being
touched. Normally, both sides are felt; with sensory lesions the individual will sense
only one.
Point Locations: Touch the surface of the skin and remove the stimulus quickly. Ask
the individual to touch the spot where the sensation was felt. Sensor y lesions can
impair accurate identification, even if they retain their sensation of light touch.
TONE and REFLEXES  
Upper motor neuron problems (brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) are associated with increased tone. 
Lower motor neuron problems are associated with decr eased tone.  
Look at the muscles on each side of the body in pairs. Assess for symmetry of bulk.  
Evaluation of the stretch reflexes assesses the intactness of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_391953]. The limb should be relaxed while applying a short and snappy blow with a 
reflex hammer. Hold the hammer loosely in a relaxed manner, making a wrist action. Allow 
the hammer to bounce.  
Reflex responses:  
0 No response  
1+ Diminished, low normal  
2+ Average, normal  
3+ Brisker than normal  
4+ Very brisk, hyperactive  
Lower motor neuron disease is associated with 0 or 1+, upper motor neuron disease is 
associated with 3+ or 4+.

Confidential  79 Biceps Reflex (C5 – C6):
Support the forearm on the examiners forearm. Place your thumb on the bicep tendon 
(located in the f ront of the bend of the elbow; midline to the anticubital fossa). Tap on your 
thumb to stimulate a response.  
Triceps Reflex (C7 -C8): 
Have the individual bend their elbow while pointing their arm downward at 90 degrees. 
Support the upper arm so that the arm hangs loosely and “goes dead”. Tap on the triceps  
tendon located just above the elbow bend (funny bone).  
Brachioradialis Reflex (C5 -C6):  
Hold the person’s thumb so that the forearm relaxes. Strike the forearm about 2-3 cm above 
the radial styloid process (located along the thumb side of the wrist, about 2-[ADDRESS_1223297]). Normally, the forearm with flex and supi[INVESTIGATOR_265263].  
Quadriceps Reflex (Knee jerk) L2 – L4:
Allow the lower legs to dangle freely. Place one hand on the quadriceps. Strike just below the 
knee cap. The lower leg normally will extend  and the quadriceps will contract.  
If the patient is supi [INVESTIGATOR_050]: Stand on one side of the bed. Place the examiners forearm under the 
thigh closest to the examiner, lifting the leg up. Reach under the thigh and place the hand on 
the thigh of the opposite leg, just above the knee cap. Tap the knee closest to the exami ner, 
(the one that has been lifted up with the examiners forearm).  
Achilles Reflex (ankle jerks) L5 – S2:
Flex the knee and externally rotate the hip. Dorsiflex the foot and strike the Achilles tendon 
of the heel. In conscious patients, kneeling on a chai r can help to relax the foot.  
Heel Lift : 
While the patient is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bend the knee and support the leg under the thigh. Have the leg 
“go dead”. Briskly jerk the leg to lift the heel of the bed. Normally, the leg will remain  
relaxed and the heel will slide upward; increased tone will cause the heel and leg to stiffen 
and lift off the bed.  
Babinski Response:  
Dorsiflexion of the great toe with fanning of remaining toes is a positive Babinski response. 
This indicates upper motor neuron disease. It is normal  in infants.  
CEREBELLAR FUNCTION  
The cerebellum is responsible for muscle coordination and balance on the same side. To test 
cerebellar function use the following tests:  
1.Finger to finger test: have the patient touch their index finger to your index fin ger
(repeat several times).
2.Finger to nose test: perform with eyes open and then eyes closed.
3.Tandem walking: heel to toe on a straight line .

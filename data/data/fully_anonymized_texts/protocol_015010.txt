   4 Protocol Synopsis  
Background : Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating complication of critical 
illness. Once AKI is established, treatment is largely supportive and no intervention has been 
found to restore kidney function or improve overall survival. Renal replacement therapy (RRT), 
usually in the form of hemodialysis, is frequently needed to manage patients with severe AKI. 
Such patients have an in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393431] 50%  with d elays in RRT 
initiation impli cated as a possible contributor . A recent meta -analysis suggest ed that earlier 
initiation of RRT may improve sur vival, but this is based on data derived overwhelmingly from 
observational studies. Our group recently completed a multi -centre pi[INVESTIGATOR_393432]. Patient recruitment and follow -up, as well as patient safety , were successfully 
demonstrated during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t phase of this research program.  
 
Objectives : The objectives of this trial are to determine whether, in critically ill patients with 
severe AKI, randomization to accelerated initiation of RRT, compa red to a conservative 
strategy consistent with standard c are, leads to :  
1. Improved survival  (primary outcome)  at 90 days ; and  
2. Recovery of kidney function  (principal  secondary outcome) , defined as independence from 
RRT at 90 days  
 
Study Population:  We will enroll  2,[ADDRESS_493862] a reasonable 
likelihood of ultimately requiring RRT. Recruitment will occur at centres in Canada , the [LOCATION_003], 
Australia, New Zealand , the [LOCATION_006], Austria , and potentially several other countries.  
 
Inclusion criteria (all need to be fulfilled for eligibility) :  
1- Age ≥ 18 years  
 
2- Admission to a n critical  care unit  (CCU) 
 
3- Evidence of kidney dysfunction [serum creatinine ≥100 µmol/L (women) and ≥  130 µmol/L 
(men) ] 
 
4- Evidence of severe AKI defined by [CONTACT_120187] 1  of the following  3 criteria :  
       i) ≥ 2-fold increase in serum creatinine from a known pre -morbid baseline or during the 
current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; OR  
       ii) Achievement of a serum creatinine ≥  354 µmol/L with evidence of a minimum 
increase of 27 µmol/L from pre -morbid baseline or during the current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
OR 
       iii) Urine output < 6.0 mL/kg over the preceding 12 hours  
 
 
Exclusion criteria (any of the following factors  will result in ineligibility) : 
1- Serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L  
 
2- Serum bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L  
 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   5 3- Presence of a drug overdose that necessitates initiation of RRT  
 
4- Lack of commitment to ongoing life support (including RRT)  
 
5- Any RRT within the previous 2 months (either acute or chronic RRT)  
 
6- Kidney transplant within the past 365 days  
 
7- Known pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393433], defined by [CONTACT_393463] d 
glomerular filtration rate < 2 0 mL/min/1.73 m2  
 
8- Presence or clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_393434], rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103020], 
vasculitis, thrombotic microangiop athy or acute interstitial nephritis  
 
9- Clinician(s) caring for patient be lieve(s) that immediate RRT  is absolutely mandated  
 
10- Clinician(s) caring for patient beli eve(s) that deferral of RRT  initiation is mandated  
 
The patient or substitute decision maker will be asked to provide consent within [ADDRESS_493863] , enrollment by [CONTACT_393464]/delayed consent will need to 
be documented within 12 hours of the above criteria being met. The patient will be excluded if 
consent cannot be obtained (or enrollment by [CONTACT_393464]/delayed consent cannot be 
documented) during this time window.  
 
Interventions  
Accelerated RRT initiation (experimental arm) : A dialysis catheter will be placed and RRT 
initiated as soon as possible and  no more than [ADDRESS_493864] RRT initiation (control arm) : In the absence of kidney function recovery, the  
initiation of RRT will be permitted if one  of the following develops : serum potassium  ≥ 6.0 
mmol/L;  pH ≤ 7.20 or serum bicarbonate  ≤ 12 mmol/L ; evidence of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] , 
based on a PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤ 200 and clinical perception of volume overload ; and/or  persistent AKI 
> 72 hours following the time of randomization . Once a decision is made to start RR T, a 
dialysis catheter will be placed and RRT initiated as soon as possible.  
 
All aspects of RRT (i.e. RRT modality, dose, anticoagulation) administered to patients in both 
treatment arms will follow guidelines that reflect local practice and usual standard s of care.  
 
Outcomes  
Primary outcome:   
All-cause m ortality at  90 days . 
 
Secondary outcomes : 
1 - RRT dependence at 90 days among surviving patients.  
2 - Composite of death or RRT dependence at 90 days . 
3 - Estimated glomerular filtration rate among patients alive at Day 90.  
4 - Albuminuria at Day 90 . 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   6 5 - Major adverse kidney outcomes, defined as death, RRT dependence or sustained 
reduction in kidney function  (defined as eGFR < 75% baseline eGFR) at 90 days . 
6 - Mechanical ventilation -free days  throug h day 28. 
7 - Vasoactive therapy -free days  through day 28. 
8 - ICU-free days through day 28. 
9 - Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] -free days through day 90.  
10 - Death in ICU, at 28 days, and in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
11 - EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L (a measure of health -related quality of life and patient utility) at day 90 
and at 1 year among survivors.  
12 - Health care costs through day 365 . 
13 – Vital status and RRT dependence at 365 days among survivors . 
 
Implications : 
The optimal timing of RRT initiation is an existing knowledge gap and a clear priority for 
investigation. With the successful completion of the STARRT -AKI pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], the feasibility and 
relevance of the proposed interventions has been established. It is now time to definiti vely 
evaluate whether earlier/pre -emptive/ accelerated RRT initiation is associated with enhanced 
survival as compared to a conservative strategy for initiation of RRT, which is driven by 
[CONTACT_393465] .

   7 SECTION 1. BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 Scope of the clinical problem  
In critically ill patients who require support in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, the 
development of acute kidney injury (AKI) is common. Recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_393435] 67% of patients.1-4 For critically ill patients with more severe forms of AKI, renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) , also known as  dialysis , is frequently employed.5 For these individuals, RRT 
initiation often results in a considerable escalation in both the complexity and associated costs 
of care.6 Moreover, th ese critically ill patients  experien ce substantial morbidity, including non -
recovery of kidney function and RRT dependence,7-9 and excess mortality, with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393436] -
fatality rates commonly exceeding 50%.5,10 
 
Many aspects of RRT delivery to critically ill patients with AKI remain uncertain resulting in 
heterogeneity in the prescription and delivery of acute RR T.11,12 Life threatening scenarios 
such as severe hyperkalemia, profound non-lactate -related metabolic acidosis , and severe 
fluid overload resulting in respi[INVESTIGATOR_393437]. In such situations, the need to initiate RRT is unequivocal.  However, in 
the ICU, patients with severe compromise of kidney functio n without these complications  are 
commonly encountered . The optimal time for initiating RRT in patients without a life -
threatening complication of AKI is unknown.  
 
Initiatin g RRT earlier in critically ill patients with AKI may confer better control of uremia, acid -
base homeostasis, electrolyte imbalances, extracellular volume accumulation and systemic 
inflammation. The earlier initiation of RRT would also prevent the development of a life -
threatening complication of AKI such as a hyperkalemia -associated  arrhythmia.  Intuitively,  the 
earlier initiation of RRT  in the absence of life -threatening complications may confer a variety of 
benefits  and is supported by [CONTACT_393466], mostly derived from 
observational studies .13,14 As a result, this practice has become common and endorsed by [CONTACT_393467][INVESTIGATOR_46830] . On the other hand , there is no high quality evidence to support the notion that  
the initiation of RRT - in the absence of a life -threatening complication of AKI – modifies 
clinically important outcomes. This problem is compounded by [CONTACT_393468].[ADDRESS_493865] of the observational 
studies did not consider patients with AKI who did not receive RRT. T here is a possibility that 
with a strategy of  supportive management and the introduction of RRT only when a life -
threatening complication supervenes,  some patients with severe AKI might recover kidney 
function spontaneously  without ever starting RRT . As a result, widespread adoption of a 
clinical strateg y of early RRT commencement might expose patients , some needlessly,  to the 
risks of RRT while inflating costs.  
 
As a consequence, there is a critical knowledge gap in evidence to guide the ideal 
timing and circumstances for initiation of RR T in critically ill patient s with AKI . The 
Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN), an international working group comprised of experts from 
both nephrology and critical care, identified the question , “When should RRT be initiated, 
and does timing affect outcome?”  as the highest -ranked  priority research topic by [CONTACT_393469] .17 Noting the absence of evidence  in this area, t he 
recently -released Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   8 Guideline for AKI recommended the pursuit of research  to “Determine [if] early vs late start 
of RRT….results in improved outcomes (eg, mortality, evolution to chronic kidney 
disease stage 5) in AKI patients.”18 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  
(NICE)  in the [LOCATION_008] recently issued a statement, as part of its set of Guidelines on 
AKI noting that “A prosp ective study is needed of adult inpatients with acute kidney 
injury AKIN stages 2 and 3, who are likely to need renal replacement therapy within a 
given timeframe (for example, 72 hours), but have no urgent need for therapy.”[ADDRESS_493866] of care; on the other hand, the absence of 
superiority of an accelerated RRT strategy will justify a more conservative approach to RRT 
initiation thereby [CONTACT_393470]. As a result, o ur proposed trial will 
have a meaningful clinical impact irrespective of its findings.  
 
1.2 Study objectives  
The principal research questions for the proposed trial are:  
In critically ill patients whose course is complicated by [CONTACT_393471], and who do 
NOT have urgent clinical indications to commence RRT, does the accelerated initiation of 
RRT, compared with initiation of RRT using standard indications and clinical judgment , lead to  
1) A lower risk of  mortality at 90 days  (primary outcome) ? 
2) A lower likelihood of persistent RRT dependence at 90 days  among survivors  
(principal  secondary outcome) ? 
This proposed trial is intended to be the definitive guide for clinical practice and address one of 
the most pressing and controversial questions in the field of Critical Care Nephrology.  
 
1.3 Consensus regarding the need for a trial  
The acute delivery of RRT to critically ill patients with AKI is common practice; yet there have 
been controversies regarding the optimal delivery of RRT for these patient s that have been 
clarified in recently completed randomized trials. These have largely focused on the delivered 
dose/intensity of RRT,20-[ADDRESS_493867] suggested that earlier RRT initiation may 
improve outcomes. Gettings et al performed a retrospective single centre study of trauma -
related AKI where a serum urea of 21.4 mmol/L at RRT initiation was used as a cut -off to 
discriminate between early and late RRT.27 This study found that “early RRT ” was initiated 
nine days earlier than “late RRT ”, and was associated with a shorter total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393438] ( 61% for “early” starters  vs 80% for “late” starters). In a multicentre 
retrospective  cohort  study, Liu et al  found that “early RRT ” (initiation when serum urea 
concentration was  < 27.1 mmol/L) was associated with a lower adjusted -risk of death.[ADDRESS_493868] -cardiac surgical patients with AKI  at a 
single -centre  to early (soon after meeting criteria for AKI) or late (following development of a 
classic indication for RRT)  RRT initiation.30 They found no difference in mortality; however, the 
trial was underpowered, and may not be generalizable due to  unexpected ly high survival and 
the preponderance of cardiac surgery -associated AKI . A recently published trial of 208 patients 
with community -acquired AKI was conducted at a single -centre in India .31 In the earlier  RRT 
arm, RRT commenced once urea exceeded 2 5 mmol/L or serum creatinine exceeded 61 9 
µmol/L irrespective of other AKI complications . In the usual -start arm, RRT was only initiated  in 
the setting of medically -refractory hyperkalemia, acidosis or volume overload or in the setting 
of uremic symptoms.  No difference in mortality or kidney recovery was observed. Applicability 
of these findings remains limited due to the young age of the patients (mean 42 y), the 
spectrum of illnesses associated with AKI (> 50% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_393439]) 
and the fact that most patients were not critically ill. Moreover, the trial was inadequately 
powered to detect a realistic treatment  effect for earlier RRT. In summary, the available 
evidence suggests that there may be clinical benefit to earlier RRT initiation in critically ill 
patients with AKI; however, clear inferences are limited by [CONTACT_393472], variable  definitions for study inclusion and limited generalizability to a broad spectrum of 
ICU patients.   
 
1.[ADDRESS_493869] a randomized trial of RRT timing in critically ill patients with AKI where patients 
would be randomized to either “early” or “standard -of-care” initiation of RRT. Amongst 
respondents, 94 % believed it would be ethical to randomize patients in such a trial , strongly 
suggest ing there is equipoise among Canadian intensivists  and nephrologists regarding the 
issue of timing of RRT initiation.[ADDRESS_493870] been confirmed in two further surveys 
conducted in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe.33,34 
 
1.5.2 Cohort studies  
In a secondary analysis of the multinational Beginning and Ending Supportive Therapy (BEST) 
for the Kidney study, we evaluated the timing of initiation of RRT in 1238 critically ill pat ients 
with AKI.29 Timing of RRT was stratified into “early” and “late” using several markers: serum 
urea (< and ≥  24.2 mmol/L, respectively), serum creatinine (< and ≥  309 µmol/L, respectively), 
urine output, and time from ICU admission  to start of RRT . In a multivariate analysis, after 
adjustment for demographics, baseline kidney function, illness severity, primary diagnosis, and 
contributing f actors for AKI, there was no association between serum urea  concentration at 
RRT initiation  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.91 -1.70; p=0.16). While higher 
serum creatinine  concentration  at the time of RRT initiation was associated with signific antly 
lower adjusted -mortality (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37 -0.69; p=0.001), late RRT defined relative to 
time from ICU admission (≥  5 days) was associated with higher adjusted -mortality (OR, 1.95; 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   10 95% CI, 1.30 -2.92; p=0.001). Furthermore, the duration of RRT, the likelihood  of RRT 
dependence at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] , and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77076] -of-stay were greater when the interval 
from ICU admission to RRT initiation was prolonged.  
 
To characterize current Canadian practice, we performed a prospective cohort study to 
describe the characteristics of critically ill patients with AKI at the time of RRT initiation and 
their association with mortality at six intensive care units in Edmonton and Toronto (n=234).35 
At RRT initiation, median serum creatinine and urea were 331  μmol/L and 22.9 mmol/L, 
respectively. Oligo -anuria ( urine output <400mL/24hr) was present in 32.9 % and 92.2% had a 
positive fluid balance. Notab ly, only 16.2% had significant hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 
5.5 mmol/L) and 33.8% had important metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate ≤ 15 mmol/L) at 
RRT initiation. We found several factors at the time of RRT initiation to be independently 
associated w ith hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393440]: creatinine  < 332 μmol/L  (odds ratio 2.8, 1.5 -5.4), 
change in urea from ICU admission > 8.9 mmol/L (OR 1.8, 1.0 -3.4), urine output <82 mL/24hr 
(OR 3.0, 1.4 -6.5), fluid balance exceeding 3.0 L/24hr (OR 2.27, 1.2 -4.5) on the day prior to 
RRT initiation , Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score36 >14 (OR 2.3, 1.3 -4.3), and RRT 
initiation ≥4 days from ICU admission (OR 4. 3, 1.9-9.5). While these data provide insight into 
the clinical, phy siologic and laboratory parameters at the time RRT was initiated, there is no 
information on the factors clinicians used to decide when to initiate RRT. We performed an 
additional survey to clarify the triggers that clinicians used to start RRT in [ADDRESS_493871] common factors influencing the 
decision to start RRT were oligoanuria (72%), metabolic acidosis (48%), azotemia (34%), and 
pulmonary edema (29%). These data confirmed that the decision to initiate RRT is often 
influenced by [CONTACT_393473]; 79% of patients had two or more triggers for initiation 
of RRT. T hese data provided  key insights into the current standard -of-care for RRT initiation in 
Canada and  have been com plemented by [CONTACT_393474] -AKI program.38,[ADDRESS_493872] performed a systematic review and meta -analysis  examining timing of RRT initiation 
in critically ill patients with AKI .13 We included controlled studies that specifically focused on 
adult critically ill patients with AKI receiving RRT where timing was evaluated and mortality 
was reported. We identified 15 unique studies for inclusion (2 randomized trials, 4 prospective 
cohort studies, and 9 retrospective cohort studies) published between 1999 and 2010. Overall 
study quality was generally low. In a pooled analysis, early initiation of RRT was associated 
with a significantly reduced odds of death (OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28 -0.72) when compared to 
delayed or late RRT initiation amidst important heterogeneity ( I2 = 78%). We  believe that these 
findings, while limited in inference due to the observed heterogeneity, confirm  equipoise for a 
prospective randomized trial evaluating whether accelerated/early initiation compared to a 
conservative strategy for RRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI can impact patient 
survival and kidney recovery.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_493873] that confirmed the feasibility and safety of our 
protocol.40,41 We identified 132  individuals who met all the eligibility criteria and enrolled 101 
individuals (77 %; pre -specified target > 50% for enrollment of eligible patients) . The median 
time from eligib ility to initiation of RRT was 7 .4 hours in the accelerated arm and 3/48 (6%) 
participants commenced RRT beyond the specified 12-hour window for that treatment arm. In 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October [ADDRESS_493874] arm, 33/52 individuals (63 %) commenced RRT , 6 (12%)  died without  the initiation 
of RRT while the remaining participants  experienced recovery of kidney function and did not 
commence RRT. Among patients who did commence RRT,  the median time from eligibility to 
RRT in itiation was [ADDRESS_493875] 12 hours of study eligibility. Overall, adherence to the study protocol exceeded the pre -
specified target of > 90% in each study arm. All patients were followed to Day 90 (pre -
specified target > 95%). A careful review o f adverse events and severe adverse events did not 
reveal any tendency to harm in either study arm. An independent Data Safety Monitoring 
Board oversaw the trial and concluded that there were “…no study -related safety concerns 
that require report to the si te Ethics/Institutional Review Boards or  other regulatory authorities.”  
 
 
SECTION  2. TRIAL  METHODOLOGY  
 
2.1 Trial design      
This multicentre , open -label , randomized controlled trial will compare an accelerated (or 
early /pre-emptive ) approach to the initiation of RRT v ersus a conservative strategy of initiation 
of RRT as guided by  [CONTACT_64896] d indications and clinical judg ment  in critically ill patients with AKI. 
Two thousand eight hundred sixty six  (2,866 ) critically ill patients with evidence of severe AKI 
will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_493876]  RRT initiation.  
 
2.2 Eligibility criteria  
 
2.2.1 Screening overview  
Research coordinators will screen the ICU p opulation  at each of the participating sites. 
Screening sweeps will occur in the morning and afternoon. Individuals with signs of AKI who 
are not initially eligible for the trial will be re -screened as several of the conditions for eligibility 
are dynamic . On a pra ctical level, screening will begin by [CONTACT_393475]’s 
bloodwork. To meet preliminary eligibility criteria, sCr must exceed 100 µmol/L in women and 
130 µmol/L in men. The coordinator will only continue screen ing the patient record  if this sCr 
threshold is exceeded. If the other inclusion criteria are met and NONE of the exclusion criteria 
are met, the patient will be considered provisionally eligible . Once provisionally eligible, the 
clinicians  (Critical Care and/or Nephrology)  caring for the pa tient will be asked if they believe 
that either the immediate initiation of RRT is mandated or the deferral of RRT is mandated. If 
the answer is negative to both these questions, the patient will be  considered fully eligible and 
efforts to obtain consent will commence.  If a patient’s eligibility is excluded by a clinician but 
RRT has not yet commenced at the subsequent screening round, the patient may be 
reconsidered for participation in the trial , and the clinician re -approached about the need to 
initiate /defer RRT,  provided the patient still meets the other eligibility criteria.  
 
  
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   12 A suggested approach to identifying eligible patients is found below:  
 

 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October [ADDRESS_493877] a  minimal data set (demographic data, some base line lab values, receipt of RRT , and 
outcomes) on those patients who are provisionally or fully eligible at screening, but are 
excluded from participation due to  one of : 
 
a. Clinician(s) belief that either immedia te RRT OR deferral of RRT initiation is absolutely 
mandated (exclusion criteria 9 and 10) 
 
b. Inability to obtain consent within 12 hours of  the patient meeting eligibility criteria  
 
The collection of this minimal data set will enable comparisons between patients in the above 
groups with patients who ultimately participate in order to ensure that there are no fundamental 
problems with the trial 's generalizability .   
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_493878] be fulfilled at the time of screening assessment : 
 
1- Age ≥ 18 years ( Operational definition:  Patient’s age on the day of eligibility screening.)  
 
2- Admission to a critical care unit ( Operational definition:  Any unit where there is capability to 
administer invasive mechanical ventilation.)  
 
3- Evidence of k idney dysfunction ( Operational definition:  serum creatinine ≥100 µmol/L 
[women]  and  ≥ 130 µ mol/L [men]  based on most recent bloodwork available prior to 
screening  and that has not declined by > 2 7 µmol/L compared to the highest value recorded 
in the preceding 48 hours .) 
 
4- Evidence of severe AKI based on at least one of the following three criteria:  
 
i) ≥ 2-fold increase in serum creatinine (sCr) from baseline ( Operational definition:  The 
baseline sCr is an outpatient  reading within 365  days of the current admission date; if 
multiple pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393441], the one closest to the date of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393442].  If a n outpatie nt pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393443] [ADDRESS_493879] creatinine value 
obtained during the current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393444]. This 
criterion is met if the current sCr is ≥ 1 00% higher th an the baseline value.)  
 
ii) If current serum creatinine is ≥  354 µmol/L , this must be accompanied by  [CONTACT_110042] 
a minimum increase of 27 µmol/L from the baseline sCr. ( Operational definition:  If 
current sCr is > 354 µmol/L and the patient has experienced an increase of 27 µmol/L  
from the documented baseline, based on the definition delineated in i) for baseline 
sCr.)  
 
iii) Urine  output < 6.0 mL/kg over the preceding 12 hours .  
 
 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   14 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for inclusion criteria  
The inclusion  criteria are designed to identify a population of critically ill adults with severe AKI 
who have an increased likelihood  of requiring RRT at some point during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393445].   
 
Criterion 3, Evidence of kidney dysfunction:  This criterion will be used as an initial screen to 
identify patients with some degree of kidney dysfunction in whom RRT may be considered if 
the remainder of the criteria are met. It provides a useful entry po int for coordinators to screen 
patients quickly and only consider individuals further if there is an elevation in sCr.  
 
Criterion 4, Evidence of severe AKI:  Determination of severe AKI will be grounded in the 
staging  system outlined in the  Kidney Disease I mproving Global O utcomes (KDIGO) 
Guidelines  for Acute Kidney injury .18 This classification system stages AKI into three levels 
based on the extent of sCr elevation in parallel with the degree and duration of oliguria ; 
patients are classified based on th e worst finding (either sCr or oliguria). In order to identify 
patients with severe AKI in whom RRT may be contemplated, patients must have evidence of 
at least Stage 2 AKI, which constitutes either a doubling of sCr or urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hr x 
12 hou rs (adapted to < 6 mL/kg over preceding 12 hours for ease of screening) or if the sCr is 
above 354 µmol/L at the time of screening, evidence that the sCr rose by [CONTACT_2669] 27 µmol/L 
from baseline.  
 
2.2.3 Exclusion criteria   
Any one of the criteria below would be grounds for exclusion:  
 
1- Serum potassium  concentration   > 5.5 mmol/L ( Operational definition:  Based on last 
available bloodwork).  
       
2- Serum bicarbonate  concentration  < 15 mmol/L  (Operational definition:  Based on last 
available bloodwork).  
       
3- Presence of a drug overdose that necessitates initiation of RRT. ( Operational definition :  If 
noted in the chart or directly from the treating team as the primary reason for administering 
RRT.)  
 
4- Lack of commitment to provide RRT as part of limita tion of ongoing life support.  
(Operational definition : Critical care team has deemed the patient not to be eligible for 
escalation of life support, including the initiation of RRT, or substitute decision makers have 
declined offer of same.)  
 
5- Any RRT within  the previous 2 months. ( Operational definition:  If recorded in the medical 
chart by [CONTACT_393476].)  
 
6- Kidney transplant within the past 365 days. ( Operational definition:  As reflected in the 
medical chart.)  
 
7- Known pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393433], defined by [CONTACT_393477] e < 2 0 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a patient who is not on chronic RRT. 
(Operational definition:  The coordinator will review all documented se rum creatinine values 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October [ADDRESS_493880] to the admission date will be considered as the “baseline” and will be used to 
calculate the corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate using an on line calculator. A 
value of < 2 0 mL/min/1.73 m2 derived from the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]42 will be grounds for 
exclusion. The serum creatinine, age, sex, and race ( Black /non-Black) is entered into a 
calculator found at: http://www.qxmd.com/calculate -online/nephrology/ckd -epi-egfr. It is 
expected that a large number of patients will not have readily available pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393446]. In the cas e of a missing pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393447] , this exclusion cri terion will be 
considered to have  been  NOT  met.)  
 
8- Presence or strong clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_393434], rapi[INVESTIGATOR_393448], vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy (eg, t hrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, malignant hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis) or 
acute interstitial nephritis. ( Operational definition:  If explicitly described in the medical chart 
or strongly suspected as the cause of AK I by [CONTACT_393478].)  
 
IF THE PATIENT MEETS ALL OF THE ABOVE INCLUSION CRI TERIA AND NONE OF 
EXCLUSIONS 1 -8, THEN THE PATIENT IS DEEMED PROVISIONALLY ELIGIBLE  AND 
THE ATTENDING CLINICIANS WILL  BE APPROACHED BY [CONTACT_393479]  
 
9- Clinician(s) caring for patient believe(s) that immediate renal replacement therapy  is 
absolutely mandated.  (Operational definition:  The study team will sp eak to the Critical Care 
attending physician, and at relevant sites, the  Nephrology attending physician caring for the 
patient and ask if he/she agrees with the statement: “ Renal replacement therapy must be 
initiated  immediately in this patient.”  If at lea st one of the clinicians answers  “Yes”, the 
clinician will be asked to identify the primary reason for mandating the  immediate start of 
RRT.) 
 
10- Clinician(s) caring for patient believe(s) that deferral of renal replacement therapy  initiation 
is mandated.  (Operational definition:  The study team will speak to the Critical Care and , at 
relevant sites, the  Nephrology attending physician caring for the patient and ask if he/she 
agrees with the statement:  “ Renal replacement therapy must be deferred in  this pat ient.” If 
at least one of the clinicians answers  “Yes”, the clinician will be asked to identify the primary 
reason for mandating the  delay in initiation of RRT.) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for exclusion criteria  
Criterion 1:  Hyperkalemia may predispose to dangero us cardiac arrhythmias. As a result, 
randomization of a patient with hyperkalemia to standard RRT initiation may be unethical.  
 
Criterion 2:  Severe metabolic acidosis may impair normal cell functions and compromise 
sensitivity to vasopressor agents in pati ents who are hemodynamically unstable. As a result, 
randomization of a patient with significant metabolic acidosis to a strategy of standard RRT 
initiation may be unethical.  
 
Criterion 3 :  It is not ethical to withhold RRT in the presence of a dialyzable toxin.  
 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   16 Criterion 4 : Severe irreversible acute or chronic illness leading clinicians to curtail or not 
escalate care is grounds for exclusion as it is unlikely that the timing of RRT initi ation will have 
an impact on clinical outcomes in these individuals.  
 
Criterion 5 : The treatment effect of earlier RRT may be reduced by [CONTACT_393480] 2 months.  
 
Criterion 6 : The risk of acute graft rejection is greatest within 1 year following transplant and 
this condition is addressed primarily with enhanced immunosuppression.  
 
Criterion 7 : The prognosis of critically ill patients with severe chronic kidney disease may be 
disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_393481] (or any interv ention for this deterioration) and such patients are 
routinely excluded from intervention trials in AKI.20 
 
Criterion 8: Since the prognosis of these conditions will largely be guided by [CONTACT_393482][INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(e.g., relief of urinary obstruction, systemic immunosuppression), patients with AKI that is due 
to causes other than suspected  acute tubular necrosis will be excluded.  
 
Criteria 9 and 10: Even after all the above eligibility criteria have been satisfied, it is crucial for 
the relevant attending clinician (s) to be comfortable with randomization to either group as this 
reflects clinical equipoise.  
 
Note regarding exclusions 9 and 10: Discussions with the attending physicians 
following the achievement of provisional eligibility  are a crucial part of the enrollment 
process in this trial. Though patients may meet the study inclusion  criteria and have 
none of exclusions 1 -8, we are relying on clinician judgment to tell us whether a 
patient’s condition mandates immediate RRT initiation or alternatively, if a patient’s 
clinical condition is such that he/she is likely to have imminent ki dney function 
recovery. Both such patients should be excluded from this trial.  
 
This approach understandably entails some degree of subjectivity on the part of the 
attending physicians. The trial will allow clinicians to utilize a variety of clinical tools  to 
make their determination , as no single biomarker has emerged as a n adequately  robust 
predictor of AKI progression and the subsequent need for RRT. In patients with oliguric 
AKI, a patient’s response to a furosemide bolus is a frequently -employed progno stic 
tool of AKI progression in clinical practice; specifically, a limited response in terms of 
urine output (with varied definitions of what constitutes a “poor” response”) might 
suggest the patient is likely to require RRT or have AKI that will not recov er in the near 
future.  This diagnostic strategy,  named the “Furosemide Stress Test” has been 
standardized and evaluated by [CONTACT_393483].43,[ADDRESS_493881] found that a urine output of < 200 mL in the 2 hours that foll ow an intravenous 
furosemide bolus has strong sensitivity and specificity for AKI progression. Though not 
mandated by [CONTACT_20767], clinicians wishing to risk stratify prospective trial participants 
using this technique will be asked to follow the method outl ined in the  published  
studies (provided in the study Operations Manual ). For example, for a provisionally 
eligible patient who clinicians are reluctant to enroll in STARRT -AKI due to the 
possibility of imminent renal recovery, a low urine output in respons e to a furosemide 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   17 bolus (ie, a “positive furosemide stress test”) might change the physician’s impression 
regarding trial eligibility.  
 
   
2.3 Trial intervention  
 
2.3.1  Allocation of participants  
Participants will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_493882] initiation of RRT with variable 
block sizes  and stratified by [CONTACT_393484] a central randomization system t hat will be managed 
at the Applied Health Research Centre.  
 
2.3.2  Accelerated RRT initiation (experimental arm)  
A dialysis catheter will be placed and RRT initiated as soon as possible and within  12 hours of 
eligibility . This 12 -hour window includes the time needed to obtain consent  or, where 
permissible, to document enrollment by [CONTACT_393464]/delayed consent . 
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_493883] RRT initiation (control arm)  
This treatment arm comprises a strategy of conservative management with respect to RRT  
initiation and RRT will only be initiated in the presence of the criteria below:  
 
a) Persistent  severe  AKI defined as sCr that remains > 50% of  the value recorded at 
randomization  
 
AND  at least one of the following indications for RRT initiation:  
 
a) Serum potassium  ≥ 6.0 mmol/L,  or 
b) pH ≤  7.20 or serum bicarbonate ≤ 12 mmol/L , or  
c) Evidence of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], based on a PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤ 200 and  clinical perception 
of volume overload , or 
d) Persistent severe AKI  (sCr remains > 50% the value recorded at randomization) for > [ADDRESS_493884] RRT initiation arm  anytime at  the discretion of the attend ing clinician(s)  based on 
clinical judgment . The clinician will be asked to specify the primary reaso n for initiating RRT in 
the absence of meeting the trial -specified criteria . However, i nitiation  of RRT within 12 hours of 
eligibility  will be considered a  protocol violation and  the clinician will also be asked to provide 
the primary reason(s) for RRT commencement . The decision to initiate RRT in the standard 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October [ADDRESS_493885] to be approved by [CONTACT_393485] (s) involved in the 
patient’s care.   
  
Once a decision is made to start RRT, a dialysis catheter will be placed and RRT initia ted as 
soon as possible. In the standard initiation  group, it is expected that a proportion of participants 
may die before receiving RRT while others may experience recovery of kidney function thus 
obviating the need for RRT.  
 
2.3.4 RRT delivery in the STARRT -AKI Trial  
Other than the study intervention (i .e., differential timing of RRT initiation), all RRT delivered to 
patients in both treatment arms will follow an identical set of recommended guidelines that is 
compatible with contemporary clinical practice  as described in the study O perations Manual.  
 
2.3.5 Criteria for discontinuation  of renal replacement therapy  
Once started in either treatment arm, RRT will continue until one of the following 
circumstances is encountered:  
 
1- Death; or  
2- Withdrawal of life support in the context of a change in the goals  of care; or  
3- Kidney function recovery with no need for continued RRT as per the nephrologist’s or critical 
care physician’s judgment . Guidance regarding the presence of renal recovery is found in 
the Operations Manual.  RRT may be reinitiated at any  time according to the same prin ciples 
described  in the Operations Manual .  
 
2.4 Frequency and duration of follow -up 
Each participant will be followed for up to 90 days followi ng randomization, and where feasible, 
to one year from randomization using administr ative data.  
 
Patients randomized to accelerated RRT initiation:  After consent has been obtained from the 
patient or SDM  (or enrollment by [CONTACT_393464]/delayed consent documented) , patients will be 
assessed frequently  in order to ensure that the randomized intervention is correctly 
implemented (i .e., within 12 hours of eligibility). Study personnel will provide regular reminders 
to the clinical team until RRT is started. Even after [ADDRESS_493886]  RRT initiation  strategy : Clinical and laboratory data will be 
reviewed daily for [ADDRESS_493887] data 
on safety events  during this time period . Each participant will be followed to 90 days following 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   19 randomization and, where feasible, o verall follow -up (using administrative databases  and a 
phone call to ascertain quality of life ) will conclude at [ADDRESS_493888] susceptible to bias in an unblinded trial, is reliably 
captured and is of unquestionable clinical relevance. All -cause mortality has also been used as 
the primary outcome in all major trials involving RRT interventions in the ICU.20,21,23

2.5.4  Safety events potentially related to the central venous catheter (CVC) used for 
RRT 
The following events related, all felt to be clinically significant consequences of the 
receipt of the CVC used for RRT, will be recorded through Day 14 (specific details on 
ascertainment of each event are found i n the Operations Manual):  
 
1 - Hemorrhage  at the site of CVC insertion

5 - Hemothorax (for catheters placed in the internal jugular or subclavian positions)  
Defined as:  Blood in the pleural space following CVC insertion; fur ther qualified by 
[CONTACT_393489].  
 
[ADDRESS_493889] data on safety events with a focus on 
those re lated to the administration of RRT and the associated need for vascular access  as 
described above. The local research team will determine whether these events qualify as 
serious adverse events (see definition below).  
 
2.6.[ADDRESS_493890] definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) includes any adverse event that 
meets at least one of the following conditions:  
- is fatal (results in death)  
- is felt to be life -threatening  
- requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53306]  
- results in significant disability or incapacity  
 
For this study, a reportable SAE must meet the definition noted above and also be 
considered45: 
i. an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_164272] , defined as clinically significant and unexpected in the context of 
critical illness secondary to AKI,  AND;   
ii. an event that is at least possibly related to study procedures.  
 
For reportable SAEs that occur from the time of patient consent/enrollment until Day 14 , the 
following reporting procedur e applies:  
- Report using the Adverse Event  Form of the eCRF within [ADDRESS_493891] returned to baseline, or until progression has been stabilized. Follow -up 
will continue for the duration of the patient’s study participation . 
 
Local reporting requirements may  differ from those of the trial. The local investigator will be 
responsible  for reporting SAEs to their Ethics Board  as per institutional requirements.  
 
 
2.7 Measurement of outcomes  
2.7.1 Primary outcome  
We will access hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (both study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393450]), consult primary care physicians, contact [CONTACT_4317]/SDMs, and if needed, 
access death registries to ascertain vital status at 90 days.  
 
2.7.2 Secondary outcomes  
1 - RRT dependence will be defined by [CONTACT_393490] +/- 14 days of the 
90-day time point following randomization.  
2 - The composite outcome of death  by [CONTACT_2006] 90 (primary outcome)  or RRT dependence at Day 
90 (principal secondary outcome).  
3 - We will evaluate kidney function in all patients alive at Day 90. S erum creatinine will be 
drawn at Day 90  (or as close as possible to Day 90)  and not beyond  132 days after 
randomization (i .e., we will accept a serum creatinine value from Day 90 minus  14 days  or 
Day 90 plus 42 days ). eGFR  will be  derived from the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_393451]/min/1.73 m2.42  
4 - A urine sample will be obtained at Day 90  (or as close as possible to Day 90)  and not 
beyond  132 days after randomization (i.e. , Day 90 minus 14 days or Day 90 plus 42 days ) 
for assessment of spot albumin and creatinine concentrations.  
5 - Major adverse kidney event  (MAKE)  by [CONTACT_2006] 90  (defined as the composite of death, RRT 
dependence or sustained reduction in  kidney function  [defined as Day 90 eGFR < 75% 
baseline eGFR ]). 
6 - A ventilator -free day will be defined as the receipt of < 2 hours of either invasive or non -
invasive ventilation within a 24 -hour period.  
7 - A vasoactive -free day will be defined as < 2 hours of receipt of any vasoactive therapy 
provided by [CONTACT_393491] a 24 hour period.  
8 - An ICU -free day will be defined as admission to an ICU for  < 2 hours within a 24 hours 
period.  
9 - Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days will be defined as a 24 -hour period completely free of an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543].  
10 - Death in ICU, at 28 -days and in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393452].  
11 - The EuroQol  EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used to measure health -related quality of 
life. As a widely accepted measure of patient utility, the EQ -5D-5L can be converted to 
quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) for use in the economic evaluation.  
[ADDRESS_493892] of the strategy itself (which will be assessed 
using a micro -costing approach46), plus any implications on length of stay, safety events 
associated with an accelerated or standard initiation strategy, and the costs associa ted 
with RRT use after ICU discharge  up to [ADDRESS_493893] ice within a 
multicent re clinical trial, valuation of costs will be done for the subset of all patients 
enrolled within  the province of  Alberta , Canada  (extrapolated based on resource use for all 
patients in the trial) using administrative costing data ava ilable from Alberta Health 
Services, and from the Alberta Physicians’ fee schedule, using methods familiar to study 
investigators46. 
13 - In jurisdictions where this is feasible, w e will access  administrative data to ascertain vital 
status and the need for RRT at Day 365 from randomization.  RRT dependence will be 
defined by  [CONTACT_393492] a kidney tran splant or the receipt of any form of RRT within 
+/- [ADDRESS_493894] of the intervention, as well as 
any associated and do wnstream costs. We will also estimate  “time and travel” costs for 
patients in the trial, based on the subsequent need for RRT therapy.48 
 
If RRT dependence at 90 days  differs  between the two treatment arms , then extrapolation of 
the benefits and costs beyond the timeframe of the clinical trial will be required to assess the 
complete economic implicati ons of this strategy. This will be critical to justifying (or not) the use 
of this strategy to health care payers. To enable this, a decision analytical framework will be 
developed alongside the data from the clinical trial to model the potential impact of  accelerated 
RRT initiation on long -term outcomes and costs, using a lifetime perspective. Sensitivity 
analysis will be undertaken to account for uncertainty regarding the long -term estimated costs 
and effects.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_493895] a 90-day mortality of 40% in the standard arm. This mortality rate is compatible with 
90-day mortality reported in contemporary cohorts of patients with RRT -requiring AKI in 
Finland and Australia/New Zealand.4,[ADDRESS_493896] selected a relative risk reduction of 15% 
(absolute risk reduction 6% ) as recommended by [CONTACT_393493].49 With Type I error of 0.05 and 
power of 0.90, a sample size of 1,359 patients/arm would be required (total 2,718). In order to 
account for the interim analyses, the required sample size increases to 2,78 0. After accounting 
for a combined rate of crossover and dropouts of 3% (as derived from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]), we will 
target a total sample size of 2,866.  
 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October [ADDRESS_493897]. The risk ratio and relative risk red uction will be estimated 
with 95% confidence intervals. An adjusted analysis will also be completed using logistic 
regression and will include the following baseline variables: age, sex, sepsis, receipt of 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_393494].  
The princip al secondary outcome, the proportion of survivors who are RRT dependent at [ADDRESS_493898], we will use the adjusted model for the primary outcome to 
estimate the probabilities of 90 -day survival. We will then use the reciprocals of these as 
weights in a logistic regression for RRT, resulting in an inverse pr obability weighted analysis. 
This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_393453] a marginal structural model. The second approach will employ a 
multinomial regression model to jointly consider the states: dead at 90 days, alive at 90 days 
receiving RRT and alive at 90 days RRT-free. A similar approach will be used to estimate the 
probabilities of 365 -day survival and to consider the states: dead at 365 days, alive at 365 
days receiving RRT and alive at 365 days RRT-free. 
 
Duration of ventilation, vasoactive therapy, ICU stay and hosp italization  and albuminuria at 90 
days (expressed as the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio in mg/mmol)  will be compared by 
[CONTACT_3553] a t -test. Finally, eGFR decline of 25%, death in ICU, by 28 days and in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
ICU readmission and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n within 90 days will be compared by [CONTACT_60679] -squared tests.  
 
Interim analyses for efficacy based on the primary outcome will be done when 25, 50 and 75% 
of planned enrollees have completed 90 -day follow -up. Given the risks of false positive results 
with early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_393454], statistical significance will be declared using small p -values 
established by O’Brien -Fleming boundaries on the primary outcome (90 -day mortality). A 
detailed monitoring plan will be developed in consultation with the DSMB prior to 
commencement of recruitment.  
 
We will evaluate the effect of accelerated vs. standard RRT in the following a priori  defined 
subgroups: i) patients with sepsis (based on the possibility that earlier RRT, due to more 
aggressive removal of inflammatory mediato rs, might have a more prominent effect among 
patients with sepsis -associated AKI);  ii) patients whose baseline eGFR  is < 45 mL/min/1.73 
m2 (based on the possible modifying effect of pre -existing chronic kidney disease on mortality 
and progression to chron ic RRT dependence)  and iii) region of the world - Canada/US vs 
Australia/NZ vs Europe (based on possibility that regional RRT and/or critical care practices 
have a modifying effect on the impact of the intervention on outcomes) . 
 
 
2.11 Planned recruitment r ate and methods to ensure enrollment  
We anticipate a recruitment rate of 1 -2 participants/site/month. Based on a conservative 
estimate, we should be able to recruit the targe t population within [ADDRESS_493899] successfully enrolled patients into numerous multicentre trials, 
including some in the area of AKI.  
 
We are also propos ing several steps to ensure this trial’s success including: 1) Site Education : 
Prior to the trial start up at each centre, the principal investigators will visit each site and 
present rounds to clinicians and nurses on the rationale, design, and logistics of the STARRT -
AKI trial. 2) Monitoring of Recruitment : The central trial coordinating centre will conduct r egular 
surveillance, monitoring and reporting of recruitment activity at each participating site, and 
distribute regular newsletters and progress rep orts. We also propose to hold regularly 
scheduled investigator and research staff meetings. 3) Novel consent models: The need to 
assure the rapid enrollment of eligible patients is of particular importance in a trial that is 
testing the value of early/acce lerated RRT initiation. The burden of illness in our eligible 
population is such that in most cases, the substitute decision maker (SDM) will need to be 
approached for consent.  This SDM may often be unavailable at the time the potential 
participant is foun d to meet eligibility criteria. In these situations,  and where permitted by [CONTACT_393495],  we will try to obtain consent by [CONTACT_393496][INVESTIGATOR_35905] -person.  At centres where this has been approved  by [CONTACT_393495] , if SDMs are not available or readily contact[CONTACT_369552], eligible patients may be 
recruited through a process of deferred /delayed  consent.   
 
 
2.12 Co-Enrollment  
Patients recruited to STARRT -AKI may also be enrolled in other studies or clinical trials as 
long as those studies/trials do not interfere with the timing of RRT initiation mandated by [CONTACT_393497] -AKI protocol.  Furthermore , the therapy tested in the other trial must not have a 
plausible interaction with the timing of RRT initiati on. Investigators and coordinators will 
routinely review trials that are operating in paralle l in the study ICUs. The trial S teerin g 
Committee w ill review and approve  co-enrollment in other studies on a case -by-case basis .50 
 
 
2.13 Study centre s 
This will be a n international initiative comprising up to 100 centres and in up to 15  countries.  
 
 
2.14 Mitigation of bias  
Institution of a sham/placebo RRT would be ethically and logistically difficult and hence 
blinding is impractical. However, we will take several st eps to mitigate bias. Central computer -
based randomization will be concealed. The use of random treatment blocks will prevent 
investigators and site coordinators from predicting the treatment assignment for the 
subsequent eligible patient.  
 
To minimize th e impact of co -interventions, a major concern when investigators and clinicians 
are unblinded to the trial -mandated intervention, the protocol calls for all delivered RRT to 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October [ADDRESS_493900] not demonstrated any benefit of “intensive” or 
“high dose” RRT in the setting of AKI.20,[ADDRESS_493901] 3 times/week. The minimum presc ribed 
effluent dose in CRRT is 20 mL/kg/hr (averaged over a 24 hr period). We have also been 
deliberately liberal with respect to the choice of clearance mode (hemodialysis vs 
hemofiltration vs hemodiafiltra tion) given the fact that local practices may var y based on the 
availability of technology and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_393455]. A recent meta -analysis did not 
demonstrate the superiority of any clearance mode in the setting of AKI.[ADDRESS_493902] been established. Together, these measures will ensure that once RRT is 
started, patients in both treatment arms receive RRT according to identical principles.  
Since the study arm will be apparent to investigators from t he outset, the risk of clinician -
directed crossover is a concern, with participants being switched to the treatment arm that is 
perceived to be more “beneficial” or “appropriate”. The patient’s changing clinical needs must 
always supersede adherence to the  study protocol and some crossovers are thus unavoidable. 
However, concerns about crossovers are mitigated from our experience in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_393456]. Only 3/48 patients assigned to accelerated RRT commenced RRT > [ADDRESS_493903] importantly, outcome assessment will not be significantly affected by [CONTACT_393498], 
especially the primary o utcome of all -cause mortality.  
 
SECTION  3. TRIAL MANAGEMENT  
 
3.1 The Coordinating Centre  
The Coordinating and Data Management Centre is the Applied Health Research Centre of the 
Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute ( www.ahrconline.com ) of St. Michael’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393457], 
Canada . This comprehensive trials unit employs expert project management staff. The 
Coordinating Centre will be responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_106423] d programming the electronic  case 
report forms, trial procedure manual, data monitoring, regulatory documents, data 
management and analysis, and providing progress and data reports to the Steering 
Committee, Data Safety and Monitoring Board, and participat ing sites.  The Applied Health 
Research Centre staff is highly familiar with the STARRT -AKI protocol as they managed the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_309994].  
 
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   27 3.2 Role of t he site investigators   
The site investigators will be responsible for: a) obtaining local institutional review board / 
research ethics board approval  and ensuring the ethical conduct of the trial , b) publicizing the 
study to all intensivists, nephrologists, trainees, and ICU nurses c) ensuring that eligible 
patients consentin g to the trial are randomized, d ) ensuring that all randomized patients are 
followed according to protocol, and e ) ensuring that serious adverse events are promptly 
transmitted to the Methods Centre and  Ethics Board , with follow -up enquiries addressed in a 
timely manner.  
 
3.3 Role of t he local study coordinators  
The site study coordinators will be responsible for: a) identification of eligible patients, 
recruitment and consent; b) providing day -to-day guidance to the ICU team (physicians and 
nurses) regarding adherence to stu dy protocols,  c) providing appropriate follow -up for all study 
patients, completing the fields in the data forms and ensuring the meticulous and secure 
storage of information  and d)  maintaining a screening log of all eligible patients . 
 
3.4 Steering Commit tee 
As co -principal investigators, Ron Wald and Sean Bagshaw  will assume overall responsibility 
for all operational aspects of the trial, including acquisition and administration of funds, training 
of research staff, supervision  of trial implementation, data interpretation and completion of the 
final manuscript. Senior investigators with an extensive background in Critical Care 
Nephrology and clinical trials will oversee the trial in Canada ( Neill Adhikari22,25,51 , Matthew 
Weir52 and Francois Lamontagne53-57), the [LOCATION_002] ( Kathleen Liu28,62 and Paul 
Palevsky20,58 -60), Europe ( Michael Joannidis61-63, Marlies Ostermann64-67 Ville Pettila4,68-70, 
and Alistair Nichol71-74) and Australia/New Zealand ( Rinaldo Bellomo21,75 -77, Martin 
Gallagher78-81 and Shay McGuiness82,83). Braden Manns  is a nephrologist at the University 
of Calgary and a health economist who has published extensively on the costs of novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393458], including the application of RRT in the setting of AKI.16,46,48,[ADDRESS_493904]. Michael’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
operationalized the screening process and developed data collection tools for this research 
program.40,85,[ADDRESS_493905] every 6 months while the trial is 
recruiting patients to review all serious adverse events separately and in aggregate. The 
DSMB Chair will communicate with the principal investigators after each meeting. The DSMB 
will also review resu lts of the interim analyses described above and make recommendations to 
the Steering Committee, based on the a priori  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  A DSMB charter will be drafted.  
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   28  
3.6 Sub-studies  
The Steering Committee will establish a sub -committee to consider  potential sub -studies, 
some of which will require additional funding beyond the core trial funding to accomplish the 
stated objectives of the trial. Proposed sub -studies may include but are not limited to the 
following:  
 
1. Long-term survival/renal functi on (1 -5 years)  
2. Long-term costs/resource use (1 -5 years)  
3. Mechani stic/pharmacological substudies  
4. Fluid balance substudy  
5. Novel kidney damage biomarker substudy  
6. Weaning from mechanical ventilation  support  substudy  
 
3.[ADDRESS_493906]  approval will be secured prior to the commencement of screening activities  at 
each cent re. Study coordinators will be responsible for obtaining informed consent from the 
eligible patient or the substitute decision maker  (SDM)  if the patient is  incapable.  If the SDM 
provides consent but the patient becomes capable prior to the end of the follow -up period, the 
study coordinator will seek consent directly from the patient, who will have the option of 
withdrawing from the study. If a SDM is contact[CONTACT_393499], steps will be taken to obtain phone consent for the study.  
 
At sites where this has been approved by [CONTACT_393500] , patients who are eligible but 
incapable of pro viding consent and for whom an SDM is not available may be enrolled and 
randomized through a process of deferred /delayed  consent.  In this circumstance, a dedicated 
effort will be made to locate a SDM even after recruitment has taken place and the SDM -once  
found - will be given the option of affirming or withdrawing the patient’s participation. In 
addition, once the participant regains capacity, he/she will be asked to affirm or withdraw 
consent for the trial.  
 
The time of eligibility will be documented  on t he study screening log . Consent (or 
documentation of enrollment in the case of deferred/delayed consent) must be obtained within 
12 hours of this time, otherwise the patient’s eligibility will have elapsed and the patient will not 
be included in the trial.  
 
To ensure confidentiality, patients will be identified to the Methods Centre only by [CONTACT_393501]. The site study coordinator will keep a master list of patient names and 
identification numbers in a password -protected computer file. At the end of the study, master 
lists will be destroyed. In accordance with current requirements, we will store data for a 
minimum of 10 years. 
 
3.8 Publication and authorship policy  
Members of the Steering Committee will participate in drafting  the manuscript that describes 
the main findings of the STARRT -AKI trial (i.e., the “principal paper”) . All investigators will be 
asked to review and provide input on the final manuscript and will be invited to serve as co -
 
STARRT -AKI Protocol Version October 5 , 2015                                              
   29 authors. It is anticipated that t he principal paper’s authorship will be attributed collectively to 
“The STARRT -AKI Investigators”.  
 
Authorship on STARRT -AKI publications  (principal  paper  and papers emanating from  sub-
studies)  will adhere to the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submit ted to Biomedical 
Journals of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors .90 These Requirements 
state “ Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and

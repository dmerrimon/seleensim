Target patient population
Patients, 40-[ADDRESS_512760], dosage and mode of administration
Each patient will undergo a screening period of 1 to 4 weeks (-28 to -9 days).  During the 
screening period, patients will be provided with ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406698] 2 inhalations QDS 
as COPD maintenance therapy. Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be provided as rescue 
medication during the screening period and throughout the study. 
Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 scheme. Approximately 500 patients will be randomised 
to the GFF and UV treatment groups, respectively. Patients will be stratified based on 
incoming COPD treatment at screening; rescue/maintenance monotherapy (LAMA, LABA or ICS only) vs. double maintenance therapy (LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA). 
The first dose of IP will be taken at Visit 3 (Day 1). During the 24 week double-blind 
treatment period, patients will take two inhalations in the morning and in the evening from the GFF inhaler (active or placebo) and one inhalation in the morning from the UV inhaler (active 
or placebo). 
Statistical methods
The co-primary non-inferiority analyses will be conducted using the Per Protocol analysis set. 
Data following important protocol deviations which may affect efficacy or from visits where 
patients do not comply with required restrictions will be excluded from this analysis.

Date 14 July 2017
9 (129)Supportive analyses and superiority testing will be conducted in the full analysis set of all 
patients randomised and dosed, using all data obtained while on treatment.
The co-primary endpoints of change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1and peak 
change from baseline in FEV 1within [ADDRESS_512761]-dosing will be analysed separately using a 
linear mixed effects repeated measures approach. The models will include baseline FEV 1and 
bronchodilator responsiveness as continuous covariates and stratification factors (prior treatment - rescue/maintenance monotherapy vs double maintenance therapy), region, visit, treatment, and treatment by [CONTACT_765], as categorical covariates. Patient will be considered a random effect. 
The co-primary analyses will be based upon an estimate of the treatment difference over the 
entire 24-week treatment period, along with two-sided 95% and 97.5% confidence intervals. For both endpoints, non-inferiority will be concluded using a 1-sided hypothesis test according to a significance level of either 1.25% or 2.5% based upon the hierarchical testing and recycling procedure. This is equivalent to the lower bound of the 95% or 97.5% 2-sided confidence interval being greater than the pre-specified margin of -[ADDRESS_512762]-dosing, TDI 
focal score and EMSCI symptom severity score will be analysed using a similar repeated measures model to the co-primary endpoints, including appropriate baselines in the model. Peak IC will be referred to a non-inferiority margin of -50mL, while TDI and EMSCI will be referred to non-inferiority margins of -1.0 units and -0.1 units respectively.
In order to strongly control the 1-sided type I error rate at 2.5% across all co-primary endpoint 
hypothesis tests and the non-inferiority hypothesis tests of the secondary endpoints, a 
hierarchical testing procedure with recycling will be defined. 
To account for the multiplicity of the two co-primary endpoints, the test mass (1 sided alpha 
of 2.5%) will initially be split equally between the tests of the non-inferiority null hypothesis 
for each of trough FEV
1and peak FEV 1(1-sided alpha of 1.25% each). Should either of these 
null hypotheses be rejected, the test mass will be recycled. As such, respective hypothesis tests 
will be conducted at either a 1-sided 1.25% or 2.5% significance level depending upon this 
recycling. The superiority of peak FEV 1 is only tested once non-inferiority of peak FEV 1is 
achieved. Should all three null hypotheses relating to the co-primary endpoints be rejected 
then testing will proceed to the secondary endpoints using a 1-sided 2.5% significance level.
If non-inferiority is demonstrated for a secondary endpoint in the per protocol analysis set, 
then testing may proceed to the next endpoint in the hierarchy, and a superiority test of the 
endpoint will also be conducted in the full analysis set where relevant. 
An exception to this sequential non-inferiority/superiority testing procedure is the secondary 
endpoint of onset of action (proportion of patients with increase in FEV 1 of ≥100 ml from

10 (129)baseline at 5 minutes on day 1). For this endpoint superiority testing will immediately be 
carried out using logistic regression without any prior non-inferiority testing.
Rescue medication use, CAT, NiSCI and other spi[INVESTIGATOR_406699]-scale endpoints 
will also be analysed using mixed effects repeated measures models.
Adverse events (AEs) and exploratory endpoints will be reported descriptively.
Approximately 500 patients per arm are to be randomised and it is expected that around 440 
patients per arm will be included in the Per Protocol Analysis Set for the co-primary analyses. This sample size will provide around 94% power to demonstrate that the difference between 
GFF and UV in change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks is 
greater than the non-inferiority margin of - 50 mL, using a one-sided significance level of 
2.5% and assuming an effective standard deviation of 167mL and a true difference of -10 mL. 
Should testing be conducted at a one-sided significance level of 1.25% then the power would 
be 90%. 
For the co-primary endpoint of peak FEV 1over [ADDRESS_512763] 97% power to 
demonstrate superiority of GFF to UV in peak FEV 1with a one-sided significance level of 
1.25%.

20 (129)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Long-acting bronchodilators are central to the pharmacological management of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( GOLD 2017 ). However, many patients remain 
symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_406708]-acting monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In a real-world 
study ( Dransfield et al 2011 ), patients receiving tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], formoterol, or salmeterol as long-
acting bronchodilator maintenance therapy continued to report dyspnea and high levels of 
supplemental rescue medication use, irrespective of the level of airflow limitation.
Glycopyrronium (GP) is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) which exerts its 
bronchodilatory effect via muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells within the 
trachea and bronchi. GP is approved in many countries in multiple formulations for different 
indications, including for the treatment of COPD.
Formoterol fumarate (FF) is a selective long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) approved worldwide 
for use in COPD. In addition, FF is also approved worldwide in combination with inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) such as budesonide (e.g., Symbicort®MDI, Symbicort®Turbuhaler®
(TBH [[COMPANY_008], LP]) for use in patients with asthma and COPD. When inhaled, FF acts 
locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. FF stimulates β2-adrenoreceptors in the airways, 
inducing airway smooth muscle relaxation and reducing or preventing bronchoconstriction. 
Dual long-acting bronchodilator therapy represents an alternative to long-acting 
bronchodilator monotherapy ( Cazzola et al 2010 ). Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate 
(GFF) is a fixed-dose combination of GP and FF in a metered dose inhaler (MDI). It is approved in the [LOCATION_003] for maintenance treatment of COPD (at a dose of 7.2/4.8 μg two 
inhalations twice daily ( Bevespi [INVESTIGATOR_345187]™ prescribing information, 2016. ). Dual 
bronchodilation with GFF has been shown to provide greater improvements in lung function than GP or FF alone, with similar or greater improvements in measures of dyspnea, rescue 
medication use, and health-related quality of life ( Martinez et al 2016 ). However, a direct 
comparison between GFF and other inhaled LAMA/LABA combinations has not been performed 
Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UV) is a fixed-dose combination of the LAMA umeclidinium and 
the LABA vilanterol, which is approved in many countries for the treatment of COPD. UV is a dry powder inhaler (DPI) prescribed at a dose of 62.5 μg/25 μg once daily ( Anoro™ 
Ellipta™ prescribing information, 2016. ).
The rationale for a direct comparison between LAMA/LABA combinations is multi-fold. 
There are several LAMA/LABA combinations available, approved at once-daily or twice-
daily dosing regimens ( Duaklir® Genuair® Summary of Product Characteristics 2015 ; 
Anoro™ Ellipta™ prescribing information, 2016. ;Utibron™ Neohaler® prescribing 
information 2016. ;Stiolto® Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862]® prescribing information 2016 ). The mono-components 
of the LAMA/LABA combinations have different pharmacological properties which may

21 (129)have an impact clinically on both lung function and symptoms. The symptomatic impact of 
COPD can vary over the course of the day and night, whereby [CONTACT_406792]. It is a well-known fact that many COPD patients find the morning hours particularly burdensome, as they get up and start their day. 
Therefore, effective bronchodilation during the night and fast onset of effect in the morning 
have relevance for this patient group ( [COMPANY_002] et al 2013 ). A direct comparison between two 
LAMA/LABAs will help elucidate the influence of their different dosing regimens and 
pharmacological properties on the treatment effects and evaluate the importance of these 
differences for patients’ lung function, symptoms and health-related quality of life.
This study will compare the efficacy of GFF to UV in patients with moderate to very severe 
COPD.
1.[ADDRESS_512773] comparison of these two treatments will support the evidence base for the prescribing of GFF.
This study will recruit patients with moderate to very severe COPD; therefore, spi[INVESTIGATOR_406709] 2 or above (GOLD 2017 ). These requirements are in line with the inclusion criteria used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_406710]. In addition, patients are required to be symptomatic 
at baseline with a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score of 10 or above. This threshold is specified in the current guidelines ( GOLD 2017 ) as determining those in need of treatment for 
symptoms of COPD. In patients meeting these criteria, with severe or persistent 
breathlessness, treatment with dual bronchodilator therapy is recommended ( GOLD 2017 ).
Randomisation and blinding minimise any potential for selection bias, or for bias in the 
assessment of study endpoints or the management of patients. This is especially important 
given the patient-reported endpoints collected in this study. As GFF is delivered in a metered dose inhaler (MDI) and UV in a dry powder inhaler (DPI), it is not possible to provide a single 
matched inhaler that could deliver either investigational treatment. Therefore, a double-
dummy design will be used whereby [CONTACT_406793] [INVESTIGATOR_406711]. Patients will also continue to use short-acting rescue 
medication when necessary (albuterol/salbutamol MDI inhaler). As the aim of this study is to directly assess the differences in lung function and symptoms attributable to the two 
LAMA/LABA combinations, patients should discontinue from inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)

22 (129)treatment before being randomised. Given that multiple inhalers are involved in study 
treatment, there would also be concerns about treatment complexity and compliance if a 
fourth inhaler were used. Patients who are receiving a stable ICS/LABA combination at screening may enter the study if ICS treatment is withdrawn. The switch to LAMA/LABA 
treatment for these patients, particularly those with lower blood eosinophil counts, is justified 
since recent studies ( Wedzicha et al 2016 ) have demonstrated the benefits of LAMA/LABA 
dual bronchodilation over ICS/LABA combination treatment in terms of reduction in 
exacerbation risk and improvements in lung function and symptoms. 
Patients at high exacerbation risk who experience further exacerbations may need their 
treatment to be escalated (for example to triple therapy including ICS). Patients who 
experience ≥2 moderate exacerbations (requiring antibiotics or ≥3 days of systemic steroids) 
or ≥1 severe exacerbation (leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]) while on study will be withdrawn.
The co-primary endpoints in this study are morning pre-dose trough FEV
1and peak FEV [ADDRESS_512774] been used as primary or secondary endpoints in many regulatory studies in COPD. Trough FEV
1was the primary endpoint in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_406712] 
(Martinez et al 2016 ; Donohue et al 2013 ). Since trough FEV 1measures lung function at the 
nadir of the effect of the randomised therapi[INVESTIGATOR_406713], peak FEV
1is included as a co-primary endpoint at the zenith of the effect. Secondary 
endpoints include recognised and validated measures of dyspnea, COPD symptoms and 
health-related quality of life. These are important factors to patients experiencing COPD in addition to measures of airflow obstruction.
As the comparator is an approved active therapy, the primary aim of the study will initially 
involve establishing the non-inferiority of GFF to UV in improving lung function and symptoms. The potential for superiority over UV in maximum bronchodilation, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13999] (IC), early onset of effects and morning symptom control will then also be assessed. 
No placebo arm is included, but as there is extensive experience of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_406714] (in particular the co-primary endpoints and other spi[INVESTIGATOR_31757]), 
there are no concerns about assay sensitivity in this study. Similar two-arm non-inferiority 
studies have been conducted with other products in COPD, including between dual bronchodilator combinations ( Kalberg et al 2016 ; Buhl et al 2015 ).
The proposed non-inferiority margin of 50mL for trough FEV
1is well established and based 
upon considerable experience in reproducible effects of long acting bronchodilators over placebo. It relates to half of the commonly recognised clinically important difference of 
100mL ( Donohue 2005 ) and has been used in several non-inferiority studies, both of dual and 
single long acting bronchodilators ( Kalberg et al 2016 ; Chapman et al 2014 ; Volgelmeier et al 
2010 ). The same margin will be applied to Peak FEV
1and IC. As the magnitude of changes in 
peak FEV 1with therapy are typi[INVESTIGATOR_406715] 1, this represents a relatively 
more stringent non-inferiority margin for peak FEV 1.
The non-inferiority margin for TDI is based upon the Minimum Clinically Important 
Difference (MCID) of 1 unit ( Mahler et al 2005 ). Although there is less precedent for formal 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 14 July 2017
23 (129)non-inferiority testing of TDI, a similar approach to using the MCID as a pre-specified margin 
has been used previously for SGRQ ( Buhl et al 2015 ). There is less clinical experience with 
the use of EMSCI, but a non-inferiority margin of 0.1 units is proposed based upon the difference observed between LAMA/LABA and LAMA only treated patients ( D’Urzo et al 
2014 ). 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
GFF was approved by [CONTACT_406794] 2016 and launched in the 
US January 2017. Its two mono-components, GP and FF, are used as single therapy or in combination with other inhaled drugs in patients with COPD in many countries worldwide. 
The clinical development program for GFF included 4,602 patients with COPD. Overall, the 
program demonstrated that GFF was effective for long-term maintenance therapy in patients with COPD and provided additional efficacy benefits compared to its mono-components (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_406795], COPD symptoms and disease-specific health status). 
GFF was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to the mono-components, and with no unexpected safety observations. Adverse drug reactions with ≥1% incidence were anxiety, 
headache, tremor, dry mouth, nausea, muscle spasms and chest pain. Less common adverse 
drug reactions were hyperglycaemia, agitation, restlessness, sleep disturbance, tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles, dizziness and 
hypersensitivity. In conclusion, these findings support a favourable benefit-risk profile for 
GFF in the treatment of patients with COPD. 
UV was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2013 and has since then been launched worldwide for 
patients with COPD. Adverse drug reactions with ≥1% incidence reported with UV are 
pharyngitis, sinusitis, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], constipation, diarrhea, pain in extremity, muscle spasms, neck pain and chest pain. Less common adverse drug reactions are 
productive cough, dry mouth, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
vomiting, musculoskeletal chest pain, chest discomfort, asthenia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular extrasystoles, myocardial infarction, pruritus, rash, and 
conjunctivitis. 
During screening, all patients will switch their COPD therapy to ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406716] (QDS) and albuterol/salbutamol MDI as needed (PRN). Although this 
regimen is expected to give adequate symptom relief for most patients, some of them (mainly 
those with previous LAMA/LABA combination treatment) may experience an increase in symptoms.  Patients will be have a faster follow up than what they would experience in 
regular clinical settings and will be reminded to contact [CONTACT_406796].   During the 24-week treatment period, all patients will be treated with a LAMA/LABA combination, and since patients on incoming triple therapy will 
not be eligible, no patients will be subjected to a step-down in therapy after randomisation 
compared to their regular maintenance therapy. Patients on incoming rescue treatment only or maintenance monotherapy will be eligible only if they are symptomatic (CAT score ≥10) at 
screening, i.e. a step-up in treatment for these patients will be based on clinical judgement and 
will offer a potential for improvement. Both arms will use approved doses and the study population represents the population for which these medications were approved.

24 (129)Based on the safety profile of the investigational products (IPs), no new or specific risks 
beyond what has been described are anticipated with the doses and the dose regimens being 
used in this trial. Investigators will ensure adequate medical care of the study participants at all times throughout the course of the study, and patients will be followed by [CONTACT_406797] 4-[ADDRESS_512775] x-ray as per local practice (postero-
anterior and lateral projections strongly recommended), or computed tomography (CT) scan 
of the chest/lungs, within [ADDRESS_512776] for COPD symptom worsening and 
pneumonia.
1.4 Study Design 
This is a phase IIIb randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, parallel group, 24 
week study to assess the efficacy and safety of GFF  7.2/4.8 μg 2 inhalations twice daily (BD) 
compared to UV 62.5/25 μg 1 inhalation once daily (OD) in patients with moderate to very 
severe COPD.
The study will be conducted in approximately 150 sites. Across these sites, it is planned that 
approximately 1400 patients will be screened and 1000 randomised into the study.
Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 scheme. Approximately 500 patients each will be 
randomised to the GFF and UV treatment groups. Patients will be stratified based on incoming COPD treatment at screening: rescue only/maintenance monotherapy (LAMA or LABA or 
ICS only) vs. double maintenance therapy (LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA). 
The study will evaluate the benefit of GFF compared to UV in patients with moderate to very 
severe COPD. Patients on rescue medication only or maintenance monotherapy will be 
required to be symptomatic (CAT ≥10) at screening (Visit 1), whereas there will be no 
symptom requirement at screening for patients on double maintenance therapy (ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA). All patients will be required to be symptomatic (CAT ≥10) at randomisation 
(Visit 3). Patients on triple maintenance therapy will not be eligible. A history of 
exacerbations in the previous year will be obtained to characterize the population but will not be included as an entry criterion. COPD severity, defined as post-bronchodilator forced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV
1), must be <80% predicted normal value, calculated 
using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations ( Quanjer et al 2012 ), and the 
measured FEV 1must also be ≥750 mL if FEV 1less than 30 % of predicted normal value. 
Post-bronchodilator FEV 1(after inhalation of albuterol/salbutamol MDI) will be tested at 
screening (Visit 1 and Visit 2) to determine eligibility and COPD severity. Bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be tested at Visit 2.
Any treatment with ICS, LAMA, LABA and existing rescue medications will be stopped at 
the screening visit. During the screening period, patients will be treated with ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406717]/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
25 (129)bromide MDI 2 inhalations QDS and albuterol/salbutamol MDI as needed. 
Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will also be used as rescue medication throughout the 24-week 
treatment period.
Baseline assessments: vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory testing 
and pregnancy test will be performed to assess patients’ eligibility.
After the Randomisation Visit (Visit 3), patients will be evaluated at Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 
(Week 12), Visit 6 (Week 18) and Visit 7 (Week 24) using spi[INVESTIGATOR_406718]. From Visit 2 onwards, patients will also enter data daily in an 
electronic Patient Reported Outcomes device (ePRO).
For patients who remain on treatment throughout the study (i.e., complete Visit 7), a follow-
up telephone call will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_512777] IP dose.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to Week 24 (Visit 7) will complete a Treatment 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit. These patients will be placed on appropriate maintenance 
COPD medications, as per the Investigator’s judgement. Consideration should be given to 
maintaining patients on at least double therapy, while ensuring appropriate follow-up and further evaluation of the prescribed treatment. 
A follow-up telephone call will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_512778] IP dose. No 
further data will be collected. In the event the Treatment Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit is performed approximately14 days post last IP dosing, a follow-up TC will not be required.

study within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to Visit 1 (screening), whichever is 
longer.  Note:  Patient participation in observational studies (i.e., studies that do not require change to medication or an additional intervention) is not exclusionary.
18. Patients who have needed additions or alterations to their usual maintenance 
therapy for COPD due to worsening symptoms within 1 month prior to Visit 1 and up to Visit 3.
19. Treatment with depot corticosteroids within 6 weeks, and other systemic 
corticosteroids within 4 weeks, prior to Visit 1. Exception: Patients who are steroid dependent, and maintained on an equivalent of [ADDRESS_512786] 3 months prior to Visit 1, are eligible for enrolment 
providing the dose of oral steroids remains stable during the screening period.

study screening.
The Investigator will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the patient before any study-specific procedures are 
performed.
2. Assign the patient a unique enrolment number, beginning with ‘E#’ (using the Interactive 
Web Response System [IWRS/IVRS]).
3. Determine patient eligibility (see Section 3.1and 3.2).
4. Randomise the patient using IWRS/IVRS (randomisation code will be blinded).If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Only the enrolment number will be used for patient identification in 
the eCRF.

33 (129)3.[ADDRESS_512788] ensure all decisions including the rationale for continuing or discontinuing treatment are appropriately 
documented.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
The randomisation codes will be computer-generated using the [COMPANY_008] Global 
Randomisation system (AZRand) and loaded into the IWRS/IVRS database. The randomisation codes will be generated in blocks to ensure approximate balance (1:1) between 
the two treatment groups. Patients will be stratified based on incoming COPD treatment; 
rescue or maintenance monotherapy (LAMA, LABA or ICS only) at screening vs. double maintenance therapy (LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA).
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
Patients, study site personnel, and AZ personnel will not know which medication the patient is receiving.
Since there are two different devices, a double-dummy technique will be applied to ensure the 
double-blinding of the study.  Matched placebo to GFF and UV will be present with the same 
external appearance. There will be no differences between active and placebo formulations with regards to appearance, odour or colour that could unmask the blinded design.  
3.7 Methods for unblinding
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
patient, will be available to the Investigator or pharmacists from the IWRS/IVRS. Routines for 
this will be described in the IWRS/IVRS user manual that will be provided to each site.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the treatment given to patient to the [COMPANY_008] staff.

Date 14 July 2017
34 (129)[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to 
regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient have been made 
and documented.
3.8 Restrictions
The following is restricted during the study:
!Donation of blood is not allowed throughout the study.
!Patient should keep regular night/day shifts.
!The activities that should be avoided in the morning prior to lung function 
testing are :
Smoking within at least 1 hour of testing.
Consuming alcohol within 4 hours of testing.
Performing vigorous exercise within 30 minutes of testing.
Wearing clothing that substantially restricts full chest and abdominal 
expansion.
Eating a large meal within 2 hours of testing.
Using albuterol/salbutamol MDI within approximately 6 hours of 
testing.
Using ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406725] 6 hours of 
testing at Visit 2 and Visit 3.
Using IP in the morning before visits 4-7.
!Restrictions regarding concomitant medication are described in Section 7.
Any event likely to interfere with the objectives of the study will be communicated to the 
Investigator and reported without delay to [COMPANY_008].
3.9 Discontinuation of IP
Patients may be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
∀ Patient decision.  The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2

35 (129)∀ AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], contraindicates further IP treatment.
∀ Severe non-compliance with the Clinical Study Protocol as judged by [CONTACT_406799]. The study physician should be consulted before IP is 
discontinued based on this criterion.
∀ In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], patient requires additional treatment or care 
beyond what is provided by [CONTACT_1758], including treatment with prohibited COPD 
medications (see Table 8 ). 
∀ Eligibility requirement found not to be fulfilled.
∀ A severe COPD exacerbation (requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]) or more than one moderate 
exacerbation (requiring antibiotics or ≥3 days of systemic steroids).
∀ Pregnancy.
3.9.[ADDRESS_512789] 
At any time, patients are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient that decides 
to discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. 
If possible, patients who discontinue IP prematurely will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_406800]/Withdrawal Visit which should be performed at the 
earliest possibility. Patients will return to appropriate COPD maintenance medications, per the 
Investigator’s discretion. Consideration should be given to maintaining patients on at least double therapy, while ensuring appropriate follow-up and further evaluation of the prescribed 
treatment. AEs will be followed up (see Section 6) and rescue medication, ePRO and all IPs 
should be returned by [CONTACT_102]. The reason and date for premature discontinuation of IP will be documented in the source documentation and in the eCRF. 
A follow-up telephone call will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_512790] IP dose for 
follow-up of any AEs. After the follow-up telephone call, patients will be withdrawn and no further data will be collected. In the event the Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit is 
performed approximately [ADDRESS_512791] will not be required. 
If a patient is withdrawn from study (see Section 3.10).
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.

who have not been randomised.)
3.10.[ADDRESS_512793]
Patients who discontinue IP will be withdrawn from the study (see Section 3.9.1 ).
3.10.3 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment 
(IP and assessments).
A patient who withdraws consent should always be asked about the reason(s) and whether any 
AEs are present; to ensure patient safety in such cases, the Investigator should follow up AEs 
outside of the clinical study period based on clinical judgement. The patient will return 
electronic PRO (ePRO) devices to the study site. 
Withdrawal of consent should be documented by [CONTACT_406801]. If possible, the patient should complete the Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit at 
the time of withdrawal of consent.
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], study patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that:
∀ are assessed as causally related to IP and 
∀ are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the CRF. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests and wellbeing.

At screening, consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. 
Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.
The screening period will start at Visit 1 with the signature [CONTACT_48028], followed by [CONTACT_4838] 2, 
and will end at the randomisation visit (Visit 3).
The minimum length of screening period will be 9 days (one day for Visit 2, and a minimum 
of 7 full days of ePRO assessments in the patient’s home to establish baseline data for the 
ePRO instruments); maximum will normally be 4 weeks. In certain cases, screening may be extended after it is agreed with the [COMPANY_008] study physician.
4.1.1 Visit 1 (day -28 to -9) 
The screening visit will be scheduled in the morning, preferably at a time similar to future 
study visits (as outlined in Section 4.2and [IP_ADDRESS] ). The following assessments and processes 
will be performed during Visit 1:
∀ Obtaining signed informed consent before any study-related procedures
∀ Assignment of an E-code in IWRS/IVRS to the patient
!Any patient signing the ICF should be recorded in IWRS/IVRS and should be 
assigned an E-code. At this point, albuterol/salbutamol MDI which will be later used for the post-bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_406729].
∀ Review of medical/surgical history, demographic, COPD history (date of COPD 
diagnosis, diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or emphysema, number of COPD 
exacerbations during last year and date of last COPD exacerbation and if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and smoking information (i.e., date of smoking initiation, current 
smoker or former smoker, date of smoking cessation and total-pack years)
∀ ePRO Training (for CAT questionnaire)

∀ Dispense the kit numbers assigned by [CONTACT_10966]/IVRS and record the kits numbers 
dispensed on the medical records
∀ IP Administration
!Dosing of IP in the clinic should be planned to occur at approximately the same 
time the patient prefers to administer IP in the mornings between the visits. The 
patient should then be advised that subsequent morning IP administration 
should happen at approximately this time, and that evening dosing should occur as close as possible to 12 hours from this. It is recommended that dosing in the 
clinic occurs before approximately 10:00 AM. If it is unavoidable that IP 
administration in the clinic is at a later time of day than the patient normally administers IP at home (for example due to the travelling time to site), then 
patients should be strongly advised that on the day prior to the next clinic visit ,
the time of IP administration should be adjusted to be approximately 24 hours and 12 hours prior to the planned dosing at the clinic. Sites should make every 
effort to ensure that dosing in the clinic occurs as close as possible to 24 
and 12 hours after the patient’s IP intake the previous day .
!IP is administered by [CONTACT_406808] 2 inhalations from the GFF/placebo inhaler 
followed by 1 inhalation from the UV /placebo inhaler. Site personnel should 
check that the patient uses the inhalers correctly.

Screen-failed patients may be re-screened observing timelines described in the exclusion criteria. 
Other instances where rescreening is being considered should be discussed with the AZ study 
physician.
Re-screening is only allowed once per patient.
If a patient is re-screened, a new informed consent form is to be signed, and re-screening Visit 
[ADDRESS_512811] dosing/time of dosing of IP the day prior to a visit, intake of disallowed medication or other disallowed events related to spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], or technical issues with spi[INVESTIGATOR_406746].

occur as soon as possible. If a visit needs to be rescheduled, no assessments will be performed, or if already partly done they will need to be repeated at the rescheduled visit. An important 
note regarding spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: during screening, for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_406747], each visit

5.1.2 Patient Reported Outcomes
Patients will complete PRO assessments at the study site and at home using a handheld 
electronic device (ePRO). PRO assessments must be collected in a systematic way to ensure 
data integrity. The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO 
data at the site or at home via an ePRO device:
For PRO instruments administered during site visits using ePRO device
∀ Administer before other procedures
!Always administer PRO instruments before other study procedures. For details 
how to activate them, refer to the ePRO materials.
∀ Provide the right environment
!Provide a quiet and private location to complete the instrument.
∀ No right or wrong answers
!Remind patients that there are no right or wrong answers and that we are asking 
them to complete these questionnaires because we’re interested in hearing 
directly from them on how they feel.
∀ Help with procedural questions
!Make sure the patient understands how to complete the instrument. Instrument 
instructions are usually self-explanatory but staff may answer questions about 
procedural issues like what it means to “tick a box”.
∀ Avoid bias: do not clarify the meaning of questions or responses
!Sometimes patients will ask site staff to clarify the meaning of a question or 
response. To avoid introducing any bias, politely tell the patient that you cannot clarify items. Remind them that there are no right or wrong answers. Tell them 
that they should select the response that best answers the question as they understand it.
∀ No time limits. Although most instruments require only a few minutes to complete 
the patient should be given as much time as is needed.
∀ Review for completeness
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
64 (129)!Prompt review of the questionnaire for completeness will minimize missing 
data and data queries. 
For PRO instruments captured at home using an ePRO device.
∀ Guidelines similar to PRO completion at the visits
!Same principles apply for ePRO for home based assessments as assessment at 
site. Remind patients that there are no right or wrong answers, avoid bias by [CONTACT_406812], remind patients that they should complete the ePRO questions 
in a quiet and private location without help from others.
∀ Train the patient on ePRO device usage
!Train the patient on how to use the ePRO device using the materials and 
training provided by [CONTACT_70170].
!Provide guidance on whom the patient should call if they have problems
∀ Monitor compliance
!Minimizing missing data is a key aspect of study success. Compliance must be 
checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify 
problems early. If compliance drops below 80% a check-in call from the site to ask the patient if they are having difficulties is highly recommended. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline/Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI)
The BDI/TDI is an instrument developed to provide a multidimensional measure of dyspnea 
in relation to activities of daily living ( Mahler et al 1984 ). The Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) 
provides a measure of dyspnea at a single state, the baseline, and the Transitional Dyspnea 
Index (TDI) evaluates changes in dyspnea from the baseline state. The instrument consists of 
three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. For the BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 
(unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. For the TDI, 
changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by [CONTACT_406813] -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are added to form a total TDI score from -9 to 
+9. Positive scores indicate an improvement, and a change from the BDI or a difference 
between treatments of 1 point has been estimated to constitute the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) ( Mahler et al 2005 ).
The BDI/TDI is completed by a trained interviewer, who asks the respondent various 
questions as part of a medical history, and selects a grade (score) using specific criteria for each of the three components. The same interviewer will complete the BDI and the TDI for an 
individual patient. The questionnaires should be completed in a quiet area, and the patient 
should be allowed to ask questions. Site personnel should take care not to influence the patient’s responses.  The interviewer must be blinded to other assessments evaluated for the

65 (129)patient.  BDI/TDI will be recorded in the ePRO, provided by [CONTACT_406814]. BDI will be completed at Visit 3, and TDI at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7 
and Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit (except in those cases when the IP has already been discontinued and not used according to protocol on the day before the visit).
[IP_ADDRESS] COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
The CAT is an 8-item PRO developed to measure the impact of COPD on health status ( Jones 
et al 2009 ). The instrument uses semantic differential six-point response scales which are 
defined by [CONTACT_406815]. Content includes items 
related to cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness going up hills/stairs, activity 
limitation at home, confidence leaving home, sleep and energy. A CAT total score is the sum of item responses. Scores range from 0-[ADDRESS_512819] on health status. CAT will be recorded by [CONTACT_406816], provided by [CONTACT_406817], at Visit 1, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7 and Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit (except in those cases when the IP has already been 
discontinued and not used according to protocol on the day before the visit).
[IP_ADDRESS] Night-time and Early morning symptoms of COPD instrument (NiSCI and 
EMSCI)
The questionnaire is made up of two parts. The first part covering “last night” symptoms (time 
elapsed from the time patient went to bed until woke up and got out of bed to start his/her day) 
and the second part covering “this morning” symptoms (time elapsed since patient got out of 
bed to start the day).
The EMSCI was developed to collect data about the frequency and severity of early morning 
symptoms and the impact of COPD symptoms on early morning activity in patients with 
COPD.
The NiSCI was developed to collect data about the frequency and severity of night-time 
symptoms and the impact of COPD symptoms on night-time awakenings in patients with 
COPD.
The data collected can be used to generate the following scores:
1. The six-Item Symptom Severity score is derived by [CONTACT_406818] a 
patient on the six item-level symptom scores and can be used to quantify the severity of early morning and night-time symptoms. 
2. The Overall COPD Symptom Severity score is comprised of a single item asking 
about overall COPD symptom severity in the early morning and at night. 
3. The Early Morning Activity score obtains information on the reduction in early 
morning activity limitation due to COPD symptoms. The Night-time Awakenings 
score can be used to obtain information on the number (or proportion) of days without night-time awakening due to COPD symptoms.

causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
screening or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, screening, 
treatment, or follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
∀ Results in death
∀ Is immediately life-threatening
∀ Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574] 
∀ Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
∀ Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
∀ Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol.

AEs/SAEs at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
6.3.3 Variables 
The following variables will be collected for each AE;
∀ AE (verbatim)
∀ The date and time when the AE started and stopped
∀ Severity
- Maximum intensity
- The Investigator must categorize the severity of each AE according to the 
following guidelines:
1 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)2 moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
3 severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)
∀ Whether the AE is serious or not
∀ Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)
∀ Action taken with regard to IP
∀ AE caused patient’s withdrawal from study (yes or no )
∀ Outcome
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:
∀ Date AE met criteria for serious AE
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
71 (129)∀ Date Investigator became aware of serious AE
∀ Reason that the AE is serious
If the following two seriousness criteria, collect the following variables:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
- Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]
- Date of discharge
Death
- Probable cause of death
- Date of death- Autopsy results
- Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
∀ Causality assessment to other medication
∀ Causality assessment to additional study drug
∀ Description of AE.
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study Protocol.
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
72 (129)6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_406823]: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?’ , 
or revealed by [CONTACT_129158]. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) rather than recording a list of signs and 
symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are 
not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The Clinical Study Protocol mandates laboratory testing, physical examination, and 
assessment of vital signs at screening only. Further testing may however be performed by [CONTACT_406824]. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is 
associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE 
and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Values and/or vital signs that fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the IP should be reported.  Wherever possible the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteriorations should be reported as AEs. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal 
medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE,unless the finding is associated with a medical condition reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please contact [CONTACT_406825] a potential Hy’s Law case. 
Investigators should be vigilant for potential Hy’s Law cases from ad hoc laboratory tests or AEs.
6.3.8 Disease under Study (DUS)
COPD symptoms or signs, such as bronchitis, cough, phlegm, sputum increased, dyspnea and 
wheeze, will be recorded as AEs when:
∀ the sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Section 6.2and/or
∀ the patient discontinues the study due to the sign or symptom and/or
∀ the sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the patient’s 
preexisting COPD history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by [CONTACT_406826]/Formoterol Fumarate

If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 1
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system,
an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756].
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to 
proceed.

7.5 Compliance
The technique for inhalation from an MDI (GFF) is different from the technique used with a DPI (UV). It is important to ensure that patients apply correct inhalation technique for 
both types of inhalers. Training devices will be available at each study site for instructional 
purposes, as well as for patients to practice the correct inhalation technique. Instruction and 
practice should occur prior to dispensing study medication, and review of patients' inhalation technique should be done at each visit.
The administration of all study medications (including IPs) should be recorded in the 
appropriate sections of the Case Report Form.

[IP_ADDRESS] Use of short-acting anticholinergics and short-acting β2-agonists
Patients will be provided ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406772] 2 inhalations QDS for use as 
COPD maintenance therapy during the screening period. Use of any SAMA as rescue 
treatment for worsening COPD symptoms is not allowed from Visit 1 and throughout the 
study duration, with the exception of treatment during a COPD exacerbation. 
Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be dispensed at Visit 1 for use as rescue medication for 
worsening of COPD symptoms. No other SABA is allowed during the study outside of 
managing a COPD exacerbation. Rescue use of albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be recorded inthe ePRO as number of inhalations per day (see Section 7, Table 7 ). Regularly scheduled use 
of albuterol/salbutamol MDI is not allowed. Prophylactic use in the absence of symptoms is 
discouraged. However, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_222505] (e.g. prior to planned exercise), it can be used, but prophylactic inhalations should not be recorded in the 
daily ePRO. Such use should be documented in the medical notes and recorded in the eCRF.
Albuterol/salbutamol MDI rescue medication is not regarded as an IP, but will be provided by 
[CONTACT_38227], in order to ensure access for this therapy from enrolment and up to Week 24, 
unless the patient is withdrawn from the study.

Visit 3: patients will be asked to withhold ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406737]/salbutamol 
MDI within approximately [ADDRESS_512838] (pre-BD) spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891]. The treatment 
with ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_406780], and the first doses of the two IP inhalers will 
be administered after completion of all pre-dose assessments. Use of albuterol/salbutamol MDI should be avoided until all lung function assessments are completed.
Visits 4-7: patients will be asked to withhold IP in the morning before the visits. The time 
from the previous dose until dosing of IP at the visit should be approximately 12 hours for the GFF/placebo inhaler, and approximately 24 hours for the UV/placebo inhaler. Use of 
albuterol/salbutamol MDI should be avoided for at least approximately [ADDRESS_512839] scheduled spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. IP will be administered after completion of all pre-dose assessments. Albuterol/salbutamol MDI intake should be avoided until all lung function 
assessments are completed. 
If IP was dosed incorrectly (missed or not taken as directed) on the day prior to a visit, the 
visit should be rescheduled to another day, as soon as possible and preferably within the visit 
window. 
If IP was dosed at an incorrect time on the day prior to a visit (see Section 4.2), it is strongly 
recommended that the visit is rescheduled as above, but if this is not feasible for the patient,

should ideally remain at the site until such time that the 6 hours withholding time has been 
reached, given it does not exceed the spi[INVESTIGATOR_406781] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) or the 
stipulated time interval since IP intake on the previous day (see Section 4.2). Alternatively, 
patients can return on another day, as soon as possible and preferably within the visit window.

For allowed medications to treat a COPD exacerbation, see Table 5 .
Rescue use of SABA and/or SAMA administered via nebulization is allowed to manage an 
acute COPD exacerbation.
Medications to treat an exacerbation should not be used for more than [ADDRESS_512840] that treatment with systemic steroids for shorter periods of time results in similar 
outcomes with less systemic steroid exposure. Therefore, it is recommended that patients are treated with a 5 day course. A single depot injectable dose of corticosteroids will be 
considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids.

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES
8.1 Statistical considerations
The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of GFF relative to UV on lung 
function. This will be addressed by [CONTACT_235307]-primary hypothesis tests: 
∀ non-inferiority of GFF relative to UV in the change from baseline in morning pre-
dose trough FEV 1over 24 weeks; 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
85 (129)∀ non-inferiority of GFF relative to UV in the peak change from baseline in FEV [ADDRESS_512842]-dosing over 24 weeks;
∀ superiority of GFF relative to UV in the peak change from baseline in FEV 1within 
[ADDRESS_512843]-dosing over 24 weeks.
The non-inferiority null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses, with μ representing the mean 
change from baseline in each treatment group, correspond to a null hypothesis of inferiority and an alternative hypothesis of non-inferiority, as follows: 
H0: μ
GFF–μUV≤ -Δ (GFF is inferior to UV by Δ or more) 
H1: μGFF–μUV> -Δ (GFF is inferior to UV by [CONTACT_21316] Δ)
The non-inferiority analysis for each endpoint is assessed within a Per Protocol analysis set 
and if non-inferiority is demonstrated the consistency of this conclusion will be assessed 
within the full analysis set.
If non-inferiority is demonstrated, then for selected endpoints superiority hypotheses will also 
be addressed within the full analysis set. Here the null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses are 
as follows: 
H0: μGFF –μUV≤ 0 (GFF is not superior to UV) 
H1: μGFF –μUV> 0 (GFF is superior to UV)
The exception to this sequential testing of non-i nferiority followed by [CONTACT_406828] 1 of ≥100 ml from baseline at 5 
minutes. For this endpoint testing will immediately be in terms of superiority hypotheses.
P-values will thus be reported as one-sided for both the non-inferiority and superiority 
hypothesis testing. This will equivalently be presented by [CONTACT_406829]-specified margin.A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be signed off prior to unblinding or to the review of any potentially treatment revealing data. Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979].
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until the database is 
locked and all protocol violations are identified.
8.2 Sample size estimate
1000 patients (500 patients each in the GFF and UV treatment arms) are to be randomised in 
this study. Based upon Phase III studies of GFF, it is estimated that 12% of the patients 
randomised will be excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set, leaving around 440 patients 
in the co-primary non-inferiority analyses. This sample size will provide around 94% power to demonstrate that the difference between GFF vs UV in change from baseline in morning pre-
dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks is greater than the non-inferiority margin of -50 mL. This

86 (129)calculation assumes a one-sided significance level of 2.5% and a true difference of -10 mL. 
Should testing be conducted at a one-sided significance level of 1.25% then the power would 
be 90%. Assumptions regarding variability for the co-primary endpoints are based on experience in previous GFF Phase III clinical studies. An effective standard deviation (SD) of 
167 mL for the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks has 
been assumed. This value is based on a per-visit SD of 200 mL and a within-patient (between-visit) correlation of 60%. Under these assumptions, for non-inferiority to be achieved the point 
estimate of the difference in pre-dose trough FEV
1over [ADDRESS_512844] be above -28mL when 
testing at a 2.5% significance level, or above - 24.5mL when testing at a 1.25% significance 
level. 
For the co-primary endpoint of peak FEV 1over [ADDRESS_512845] 97% power 
to demonstrate superiority of GFF to UV in peak FEV 1with a one-sided significance level of 
1.25%.
For the secondary endpoint of the TDI focal score over [ADDRESS_512846] 90% with a margin of -0.75 units (three quarters of the MCID), assuming no difference 
between treatments and a standard deviation of [ADDRESS_512847] on treatment, as a comparison of their effectiveness when used in practice. For selected endpoints this full analysis set will be used to provide an 
assessment of superiority, including for the co-primary analysis of the superiority of GFF 
relative to UV in Peak FEV

inhalation of IP. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment they were assigned to at 
randomisation.  
This analysis set will be used to demonstrate consistency in non-inferiority hypothesis tests 
and as the primary means of assessing superiority hypotheses.
Per Protocol Analysis Set
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will be used as the primary means of assessing non-
inferiority hypotheses.
The Per Protocol Analysis Set is the subset of the full analysis set containing patients with 
post-randomisation data obtained prior to important protocol deviations which may affect efficacy. Data obtained after such important protocol deviations, i.e. those which may affect efficacy, will be excluded from analyses using this set. The use of certain prohibited medications (such as inhaled corticosteroids) outside of the limitations described in Section 7.7will be defined in the SAP as important protocol deviations and so data after the initiation 
of these will be excluded from per protocol analyses. Since receiving the wrong treatment will be a major protocol deviation, patients in the PP analysis set will be analysed as randomised (which for this population is identical to analysis by [CONTACT_84810]). Patients must also have a valid spi[INVESTIGATOR_406783].
Patients who are found not to meet the inclusion criteria for clinical diagnosis of COPD or the 
COPD severity criteria or who did not have the required washout of prohibited medications 
prior to baseline will be excluded entirely for the PP analysis set. In addition, data from visits 
where patients do not comply with required restrictions will be removed from analyses which use the per protocol analysis set (see Section 8.4.3 ). 
A detailed definition of the Per Protocol Analysis Set and data points to be excluded will be 
given in the Statistical Analysis Plan and defined prior to the review of any potentially treatment revealing data.

Rescue Medication User analysis setRegional differences in rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI usage are expected with some 
regions using virtually no rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI at study entry. Therefore, the 
Rescue Medication User analysis set is defined as all patients in the full analysis set with average baseline rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI use of ≥ 1 inhalation/day. 
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Definition of baseline
All efficacy assessments are relative to pre-dose baseline obtained at randomisation at Visit 3. 
For spi[INVESTIGATOR_406784] -60 and -30 minute pre-dose 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_406785] 1 (Vis it 3) will be used to establish baseline for all 
FEV 1, FVC, and IC parameters. 
For the diary symptom score parameters and rescue medication usage, baseline will be the 
average of the non-missing values from the ePRO data collected in the last seven days before 
randomisation (i.e. excluding data recorded on the day of visit 3).
8.4.[ADDRESS_512850] one effort that meets ATS/ERS criteria 
for acceptability will be considered acceptable and contribute to the post-dose assessments for analyses using the full analysis set. If all the assessments at a specific timepoint were deemed to be of unacceptable quality the pulmonary function assessments obtained at the timepoint will not be included in any efficacy analysis and will be considered missing.
Further requirements will have to be met in addition to the ATS/ERS criteria in order for 
pulmonary function data to be used in the Per Protocol analyses. Patients who do not comply with selected restrictions during a study visit (for example on smoking and bronchodilator or 
rescue medication use) will have their data from that visit removed from analyses which use 
the per protocol analysis set. Patients who do not take the morning and evening doses of blinded study inhalers on the day preceding a study visit will also have their data from that 
visit removed. 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
89 (129)[IP_ADDRESS] Morning pre-dose trough FEV 1
The co-primary endpoint of change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1 is defined 
as the average of the -60 and -30 minute pre-dose values at each visit minus baseline. Baseline 
is defined as the average of the non-missing -60 minute and -30 minute values obtained prior to dosing at Visit 3.
In patients missing either of these pre-dose assessments, the value will be calculated from the 
single measurement. In patients missing both pre-dose values, morning pre-dose trough FEV
1 
at that visit will not be calculated.
The change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FVC will be derived similarly.
[IP_ADDRESS] Peak FEV [ADDRESS_512851]-dose.
[IP_ADDRESS] Increase in FEV [ADDRESS_512852]-dosing
To assess the early onset of action, a secondary endpoint of this study will be the proportion of 
patients with increase of FEV 1 of ≥100 ml from baseline at 5 minutes on day 1. Only data 
assigned to the 5 minute window will be used to determine response. Patients with missing data will be considered to be non-responders for the analysis.
Additional categorical endpoints will be derived similarly as the proportion of patients with 
increase of FEV
1 of ≥150 ml from baseline at 5 minutes and the proportion of patients with 
increase of FEV 1 of ≥12% from baseline at 5 minutes.
8.4.4 Patient Reported Outcomes 
[IP_ADDRESS] Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal scoreAs a secondary endpoint assessing dyspnea, the TDI focal score will be derived at post-
randomisation visits relative to the baseline severity of dyspnea assessed using the BDI at visit 
3. The BDI and TDI consist of 3 individual components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. These are summed to form a baseline total score for BDI (range 
0-12) and a total TDI score (range -9 to +9). For the TDI, at each visit, if a response to any of 
the three questions is missing, then the focal score will also be considered missing. Otherwise, scoring and handling of missing items will be conducted in accordance with the user’s guide 
for the TDI score.

Date 14 July 2017
90 (129)The percentage of patients achieving the threshold of 1 unit or more in TDI focal score will be 
derived at each visit. For the TDI responder analyses, patients with missing data will be 
considered to be non-responders for the analysis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Early Morning Symptoms COPD Instrument (EMSCI) and Night Time 
Symptoms COPD Instrument (NiSCI)
Patients will complete a daily ePRO questionnaire of their COPD symptoms with two parts 
covering symptoms “last night” and “this morning”.
The change from baseline in the 6-item EMSCI Symptom Severity Score is a secondary 
endpoint. This is derived by [CONTACT_406818] a patient on the six item-level symptom scores
The change from baseline in the 6-item NiSCI Symptom Severity Score will also be assessed. 
The change from baseline in the Overall COPD Symptom Severity score, Early Morning Activity score and Night-time Awakenings score will also be derived.
Each daily measure will be aggregated based upon the time periods between clinic visits. Data 
from the day of the clinic visit will not be used in these aggregates. These periods will be specified in detail in the SAP. If the measure is available on more than half of the days in a given period then an aggregate score will be computed as the average of all present daily values. Otherwise the score will be considered missing for that period. ePRO data recorded during the last 7 days of the screening period prior to Visit 3 will be used to calculate the baseline.
[IP_ADDRESS] COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score
The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is used to quantify the impact of COPD symptoms on 
health status. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40, and it is calculated as the sum of the responses given for each of the 8 items (scored on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5), with higher scores indicating a higher impact of COPD symptoms on health status. If the response to 1 of the 8 items is missing, the missing item will be considered equal to the average of the 7 non-missing items for that patient. If more than 1 item is missing the score will be considered missing.
The change from baseline in CAT score will be derived at each visit relative to the baseline at 
visit 3. The percentage of patients achieving a MCID threshold for CAT of 2 units or more
will be derived at each visit, with patients with missing data considered to be non-responders.
[IP_ADDRESS] Daily rescue medication use
The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be recorded in the patient 
ePRO in the morning and evening and these summed. The mean daily number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be calculated overall and in time periods between

8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Trough FEV 1
The co-primary analysis of trough FEV 1will be conducted using the Per Protocol analysis set. 
The change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1will be analysed using a linear 
mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The model will include baseline 
FEV 1and bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI as continuous 
covariates and stratification factors (prior treatment - rescue/maintenance monotherapy vs 
double maintenance therapy), region, visit, treatment, and treatment by [CONTACT_765], as categorical 
covariates (fixed effects). Patient will be considered a random effect. Baseline is defined as the average of the non-missing -[ADDRESS_512855] will be used to obtain an estimate of the treatment difference over the entire 24-
week Treatment Period with two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and 97.5% CI. Non-inferiority will be concluded using a 1-sided hypothesis test according to a significance level 
of either 1.25% or 2.5% based upon the hierarchical testing and recycling procedure described 
in section [IP_ADDRESS] . This is equivalent to the lower bound of the 95% or 97.5% 2-sided 
confidence interval being greater than the pre-specified margin of -50 mL. 1-sided p-values 
will be produced accordingly.
From the same model contrasts will also be used to produce estimates of the treatment 
difference at each individual time-point (for example at week 24).
A similar analysis will be conducted in the full analysis set using all data obtained while on 
treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peak FEV
[ADDRESS_512856] be conducted in the Per Protocol analysis set. The estimates of treatment difference over 24 weeks and associated 95% and 97.5% 2-sided CIs will be referred to a non-inferiority margin of -50mL.
The Full Analysis Set will be used to assess the consistency of the non-inferiority conclusion 
using all evaluable data and a similar repeated measures model. This model will then be used for the formal assessment of superiority hypotheses. Testing of non-inferiority and superiority will be at a significance level of either 1.25% or 2.5% based upon the hierarchical testing and recycling procedure described in section [IP_ADDRESS] . 1-sided p-values will be produced 
accordingly for both non-inferiority analyses and the superiority analysis.
Contrasts will be used to produce estimates at individual visits.

93 (129)[IP_ADDRESS] Hierarchical testing strategy – primary endpoints
In order to strongly control the 1-sided type I error rate at 2.5% across all co-primary endpoint 
hypothesis tests and the non-inferiority hypothesis tests of the secondary endpoints a 
hierarchical testing procedure with recycling will be defined. 
To account for the multiplicity of the two co-primary endpoints, the test mass (1 sided alpha 
of 2.5%) will initially be split equally between the tests of the non-inferiority null hypothesis 
for each of trough FEV 1and peak FEV 1(1-sided alpha of 1.25% each).
Should either of these null hypotheses be rejected, the test mass will be recycled ( Burman et al 
2009 ), as described in Figure [ADDRESS_512857] as follows:
∀ from trough FEV 1non-inferiority testing to peak FEV 1non-inferiority testing
∀ from peak FEV 1non-inferiority testing to peak FEV 1superiority testing
∀ from peak FEV 1superiority testing to trough FEV 1non-inferiority testing
As such, respective hypothesis tests will be conducted at either a 1-sided 1.25% or 2.5% 
significance level depending upon this recycling.
Figure 2 Testing hierarchy for primary endpoints
NI = Non-inferiority, Sup = Superiority
Should all three null hypotheses relating to the co-primary endpoints be rejected then testing 
will proceed to the secondary endpoints using a 1-sided 2.5% significance level.

94 (129)8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Hierarchical testing strategy – secondary endpointsA sequential testing hierarchy will be defined so as to strongly control 1-sided type I error at 
2.5% across all non-inferiority hypothesis tests of secondary endpoints. The secondary 
endpoints over [ADDRESS_512858] their respective non-inferiority margins in the following sequence using a 1-sided significance level of 2.5%: 
1. Peak change from baseline in Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_406786] [ADDRESS_512859]-dosing over 
24 weeks (non-inferiority with option to proceed to superiority), 
2. Proportion of patients with increase of FEV
1 of ≥100 ml from baseline at 5 minutes 
on Day 1 (superiority only), 
3. Change from baseline in TDI focal score over 24 weeks (non-inferiority only)4. Change from baseline in EMSCI  Symp tom Severity Score over 24 weeks (non-
inferiority with option to proceed to superiority),
If non-inferiority is demonstrated for an endpoint, then testing may proceed to the next 
endpoint in the hierarchy, and a superiority test of the endpoint will also be conducted in the 
full analysis set for those endpoints indicated. Proceeding to the next endpoint is not 
contingent on demonstrating superiority.
An exception to this sequential non-inferiority/superiority testing procedure is the secondary 
endpoint Onset of action (proportion of patients with increase in FEV
1 of ≥100 ml from 
baseline at 5 minutes at day 1). For this endpoint, superiority testing will immediately be carried out and superiority is required in order to move to the next step in the testing 
hierarchy.
This sequential testing hierarchy is illustrated in Figure 3 :

be used to assess the consistency of the non-inferiority conclusion using all evaluable data and a similar repeated measures model. This model will be used for the formal assessment of superiority hypotheses and 1-sided p-values and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced.
Contrasts will be used to produce estimates at individual visits. Other continuous pulmonary 
function endpoints such as morning pre-dose trough and peak post-dose FVC and AUC

FEV 1and FVC will be analysed similarly. Estimated treatment differences will be interpreted 
using 95% CIs, but will not be formally assessed for non-inferiority.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary Function at Day [ADDRESS_512862]-dosing, the proportion of patients achieving an 
improvement from baseline in FEV 1 of ≥100 ml will be estimated for each treatment. Logistic 
regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with baseline and bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI as continuous covariates and treatment, region and stratification factors as categorical covariates. This analysis will use the full analysis set and proceed immediately to testing of the superiority hypothesis. One-sided p-values and odds ratios with 2-sided 95% CI will be produced.
Similar analyses will be conducted at 5 minutes on day 1 using alternative thresholds (increase 
in FEV
1 of ≥150 ml from baseline and increase in FEV 1 of ≥12% from baseline).
[IP_ADDRESS] Transition Dyspnea Index Focal Score
The difference between treatment groups in TDI over 24 weeks will be evaluated using a 
similar MMRM approach as for the co-primary endpoints. The model will include BDI (in place of baseline) and bronchodilator responsiveness as continuous covariates. Stratification factors, region, visit, treatment, and treatment by [CONTACT_406831]. Patient will be considered a random effect. 
One-sided p-values and point estimates with two-sided 95% CIs will be produced for the 
treatment difference over 24 weeks. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower bound of this confidence interval is greater than the pre-specified margin of -1.0 units (the minimum clinically important difference). Estimates of treatment difference will also be produced at each individual timepoint. A supportive analysis will also be produced using the Full Analysis Set.
The individual components of the TDI: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and 
magnitude of effort will also be summarised. Furthermore as supportive analyses, responder analyses will be performed at each visit, where responders are defined as a response of 1.0 point or more. Logistic regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with BDI as a continuous covariate and treatment group, region and stratification factors as categorical covariates. Odds ratios with 95% CIs will be produced.

severity score over [ADDRESS_512863]. 
One-sided p-values and point estimates with two-sided 95% CIs will be produced for the 
treatment difference over 24 weeks. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower bound of this confidence interval is greater than the pre-specified margin of -0.1 units. Estimates of treatment difference will also be produced at each individual time-point. 
If non-inferiority is demonstrated in the Per Protocol analysis then the Full Analysis Set will

Estimates of treatment differences will be produced similarly for the NiSCI symptom severity 
score. These will be interpreted using 95% CIs, but will not be formally assessed for non-inferiority. Other sub-scales and responses will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].
[IP_ADDRESS] COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score
The difference between treatment groups in the change from baseline in CAT score over 24 
weeks will be evaluated using a similar MMRM approach as for the co-primary endpoints. Treatment differences will be interpreted using 95% CIs in relation to a non-inferiority margin 
of 2 units.
Responder analyses will be performed at each visit, where responders are defined as a 
response of 2 units or more. Logistic regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with baseline CAT score as a continuous covariates and treatment group, region and stratification factors as categorical covariates. Odds ratios with 95% CI will be produced for each treatment comparison.

8.5.3 Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analyses of the co-primary endpoints will be produced according to prior treatment 
at entry (rescue therapy only, single maintenance therapy, LABA/LAMA maintenance 
therapy, LABA/ICS maintenance therapy).
Selected symptomatic endpoints will be analysed within subgroups of patients with varying 
levels of baseline symptom scores as measured by [CONTACT_63906].
Further subgroup analyses may be defined in the SAP.8.5.4 Interim analysis - Not applicable
No interim analyses are planned for this study.
8.5.5 Sensitivity analysis 
Although the co-primary and secondary endpoints are primarily addressed using estimates of 
the effects over 24 weeks contrasts will also be used to produce estimates at each individual visit. 
As described in Section 8.3, the co-primary analyses and all other non-inferiority analyses in 
this study will primarily be conducted using the per protocol analysis set and non-inferiority comparisons will also be conducted in the full analysis set to assess consistency when all 
patients and evaluable data are used. 
The methods used primarily in these analyses rely on the assumption that data is missing at 
random (MAR) given the covariates included in the models. Sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted to assess the robustness of conclusions to this assumption, including under Missing 
Not at Random (MNAR) scenarios. 
Multiple imputation methods will be used under varying assumptions about treatment effects 
in the unobserved data and assuming differing effects according to the patterns of missingness 
and reason for withdrawal. Full details will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening‘Life-threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death.  ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291427] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
∀ Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
∀ Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
∀ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
∀ Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76356]
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix A

Study Code D5970C00002Version 2

109 (129)∀ Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of 
the suspect drug?
∀ Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?
∀ De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]?
∀ No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_377645], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
∀ Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or support a 
re-challenge.
∀ Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
∀ Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
∀ Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility

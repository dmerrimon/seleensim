SCHEMA  
 
DESIGN   
HILLCLIMBER is a randomized, controlled, open -label phase II trial  of moderate 
dose statin therapy versus high -dose statin therapy  in HIV -infected persons taking 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) who have coronary heart disease (CHD)  or are at high 
risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease .  All subjects will have an initial two -
week run -in period  with pravastatin 40mg dail y. Subjec ts not demonstrating 
significant toxicity at week 2 will then be randomized to rosuvastatin 20mg versus 
continuing pravastatin 40mg daily. At week 6; those in the rosuvastatin arm who do 
not demonstrate significant clinical or laboratory safety/ toxicity  issues  will then have 
doses increased to rosuvastatin 40mg (high intensity dose group). The group 
randomized to pravastatin 40mg daily at week [ADDRESS_468492] their dose increased 
at the end of week 6  (moderate intensity group) .  
• The primary endpoint is percent change in low -density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL -c) from Week 2 to 14 of high versus moderate intensity lipid -lowering 
statin therapy  
 
DURATION  Total duration of the study is 14 weeks: 2 weeks for the initial run -in, 12 weeks 
on therapy as per randomization (weeks 6-14 with  possible dose increase ).  
 
SAMPLE SIZE  [ADDRESS_468493] 
coronary heart disease (CHD)  or are at high risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, which includes myocardial infarction and 
stroke) as evidenced by 10 -year ASCVD risk of 15.0% or gr eater.  
  
REGIMEN    The following treatment regimens will be used:  
Stage One (Run -in): Pravastatin 40mg daily (Weeks 0 -2),  
Stage Two (Randomization in 1:1 ratio):   
• Moderate intensity group : Pravastatin 40mg daily (Weeks 2 -14)   
OR 
• High intensity group : Rosuvastatin 20mg daily (Weeks 2 -6), titrated to 
Rosuvastatin 40mg daily (Weeks 6 -14). 
 
  
 
1.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
• To evaluate the lipid -lowering efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_374210]-density

    Version 4.0, March [ADDRESS_468494] coronary heart disease (CHD)  or are at high risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).  
 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives   
 
To determine mean changes from week 2 to week 14 for patients randomized to high 
versus  moderate intensity statins  in the following : 
 
• Lipid parameters (HDL -c, triglycerides, and total cholesterol)  
• Inflammatory biomarkers (soluble CD163, ST2, high sensitivity troponin I, and high -
sensitivity C -reactive protein)  
• Immunologic markers ( T cell rea ctivity ) and viral reservoir persistence   
 
To evaluate safety, as measured by [CONTACT_3148] -emergent clinical and laboratory 
adverse events, of high versus moderate intensity statin therapy in HIV -infected 
persons taking ART who have coronary heart disease (C HD) or are at high risk for 
ASCVD .  
 
2.0 Background  
This study is a phase II investigation of the efficacy of high intensity versus moderate intensity 
lipid lowering statin therapy for HIV -infected persons with coronary heart disease (CHD)  and/or 
high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)  not already on high intensity lipid 
lowering therapy. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_374199] – in addition to efficacy – of high -intensity versus moderate -
intensity statin regimens for HIV -infected persons with CHD  and/or high risk for ASCVD . The 
study drugs (rosuvastatin and pravastatin) are approved and in regular clinical use, but 
rosuvastatin is being repurposed in thi s study for a new population in which there are no data 
for the higher intensity therapy under study.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_468495] two decades, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved longevity 
among persons living with human immunodeficienc y virus (HIV), who are increasingly at risk 
for non -communicable comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). (1 -5) Compared 
with uninfected persons, persons living with HIV are at 50% or greater risk for myocardial 
infarction (MI), even after adjus tment for CVD risk factors, and over fourfold greater risk for 
sudden cardiac death. (6 -13) Standard care for persons with coronary heart disease (CHD),  
which include s previous acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and MI, in the general population 
includes intensive lipid lowering with high dose statin therapy, such as rosuvastatin 20 -40mg 
daily or atorvastatin 40 -80mg daily, due to high -quality clinical trial data demonstrating 
significant net clinical benefits of inte nsive lipid lowering with high dose statins compared with 
less intensive lipid lowering with lower dose statins. (14 -16) The importance of intensive lipid 
lowering following coronary events has been re -affirmed by a recent trial in which patients 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374200] a statin plus ezetimibe versus a statin alone achieved 
lower LDL -c levels (median LDL -c 53.7 mg/dl versus 69.5 mg/dl) and experienced improved 
cardiovascular outcomes without excess adverse events. (17) Furthermore, the most recen t 
American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) evidence -based 
guidelines recommend that persons with predicted 10 -year ASCVD risks of 7.5% or greater be 
prescribed moderate -to-high-intensity statins; the absolute net benefit of int ensifying statin 
  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March 1 5, 2017  
9 
 therapy becomes even  greater  and thus favors high intensity statin therapy  at higher ASCVD 
risk levels. (18) 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_374201], it remains unknown whether intensive 
lipid lowering with high dose stati ns for HIV-infected persons with known CHD and/or high risk 
for ASCVD  confers clinical benefit. Trials of lipid -lowering therapy among persons living with 
HIV on ART have generally tested lower dose statins due to safety concerns related to 
theoretical and  observed drug -drug interactions between ARTs, particularly protease inhibitors 
(PIs), and statins. Some of this is warranted; simvastatin is contraindicated with concomitant 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_374202], as simvastatin levels increase 
more than fivefold with concomitant PI [CONTACT_3225]. (18) However, most other statins have proven safe 
and efficacious in numerous small trials of HIV -infected persons on ART, albeit at relatively 
low doses. (1 9) The most potent statin doses tested in thes e trials have generally been 
rosuvastatin 10mg daily or atorvastatin 10mg daily ( 20-24); a lone exception is a recent trial in 
which 19 HIV -infected persons were started on atorvastatin 20mg daily and titrated up to 40mg 
daily, which revealed similar safet y profiles of atorvastatin 40mg daily and placebo. (2 5) No 
trials of any size have evaluated HIV -infected persons on ART taking atorvastatin 80mg daily 
or rosuvastatin [ADDRESS_468496] of care  for persons with CHD, 
particularly previou s ACS, as well as persons with high ASCVD risk, in the general population.  
 
In this study, we intend to evaluate high intensity rosuvastatin (20mg daily uptitrated to  40mg 
daily) rather than atorvastatin 80mg daily because rosuvastatin 40mg daily has somew hat 
greater LDL -lowering efficacy and fewer pharmacological interactions with common HIV 
medications, particularly protease inhibitors. Rosuvastatin is not lipophilic, absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], 
and minimally (<10%) metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]450 system, resulting in ne gligible 
pharmacokinetic interactions with protease inhibitors or other CYP450 -metabolized 
medications; meanwhile, atorvastatin is more lipophilic and metabolized extensively by [CONTACT_191700]450 system, resulting in potential toxicity due to accumulation in the setting of co -
administration with protease inhibitors and other CYP450 -metabolized medications. (2 6) Thus, 
although rosuvastatin and atorvastatin both appear to be safe based on limited data in HIV -
infected persons taking ART, we anticipated that the safet y margin would be greater for high -
dose rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin in this population. This a randomized, controlled, 
open -label Phase II study of a known approved drug re -purposed for a unique population.

week 6; those in the rosuvastatin arm who do not demonstrate significant safety or toxicity  concerns  
will then have doses increased to rosuvastatin 40mg (high dose group). The  group randomized to 
pravastatin 40mg daily at week [ADDRESS_468498] their dose increased at the end of week 6.

5.0 STUDY TREATMENT  
5.1 Regimens, Administration, and Duration  
 
After a 2 -week pravastatin 40mg daily run -in period, s ubjects will be randomly assigned to 
rosuvastatin 20mg daily or pravastatin 40mg daily at week 2 in a 1:[ADDRESS_468510] their dose escalated to 40mg daily.    
 
Run-in:  Pravastatin 40mg daily for 2 weeks (Weeks 0 -2)  
  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March 1 5, 2017  
13 
 Randomization (1:1 ratio) at Week 2 :   
o Moderate intensity strategy : Pravastatin 40mg once daily for 12 weeks (Weeks 2 -14)   
OR 
o High-intensity strategy : Rosuvastatin 20mg once daily for 4 weeks (Weeks 2 to 6)  
o Continue Rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (Weeks 6 to 14) if:  
▪ AST or ALT between 1.5x and 3x ULN  
OR 
▪ CK between 3x and 10x ULN  
OR 
▪ Grade 1 or 2 toxicity attributable to rosuvastatin is present  
o Escalation of Rosuvastatin to 40 mg daily  (Weeks 6 to 14) if:   
▪ AST, ALT, and CK < 1.5x ULN at week 6   
AND  
▪ CK ≤3x ULN at week 6  
AND  
▪ No grade [ADDRESS_468511] will 
dispense 2 weeks ( 15 tablets ) of pravastatin 40 mg at week 0  to all part icipants .  At 
week 2, subjects will be randomized to receive either 12 weeks ( 3 bottles, 90  tablets) 
of rosuvastatin 20 mg tablets or 12 weeks ( 85 tablets) of pravastatin 40 mg tablets.   
Based on LFTs , CK, and safety/toxicity assessments at  Week 6, participants in the 
rosuvastatin arm will be notified within 5 days whether or not they are to escalate to 
two 20mg tablets daily or continue taking one tablet daily.  If the dose is escalated, 
participants will need to return to the pharmacy within the next 4 weeks to receive an 
additional supply of 30 tablets (1 bottle) of rosuvastatin 20mg.  
At the Week 14 visit, subjects should  return any remaining study -provided study 
products.  
 
5.1.2  Administration  
 
Pravastatin will be administered orally as one 40 mg tablet once daily  with or without 
food.  
 
Rosuvastatin will be administered orally as one or two (high -dose) 20 mg tablet (s) once 
daily with or without food .

  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March [ADDRESS_468529] management, dose interruptions, modifications, and discontinuation of 
study treatment will be ma ndated only for toxicities attributable to study -provided  drugs 
(pravastatin and rosuvastatin ).  
 
The grading system for drug toxicities is the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.0, Novem ber 2014, located at                              
http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/gradingtables.aspx .  
 
The lone difference between the grading system for drug toxicitie s used in this trial and the 
DAIDS Table is that our protocol has a lower threshold for grading transaminase (AST and 
ALT) elevations; based on the current ACC/AHA and National Lipid Association Guidelines, 
we consider elevation of AST or ALT ≥3x ULN  as gr ounds for holding the study drug (and a 
grade 3 a dverse event in this protocol), and CK ≥10x ULN as a grade 3 adverse event and 
grounds for holding the study drug.  
 
NOTE:  The HILLCLIMBER protocol chair must be notified by e -mail regarding toxicities that 
result in regimen interruption or discontinuation. Email : [EMAIL_7230] . 
General guidelines presented in sections 7.1.[ADDRESS_468530] should be followed closely and if the toxicity does not return to 
Grade [ADDRESS_468531] the study drug permanently 
discontinued, with clinical assessments and laboratory testing as described for Grade 3 
toxicity. If the investigator fe els that the toxicity is clearly related to another cause and 
that the toxicity is not caused by [CONTACT_5257], and after consultation with the study 
team, dosing may continue when the toxicity has resolved to Grade 2 or less.  
  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March 1 5, 2017

For any symptomatic  (eg, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, rash 
or eosinophilia) ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_468537] (Grade 3), study drug should be held. Subjects 
should be asked to return to the research site for repeat testing [ADDRESS_468538]  is ≤[ADDRESS_468539]  >[ADDRESS_468540] (Grade 4),  the study drug should be discontinued. The 
subject should be brought back for repeat testing every [ADDRESS_468541]

the study drug  will not be restarted at that time.  
 
NOTE:  If the Grade 3 or 4 elevation is clearly related to another cause and not related 
to study drug ( eg, acute hepatitis A infection), the subject should be brought back for 
repeat testing every [ADDRESS_468544] ≤[ADDRESS_468545] 
evaluations as per section 6.2.4.  
 
NOTE:  For those subjects with ALT  or AST  >[ADDRESS_468546] upon repeat testing, whether 
symptomatic or not, INR should also be performed (in addition to bilirubin and alkaline 
phosphatase, which will be evaluated with ALT and AST routinely) as part of the study 
to help determine etiology of increased LFTs. Other labs including hepatitis serologies 
may also be indicated and performed in the context of clinical care by [CONTACT_200808].

7.1.3  Myalgias and Myopathy  
 
Persons who present with significant myalgias (Grade ≥3, ie, muscle pain causing 
inability to perform usual so cial and functional activities) should be evaluated with a 
clinical assessment that includes an evaluation of CK, serum creatinine, potassium, 
and urinalysis. Myopathy is defined as muscle aches, soreness, tenderness, or 
weakness with creatinine kinase (CK ) >[ADDRESS_468548] not related to exercise or other 
causes, including trauma. If the symptoms are associated with Grade 3 elevation in 
CK ([ADDRESS_468549]) (see table below) that is not related to exercise or other cause , study 
medications should be permanently discont inued. Subjects will be followed on study, 
off treatment through the study termination visit with subject evaluations as per section 
6.2.4.  
 
NOTE:  Mitochondrial  toxicity related to nucleoside therapy and not related to study

  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March [ADDRESS_468557] CHD  and/or calculated 10 -year ASCVD risk >15% will be 
included and started on moderate dose statin therapy (pravastatin 40mg daily) for an initial two -
week run -in period. Subjects not demonstrating significant toxicity at week 2 will then be 
randomized to high intensity statin therapy ( rosuvastatin 20 mg) versus continuing moderate 
intensity statin therapy ( pravastatin 40mg daily ). At week 6, s ubjects  in the rosuvastatin arm who 
do not demonstrate significant toxicity and whose LDL -c is >60mg/dl and decreased by [CONTACT_21316] 
25% compared with week [ADDRESS_468558] doses increased to rosuvastatin 40mg (high dose 
group).  Efficacy and safety will be evaluated at Week 14.   
  
9.2 Endpoints  
 
9.2.1  Primary Endpoint s:  
 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint is mean percent change in fasting LDL-c 
(mg/dl) from week 2 (end of run -in period) to week 14   
 
▪ The mean percent change in fasting LDL-c from week 2 to week 14 will be 
compared for the high dose group (rosuvastatin 20mg daily uptitrated to 40mg 
daily) and the moderate dose group (pravasta tin 40mg daily).  
 
Safety :   
▪ All treatment -emergent adverse events, including  but not limited to :  
• Incidence of adverse event -related study drug discontinuation (following 
initial 2 week wash -in) or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
• Grade 3 or greater adverse events;  
• Study d rug-related symptoms  
• CK elevation > 3x upper limit of normal;  
• AST or ALT elevation >3x upper limit of normal;  
 
9.2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
 
Secondary endpoints include mean percent changes in the following from week 2 to 
week 14:  
• Lipid parameters (HDL -c, triglycerides, and total cholesterol),  
• Inflammatory biomarkers (soluble CD163, ST2, high sensitivity troponin 
I, high -sensitivity CRP, PAI -1, Lp -PLA2)  
• Viral and immunologic  markers derived from PBMCs (such as T cell 
reactivity and viral reservoir persistence).  
• Statin drug levels >400% expected steady -state dose level  
• Hemoglobin A1c level  
 
An additional secondary endpoint will evaluate safety, as measured by [CONTACT_3148] -
  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March [ADDRESS_468559] coronary heart disease 
(CHD)  and/or 15% or greater risk for ASCVD .  
 
 
9.3 Randomization and Stratificati on  
 
Subjects who meet enrollment criteria will be randomized at Week 2 in a 1:[ADDRESS_468560].   Randomization will be stratified by : (1) 
type of ART: patients taking any booster (ritonavir or cobi cistat) as part of their ART regimen 
and patients not taking a booster ; and (2) known CHD or not.  
 
9.4  Sample size and Accrual  
 
The predicted percent reduction in LDL -c by [CONTACT_374222]: 20mg (55 -60%), 
and 40mg (60 -63%). The predicted percent reduction in LDL -c by [CONTACT_374223] 40mg is 30%. 
The expected difference in LDL -c for subjects receiving high (rosuvastatin 20 -40mg daily) 
versus moderate (pravastatin 4 0mg daily) intensity statin doses in this study is therefore 
approximately 25 -30% compared with moderate. In a landmark study of patients  with CHD  
comparing high intensity statin (atorvastatin 80mg, which is similar in intensity of expected lipid 
lowering to rosuvastatin 20 -40mg) versus pravastatin 40mg, mean LDL cholesterol levels 
during treatment were 62mg/dl and 95mg/dl for high intensity and pravastatin groups (with 
standard deviations of approximately 20mg/dl), respectively.  
 
Given potentially lower b aseline LDL cholesterol levels in this study (we expect mean LDL of 
participants  will be approximately 105, including patients off statin therapy and those on low 
intensity therapy), realistic expected mean LDL cholesterol levels are 75mg/dl for the 
prava statin group and 50mg/dl for the high -intensity/rosuvastatin group. These expected LDL 
cholesterol levels are similar to those seen in the high intensity versus lower intensity 
treatment groups in a more recent trial of lipid -lowering strategies in high -risk patients, in which 
there was no excess of adverse events in the higher -intensity group which achieved a mean 
LDL of 53.7mg. In order to have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_468561] a 
25mg/dl difference in LDL -c lowering with a standard deviation of LDL -c of 20, the desired 
sample size would be at least 11 cases and 11 controls. Given the potential for study drug 
discontinuation in an expected 8 or fewer patients (based on on -treatment symptoms being 
present in 5 -20% of patients on statin s), the goal subject enrollment for this study is 30  with a 
possible enrollment of up to 50 participants in order to ensure adequate power . 
 
9.5 Monitoring  
 
When approximately 50% of patients have completed the study through week 6, an interim 
analysis for  safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_82571]. Patients 
with levels of CK, AST, ALT at weeks [ADDRESS_468562] the study drug discontinued at that time. If >25% of study enro llees are 
required to have the study drug discontinued at the interim analysis, the trial will be stopped. 
Serious adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_374224]. If a study patient has CK, AST, or ALT levels of 3 times the upper limit of normal or 
greater any time prior to the interim safety analysis, the study coordinator will alert the medical 
safety officer (Kunal N. Karmali, MD), who will contact [CONTACT_374225]. Such patients who discontinue the study drug at the 
  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March 1 5, 2017  
28 
 medical safety officer’s request will continue to be followed in the study and included in 
intention -to-treat analyses.  
 
9.6 Analyses  
 
9.6.1  Primary Anaysis  
Lipid measurements from week 2 and week 14 will be used for analyses of the primary 
endpoints. We will use intention -to-treat analyses for evaluation of the primary endpoint and 
logistic regressions to compare percent change in LDL -c from week 2 to week 14 for t he high -
intensity statin group versus the lower intensity statin group .   
 
The primary analysis will evaluate percent changes in LDL -c at week 14 compared with week 
2 (following wash -in with pravastatin 40mg daily) for patients randomized to a high intensi ty 
versus lower intensity strategy. Two -sample t -tests will be performed using STATA version 14 
(Stata Statistical Software: Release 14; College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).  
 
9.6.2 Secondary Analyses  
 Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by [CONTACT_12922].    
Adverse event s (signs, symptoms, and diagnose s) will be analyzed and reported using the 
AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) medical dictionary and standardized coding for Signs, 
Symptoms, and Diagnoses for Clinical and Adverse Events.  Adverse events will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_374226], the 
rate of occurrence, and the severity and relationship to study drug.    
 
Incidence of clinical and/or laboratory toxicities. The saf ety and tolerability measures will 
include : 
-  Time to discontinuation of any study medication due to adverse events (AEs), -- 
Proportion of Grade [ADDRESS_468563] not be identified by [CONTACT_374227]. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_374228].  
10.2 Role of Data Management  
 
10.2.1 Instructions concerning the  recording of study data on CRFs will be provided by [CONTACT_374229] . The Research Electronic  
Data Capture ( REDC ap)  data management system will be used .   
  HILLCLIMBER  
    Version 4.0, March [ADDRESS_468564] records, including consent forms, CRFs, 
supporting data, laboratory specimen records, and medical records (physicians’ 
progress notes, nurses’ notes, individuals’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]), to ensure protection of 
study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of 
records. The monitors also will inspect sites’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory 
requirements are being followed and sites’ pharmacies , and  to review product storage 
and management.  
10.3.2  The s ite investigator will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, drug distribution 
forms, CRFs) and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374207], the site monitors, the FDA, the OHRP, and the pharmaceutical support er(s) or 
designee for confirmation of the study data.  
10.4 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
The adverse events (AEs) that must be reported in an expedited fashion to the IND Sponsor 
([CONTACT_374235] -Jones  at Northwestern University)  are all serious adverse events (SAEs)  as 
defined by [CONTACT_374230] (ICH) guidelines regardless of 
relationship to the study agent(s) . The protocol for reporting AEs will be as follows:  
o We will report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions to 
the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products no later than 7 calendar days 
after initial receipt of the information [21 CFR 312.31(c)(2)].  
o We will submit 7 -day reports by [CONTACT_374231] (facsimile or email) and 
will address each submission to the Regulatory Product Manager and/or to the Chief, 
Project Management Staff;  
o We will report any (1) serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions, (2) findings 
from other clinical, animal, or in -vitro studies that suggest significant human risk, and 
(3) a clinically important increase in the rate of a serious s uspected adverse reaction to 
the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products and to all investigators no later 
than 15 calendar days after determining that the information qualifies for reporting.  
 
SAEs as defined by [CONTACT_374232]: deaths, life -threatening events, events that require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], events that result in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, and congenital anomalies or birth defects. Important medical events as 
assessed by [CONTACT_74559] l and scientific judgment may also be considered SAEs by [CONTACT_374233].  Possible drug -induced liver injury is also 
considered an SAE in this study and requires expedited reporting.  
 
The study agents that m ust be considered in determining relationships of AEs requiring 
expedited reporting to the IND Sponsor are pravastatin and rosuvastatin.    
 
The DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE 
Grading Table), Version 2.0, November 2014, must be used and is available at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/gradingtables.aspx .    
 
Any SAE occurring during the study and up to [ADDRESS_468565]. 
Donald Lloyd -Jones at [PHONE_7748]  within 24 hours  of awareness.  The IND Sponsor and 
the HILLCLIMBER Principle Investigat or and Research Manager  should be alerted about the 
faxed form by [CONTACT_63822] [EMAIL_7230]  and 
[EMAIL_7234]  with the title: HILLCLIMBER  SAE REPORT.   
   
The FDA also requires sponsors to submit a written Safety Report of all serious and 
unexpected AEs . The study investigators in this study have the responsibility of promptly 
reporting all SAEs so that IND Sponsor can comply with these regulations.  A non -blinded 
safety officer (Kunal N. Karmali, MD) will be available to review SAEs and  determine the 
potential relation of the study drug to SAEs.  
 
The protocol -defined expedited event reporting period for this protocol is the entire study 
duration for an individual subject (from study enrollment until study completion or 
discontinuation of the subject from s tudy participation for any reason).  
 
After the end of the protocol -defined reporting period stated above, sites must report serious, 
unexpected, suspected adverse drug reactions if the study site staff becomes aware of the 
event on a passive basis, i.e., f rom publicly available information.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_468566] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
 
This protocol and the informed consent document (Appendix II) and any subsequent 
modifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_374234]. A signed consent form will be obtained from the subject 
(or legal guardian or person with power of attorney for subjects who cannot consent for 
themselves). The consent form will descr ibe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be 
followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy of the consent form will be given to 
the subject or legal guardian, and this fact will be documented in the subject’s record.

dissection ) 
 Freedom from major amputation at 30d, 6mo & 12mo  
 Freedom from death at 30d, 6mo & 12mo

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition where arteries become narrowed due to plaque and 
thrombus buildup and this reduces blood flow to the limbs. Millions of Americans are affected 
by [CONTACT_645367]. Individuals with PAD have an increased risk for 
heart disease, aortic aneurysms, stroke and an increased mortality. Due to the prevalence of PAD 
in society, research is ongoing to help treat this disease. 1, 2  
 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has been one of the most widely used methods of 
treating PAD; however, it is well know that complications and patency rates are disappointing. 
Many studies have suggested combining PTA with a debulking therapy could provide better 
results so there is less tissue compressed. There are many atherectomy devices on the market, but 
to our knowledge, there is a need to determine the optimal algorithm to best treat PAD.3   
 
Ex
cimer laser ablation (ELA) has been performed since [ADDRESS_863860] devices received CE 
mark. There are many devices that modify or remove obstructions in the arteries, but the 
Excimer laser is unique as it ablates or vaporizes tissue at the catheter tip. The catheter contains 
optical fibers that transmit pulses of ultraviolet light at 308nm that break down blockages at the 
molecular level. The laser catheters ablate lesions consisting of plaque, thrombus, neointimal 
hyperplasia, and calcium. 
  
The
 Laser Angioplasty for Critical Ischemia (LACI) Registry used excimer laser catheters 
ranging from 0.9 to 2.5 mm to debulk infrainguinal arteries followed by [CONTACT_645368]. From visual assessment, baseline lesion stenosis was 92% ± 12% and after 
lase
r use, this decreased to 55% ±24% (p<0.001). 88% of lesions were located in the 
femoropopliteal arteries4. 
 
The
 CELLO Registry used excimer laser catheters to enlarge the lumen of the superficial femoral 
artery or proximal popliteal. A 2.0mm Turbo-Elite laser catheter was used to create a pi[INVESTIGATOR_645363]. The 
primary effectiveness endpoint for this study was a decrease of 20% or greater after all laser by 
[CONTACT_645369].  During the study the diameter stenosis was reduced from 77% ± 15% at 
baseline to 34.7% ± 17.8% post all laser5.  
 
The EXCITE Study used Turbo-Elite catheters to create a 2.0 mm pi[INVESTIGATOR_645364]-stent restenosis (ISR) lesions. Operators could use the Turbo-Elite 
for multiple passes and enlarging the lumen, but Turbo Tandem was the device used to conduct 
maximal debulking. This study was randomized to compare ELA + PTA to PTA only with the 
final mean diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_645370] 11.5% vs 18.1% respectively (p=0.004)6. 
The protocol was amended during the study to collect visual assessment data post Turbo-Elite. In 
94 patients, Turbo-Elite effectively reduced baseline stenosis from 88.3% ± 12.2% to 49.2% ± 
24.8% with an a
verage mean reduction of 39.1% ± 24.1%. In a post hoc core lab analysis, the 
baseline stenosis of 84.8% ± 14.7% was reduced to 58.1% ± 13.5% with an average mean 
reduction of 26.8% ± 14.3%.  
 
   
Page 4 of 12 Walker TurboPower+DCB Retro 20Mar2018 While studies have shown the decrease in stenosis with excimer laser atherectomy in a variety of 
lesion morphologies and arteries, there are no studies specific to Turbo Power laser atherectomy 
plus drug coated balloon in a variety of lesion morphologies. 
 
2. OBJECTIVE(S) 
 
The objective of this study is to determine outcomes of combined Turbo Power laser 
atherectomy plus drug coated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of femoropopliteal de 
novo/re
stenotic lesions and in-stent restenosis (ISR). Better understanding of these outcomes will 
help guide optimal treatment algorithms for this difficult to treat cohort of patients. 
 
3. DESIGN 
 
This is a retrospective, single-site, non-randomized study. Up to [ADDRESS_863861] be compliant with physician dischar ge instructions to 
be included in this cohort.  
 
Primary Endpoint: 
Rate of freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) at one year 
 
S
econdary Endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints consist of:  
 Procedural success (≤30% residual stenosis) 
 P rocedural safety (freedom from significant embolization (sequelae), or dissection) 
 Freedom from major amputation at 30d, 6mo & 12mo 
 F reedom from death at 30d, 6mo & 12mo 
 F reedom from TLR 6 months  
 P atency at 12 months (up to 20 patients) 
 
The device involved in this study is the Spectranetics’ Turbo Power laser catheter followed by 
[CONTACT_645371]. These devices are currently available in the [LOCATION_002]. The 
Tur
bo Power laser catheter is  currently indicated  for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease 
including
 treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Additionally, the two drug-coated balloons on 
the ma
rket in the [LOCATION_002] during this retrospective timeframe were IN.PACT Admiral 
(Medtronic) and Lutonix 035 ( CR B ard). They are both indicated for treatment of peripheral 
arterial disease and specifically, IN.PACT Admiral is indicated for ISR treatment. The present 
protocol does not involve invasive investigational interventions. 
 
4. S ELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
4.1 Study Population 
 
Patients will be recruited from the investigator ’s general patient population, and they must meet 
all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed below. 
 
   
Page 5 of 12 Walker TurboPower+DCB Retro 20Mar2018 4.2 Inclusion criteria 
 
All patients from Cardiovascular Institute of the South who were treated for femoropopliteal de 
novo/restenotic lesions or in-stent restenosis using Turbo Power laser atherectomy plus drug 
coated balloon angioplasty during 2016-2017. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_863862]’s participation may be discontinued at 
any time during the study.  The rationale for discontinuation must be documented in the 
source documentation and in the data collection form. 
 
Factors leading to discontinuation may include: 
 S ubject Withdrawal- A subject that has been consented prior to this amendment, 
may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or no reason at all.  Withdrawal 
should not affect the subject’s relationship with the physician, and no penalty or 
loss of benefits (if any) should occur. Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_645372].  
 I nvestigator Termination- An investigator may discontinue a subject in a study 
due to a significant adverse event or due to failure to cooperate with study 
requirements. 
 L ost- To-Follow- Up- Lost to follow-up is defined as the inability to obtain a 
response from the subject on three separate days.  These contacts may be 
telephone calls or emails to subject (or subject representative and/or primary care 
provider if subject unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]); however at least one effort should be a 
c
ertified letter to the subject’s last known address. 
 
 
4.4 Treatment Group 
 
Treatment was performed at the physician’s discretion. The subjects included in this 
retrospective study were treated with Turbo Power laser atherectomy as well as drug-coated 
balloon angioplasty. 
 
               
5. S AMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
5.1 The study is designed to include up to 120 patients. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic 
mean, median as indicated, minimum and maximum and standard deviation) will be 
calculated for continuous variables. Absolute frequencies and percentages will be 
obtained for qualitative variables. 95% Confidence intervals will be provided.  In 
   
Page 6 of 12 Walker TurboPower+DCB Retro 20Mar2018 calculation of percentages, patients with missing data will not be considered, unless 
otherwise specified.  All baseline characteristics will be summarized. Descriptive 
sta
tistics will be used to summarize the values and changes from baseline across time.

 1.0 Background  
 
Stroke and traumatic brain injury ( TBI) are leading causes of  long -term disability among 
Veterans and result in the need for care from informal caregivers after discharge to the home 
setting. T here are very few evidence -based, easy -to-deliver follow -up programs after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245847] (her) caregiver. The ANSWERS -VA intervention aims to provide the Veteran and 
caregiver dyad with a set of practical skills that each can use in copi[INVESTIGATOR_245848]. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_298891] a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) to evaluate (a) the efficacy of the “Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining 
Strengths for Veterans (ANSWERS -VA)” d yadic intervention with Veterans who have sustained a 
stroke and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their informal caregivers, and (b) estimate effect 
sizes for the ANSWERS -VA intervention. The ANSWERS -VA intervention will be compared with 
an educational intervention that will serve as an attention control group.  
Specific Aim 1:  To tailor the implementation of the ANSWERS -VA intervention to dyads (n=10) 
consisting of Veterans with stroke and/or TBI diagnoses  and their informal caregivers and 
modify the imp lementation processes for the RCT.  
Specific Aim 2:  To test the short -term , intermediate, and sustained efficacy of the intervention  
(baseline, 8, 12, 24 weeks, and 1 year)  for improving  the caregivers’ quality of life , task difficulty, 
threat appraisal, se lf-efficacy for caregiving, and optimism.  
Specific Aim 3 : To complete a cost effectiveness analysis of  the intervention in comparison to 
the attention control .  
Exploratory Aim 1:  To estimate the effect sizes for the dyad outcomes of  depressive symptoms, 
social participation, and quality of the dyadic relationship.   
 
3.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
For this study, an eligible, informal caregiver is defined as a family  member or significant other 
who is providing care for a Veteran stroke or a TBI survivor in the home setting. Table 2 provides 
inclusion and exclusion criteria for Veterans and caregivers . Eligibility will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_245861]/or caregiver self -report during a screening telephone interview ; however, study 
personnel may do a basic initial sc reen by [CONTACT_245862] ( CPRS ) when patient lists are obtained.

4.0 Procedures  
 
Recruitment -Participant Identification and Screening : The PI, graduate student interns,  and the 
project manager will be involved in pa rticipant identification and screening . We will use several 
methods to identify Veterans with stroke (hemorrhagic or acute ischemic) and TBI  and their 
caregivers :  
1) To identify Veterans  with recent admissions , we will run lists of patients who were admitted  
and discharged with stroke or TBI diagnoses. A waiver of consent and HIPAA will be 
obtained and the patients will be screened for inclusion criteria.  After obtaining approval 
from the provider, we will approach the patient and his/her caregiver  (in -perso n, phone, or 
mail) about participation in the study ; 
2) We will utilize the Veterans Health Information System (VistA) t o establish a list of 
Veterans/ caregivers with a diagnosis of stroke within the past 3 years ( 10/1/2011  thru 
present ) and TBI post -9/11/200 1. A waiver of consent and HIPAA will be obtained and the 
patients will be screened for inclusion criteria. After obtaining approval from the provider, 
we will approach the patient and his/her caregiver  (in -person, phone, or mail) about 
participation in t he study ; 
3) We will seek provider  referrals by [CONTACT_245864][INVESTIGATOR_245850], PM&R/TBI, and the Caregiver Program Case Manager (s); 
and 
4) Advertisements will be placed throughout the VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245851] s and/or 
caregivers can contact [CONTACT_3476] .  
VA HSR&D   NRI 12 -415-1 
IRB # [PHONE_5166]  
Version : 9-14-2015   Page 8 
 5) We will seek research referrals by [CONTACT_245865]/or TBI 
studies for which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245852] a collaborator (Co -I, Co -PI, or PI).  A waiver of consent and 
HIPAA will b e obtained and the patients will be screened for inclusion criteria.  After 
obtaining approval from the provider, we will approach the patient and his/her caregiver  
(in-person, phone, or mail) about participation in the study ; 
 
After the potential particip ants  have been identified through lists or referrals , we will obtain 
approval from the Veterans’ healthcare providers before we make contact [INVESTIGATOR_58016]. 
Veterans and their caregivers/next of kin will be contact[CONTACT_245866]: (1) s ome may be 
approached while they are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245853] a study 
brochure and basic information to let them know about the study, and (2) others will be mailed 
a recruitment packet. When a Veteran with a known caregiver is identif ied, the recruitment 
packet will contain  a recruitment letter, study brochure , 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_97341] s (VA 
Informed Consent Form and the VA Consent for Recording)  and HIPAA authorization form  (one 
each for the caregiver and the Veteran) , and a Volunteering in Research p amphlet ( as required 
by [CONTACT_20248]) (see Appendix A1.5). When we are unsure whether or not the Veteran has a caregiver, 
we will mail a recruitment packet that only contains a recruitment letter and our study 
pamphlet (see Appendix A 1.1). A  telephone number will be provided on the  recruitment letter  
for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_245854].  All recruitment 
materials can be found in Appendices  1.1-1.5 in section 11.0 .  
 
Approximately 1 week after recruitmen t packets are mailed, Veterans  and/or their next of kin 
will be telephoned by [CONTACT_245867]. We will make approximately [ADDRESS_298894] is made while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], patient and caregiver will be given the opportunity 
to be screened for eligibility and/or consented prior to discharge. Otherwise, patient and 
caregiver will be contact[CONTACT_245868] [ADDRESS_298895] review and/or discussions with 
providers, and potential participants will not be contact[CONTACT_245869]. We will obtain approval from the Chief of Medical Services, Neurology, 
Physical Medicine Rehabilitation (PMR), and the ACOS of Primary Care at both study sites to 
before we conduct the research. After  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_245855], Institutional Review Board 
(IRB), and VA Research & Development (R&D) approvals  are received , we will begin recruitment.  
 
Consent  and Enrollment.  The informed consent s and HIPAA authorization will be explained to 
interested  Veterans and their caregivers over the telephone  or in -person . If eligible and they 
consent, the Veterans and their caregiver s will sign and return the consent s and HIPAA 
authorization  to the study team by [CONTACT_2319], fax, or in -person . Each Veteran and caregiver (i.e., 
dyad) will receive  a copy of the signed consent s and HIPAA authorization. Con sented  dyad s will 
then be scheduled for a baseline data collection telephone interview.  Data collection will not 
occur until the consent s and HIPAA authorization s are received  by [CONTACT_3476] .   
 
Randomization to Groups.  Following enrollment , the statistician will randomly assign the dyads 
to either the ANSWERS -VA intervention  or the educational attention control  group using a block 
randomized approach with stratification on diag nosis (stroke dyad /TBI dyad ), recruitment site 
(two for stroke dyad s, two for TBI dyad s), type of relationship (spouse vs. adult child/other), 
VA HSR&D   NRI 12 -415-1

Version : 9-14-2015   Page 9 
 PTSD (stroke survivor/TBI survivor), and baseline depressive symptoms (non -depressed vs. 
depressed PHQ -9 > 5). SA S PROC PLAN78 will be used to create the randomized blocks within 
strata in order to obtain, as closely as possible, similar numbers and composition (balance) 
between the groups, and facilitate maintenance of blinding of data collector s. 
 
Baseline Data Col lection.  Veterans and their caregivers will be interviewed by a data collector  or 
the project manager for his (her) baseline interview. This interview will be completed by 
[CONTACT_756]. Interviews are expected to take approximately [ADDRESS_298896] convenient to the dyad. 
All data collection instruments including a table which re flects when each instrument is used  can 
be found in Appendi ces 8.1-8.3 (see section 11.0 ).   
 
ANSWERS -VA Intervention Procedures.  The ANSWERS -VA intervention  is delivered completely 
by [CONTACT_756] . Dyads will receive 8 weekly calls  (plus a booster call at 12  weeks)  from an 
ANSWERS  intervention  specialist  located in Indianapolis . The first scheduled intervention call is 
planned to occur within approximately [ADDRESS_298897] approximately 60 -90 minutes. Dyads 
assigned to the intervention group will receive:  
1) the schedule of upcoming stu dy calls  (see Appendix 2.2 in section 11.0 ), 
2) ANSWERS -VA workbook (see Appendix 12 in section 11.0),  
3) Veteran Stroke & TBI Resource Guide (see Appendix 5 in section 11.0 ), 
4) Be Involved Brochure (see Appendix 13 in section 11.0),  
5) if the participants are in the  TBI arm, and if they have children, a booklet entitled, 
“Talking with Children about TBI” or “Talking with Children about Moderate or 
Severe TBI” (whichever is more applicable to the dyad)  (see Appendi ces 4.2 and 4. 3 
in section 11.0), and  
6) if the Veteran h as a Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, the Veteran 
PTSD Booklet  (see Appendix 6 in section 11.0 ). 
 
Attention Control  Procedures.  The attention control  procedures  are also delivered completely 
by [CONTACT_756] . Dyads will receive 8 weekly calls  (plus a booster call at 12 weeks)  from an 
ANSWERS  intervention  specialist  who has been cross -trained in the attention control 
procedures located in Indianapolis . The first scheduled attention control  call is planned to occur 
within approximately [ADDRESS_298898]  will then provide support through the use active listening strategies. 
These strategies include using (a) conversation  starters (e.g., “What would you like to talk about 
today?”), (b) paraphrasing (e.g., “What you are telling me is…”), (c) clarifying (e.g., “Tell me 
VA HSR&D   NRI 12 -415-1 
IRB # [PHONE_5166]  
Version : 9-14-2015   Page 10 
 more about that”), (d) reflection (e.g., “So, you’re feeling___because___”), and (e) summarizing 
(e.g., “So , overall… “). These strategies provide the dyad  with the opportunity to express their 
problems and concerns and to use the interventionist  as a “sounding board.” Intervention 
specialists  will refer dyad s to the ASA or TBI organization , or their health car e providers for more 
information and answers to their questions.  These calls are expected to last approximately 15 -
30 minutes.  Dyads assigned to the attention control  group will receive :  
1) the schedule of upcoming study calls  (see Appendix 2 in section 11.0 for a complete 
packet of study letters),  and 
2) educational materials  entitled, “Caring for Stroke Survivors” published by [CONTACT_245870] (ASA) (see Appendix 3  in section 11.0 ) or “Becoming a 
Family Caregiver for a Service Member/Veteran wi th TBI”  published by [CONTACT_245871] (DVBIC) (see Appendix 4 .1 in section 11.0) . 
At the end of the dyad’s participation in the study, the attention control group will receive the 
ANSWERS -VA workbook, Veteran Stroke & TBI Resour ce Guide, Be Involved Brochure, and the 
Talking with Children about TBI and Veteran PTSD Booklet  if applicable.  
  
Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation . Any subject is permitted to withdraw from the study  at any 
time or decline to answer any particular question  without adverse effects. If a subject  
withdraws, we will complete a standardized form detailing the reason.  If one member of the 
dyad decides to withdraw, then the other member will have to be withdrawn by [CONTACT_245872].  
 
Treatment Fidelity Procedures for the ANSWERS -VA Intervention and Attention Control  
Procedures.  Special efforts will be made to boost  and track treatment fidelity of both the 
ANSWERS -VA interve ntion and attention control  procedures.  In order to track and monitor 
treatment fidelity, the intervention and control calls with be audio -recorded with the permission 
of the Veteran and caregiver.  
 
Data Collection  Procedures . Data collector s and the proje ct manager (baseline data collection 
only) will be trained to conduct telephone surveys for data collection prior to recruitment. Study 
personnel will work with the dyad to create a schedule of calls for the study . Response f orms 
(see Appendix 7.1-7.3 in section 11.0 ) will be mailed to the dyads  prior to the data collection 
calls to facilitate the interview process. Data collector s will be blinded to group assignment and 
will complete the remainder of the data collection calls which will be scheduled for [ADDRESS_298899] convenient to the dyad. Surveys /instruments  used for data collection can be 
found  in Appendix 8.1-8.3 (see section 11.0 ). Data will be collected on paper forms, and then 
entered into an electronic database . 
 
In order to alleviate some of the interview time and burden on the dyad , and to collect accurate 
data, Veteran demographics and medical history data (i.e., comorbidities, injury -specific data, 
health care utilization) will be collected via retrospective  medical chart review  using the VA 
electronic medical record known as CPRS. A complete list of variables collected can be found on 
the Veteran chart abstraction form in Appendix 9  in section 11.0 . Please note that the only  
variables which will contain  PHI/ PII being collected for the Veterans and caregivers during the 
course of this study are as follows: name, address, telephone number,  MRN  (Veteran only -MRN 
VA HSR&D   NRI 12 -415-1

Version : 9-14-2015   Page 11 
 is SSN at VA ), date of discharge (Veteran only), date of diagnosis (Veteran only) and the audio 
recor ding of the intervention and control sessions . Methods for ensuring privacy and 
confidentiality for the Veterans and caregivers  are discussed in more detail in section 9.0.  
 
Payment for Participation.  Veteran s and c aregiver s will be reimbursed after comple ting the 
baseline and [ADDRESS_298900] be used. The schedule and amounts for reimbursement for each 
participant will be as follows: baseline interview - $15; 1-year interviews - $15. The total 
potential reimbursement for  each participant in  the study is $ 30. The VA protocol for research 
participant reimbursement will be followed.  
 
Project Management Plan.  Overall, the coordination of this project will be led by [CONTACT_3433] e VA 
Indianapolis study team with Virginia Daggett, PhD, MSN, RN, the PI, overseeing the project. [CONTACT_245880] will coordinate the study investigators , and the project manager  and will coordinate the 
research staff and ensure that this study is compliant wi th all IRB and VA policies and 
regulations. Study teams from Indianapolis and Houston will have weekly conference calls . Prior 
to the initiation of this study, Drs. Daggett and Judge  will provide training to the interven tion 
specialists  for both the ANSWE RS-VA intervention and the attention control  groups. In addition, 
all data collector s will undergo training on how to complete the surveys, collect data, and  
perform  data entry to ensure that data from the two sites is being collected in a consistent 
manne r. Yearly face -to-face meetings and weekly calls will ensure that all sites follow the study 
protocol. The project manager  will coordinate prompt and reliable feedback to each site related 
to any data problems that may occur and likewise, will provide regu lar recruitment updates. 
Intervention fidelity will be observed through the review of audio recordings to ensure 
standardized delivery of the intervention. Data management will be coordinated through the 
IUSM Biostatistics Department which has coordinated other VA and non -VA multi -site studies.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_298901] been identified and 
screened for eligibility, 330 dyads  (222 Veterans  with stroke and their informal caregivers and 
108 Veterans  with TBI  informal caregivers ) will be randomized to either the ANSWERS -VA 
intervention or an educational attention control  group. Based on our proposed sample size, we 
will need to enroll an average of 1 3 dyads  per month to reach our goal over 2 years  (September 
of 2014 through October 31, 2017 ). At t hese two sites combined, w e will screen at least [ADDRESS_298902] 694 TBI survivors over the course of our study. Figure 3 below  
outlines our participant flow diagram for this study .

Our sample demographics will represent the Veteran patient population and the ir caregivers’ 
demographics at the Houston and Indianapolis VAMCs.  While we are expecting to recruit a 
sizable proportion of African American, Hispanic, and women caregivers of Veterans, our sample 
may be limited in terms of male caregivers and those from other racial groups due to population 
mix in this region . Specific strategies for the recruitment and retention of both male and female 
caregivers, as well as those from various ethnic/racial groups, will be used. We will be sure to 
include written materia ls that represent multiple ethnic and racial backgrounds as well as 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_245856].  
 
Methods.  This is  a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the ANSWERS -VA intervention 
among Veterans with stroke or TBI  and their informal car egivers . Veteran/caregiver dyads  in 
which the Veteran has suffered a stroke (N = 222) or TBI (N = 108), who have received care at 
the Michael E. DeBakey  VAMC  (MEDVAMC)  in Houston or the Richard L. Roudebush VAMC (RLR 
VAMC) in Indianapolis, will be randomiz ed to the ANSWERS -VA intervention group or to an 
educational attention control  group. Both the intervention and control procedures involve [ADDRESS_298903] on the primary outcomes of caregiver’s 
quality of life and unhealthy days. We will test the immediate efficacy of the ANSWERS -VA 
intervention on these mediators and outcomes from baseline to 8 weeks, and long -term, 
sustained efficacy at (12 and 24 weeks and at 1 year). Veteran and caregiver  characteristics (i.e., 
demographics, co -morbidities, relationship of caregiver to Veteran , and caregiver assessment of 
the Veteran ’s impairment) will be controlled by [CONTACT_245873], as 
necessary, by [CONTACT_245874]. We will assess the exploratory outcomes of 
effect sizes for the ANSWERS -VA intervention for the Veteran and caregiver  on the secondary 
outcomes of  depressive symptoms , social pa rticipation , and quality of the dyadic relationship . 
We will also assess the outcomes of noncaregiving hours and unhealthy days in caregivers  to 
determine the cost effectiveness of this intervention  (see Figure 2 ).

6.0 Data Management  
 
Data base . The REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture) database system will be 
implemented to collect data for this study. Study data kept on the REDCap database will not 
contain any PHI or PII. The project manager, data collector s and/or intervention specialists  at 
Indianapolis and Houston  will ent er survey data and intervention data in  this database.  REDCap 
is a software toolset referred for electronic collection and management of research data . 
REDCap provides a secure, web -based environment with  an intuitive interface for users to enter 
data and have real time validation rules at the time of entry. The system offers easy data 
manipulation with logged auditing, functionality for reporting, monitoring and querying patient 
records, and an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages such  as: SPSS,

IRB # [PHONE_5166]  
Version : 9-14-2015   Page 14 
 SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus.  Data will be entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_74143], data collector s 
and/or intervention specialists in Indianapolis and in Houston.  
 
Data Storage  & Security . The servers hosting REDCap are physically located in a secur ed and 
environmentally structured computer operations center on the I ndiana University  (IU) 
Bloomington campus and are supported by [CONTACT_245875] (UITS) 
server and database administrators. To comply with HIPAA guidelines, proce sses and 
procedures have been documented and implemented to ensure the security and protection of 
the study data within the computer operations center, the servers, and the database. There are 
two secure means of access to the study data for study members who are granted access: 1) via 
the application by [CONTACT_245876]’s Central Authentication Service (CAS) and project database specific 
permissions; and, 2) via direct access to the database by [CONTACT_245877]. 
In each case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245857]. REDCap utilizes SSL (https) encryption for secure connectivity.  
 
We will keep a paper enrollment form  that will contain the following PHI/PII: name, MRN , 
addre ss, and contact [CONTACT_3031]. The enrollment form  will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a 
locked office utilized for the study at the Indianapolis VAMC for patients /caregivers  enrolled 
from the RLRVAMC and at the Houston VAMC for patients/caregivers en rolled at the 
MEDVAMC .  The information from this enrollment form  will be added to an electronic crosswalk 
that ties this information to the study ID that will be established at the coordinating center at 
the RLR VAMC in Indianapolis in an access -controlle d project folder on the secure VA network 
research drive which is behind the VA firewall. Access to this folder will be given to the study 
personnel in Houston so that the information can be shared in a secure manner. PHI/PII will not 
be stored on any othe r paper research records or in the electronic database (REDCap).  
 
Audio recordings of the calls administered by [CONTACT_245878] L. Roudebush VAMC in the access -controlled project  folder on the  secure VA network  Q- 
According  to the VA’s OIS Risk Based Decisions (RBD) Memorandum, recordings will be made 
with devices that are not  technically capable of FIPS [ADDRESS_298905] folder for backup, and then permanently deleted from the 
devices.  
 
Missing Data.  We will incorporate several s trategies to minimize missing data. For example: (a) 
a tracking database will be incorporated to insure timely follow -up contacts and maintain 
current contact [CONTACT_3031]; (b) calls with dyad s will be scheduled ahead of time and at a time 
which is convenie nt for the Veteran and caregiver ; (c) essential data fields will force data 
collectors to provide an appropriate value (including use of special missing codes describing 
reason data are missing), rather than leave blank; (d) data will be entered into a sec ure system 
backed up nightly by [CONTACT_77842]; (e) paper forms will be available for data collection when 
direct entry is not possible; and (f) data will be inspected quarterly  during data collection for 
errors and missing values.  
 
Data Transfers.  In ord er to receive the subject  lists from Houston , the data collector  there will 
run the list using a template built by  a Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC) from Indianapolis. 
Then the  data collector  at Houston will be given access to the Indianapolis  stud y folder on the

7.0 Risks & Benefits  
 
Risks.  The main risks to subjects are loss of confidentiality and discomfort in answering certain 
questions. Specific steps to minimize these risks are detailed in section 9.0. Should any loss of 
confidentiality be identified, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318], within [ADDRESS_298907] the ACOS for R esearch, the IRB and R&D committees , and the Information Security 
Officer (ISO) and Privacy Officer  (PO) at the coordinating site as well as the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_245858].  
 
Benefits to Participants.  Our hope is that  the ANSWERS -VA intervention will provide Veterans 
with brain injury and their loved ones with a core set of practical skills that each can use in 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_245859].  Participants in the intervention group 
will receive [ADDRESS_298908] who will work with the dyad on 
education and counseling -based skills training and cognitive and physical rehabilitation 
techniques. They will also receive the ANSWERS -VA binder  (see Appendix 12 in section 11.0)  
which contains written educational materials, skills training, worksheets, and additional 
resources. The control group will also receive the ANSWERS -VA binder , but not until they 
complete the final data collection interview for the study.    
 
Benefits to S ociety.  The long term goal of this study is to implement this intervention for 
Veterans with stroke and TBI and their family caregivers across VHA by [CONTACT_245879]. Therefore, this program may also benefit the health -related q uality of life 
of future Veterans with stroke/TBI and their caregivers. The ANSWERS -VA intervention will also 
foster translation into practice due to eliminating costly in -patient and in -home visits.  
 
8.0 Data Safety and Monitoring  
Any ongoing data safety and  monitoring issues will be presented to the larger investigators 
group. This group of investigators is comprised of VA and non -VA representatives with a diverse 
background in nursing, medicine, traumatic brain injury, biostatistics, stroke and caregiving.  . 
This group  will monitor recruitment, enrollment, data collection, intervention procedures, and 
participant safety issues such as adverse events and protocol deviations  on an ad hoc basis . This 
is a minimal risk study, and we do not anticipate any study -related, serious adverse events. 
However, we will track all adverse events and will report any serious adverse events to the IRB 
as a reportable VA event per VA policy.. At continuing review, the IRB will receive a copy of  all 
Adverse Events no t requiring prompt reporting.   
 
9.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
VA HSR&D   NRI 12 -415-1 
IRB # [PHONE_5166]  
Version : 9-14-[ADDRESS_298909] are the subjects’ name s, address es, 
telephone number s, social security number, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166159] , date of diagnosis , and voice 
recording s of the intervention and control calls, and all of the PII being collected will be stored 
at the RLRVAMC  and MED  VAMC . To add further protections, s ubjects will be assigned a unique 
study identification (ID) number. This number will be used as the identif ier for the study data 
that will be stored in the REDCap database and for the audio recordings. The study ID will also 
connect the Veteran and caregiver data that is abstracted through CPRS chart reviews. The 
crosswalk file that links the subject ID number  with the Veterans and caregivers will be kept at 
the VA on a network server in a secure file behind the VA firewall and will only be accessible to 
authorized study personnel. All study forms which contain PHI/PII will be locked and secured in 
file cabinet s only accessible to authorized study personnel. When study personnel are no longer 
part of the research team, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245860], and 
the R&D office will be notified so that VA network access can be terminated . 
 
Subjects will be instructed that they may refuse to answer any question with which they are 
uncomfortable, and they will be assured that they may withdraw from the study at any time  
without repercussions of their healthcare and the healthcare of the Veteran with whom they 
have a relationship.

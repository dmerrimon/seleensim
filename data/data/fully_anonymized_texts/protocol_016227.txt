Page 9 of 37 4. Introduction  
4.1. Chronic Pain 
Chronic pain is a significant world- wide complaint and consumes considerable healthcare 
resources and heavily impacts quality of social and working life for many.  A 2001 European 
investigation showed that 30% of patients treated in primary care facilities were treated by a physician for a pain complaint, and 37% of those patients (11% of total) suffered from chronic pain ( Hasselstrom, Liu -Palmgren, & Rasjo-Wraak, 2002) .  More recently an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_71606] 48%, 8% of which is of neuropathic origin.  The authors concluded that chronic pain is more prevalent than what previous studies have suggested ( Torrance, Smith, Bennett, & Lee, 
2006).  In a separate European study done in 2006, 19% of adults surveyed reported suffering from chronic pain ( Breivik, Collett, Ventafridda, Cohen, & Gallacher, 2006).  
In the 2010 report of the health and status of the nation, Health, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that over 28% of adults suffer from non- fleeting low -back 
pain.  In patients with low-back pain, approxim ately half of the patients reported limitation in 
at least one basic action from the following list:  movement difficulty, emotional difficulty, sensory difficulty, cognitive difficulty, self- care limitation, social limitation, or work 
limitation (National Center for Health Statistics, 2011).  
 Chronic pain can lead to a number of co-morbidities, including reduced health- related quality 
of life, reduced ability to engage in activities of daily living, increased disability, increased emotional depression, and weight gain due to the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle. 
4.2. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_71607] (SCS) is a treatment option for chronic pain that has generally been 
reserved for patients who have failed multiple, and sometimes all, conservative chronic pain 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  With SCS, an implanted pulse generator (IPG) delivers electrical current to a 
lead(s) implanted in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_71608](s) where access can be obtained neural 
structures  that are implicated in the chronic pain circuits.   Electrically stimulating these 
nerves creates a comfortable tingling sensation, known as paresthesia, that can be directed to 
the painful location to mask the sensation of pain (Kumar et al ., 2006).  
SCS is effective for neuropathic pain associated w ith a variety of conditions, including failed 
back surgery syndrome (FBSS), which is the most common condition associated with 
chronic pain (Carter et al., 2004, Taylor et al ., 2004).  For best pain relief, the paresthesia 
must be programmed to overlap the regions of pain (North et al., 1990). To achieve overlap, the electrode contacts are programmed based on the patient’s feedback  to various 
combinations of stimulation parameters such as polarities, pulse rate, amplitude, and pulse 
width.   
Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on the use of SCS to treat 
patients with FBSS. Each study demonstrated the superiority of SCS compared with the 

A4057  Confidential 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific  
COVEREDGE ALGORITHM Protocol  
 
Page 10 of 37 alternative therapy, reoperation in one case (North et al. , 2005) and conventional medical 
manageme nt (CMM), including medication, nerve blocks, physical therapy, massage, etc., in 
the other (Kumar et al., 2007).  
In a single -center study, North et al. randomized 50 patients: 24 to SCS and 26 to 
reoperation. At an average follow- up of 2.9 years, the success rate (at least 50% pain relief 
and patient satisfaction) was reported to be significantly higher among patients randomized 
to SCS (9 of 24 patients) than among those randomized to reoperation (3 of 26 patients).  Crossover was permitted if a patient’s randomized therapy did not provide adequate pain relief, and significantly more patients crossed from reoperation to SCS (14 of 26) than from SCS to reoperation (5 of 24). Six of the reoperation crossovers achieved success with SCS, bringing the success rate to 15 of 38 who received SCS as a final treatment.  None of the patients who fai led SCS achieved success with reoperation (3 of 31 who received reoperation 
as a final treatment achieved success).  
North et al. then used data from this study to compare the cost of SCS versus reoperation over a 2.9- year follow -up period and demonstrated that SCS was the least expensive and was 
dominant in terms of cost- effectiveness and  cost-utility (North et al., 2007).   
In a separate, international, multi-center RCT, Kumar et al. randomized 100 patients:  48 to CMM and 52 to SCS plus CMM (Kumar et al. , 2007).  At 6 months, patients randomized to 
SCS achieved significantly greater pain relief and improved functional capacity and health-related quality of life compared with patients randomized to CMM.
 The patients randomized 
to SCS who actually received SCS (42 of 52) and were followed for 24 months reported significantly improved leg pain relief, functional capacity, and quality of life compared with their pre -treatment status (Kumar et al., 2008).  While initial SCS costs were greater than 
CMM costs, by  [ADDRESS_77865] examine costs and quality of life data beyond six months to paint an accurate pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] (Manca et al.,  2008). 
The results of the se RCTs provide evidence that SCS is effective and cost effective in 
relieving chronic neuropathic pain associated with FBSS.  North et al. also indicate that SCS might provide the best outcome and economic value for patients who are eligible for both SCS and reoperation (North et al., 2007).  The results of North’s single- center RCT, 
however, have not been confirmed by a multi- center RCT that reflects the advances in 
surgical practice and in SCS that might have changed the comparative efficacy of these 
procedures.   
In 2004, FDA approved the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation (BSC) Precision
® SCS system as 
an aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs.  The 
Precision system received CE  mark in 2005 for treatment of chronic intractable pain.   
The results of a multi -center, non-randomized feasibility study conducted with this system 
demonstrated more than 50% pain relief through a maximum follow-up of 18 months, but the

8. Design  
This is a p rospective, on- label, multi-center, non- randomized, exploratory, single -arm study. 
8.1. Scale and Duration 
This study will be conducted in up to [ADDRESS_77866] 
patient enrolled to completion of end of study close out activities.  Figure 8.1-1 shows the study design   
Figure 8.1-1: Study Design 
  
8.2. Treatment Assignment  
Consecutive eligible patients who consent to participation and have met all of the inclusion 
and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled and assigned a unique subject identifier.  
8.2.1. Treatment  
The study treatment will consist of commercially available neurostimulation program settings 
for subjects implanted with any commercially approved [LOCATION_011] Scientific Precision Spectra 
neurostimulator and CoverEdge surgical lead for pain.  
8.3. Justification for the Study Design  
All devices used in  this study are approved for commercial release.  
This is a prospective, on -label, multi-center, non- randomized, exploratory, single -arm study. 
The endpoints of this  study are intended to observe the paresthesia paradigms elicited by 
[CONTACT_71637]-label use of the BSC Precision Spectra neurostimulation 
system and CoverEdge surgical leads. The results of this study will also help [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific guide the development of next generation programming algorithms. 
A prospective study design w ill ensure that identical procedures are followed for data capture 
and review. A multi- center design will minimize the impact on the results due to specific surgical 
placement and intra- operative techniques as well as to minimize bias that may result from 
differences in patient selection, regional differences in the patient demographic, and patient 
management.   
This study does not require blinding since there is no treatment comparison based on 
outcomes and all subjects will be undergoing identical procedures. All end -points are 
exploratory and the design does not require statistical power.

Page 14 of 37 10.2. Withdrawal 
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study 
or lost to follow-up) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall be reported. If such withdrawal is due to p roblems 
related to study device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject’s 
permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical study.   
Reasons for withdrawal include 
• physician discretion,  
• subject choice to withdraw consent,  
• subject’s failure to meet sub -study inclusion or exclusion criteria after enrollment 
• lost to follow -up, or  
• death  
While study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from the study at any time, 
with or without reason, and without pre judice to further treatment.  
All applicable case report forms (CRFs) up to the point of subject withdrawal and an “End of 
Study” form must be completed.  Any subject deemed “lost to follow-up” should have a 
minimum of three documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_12552]/her prior to completion of the “End of Study” form.   
Additional data may no longer be collected after the point at which a subject has been 
withdrawn from the study or withdraws consent, for whatever reason.  All open adverse events should be closed or documented as unresolved.  Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used and analyzed.  
10.3. Subject Status and Classification  
A subject is considered enrolled after a signed informed consent form (ICF) has been obtained. Study participation will end when each enrolled subject completes their study 
visits, withdraws , or at most [ADDRESS_77869] been enrolled to alert investigators that enrollment will soon cease. The correspondence will also outline the specific activities to minimize the risk of enrollment after the protocol-specified cap of 15 enrolled  subjects has been reached .

Page 16 of 37 • Written informed consent must be recorded appropriately by [CONTACT_71638]’s 
dated signature.   
• The consent process must be documented in the subject’s medical chart.  
11.4. Programming Visit – Day 0  
The Programming Visit will occur in the physician’s office. The clinician may perform 
routine clinical care prior to any changes in programming. 
Fluoroscopy 
If not performed as part of routine care, fluoroscopy should be done prior to any changes in  
programming. Both an AP and a lateral view are recommended to determine the location of 
the implanted lead.  
Prior to any changes in programming, the following assessments will be completed:  
• Pain Drawing  
• Pain Intensity  
The subject will be asked to complete their pain drawing and intensity assessment based on their recollection of pain. Upon completion of the above mentioned assessments, subjects 
will be pro grammed to receive multiple program settings by [CONTACT_71639]’s personnel. 
The following assessments will be completed based on each program setting: 
• Perception and Discomfort Thresholds during progr amming  
• Paresthesia Drawing  
Multiple program  settings will be tested and the above assessments completed for each 
configuration.  The total number of configurations tested will depend on the subject’s 
tolerance.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_77870]’s visit.  The study will be considered complete 
once all subjects have completed Programming Visit and all site and study close- out 
activities have been completed.  
11.7. Source Documents  
Where copi[INVESTIGATOR_71610], these shall be signed and dated by a member of the 
investigation center team with a statement that it is a true reproduction of the original source document. All source documentation will be retained at the study site. Examples of source documents include, but are not limited to the following:

12. Statistical Considerations  
This feasibility study is exploratory in nature and thus no statistical powered end- points are 
included. 
13. Data Management 
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review 
Subject data will be recorded on paper case report forms (CRFs) which will be provided by 
[CONTACT_71640]. The data reported on the CRFs shall be derived from source documents and shall be consistent with these source documents. An exception to this requirement is when data must be recorded directly on the CRF. For example, the questionnaire filled out by [CONTACT_71641]. Any discrepancies should be explained in writing. Any change or correction made to the clinical data will be dated, initialed and explained, if necessary, and shall not obscure the original entry. A written audit trail shall be maintained 

A4057  Confidential 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific  
COVEREDGE ALGORITHM Protocol  
 
Page 18 of 37 which will be made available for review by [CONTACT_71642]. Sites will be trained to 
complete the CRF.  
13.2. Data Retention 
The Investigator or Investigational site will maintain, at the investigative site, in  original 
format all essential study documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines.  Documents must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_77871]. These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by [CONTACT_71643].  It is BSC’s responsibility to inform the 
Investigator when these documents no longer need to be maintained. The Investigator will take measures to ensure that these essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the Inves tigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these 
essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change.  
13.3. Study Assessments  
13.3.1. Pain Drawing  
Pain areas will be collected on a paper form on which the subject draws their areas of 
pain.  Subjects shall be instructed to complete the drawing as follows:  
• Completely fill in all areas of pain , regardless of relative intensity and avoid alternate 
techniques for marking pain (e.g. circling areas of pain, hash marks, pi[INVESTIGATOR_71611])   
• Avoid marking outside the body lines or within the data field box 
13.3.2. Pain Intensity  
Pain Intensity  is a questionnaire assessing the intensity of  the subject’s different areas of 
pain.  Pain intensity is expressed on a 0 – 10 numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0 indicates “no pain” and 10 indicates “pain as bad as you can imagine”.  
13.3.3. Paresthesia Drawing  
Paresthesia coverage will be collected by [CONTACT_71644]-induced paresthesia.   
Subjects shall be instructed to complete the drawing as follows:  
• Completely fill in all are as of paresthesia, regardless of relative intensity and avoid 
alternate techniques for marking paresthesia (e.g. circling areas of paresthesia, hash marks, pi[INVESTIGATOR_71612])   
• Avoid marking outside the body lines or within the data field box

13.3.4. Fluoroscopy  
It is recommended  that both AP and lateral  images be performed to document lead 
position, if not part of routine care.  
14. Amendments  
If a protocol revision is necessary which affects the rights, safety or welfare of the subject or 
scientific integrity of the data, an amendment is required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., IRB/EC/FDA/CA) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation. 
15. Deviations  
An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect the life and physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the sponsor and the reviewing IRB/EC of any deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, and those deviations which 
affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_77872] be documented and reported to the sponsor . Sites may also be required to 
report deviations to the IRB/EC, per local guidelines and government regulations.  
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions (including notification, center re- training, or 
discontinuation) will be put into place by [CONTACT_456]. 
Deviations will be classified according to the following definitions:  
• Type A  - Deviation to protect the life or physical well-being of a patient in an 
unforeseen emergency.  
• Type B - Deviation based on medical judgment.  
• Type C - Deviation due to misunderstanding of protocol requ irements .  
• Type D - Deviation due to a situation that is beyond control.  
• Type E - Deviation due to an oversight, error or protocol non- compliance.  
16. Device/Equipment Accountability  
Device accountability is not required as t his study does not utilize investigational devices. It 
will only recruit subjects who have been implanted with commercially approved devices.

SCS patients should not have any form of diathermy either as treatment for a medical condition or as part of a surgical procedure. The high energy and heat generated by [CONTACT_71651], causing tissue damage at the lead 
site and, possibl y, severe injury or death. The stimulator, whether it is turned on or off, may 
be damaged. 
19.5.3. Implanted Stimulation Devices:  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_71620] y interfere with the operation of implanted sensing stimulators 
such as pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillators. The effects of implanted stimulation 
devices on neurostimulators are unknown. 
19.5.4. Medical Devices/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  
The following medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_71621], particularly if used in close proximity to the device: 
• lithotripsy  
• electrocautery (See “Instructions for the Physician” in the Information for the Prescriber 
Manual)  
• extern al defibrillation  
• radiation therapy  
• ultrasonic scanning  
• high- output ultrasound  
If any of the above is required by [CONTACT_71652], refer to “Instructions for the Physician” 
the Information for the Prescriber Manual. Ultimately, however, the device may require explantation as a result of damage to the device.  
19.6. Risk Minimization Actions

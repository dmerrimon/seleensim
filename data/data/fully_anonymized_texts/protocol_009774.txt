of patients without JAK2 mutations and any difference in response rate. 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
RUXOLITINIB phosphate is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase family of protein tyrosine 
kinases (JAKs) that has been recently approved for the treatmen t of patient with 
myelofibrosis and is undergoing further evaluation for the trea tment of other 
myeloproliferative disorders under IND No. 77,456.  Unless otherwise noted, RUXOLITINIB phosphate is referred to throughout this protocol a s RUXOLITINIB.  
RUXOLITINIB Phosphate Tablets 5 and 25 mg (free base equivalent ), as disclosed in 
IND No. 77,456, will be used in the proposed studies described in this IND. Additional details of the CMC characterization of RUXOLITINIB may be found  in the Clinical 
Investigators Brochure (CIB). 
We propose to investigate the combination of decitabine and RUX OLITINIB in 
patients with high-risk MDS/MPN and post-MPN AML.  In the phase  I portion of the 
trial, the aim is to determine the tolerability of the combinat ion.  In the phase II portion 
of the trial, the number and duration of responses in patients with post-MPN AML and 
high-risk MDS/MPN (> 20% blasts) will be determined.

The Jak family of kinases comprises four proteins (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2) that 
can associate with cytokine receptor subunits, phosphorylate them, and in doing so 
create docking sites on the receptors for binding of SH2-containing proteins.[ADDRESS_372572] of several domains (JH1-JH7), including a tyrosine kinase 
domain, and the functional significance of these domains has be en characterized by 
[CONTACT_13984].  Jaks are able to associate with the cytokine receptors as well as 
with each other. Dimerization/oligomerization of cytokine recep tor subunits as a result 
of ligand binding leads to juxtaposition of Jaks. This results in transphosphorylation and activation of
 their kinase activity and the phosphorylation of downstream signaling 
proteins such as Stats, Src-kinases, and adaptors such as Shc, Grb2, and Cbl. [ADDRESS_372573] been associated with a numbe r of disorders. For 
example, chromosomal translocations resulting in TEL-JAK2 constructs lead to the 
constitutive activation of STAT5, IL-3-independent cellular proliferation, and 
leukemogenesis.2-4 The translocation t(9;12)(p24;p13) results in the fusion of the 
kinase catalytic region of JAK2 with the transcription factor TEL generating the 
constitutively active TEL-JAK2.[ADDRESS_372574] with other transcription factors such 
as the p300/cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein family of coactivators to 
activate genes. The transcriptional activity of STATs may also be regulated by [CONTACT_304476], although the implications of 
such regulation are not known.  
STATs mediate diverse and sometimes opposite cellular events affecting growth, 
differentiation, and apoptosis. For example, STATs can mediate both growth arrest 
and cellular proliferation. Specifically, STAT1 mediates the growth-inhibito ry effects of

Oncology Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00 – 02-16-2015)  Protocol No.  2014-[ADDRESS_372575], and in GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced 
proliferation. STATs also modulate cellular differentiation and apoptosis. 
Reconstitution of STAT1 in STAT1-null U3A cells (which do not respond to TNF- ) 
restores basal caspase expression and renders them sensitive to TNF-indu ced 
apoptosis. Conversely, STAT3 and STAT5 mediate the antiapoptoti c effects of IL-[ADDRESS_372576] been described in a  variety of 
leukemias and their inhibition can be a goal for leukemia thera py. Myelofibrosis (MF) 
is a clonal stem cell disorder with the potential to transform to acute leukemia (AML), 
referred to as myelofibrosis in blast phase (MF-BP).[ADDRESS_372577] with a median survival of 3.9 months.7 
Decitabine (5-aza-2′deoxycytidine) is a deoxycytidine analog originally synthesized in 
the 1960s. The compound is phosphorylated by [CONTACT_304477], and it is an S-phase–specific agent. De citabine also inhibits 
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) by [CONTACT_304478]. At low doses, hypom ethylation of DNA with 
subsequent gene reactivation and induction of cellular differen tiation occur. At higher 
doses, cellular cytotoxicity predominates. 
DNA hypermethylation of promoter-specific CpG islands is a well -known mechanism 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_263574], occurring frequently in cell cycle reg ulatory genes such as 
p15INK4B in a variety of hematologic malignancies, including MDS and AM L. In MF, 
p15INK4B and p16INK4A hypermethylation has been reported to occur as the disease 
advances into accelerated and blast phases. Hypermethylation of  the calcitonin gene 
(used as a marker of methylation at the 11p15 chromosome locus where several 
tumor-suppressor genes appear to cluster) has been reported in MF even in the 
chronic phase of the disease compared with other Philadelphia c hromosome–
negative chronic myeloproliferative diseases. In addition, the retinoic acid receptor β 
(RAR β) gene has been found to be a target of epi[INVESTIGATOR_304458] a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in this dise ase. In clinical trials, 
decitabine has clinical activity in MDS at lower doses. Further more, a decrease in 
hypermethylation of the p15INK4B gene was observed in some patients with MDS 
following treatment with decitabine and correlated with clinica l response.Significant 
evidence of clinical activity was also reported in a recent pha se I study of decitabine at 
low doses in hematologic malignancies, but this study found no evidence of a

correlation of clinical responses with p15INK4B methylation, suggesting that the biologic 
effects of the drug may not be mediated solely through p15INK4B demethylation. 
Our group has previously conducted a phase-II study to evaluate  the activity of DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacitidine, in patients with MF.8 Thirty-four patients 
(76% previously treated) received 5-azacitidine at 75 mg/m(2) s ubcutaneously daily 
for 7 days, every 4 weeks. Twelve (35%) patients had abnormal c ytogenetics and 19 
(70%) of 27 evaluable patients had JAK2(V617F) mutation. Responses occurred in 8 
(24%) patients after a median of 5 months (range, 3-10). Partia l response occurred in 
1 (3%) patient (duration 22+ months) and clinical improvement i n 7 (21%) patients 
(median duration 4 months; range, 2-8.5). Myelosuppression was the major adverse 
effect, with grade 3-4 neutropenia in 10 (29%) patients. Global DNA methylation 
assessed by [CONTACT_304479] (LINE) bis ulfite/pyrosequencing 
assay decreased from 53% pretherapy to 44% on day 14 (P=0.0014)  and returned to 
50% at the end of the first 28-day cycle (P=0.016). 5-azacitidi ne is relatively well 
tolerated and results in induction of global hypomethylation in  patients with MF, but 
results in limited clinical activity.9 
In another recently published study, 54 patients with Philadelp hia-negative 
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, including 21 essential thromb ocythemia [ET], 21 
polycythemia vera [PV], 7 primary myelofibrosis, and 5 unclassi fied MPN) who had 
progressed to AML (n = 26) or MDS (n = 28) were treated with azacitidine in a patient-
named program.10 Overall response rate was 52% (24% complete response [CR], 
11% partial response [PR], 8% marrow CR or CR with incomplete r ecovery of 
cytopenias, 9% hematologic improvement) and median response dur ation was 9 
months. Prognostic factors were for overall response the underl ying MPN (71% vs 
33% responses in ET and PV, respectively; P = .016); prognostic factors for CR 
achievement were the underlying MPN (14% CR for PV vs 43% for E T; P = .040) and 
World Health Organization classification at transformation (36%  vs 12% CR in MDS 
and AML, respectively, P = .038). Recurrence of chronic phase features of the initial 
MPN was observed in 39% of the responders. Median overall survi val was [ADDRESS_372578] 
demonstrated significant activity.11 In a study from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, 
Four out of seven patients (57%) with MF-BP treated with decitabine reported 
subjective improvement in symptoms of fatigue/global weakness a nd left upper 
quadrant abdominal fullness/pain.7 All seven patients experienced an objective 
reduction in spleen size on physical examination with a mean 35 % reduction of 
palpable splenomegaly (range 11–61%). Four out of seven patient s (57%) had a 
decrease in RBC transfusion requirements and a single patient a chieved transfusion 
independence after three cycles of therapy. The three patients who remain alive currently are in a morphologic complete response with incomplete platelet recovery (CRi) by [CONTACT_304480] 8 
Oncology Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00 – 02-16-2015)  Protocol No.  2014-[ADDRESS_372579] recently conducted a phase II study of RUXOLITINIB in p atients with 
relapsed/refractory leukemias for which no standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] w ere anticipated to 
result in a durable remission. Patients with acceptable perform ance status (0-2) with 
adequate organ function and no active infection received RUXOLI TINIB 25mg orally 
twice a day for 4 weeks (1 cycle). Response was assessed after every 2 cycles of 
treatment. Responding patients or patients with stable disease were allowed to 
continue until progression. Dose escalation to 50 mg twice dail y was permitted in 
patients demonstrating a benefit. 38 patients with median age 6 9 (range 45-88) with 
relapsed and refractory leukemias were treated. The median numb er of prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 2 (range 1-6). 12 patients had JAK2V617F mutation . Patients who 
completed 2 cycles of INCB with clinical improvement were defin ed as having stable 
disease (SD). Patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy  (range 1-22). Three 
patients with AML developi[INVESTIGATOR_304459] (MF-BP) showed remarkable response 
with 2 achieving complete remission (CR) and one remission with  insufficient platelet 
count (CRi). [ADDRESS_372580] had a  significant reduction 
in their spleen size. Overall INCB was tolerated very well.  
Rationale: 
There is no standard medical treatment for MF-BP or other post- MPN-AML. We 
believe that the combination of ruxolitinib and decitabine is a  candidate approach to 
the treatment of MF-BP that is worthy of exploration based on the current 
understanding of the biology of disease. The molecular pathogenesis of MPN and progression to blast phase is almost certainly due to a complex  combination of gene 
mutations (JAK2V617F, MPL) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_304460] (IDH1/2, IKZF1, EZH2, TET2) that culminate in the emergence of leukemic clones. Recen t evidence 
indicates that the JAK2V617F protein can localize in the nucleus and influence global DNA methylation patterns which may lead to genomic instability and disease 
progression (40, 41). The inhibition of JAK-STAT mediated cell proliferation and 
survival in conjunction with the reversal of DNA hypermethylati on of tumor 
suppressor genes would be predicted to have at least an additive if not synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis of cells belonging to the malignan t myeloid clone. 
Correlative studies conducted within a trial of combination JAK [ADDRESS_372581] on m ethylation status of 
various gene promoters as well as the influence on gene express ion of chromatin 
related proteins and ultimately leukemic cell survival. The sequential administration of a JAK2 inhibitor followed by a DNMT inhibitor would also potent ially serve to 
overcome the JAK2-independent effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_304461] t lead to MPN-BP.

4.1 Ruxolitinib 
Ruxolitinib represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor  of JAK1 (IC50 = 3.3 ± 
1.2 nM) and JAK2 (IC50 = 2.8 ± 1.2 nM) with modest to marked se lectivity against 
TYK2 (IC50 = 19 ± 3.2 nM) and JAK3 (IC50 = 428 ± 243 nM), respe ctively. 
INCB018424 is inactive (ie, < 30% inhibition) against 28 additional kinases when 
tested at 200 nM.  
Ruxolitinib has high solubility and permeability, (ie, it is designated as a Class I 
molecule in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS)) and exhibits 
moderate- to-high clearance, volume of distribution and oral bioavailability in preclinical species. The apparent elimination half-life is shor t (< 5 hr) in all species. 
The primary clearance pathway is oxidative metabolism. The meta bolism by [CONTACT_304481]3A4. In a stu dy using 14C-
Ruxolitinib in healthy volunteers, unchanged Ruxolitinib was th e predominant 
circulating drug-related entity with 2 major circulating metabo lites observed, both of 
which are mono-oxidation products. The metabolites of Ruxolitinib retain varying 
degrees of JAK-related pharmacological activity. Excretion was fairly rapid by [CONTACT_304482] < 1% o f the administered 
dose. Tissue distribution studies in rats indicate rapid and co mplete elimination of 
radioactivity in most tissues. Ruxolitinib exhibits high plasma  protein binding in 
humans with an unbound fraction of 3.3%.  
4.1.1 Chemistry   
The chemical name [CONTACT_304493], previously known as INCB01842 4 (also referred to 
as INC424) phosphate is ( R)-3-(4- (7 H-pyrrolo[2,3- d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-1H -pyrazol-1-yl)-
3-cyclopentylpropanenitrile phosphate. INCB018424 phosphate has  a molecular 
formula of C17H21N6O4P and a molecular weight of 404.36.

rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91786], the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the 
formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and  decitabine 
incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.Decitabine is approved by [CONTACT_304483]. 
 
4.1.7 Chemistry and Physical Properties 
Decitabine  is also known as 5-aza-2’-deoxycytydine, an analogu e of the 
natural nucleoside 2’-deoxycytidine. Decitabine is a fine, whit e to almost white 
powder with themolecular formula of C8H12N4O4 and a molecular w eight of 228.21. 
Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 4-amino-1-(2-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofurano syl)-1,3,5-triazin-
2(1H)-one. Decitabine is slightly soluble in ethanol/water (50/50),  methanol/water 
(50/50) and methanol; sparingly soluble in water and soluble in  dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMSO). 
 
4.1.8 Formulation and Stability  
Decitabine for injection is supplied as Dacogen™, a sterile lyo philized white to almost 
white powder, in a single-dose vial, packaged in cartons of 1 vial. Dacogen™ 
(decitabine) for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder supp lied in a clear colorless 
glass vial. Each 20 mL, single dose, glass vial contains 50 mg decitabine, 68 mg 
monobasic potassium phosphate (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) and 11.6 mg 
sodium hydroxide (NDC [ZIP_CODE]-  600-50). Vials are to be stored at 25°C (77°F) with 
excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F). Unless used within [ADDRESS_372591] be prepared using col d (2°C - 8°C) infusion 
fluids and stored at 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F) for up to a maximum of 7 hours until administration.

refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in 
transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) and interm ediate-1, 
intermediate-2, and high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups. 
The indication of refractory anemia with excess blasts in trans formation has 
been included in the definition of acute myeloid leukemia accor ding to the 
most recent WHO classification. As a result, decitabine is a co mmon treatment 
of AML, and has been incorporated into standard treatment pathw ays for AML 
by [CONTACT_68015], especially in patients who are unfit for standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as those over age 60 years.

6.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN  
Patients will be recruited among the patients referred to the L eukemia Department at 
the University of [LOCATION_007] – MD Anderson Cancer Center. There will  be no direct 
advertising for this study. The study will be available to the public and the details of 
the inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria and study design wil l be posted at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov. A maximum of 36 patients (up to 12 pati ents in phase I and up 
to 24 patients in the phase II) will be enrolled in the study. Up to [ADDRESS_372593] be done within 30 days of entry:

8.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
8.[ADDRESS_372594] 9 patients on study wil l receive RUXOLITINIB for 
28 days during induction therapy at escalating doses per the ta ble below, plus 
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days 
 
Dose of RUXOLITINIB will be as follows: Table 1 – RUXOLITINIB dose 
Dose level RUXOLITINIB (mg PO) 
(x 28 days) No of evaluable 
patients 
0 10 BID 3 
1 15 BID 3 
2 25 BID 3 
3 50 BID 3 
 
We will utilize the above design format to determine the tolera ble dose of 
RUXOLITINIB to be used in combination with decitabine, with 25 mg PO BID as the 
target dose. The enrollment of participants will be staggered; all the participants in 
each cohort will finish the first cycle of therapy followed by 7 days of observation (i.e. 
day 35 of therapy) before proceeding to the next cohort. Subsqu ence cycles will 
begin on the first day of decitabine therapy and, in the absenc e of toxicity, 
RUXOLITINIB administration will not be interrupted.Patients who  come off the study 
during the first cycle for reasons other than development of dose limiting toxicity (e.g. 
disease progression) will be replaced in order to ensure adequa te chance for the 
assessment of DLT. 
If grade 3-4 non-hematological RUXOLITINIB-related toxicities are observed in ≥ 2/6 
patients, this dose level would exceed the MTD.

Oncology Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00 – 02-16-2015)  Protocol No.  2014-0344 
 
 
 
If grade 3-4 RUXOLITINIB-related toxicities are observed in 0-1 /6 patients, the study 
will continue at the RUXOLITINIB dose of 15, 25, and 50 mg P.O.  BID x 28 days plus 
chemotherapy, as outlined above. We will examine the dose of 50  mg BID to assess 
its tolerability and if well tolerated, this will be the dose to move to phase II, However, 
the target dose for phase II is 25 mg po BID x 28 days. 
 
Cycles will be repeated approximately every 4 to 6 weeks, depen ding on the recovery 
of the blood counts and will continue until clinically signific ant progression, withdrawal 
of consent or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 24 cycles (see section 13.0). 
 
Toxicities to be monitored include any grade 3 or 4 non-hematol ogical toxicity felt to 
be related to RUXOLITINIB and prolonged cytopenias (lasting for  more than 42 days 
after the initiation of the treatment) felt to be related to th e treatment and not the 
underlying disease. Patients with prolonged cytopenias should have a bone marrow 
exam around day 42 to establish whether this is due to the trea tment or whether 
there is persistent disease. In the case of the former, treatme nt should be 
discontinued. 
Prior to advancing/changing dose levels, a cohort summary must be completed and 
submitted to the IND Medical Monitor for review. 
Each cohort will have up to 6 patients enrolled. 
Phase II 
Twenty four patients (not including any patients from the phase  I portion of the study) 
will receive cycles of therapy according to the following start ing schedule: 
RUXOLITINIB at dose defined by [CONTACT_7609] I portion of the study, on  days 1-28 of 
each cycle 
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days 
Cycles will be repeated every 4 to 6 weeks depending on toleran ce and  the recovery 
of counts. 
RUXOLITINIB will be provided by [CONTACT_456] (Incyte) free of ch arge to the 
participating patients for a maximum period of up to 24 months.  Any used or expi[INVESTIGATOR_304464].

Patients who experience RUXOLITINIB-specific (defined as determ ined by [CONTACT_28824]) grade 3-4 extramedullary toxicities during induction cycle #1, 
and who are not in CR after cycle #1, may receive a second indu ction course at the   
next lower dose with respect to RUXOLITINIB (as defined in tabl e1 on page 14).  
Other dose modification schedules felt to be in the best intere st of the patient may be 
permitted, after discussion with the principal investigator [CONTACT_57999] h the documentation of 
the discussion in the patient’s medical records.  There will be  no dose modifications 
of decitabine for either induction cycle #1, or second inductio n course, secondary to 
myelosuppression. 
Adjustment of dose of RUXOLITINIB to [ADDRESS_372595] toxicity but are having benefit from the trea tment. If patients 
develop significant myelosuppression that is thought to be spec ifically related to 
RUXOLITINIB, it can be held for a week and then resumed at a lo wer dose (5-10 mg 
per day less than the prior dose). Toxicities to be monitored include any grade 3 or 4 non-hematol ogical toxicity felt to 
be related to RUXOLITINIB and prolonged cytopenias (lasting for  more than 42 days 
after the initiation of the treatment) felt to be related to th e treatment and not the 
underlying disease. Patients with prolonged cytopenias should have a bone marrow 
exam around day 42 to establish whether this is due to the trea tment or whether

limiting toxicity (DLT), then a new cohort of [ADDRESS_372600] cohort 
experiences a DLT, then the next cohort of patients will be tre ated at a lower dose 
level (dose level -1) and no further dose escalation with occur  in this step.  Three 
patients will be enrolled at this dose level, if 0 or 1 patient s experiences a DLT, a 
further 3 patients will be enrolled at this dose level.  If overall 0 or 1 patient 
experiences a DLT at this dose level, this dose will be establi shed as the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD). 
x If two or more evaluable patients in the cohort experience DLT , then the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded, and no fu rther dose 
escalation will occur.  The previous dose will be considered as  the MTD. 
x If only three patients were treated at the dose level under consideration as the 
MTD, then up to an additional 3 patients will be accrued.  If n o more than one 
patient at that dose level experiences DLT, then that dose leve l will be confirmed 
as the MTD.  If two or more patients in that cohort experience DLT, then the 
previous dose level will be studied in the same fashion. 
 
8.3 Definition of DLT and MTD: 
For the purposes of assessing safety, DLTs will be defined as t hose adverse events 
occurring in the first cycle (i.e. 28 days) of therapy that are not clearly related to 
disease, intercurrent illness or concurrent medication. These e vents will be defined 
based on the NCI CTCAE version 4 as follows: 
 
x Any Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (with the exceptions of Grade [ADDRESS_372601] been prescribed; Grade [ADDRESS_372602]/ALT must 
be sustained for more than [ADDRESS_372603] b ilirubin >[ADDRESS_372604] be Grade 4 to be considered a DL T) 
 
x Any Grade [ADDRESS_372605] 
cycle of therapy with a bone marrow cellularity of ≤5% and no e vidence of leukemia.  
No dose modification will occur until any potential DLTs is ful ly assessed 

MTD is defined as the highest dose studied for which the incide nce of DLT is less 
than 17% (1 out of 6).

9.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
Response assessment 
Response assessment (RA) can be performed at the end of any cyc le after cycle 1.  
Specific events that will prompt response assessment include of resolution of splenomegaly 
on exam and clearance of blasts from the peripheral blood, whic h will prompt bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]. Patients continuing to maintain at least S D by [CONTACT_304486], unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Patients may receive up to 24 cycles in 
this study. Patients may proceed to allogeneic stem cell transp lant at any time after Cycle 1. 
Dose modification of ruxolitinib will be allowed after Cycle 1.  RUXOLITINIB will be provided 
by [CONTACT_127026] a maximum of up to 2 years, after which it w ill be required to procure it 
from commercial sources. 
Adverse events will be captured as long as patients are on stud y and will be used to fully 
characterize the tolerability and toxcicity of this combination  therapy.  These events will be 
defined based on the NCI CTCAE version 4. Patients who withdraw  from the study for any 
reason will be followed and seen 28 days (+/- 5 days) for an end of study visit to capture all 
adverse events.  
Adverse events will only be captured after the first dose of RU XOLITINIB has been 
administered. Table [ADDRESS_372613]

10.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
Adverse Event: An adverse event is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in 
anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic functions, as indicated b y physical signs, symptoms, 
and/or laboratory changes occurring in any phase of the clinica l trial, whether associated 
with drug or placebo and whether or not considered drug related . All of the following are to 
be considered adverse events: 
x An exacerbation of a pre-existing condition 
x An intercurrent illness 
x Any drug interaction 
x Any event related to a concomitant medication 
x Development of an abnormal laboratory value or a significant c hange from baseline 
in a laboratory value within the range of normal, considered by  [CONTACT_304489] 
x An unexpected significant worsening of the cancer under treatm ent. Anticipated day-
to-day fluctuations in the activity of the cancer or the antici pated progression of the 
cancer (other than death) should not be considered an adverse event. 
 
Serious Adverse Event: A serious adverse event is one that is f atal or life-threatening (see 
below), is temporarily or permanently disabling, requires inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or 
 Confidential                                                        Page 24 
Oncology Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 00 – 02-16-2015)  Protocol No.  2014-0344 
 
 
prolonged), or is associated with a congenital anomaly, a new cancer or a drug overdose 
(either accidental or intentional). In addition, any event suggesting a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect or precaution should also be cons idered serious. The MDACC 
criteria for adverse events in Leukemia will be used for report ing (Appendix E). 
 
Life-threatening: means an immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. Life-
threatening does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might 
have caused death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even t hough drug-induced hepatitis 
can be fatal. The following potential adverse reactions may occur:  bone marr ow suppression with risks 
of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.  It is anticipated that there will be a risk of infection both from myelosuppression and immunosuppression.  Th ere is a risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a secondary neoplasm such as acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  Specific side effects of the drugs given during treatment are listed below: 
 
The main anticipated side effect of treatment with Decitabine is myelosuppression. This is 
both expected and acceptable in this clinical setting and will be managed with standard of 
care practice including appropriate anti-microbial prophyalxis for bacterial, fungal and viral 
infections. Red blood cell transfusions are acceptable for a hemoglobin <8g/dL or higher if 
the investigator believes the transfusion will ameliorate symptoms of anemia. Platelet 
transfusions are acceptable in cases of acute bleeding or routi nely for a platelet count below 
20 x 10
9/L.  
Treatment with Ruxolitinib would also expect to induce myelosup presion and the same 
standard practices listed above would apply. The clinical adver se event profile of Ruxolitinib 
as has been described in the published phase I/II would indicat e minimal gastrointestinal 
and other non-hematological toxicity.  
11.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
Response assessment will follow the standard response assessmen t for AML defined 
by [CONTACT_248286] 12: 
Complete Response (CR)

13.0 STATISTICAL DESIGN 
Basis for sample size: 
Phase I 
 
First, a phase I study is performed to assess the safety of dif ferent dosing regimens for 
RUXOLITINIB combined with decitabine. Four combination dose lev els are defined (table 1). A 3+3 
design will be used to for dose escalation. Detailed dose escalation rules are described in the 
following section. A maximum of 18 evaluable patients will enroll in the phase I study. 
 
Dose Escalation Procedures: 
The dose of treatment agent will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients. The starting dose is at dose [ADDRESS_372622] 1 patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT). If only [ADDRESS_372623] 2 of 3 or 2 of up to 6 patients experience a DLT at a given dose level, then the MTD has been exceeded (st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_46528]).  Once the MTD has 
been exceeded, treat another [ADDRESS_372624] cycle. One cycle of therapy is defined 5 days of decitabine and 28 
days of RUXOLITINIB but treatment with RUXOLITINIB can be continued until the next cycle (start of decitabine) in the absence of toxicity, beyond the day 28 an d without interruption.

 Phase II 
 Phase II part is a single arm study using the dosage level reco mmended from phase I. The patients 
treated at the MTD in phase I will not be included in phase II part, and the sample size for phase II is 
a maximum of 24 patients. The trial will be continuously monito red for efficacy and toxicity (non-
hematological ≥grade 3 and hematological ≥grade 4). The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey will be 
used to perform interim efficacy and safety monitoring.  
 
Efficacy and Toxicity Monitoring The primary endpoint is the overall response (CR+CRi) after thr ee cycles of treatment. Overall 
response (OR) and toxicity will be monitored simultaneously usi ng the Bayesian approach of Thall, 
Simon, Estey (1995, 1996) and the extension by [CONTACT_210872] ( 1998. The historical data 
suggested the overall response rate is 10% and the target overall response rate with the 
experimental treatment is 30%. This regimen of the combination treatment will be considered 
worthy of further investigation if it elicits an increase in OR  to 20% with acceptable toxicity.  A 
>20% toxicity rate is considered unacceptable.  Thus, interim m onitoring rules, assuming the prior 
distributions above, were constructed that meet the following t wo conditions, 
Pr(0.2 < θ
E, Toxicity | data) > 0.80 and 
Pr(θ E, OR  > 0.3| data) < 0.025. 
where TE, Toxicity  and T E, OR  are the true toxicity and overall response for the combination treatment, 
respectively.  The first rule provides for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] i f excessive toxicity is highly probable 
(i.e., probability >80.0%) for the combination treatment.  The second condition will stop the study 
early if the data suggest that it is unlikely (i.e., probabilit y < 2.5%) that OR rate of the combination 
treatment is 30%.  Monitoring for toxicity and futility will no t begin until [ADDRESS_372625] been 
evaluated, and cohort size for future evaluations is 2.

Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1.0) was used to generate the toxicity and futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_304470] (Table 9). In order to utilize the software for the design, a 30% 
response rate and beta (0.6, 1.4) priors were assumed for the standard treatment response distribution and experimental treatment response prior distribution, respectively. In addition, a 30% 
toxicity constant rate and beta (0.6, 1.4) priors were assumed for the standard treatment toxicity 
constant rate and experimental treatment toxicity prior distrib ution, respectively. 
 
The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_304471] 30% and the true toxicity rate is 20% was 44%.  Probabilities of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_304472] (i.e., 40%) were 10% when the true  OR rate was 10% and 39% when 
true OR rate was 20%.

14.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
14.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
x A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse exper ience that places the patient, 
in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it 
occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had i t occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233003] 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experi ence when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient o r subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
x Important medical events as defined above, may also be conside red serious adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office. 
x All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must 
be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and pr ocedures outlined in “The 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for 
Investigators on Reporting  Unanticipated Adverse Events for Dr ugs and Devices”.  Unless 
stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of  knowledge of the event). 
 
x All life-threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must 
have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working d ay) of knowledge of the event 
to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 
x Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be Utilized for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.

development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
x Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_304492] (Safety Project Manager 
IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177191], Good Clinical Pra ctices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy. 
Investigator Communication with Supporting Companies: 
Serious adverse events (SAE) will be captured from the time of the first protocol-specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_372631] dose of drug.  The i nvestigator will inform Incyte of any SAE 
or pregnancy within 24 hours of being aware of the event via email and/or fax. Respective 
companies will to be informed based on the attribution of a giv en event: 
 
1. Due to RUXOLITINIB alone – These SAEs will only to be report ed to INCYTE. 
2. Due to both the RUXOLITINIB and decitabine – These SAEs will be reported to INCYTE 
3. All pregnancies will be reported to INCYTE If the investigat or can’t associate causality 
with one or the other alone then causality needs to be associat ed with the combination of 
the products.  These SAEs will go to INCYTE. 
 
Adverse events will be documented in the Leukemia-specific AE R ecording and Reporting 
Guidelines attached in Appendix E. medical record and entered i nto the case report form. PDMS/ 
CORE will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol. All adverse events will be 
captured in CRF during Phase I portion of the study.  In Phase II, only Grade [ADDRESS_372632] be completed and supplied to Incyte within 24-hours/1-business day at the latest on the following working day.  The i nitial report must be as complete as 
possible, including details of the current illness and (serious ) adverse event, and an assessment of 
the causal relationship between the event and the investigation al product(s).  Information not 
available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory 
values received after the report) must be documented on a follo w-up MDACC IND eSAE reporting 
form.

After one cycle of therapy, after 3 cycles, and then every 3 cy cles while on the study (in addition to 
baseline and end of study samples), peripheral blood will be collected for measurements of 
inflammatory cytokine levels, (including but not limited to IL6, TNF-alpha, CRP and IL10), expression 
of different proteins related to intracellular signaling, (incl uding but not limted to STAT3, STAT5, and 
JAK2), and methylation of genes (including but not limited to p 15, ER, and ECAD). This will include 
collection of: one red top (10ml) and two purple top tubes (10ml each).  All samples will be submitted 
to the laboratory of [CONTACT_304494] at MD Anderson. 
All research samples may not be drawn at all times, missed samp les will not be considered a 
deviation. 16.[ADDRESS_372633] agents deemed necessary for patient support ive care are permitted (antibiotics, 
allopurinol, GCSF). Only other chemotherapy agents or investiga tional agents are prohibited. 
Temporary prior measures to control blood counts, such as apheresis or hydrea are allowed.

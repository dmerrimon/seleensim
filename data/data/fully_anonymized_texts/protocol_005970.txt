This study  is funded  by [CONTACT_33230] -Centered  Outcomes  Research  Institute  (PCORI). PCORI  has 
established  a two-staged  approach  to its study  development,  implementation,  and analysis  of 
findings.    
 In Stage  I, we will include  developm ent of interventions,  solidifying  partnerships,  IRB 
approval,  and training  of project  staff.  Research  activities  in this Stage  I will include:  
conducting  focus  groups  and one-on-one cognitive  interviews  with  stakeholders  to 
provide  feedback  on the intervention  materials  and on the content  and flow  of the 
EMR -based  asthma  decision  support  tool.   
 
 In Stage  II, we will conduct  a 3-arm randomized  controlled  trial among  elderly  patients  
with  poorly  controlled  asthma  from  the clinics  of the Mount  Sinai  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  Mount  
Sinai’s  St. Luke’s -Roosevelt,  and Institute  for Family  Health.  Patients  will be randomized  
to clinic - or home -based  support  programs  or to a usual  care  control  arm and will be 
observed for 12-months.   
 
Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words): 
We will compare  th e  effectiveness  of home -based  vs. clinic -based  care  coordination and self-
management  support  to improve  asthma  treatment  and outcomes  for older  adult  asthmatics  
from  Latino  and African -American  communities.  Older  Latino  and African -American  adults with  
asthma have  a disproportionately  higher  risk of poorer  health  and health  outcomes  resulting  
from  their  disease  compared  to whites.  Several  contributing  factors  include  but are not limited  
to multiple  morbidities,  greater  medication  regimen  comple xity,  limited  health  literacy  and 
English  proficiency,  healthcare  costs,  and beliefs  about  medications  and illness  that affect  
medication  use.  
 
Clinics  have  successfully  leveraged  the electronic medical  record  (EMR)  to improve  asthma  care  
by [CONTACT_39487].  Unfortunately,  this clinician -centric  strategy  cannot  compensate  for the diverse  
demographic, psychosocial,  health  status  and health  systems  challenges  faced  by [CONTACT_544202].  
However, two viable  patient -centric strategies  have  emerged  with  great  promise:  clinic-based  
care  management  support  led by a care  coach,  and home- based  patient/family  support  led by 
a community  health  worker. At present,  no study  to our knowledge  has directly  compared  these  
approaches  for improving  asthma care  and outcomes  for any adults,  including  the elderly .  
 
In this study,  we will compare  these  two patient- centric self- management  support strategies,  
and couple them  with  clinician -centric, EMR- based  clinician  decision  support  to complete  a 3600 
approach  to improving  asthma  care  and outcomes  for older  adults.

Revised  9/2/14 1) Objectives: 
Our specific  aims  and hypotheses  are: 
Aim 1: To compare  the effectiveness  of clinic  and home -based  asthma  care  coordination  
and self- management  support  to improve  care  and asthma- related  outcomes.  
Hypotheses : Compare d to usual  care,  patients  receiving  either clinic - or home -based  
support  will: 
1) have  better  asthma  outcomes  (control,  quality  of life, less need  for urgent  care)  
2) have  better  asthma  self- management  (medication  adherence,  trigger  avoidance,  
appointment  keepin g, use of action  plans)  
Aim 2: To identify  subsets of individuals who will have greater benefit from home -based 
care  coordination  and self- management  support  compared  to clinic -based support.  
Hypothesis : Patients  with  more  severe  asthma  and those  at greate r risk of missed clinic 
appointments because of physical or cognitive impairment and psychosocial issues (e.g., 
substance abuse, mental illness) will be more likely to benefit from the home -based 
intervention.  
 
In Stage  I, we will address  these  aims  throug h future  developi[INVESTIGATOR_564170]. We will 
conduct  focus  groups  and one-on-one cognitive  interviews  with  stakeholders  to provide  
feedback  on the intervention  materials  and on the content  and flow  of the EMR -based  asthma  
decision  support  tool.  
 
In Stage  II, we will conduct  a 3-arm randomized  controlled trial among  elderly  patients  with  
poorly  controlled  asthma  from  the clinics of the Mount  Sinai  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , Mount  Sinai’s St. Luke’s -
Roosevelt  and Institute  for Family  Health.  Patients  will be randomized  to clinic- or home -based  
support  programs  or to a usual  care  control  arm and will be observed for 12-months.  
 
2) Background 
IMPACT OF THE CONDITION ON THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS  
Asthma, Disparities, and Aging. African-Americans and Latinos, low-income individuals, and 
the elderly suffer disproportionately from asthma in the US. Physical factors like frailty and 
long term changes to the lung and immune system can contribute to poorer outcomes 
among older asthmatics. Much of asthma outcomes in the elderly are traceable to the care 
they receive and their ability to effectively manage their illness between medical visits. 
Compared with younger adult asthmatics, the elderly have more chronic illnesses and more 
complex medication regimens, and higher prevalence of depression and cognitive and 
functional impairments. They are also more likely to have low health literacy, fixed incomes 
and high healthcare costs, and less likely to have reliable social supports. Alone or in 
combination, these factors challenge the self-management skills of older adults.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_741142] chosen to compare 2 promising mechanisms for engaging older adults in asthma care, 
improving their care, health and quality of life. The approaches take advantage of emerging 
models of care delivery, use of the practice-based care coordinator and the community health 
worker conducting home visits.  
 
Clinic-Based Care Coordination and Self-Management Support (CC/SMS). Self-management 
support programs have been used extensively in primary care for several decades with 
important benefits, including for older adults. Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MSH) and The Institute 
for Family Health (IFH) have developed successful models of care coordination/self-
management support based on the Chronic Care Model and others. At MSH, the Preventing 
Admissions Care Team uses care coordinators to provide patients with extensive self-
management and social services support. This program has resulted in a 50% reduction in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564171]. MSH has also 
applied this approach to reducing ED revisits by [CONTACT_21140], and has created a team of care 
coaches in the primary care practices who use the same strategies toward the goal of 
improving diabetes care and outcomes. At IFH, a Chronic Care Model-based diabetes care 
management program resulted in a 22% reduction in HbA1c levels, a measure of diabetes 
control, indicating substantially improved diabetes control. IFH has also broadly and 
successfully implemented the Collaborative Care Model for depression management in 
primary care, again using care coordination and self-management support as a core 
element.  
 
Community Health Worker Programs.  Programs use community health workers (CHWs) to 
promote the well-being and improve the health of individuals with diseases like asthma, 
diabetes and hypertension by [CONTACT_564184], addressing 
barriers to care, and promoting self-management activities. CHWs are lay persons with 
limited training in self-management support for one or more conditions. They are typi[INVESTIGATOR_564172]:  Clinic-based vs. home -based support to improve care and

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_741143] exclusively on 
pediatric populations. A major innovation of our study is the plan to adopt the CHW model 
for older asthmatics. 
 
Comparing Home- and Clinic-Based CC/SMS.  Our emphasis on comparing home versus clinic-
based strategies is highly germane to older asthmatic patients, as both have legitimate strengths 
and weaknesses. Home-based interventions allow for patient engagement in a setting where the 
CHW can more directly and objectively determine asthma self-management concerns related to 
one’s physical environment. In addition, elderly patients are often socially isolated and have 
fixed incomes, posing challenges for transport to and from the clinic. Further, with greater 
comorbidity, more frequent visits may not be as plausible. Yet there are negatives as well for 
home-based approaches; when outsourcing care coordination and self-management support 
services, there may continue to be a disconnect between these activities and clinical decision 
making and care since it is not based directly in the clinic itself. Furthermore, some patients may 
be less receptive to the intrusion of a home visit. For clinic-based care, the strengths of home-
based interventions are the weaknesses here. Assessments and interventions are not tailored to 
one’s living situation (i.e. avoiding triggers, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_564173]). At 
times follow-up may require phone calls rather than face- to-face meetings to reach patients. 
And collaboration between the care coach and PCP is greatly enhanced when the two work in 
the same location. 
 
3) Setting of the Human Research 
In Stage I , we will recruit stakeholders to participate in focus groups and cognitive 
interviews, and in Stage II we will recruit patients to participate in a 3-arm RCT. The research

Revised  9/2/14  In Stage I,  the queries will identify patients ≥[ADDRESS_741151] numbers, date of birth, date and time of upcoming clinic appointment 
(within 4 weeks), address, phone number, and name [CONTACT_564198].  At Mount Sinai, 
these queries will identify pat ients ages ≥50 years.  
 In Stage II,  three queries will identify patients ≥ 55 years with an asthma diagnosis.  
 
 POPULATION MANAGEMENT REPORT:  Query #[ADDRESS_741152] patients’ names, medical record 
numbers, social security numbers, date of birth, date and time of upcoming clinic 
appointment (within 4 weeks), address, phone number, and name [CONTACT_564198]. 
At ST. L[LOCATION_006]E’S, this query will also be generated.  
 ACUTE CARE REPORT:  Query #[ADDRESS_741153] patients’ names, medical record numbers, social security number s, date of birth, 
address, phone number, oral steroid use, latest ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186] (in past 12 months) and 
name [CONTACT_564198]. At ST. L[LOCATION_006]E’S, this query will not be generated. 
 POINT OF CARE REFERRAL REPORT:  Query #[ADDRESS_741154]. L[LOCATION_006]E’S , this report will be used as described in Stage I 
activities (see below) to assist PCPs with approaching patients.  
 
At MOUNT SINAI: 
We will obtain permission from physicians to recruit their patients. A request form will be 
distributed to physicians who see patients in IMA and pulmonary clinics. If we do not hear back 
by [CONTACT_564186], mail, or fax, we will assume that we have permission to offer eligible 
patients the opportunity to participate in this study. Each physician will choose their preferred 
method of recruitment for their patients. Physicians will choose to:  
a) Allow RAs to offer participation to all asthma patients under their care who are ≥50 years;  
b) Require RAs to ask their permission by [CONTACT_564187] a patient- by-patient basis, or;  
c) Prohibit study personnel from directly approaching patients under their care. 
 
Eligible patients will also be identified from a previous study (NIH Grant#: R01HL096612; GCO#: 
08-1084; HSM#11-[ZIP_CODE]). Patients previously enrolled in the aforementioned study indicated 
that they would like to be contact[CONTACT_564188]. A master list of these 
patients (name, medical record number, date of birth, address, phone number, and name [CONTACT_564199]) will be generated for recruitment in this new study. 
 
At ST. L[LOCATION_006]E’S ROOSEVELT:  
There will be two methods in which recruitment will occur in the Internal Medicine and 
Pulmonary clinics.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_741155] method :  
1) A list will be generated from an eCW query to identify patients with asthma who are 55years 
and older.  
2) The RA will pre-screen the list for potentially eligible patien ts on eCW .  
3) The RA will then email the providers of potentially eligible patient s asking permission to 
approach them .  
4) The RA will then approach the patient during their scheduled visit and introduce the study 
and administer the eligibility screener to those interested in participation. 
 
In the second method: 
1) A list will be generated from an eCW query to identify patients with asthma who are 55 
years and older.  
2) The RA will pre-screen the list for potentially eligible participants on eCW .  
3) The RA will then email the providers of potentially eligible participants and request 
permission to send a letter on their behalf describing the study. We will only send a 
recruitment letter to those patients the provider recommends for the study .  
4) The RA will then send the recruitment letter #1 where patients are provided with a phone 
number to opt in and hotline number to opt out. 
5) If the study team did not hear from the patients after 10 days, recruitment letter #2 will be 
sent .  This letter states that a member of the study team will call them in 10 days if we do 
not receive an opt out call from them. 
6) Patients who do not opt-out after 10 days will be contact[CONTACT_564189]. 
7) Patients who speak with the RA on the telephone will be screened for eligibility. 
 
Potentially eligible caregivers (Stage I only) will be identified from our eligible patient lists. At 
Mount Sinai, we will ask patients if they have a caregiver and if we may contact [CONTACT_564190] I of the study.  At St. Luke’s Roosevelt, we w ill provide patients with a letter 
to give their caregiver. The letter to their caregiver will have an opt-in hotline.  
 
Potentially eligible clinicians  (Stage I only) will be identified from clinical practices participating 
in this study. 
 
RECRUITMENT OF HUMAN SUBJECTS (Patients, Caregivers and Clinicians):  
In Stage I , we will recruit stakeholders to participate in focus groups and cognitive interviews. In 
Stage II , we will recruit patients to participate in a 3-arm RCT. In both stages, we will approach 
participants as described below: 
- Patients (Stage I and II) – RAs at Mount Sinai will recruit patients from Mount Sinai 
(physician-approved) and SLR (release form provided) by [CONTACT_225622] a recruitment 
letter. The recruitment letter will have an opt-out hotline number to call. Ten (10) days 
after the recruitment letter, an RA will approach the patient over the telephone. RAs

Revised  9/2/14 will use a recruitment script. If PCP approaches a patient about the study in a clinic 
appointment and the patient is interested in meeting with the RA in-person, the patient 
will be offered the opportunity to complete the eligibility screener that same day a nd 
by[CONTACT_564191]. 
- Caregivers (Stage I only) – RAs will ask eligible patients if they have a caregiver, and if we 
may approach their caregiver for participation in one of these focus groups or cognitive 
interviews as well. Caregivers will be approached over the telephone. RAs will use a 
recruitment script. At SLR, we will provide a letter for the patient to provide to the 
caregiver. The letter will include an opt-in hotline.  
- Clinicians (Stage I only) – The PIs will make announcements at faculty meetings, staff 
meetings, and send out Division-wide recruitment emails. Clinicians will be invited to 
contact [CONTACT_564192].  
 
In Stage I , RAs will schedule interested subjects for either a focus group session or cognitive 
interview. On the day of a focus group session or cognitive interview, the RA will meet with the 
subjects to administer the informed consent procedure. In Stage II , RAs will administer the 
eligibility screen and schedule the baseline rese arch visit at the patient’s preferred location (in 
the clinic or in the patient’s home). The RA will call to confirm the baseline research visit 1 -2 
days in advance.  
 
Note:  No identifiable information beyond what is listed in the Waiver of Authorization will be 
automatically collected from the potential subjects prior to them being consented. If the 
potential subject decides not to sign informed consent, they will be asked to verbally give 
permission for de-identified information to be recorded in order to keep track of whether 
subjects who decide not to participate are different from those who decide to participate. They 
will be clearly told that this is optional and that if they refuse, it will have no bearing on their 
medical care. They will be told that the de-identified information we would like to record is the 
following: gender, age (not date of birth), race, and ethnicity. In the unlikely event that anyone 
is older than 89 years, they will be categorized as ’90 or older’ rather than specifying the a ge.  
 
While this application and protocol seeks approval for conducting the study at Mount 
Sinai and SLR sites, IFH recruitment procedures are as follows:  
Epic queries will identify potentially eligible patients; Epic reports will list their 
name, medical record number, date of birth, date and time of upcoming clinic 
appointment (within 4 weeks), address, phone number, and name [CONTACT_564200]. We will obtain permission from physicians to recruit their patients 
(see Letter request at Attachment A.) A request form will be distributed to 
physicians who see patients at the study sites. Each physician will choose their 
preferred method of recruitment for their patients. Physicians will choose to:

Revised  9/2/14 The duration of Stage I is 8 months. The duration of Stage II  is 2 years and 4 months. 
Patients will be followed from the time of consent from baseline through the 12-month 
follow up. 
 
e) Study Endpoints 
Stage I  activities are estimated to close on 11/30/2014. Stage II activities are estimated to 
close on 12/30/2017. We will follow patients for one year (12 months) or until death. We 
will continue to track patients throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564176].  
 
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research 
STAGE I.  Focus Groups and Cognitive Interviews. (Months 0- 8) 
We will conduct  focus  groups  and cognitive  interviews  with  patients, caregivers,  and 
clinicians.  We expect to conduct 30 cognitive interviews with stakeholders on the 
intervention protocols and materials, 9 -12 focus groups on this same topic and 8 -10 
interviews with clinicians focusing on the EMR -decision support tool. Team members will 
compare notes after conducting two interviews at each site and will revise the protocols, 
materials, and EMR -screen shots  before proceeding to the next round of interviews. 
Interviews will continue until no further substantive changes are required. We will 
reimburse subjects $25 in cash. The table below describes the topi[INVESTIGATOR_564177]. At the end of each focus gro ups or cognitive interview, we will ask participant s 
to complete an Information Sheet. The Information Sheet for patients/caregivers asks about 
gender, age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, English ability, and age the 
patient was first told they had asthma. The Information Sheet for provid ers asks about their 
gender, role in the clinic, clinical training, work domain, what electronic medical records 
they have used in the past. The sheet also asks them to rate their knowledge and skills in 
managing asthma in adults, how helpful Epic is in he lpi[INVESTIGATOR_564178], and provide any suggestions for what features could be added to Epic to help 
them to better manage their patients with asthma.

STAGE II. Randomized Controlled Trial. (Months 9-36) 
ACC AND CHW ASTHMA PROGRAM DETAILS. The ACC and CHW programs for asthma CC/SMS 
will have the same objectives and provide the same general services. The primary difference will 
be the location, home or office, in which the bulk of services are provided, and the attendant 
advantages and disadvantages these locations present. Note: the ACC and CHW programs will 
be developed from existing, successfully operating programs at IFH and MSH, and in the East 
Harlem and South Bronx communities.  
 
 Training. During this Stage I  there will be a brief orientation to the study for all clinical 
and non-clinical staff in the participating clinics. The project manager will train the four 
RAs in all study protocols. The RAs will have appropriate Human Subjects Training 
Program certification. Our team of experts (Asthma Social Workers, Care Managers, 
General Internists, and Pulmonologists) will train the ACCs and CHWs. All protocols and 
materials will be carefully reviewed. A pulmonologist and asthma social worker 
(overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wisnivesky) will conduct the asthma trainings, which will cover basic 
disease processes and the role of allergens and other triggers, symptom and severity 
assessments (ACT and peak flow), medications and other management strategies, 
medication adherence and other self-management behaviors (action plans, trigger 
avoidance, appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.). [CONTACT_547003] will lead training on home 
assessment, with a discussion on performing the assessment by [CONTACT_18654]-reports 
(germane to the work of the ACC). [CONTACT_174128] will lead the training on chronic illness 
management (e.g., methods to support adherence, motivational interviewing) and 
principals of care coordination, and [CONTACT_564202] will supplement this with information and 
methods relevant to the CHW and home-based support. We will include some existing 
CHWs and CCs for this study, thus limiting additional training to asthma-specific 
management, basic management of other chronic conditions, and the program 
protocols. Trainings will include role playing and interviews with actual patients. 
Complete training will be approximately 60 hours. During Stage II , ACC/CHWs will be 
supervised at regular intervals of program implementation to ensure fidelity to program 
protocols and to reinforce learning.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_741158] a 3-arm, patient-randomized pragmatic 
clinical trial following older adults with uncontrolled asthma for up to 12 months. We will 
register the trial at ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 Recruitment. (Procedures are described in detail above in #5a. ) Patients will be 
identified from several EMR reports. Following approval by [CONTACT_21122], patients will receive 
a letter about the research study and the upcoming call from the RA. The letter will have 
a toll-free telephone number to enable patients to call and opt-out. The RA will phone 
patients to describe the study, recruit, screen for asthma control and eligibility, and 
schedule for a baseline research interview. All research interviews will take place at the 
preferred location of the patient (in the clinic or in patients’ home).  
 
 Randomization. After the RA has completed the baseline research interview, the PM 
will access a dedicated website that implements the algorithm to obtain the assignment. 
The PM will notify the ACCs or CHWs that a new patient is assigned to their respective 
intervention arm. Randomization to the study arms will be made with a 1:1:[ADDRESS_741159] to 
important covariates including site and level of asthma control (not well controlled vs. 
very poorly controlled as per NAEPP guidelines) . A minimization technique will be 
employed (i.e., allocation is assigned to the arm that minimizes an imbalance score 
calculated based on site and asthma control). Please note:  at the end of the 12-month 
study period, patients assigned to the usual care arm will be given the option to meet 
with a clinic-based care coach.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_741161]. Wolf is an expert in qualitative research and will lead this effort following 
well-established methods. 
         Quantitative  data will also be collected from stakeholders via written 
questionnaires. Among patients, at month 12 we will assess: general helpfulness of the 
program for improving their health (rated on a scale of 1 to 10), and trust in the ACC or 
CHW, measured with adapted items from the CAHPS. Among all clinicians in the 
participating sites, at study month 30 we will assess general helpfulness of the program 
for improving their patients’ health, trust in the ACC or CHW, quality of the 
communication with the ACC/CHW, helpfulness of EMR-based support tool and barriers 
to using it. We will further assess clinicians’ use of the decision suppo rt tool through 
electronic inquiries of the EMR. These will include the proportion of encounters in which 
the PCPs used the decision support tools, what elements they used or actively 
disregarded, and when they were used. Assessments of ACC activities will include 
reviews of their documentation on a random selection of [ADDRESS_741162] of topi[INVESTIGATOR_564182]-person encounters, and the frequency of documented exchanges between the 
ACC/CHW and PCP. The RAs will use a standardized chart abstraction form.

the study. The research data collected and stored will have the study identification 
number and no other identifying information on it. Research data (hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will 
be stored in a locked file cabinet where the project manager ’s office is located in the 
Center for Advanced Medicine (CAM) Building at [ADDRESS_741164] 
manager ’s office at Mount Sinai. It will be stored in a locked cabinet in the project 
manager’s office. Data will be downloaded weekly from the recording device will be 
kept on the project manager’ s computer using an encryption software (TrueCrypt) 
to further ensure the safety of the audiofiles. De-identified transcripts will be sent to 
one of our partner organizations (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) for coding 
and analysis. 
 
i) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects 
The Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for Stage I activities is described below.  The 
Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the study will be formed before the RCT 
begins in Stage II .  
 
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan 
A) Monitoring Entity:  [CONTACT_279035] will be responsible for the data safety and monitoring 
for the entire study; he will also oversee the safety and monitoring of data collected at 
ISMMS. [CONTACT_564203] will be responsible for the safety and monitoring of data collected at IFH.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_741165]. Wolf will oversee the data 
safety and monitoring of the data at Northwestern University.  
 
B)  Procedures for Monitoring Study Safety: 1) Safety reviews: The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_109219] a monthly basis. 2) Annual review: The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_172078] a continuing basis for subject safety and 
include results of the review in the annual progress reports submitted to the safety officer 
and the Institutional Review Board. 3) Annual report: The annual report will include a list of 
adverse events. The annual report will address: a) whether adverse event rates are 
consistent with pre-study assumptions; b) reason for dropouts from the study; c) whether 
all participants met entry criteria; d) whether continuation of the study is justified on the 
basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and e) 
conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771]. 3) Institutional Review 
Board review: The Institutional Review Board will review each protocol annually for safety. 
 
[CONTACT_279035] will be responsible for monitoring and reporting safety data from all study 
sites (ISMMS, IFH, and Northwestern University). [CONTACT_564203] will supervise the collection and 
reporting of safety data for all participants enrolled at IFH . Adverse events will be reported 
to the ISMMS and IFH IRBs. Additionally, safety data from IFH will be sent to ISMMS 
monthly. These data will be summarized individually and then combined with Mount Sinai 
data for reporting to the IRB and PCORI as necessary. Safety data from both study sites will 
be discussed monthly during study meetings with investigators from all study sites. We have 
used similar procedures in our prior studies conducted at ISMMS, IFH and Northwestern 
University.  
 
In addition, we will use encryption software (Truecrypt, TrueCrypt Foundation) to protect all 
electronic audio data collected at ISMMS. Audio files from ISMMS and IFH will be sent for 
transcription and the transcripts will be sent to Northwestern University. Northwestern will 
serve as the Data Coordinating Center.  
 
j) Withdrawal of Subjects 
Patients are withdrawn from the study when they are found to be ineligible or 
become ineligible after enrollment. When patients are withdrawn, they are still 
followed up with research interviews, and also with the intervention (if the 
subject had been randomized to an intervention arm), but their data is later on 
excluded from analysis.

Revised  9/2/14 Participation in the study poses minimal risk of psychological, social and economic 
harm.  Informing subjects in advance that they may decline to answer any question 
asked during the interview will mitigate any risks associated with expressing their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153] (e.g., feeling uncomfortable).  They will also be assured they can terminate 
their participation in the study at any time without penalty.   
 
Greater than minimal risk is expected for subjects in the RCT. Participants enrolled into the 
intervention arms of this study are expected to benefit, having better asthma control. While 
participants in the usual care arm of this study may not benefit directly from their 
participation, we anticipate results from this study to benefit future patients by [CONTACT_564193], including the multidisciplinary 
management of chronic diseases and the medical home concept.  
 
There always exists, the potential for loss of private information; however, there are 
procedures in place to minimize this risk. Procedures include: regular quality control 
data checks, encryption of data, and adherence to the ISMMS policy on data safety 
and transfer.  
7) Provisions for Research Related Injury 
This research involves minimal to no risk for subjects. The investigators on this project will make 
themselves available to meet with any participants expressing medical or psychological distress 
while being interviewed.  
 
In order to reduce the risk of subjects: 
1. Psychological distress may be provoked by [CONTACT_564194].  
In order to reduce the risk of subjects becoming psychologically distressed, subjects will be 
asked at the time of consent to inform a member of the research staff if at any point during 
the study they feel that participating in the research is causing them undue distress. 
Subjects will also be clearly instructed at each study visit that they are free to discontinue 
their participation in the research project at any time and that this will have no 
consequences at all for their continued medical care. Additionally , if study personnel find 
that the subject requires referral for mental health services (e.g., suicidal ideation) during 
the course of the intervention, the study personnel will contact [CONTACT_423]’s PCP directly to 
arrange for referral to mental health services. The IMA clinic has mental health professionals 
in place to address any distress that is brought on during the interview questions. The costs 
associated with these services will be included as a part of usual care in IMA.  
2. Violation of participant confidentiality is always a potential risk in research where 
identifiable data is collected. 
We have measures and protocols in place to deter the loss of identifiable data. See #5h.

9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
Subjects will be informed that their data is confidential. Subjects may stop participation at 
any time or skip any question if he/she feels uncomfortable. 
 
Throughout the study, steps will be taken to ensure the privacy of participants. The research 
personnel will not provide details of study to subjects in public waiting areas but will instead 
disclose details in one of the private exam rooms of the clinic. The research personnel will 
communicate with subjects through the contact [CONTACT_564196]. 
 
To ensure that subjects feel at ease throughout the interviews and intervention sessions, 
the research personnel will remind the subjects that if at any point he/she becomes 
frustrated or does not wish to answer a particular question or participate in an activity or 
discussion, he/she does not have to do so. In addition, the research personnel will give 
opportunities for breaks throughout the interviews and sessions.  
 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects 
Not applicable. 
 
11) Payment to Subjects 
Subjects enrolled in Stage I study activities (focus groups, cognitive interviews) will be 
reimbursed for their time and effort at each interview with $25 in cash ($25 total). 
Participating SLR staff will not receive monetary compensation; they will be provided with 
refreshments at the session. Subjects enrolled in Stage II study activities (research 
interviews at baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months) will be compensated for their 
time and effort at each interview.

Title International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and 
Invasive Approaches - Chronic Kidney Disease  
Study Objectives  Primary objective  is to determine whether an  initial  invasive (INV) strategy 
of cardiac catheterization and optimal revascularization , if feasible , in 
addition to optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with stable ischemic 
heart disease ( SIHD ) and at least moderate ischemia on ischemia testing  
reduces the incidence of the composite of death or nonfatal myocar dial 
infarction compared with a conservative (CON) strategy of optimal medical 
therapy alone with cardiac catheterization and revascularization reserved 
for failure of OMT , in participants with advanced CKD (defined as those 
with estimated glomerular filtr ation rate [eGFR] <30 or on dialysis) . 
Secondary objective  is to determine whether an INV strategy is more 
effective than CON strategy in improving angina control, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_345500] (SAQ) Angina Frequency scale, and 
disease -specific quality of life, as assessed by [CONTACT_587864].  
Other secondary objectives include comparing the incidence of the 
composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587837]; individual components of this endpoint; all -cause death; stroke; as 
well as comparing health resource utilization, cost, and cost -effectiveness 
between the two randomized strategies.

Among patients with advanced CKD, c ardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death ,1, 2 
15-30 times higher than the age -adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate in the general 
population.3, 4 The p rojected 4 -year mortality is >50% in patients with advanced  CKD 5-[ADDRESS_864171] cancers, heart failure, stroke  or 
MI.10 Participants with advanced CKD are 5 -10 times more likely to die than to reach end stage 
renal disease (ESRD) .11  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], ~80%  of contemporary coronary artery disease (CAD) 
trials exclude p articipants with advanced CKD . [ADDRESS_864172] of the treatments aimed at reducing 
cardiovascular events in advanced CKD are therefore extrapolated from cohorts without 
advanced CKD. Participants  with advan ced CKD and cardiovascular disease are undertreated 
with less  frequent  use of statins and revascularization therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the optimal management 
approach to these patients is unknown.  Participants with advanced CKD are notably 
underrepresented in contempo rary trials comparing  revascularization with medical therapy in 
SIHD patients , such as the By[CONTACT_587865] 2 Diabetes 
(BARI 2D) trial13 or the Clinical Outcomes Utilizi ng Revascularization and Aggressive Drug 
Evaluation  (COURAGE) trial ,[ADDRESS_864173] -induced acute kidney injury (AKI), 15, 16 dialysis , major bleeding  
and short -term risk of death. However, there is controversy in the medical literature regarding 
the incidence (<1% to >30%), effective treatment (saline hydration, N -acetyl cys teine, or sodium 
bicarbonate) and prognosis of contrast induced AKI (<0.5% to >5% requiring dialysis).17-[ADDRESS_864174]  been associated with increase in short -term 
mortality residual confounding in these studies makes interpretation difficult. Moreover it is 
unknown if these short -term increased risks are offset by [CONTACT_7419] -term benefits.  Limited 
observational study in the CKD  cohort suggests a survival benefit of revascularization when 
compared with medical therapy alone long -term, 21-24 despi[INVESTIGATOR_645506] -term risks. 
However, the medical therapy in these trials was not optimized, drug eluting stents were rarely 
used and there is undoubtedly  inherent selection and ascertainment bias with observat ional 
studies. The  above has resulted in substantial clinical equipoise in the management of 
these patients  with the rates of revascularization  of only around 10 -45%.21, 23, [ADDRESS_864175] profound implications for guidelines, health policy, and clinical

Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  17 4. STUDY DESIGN  
The ISCHEMIA -CKD  trial is an international, randomized, comparative effectiveness study. 
Approximately 1,000 participant s at approximately 500 sites  worldwide with  advanced CKD 
(defined as eGFR<30 or on dialysis) and at least moderate  ischemia on ischemia testing  will be 
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the INV or CON strategies . 
The design of the trial to randomize patients upstream of cath is advanta geous as it will expose 
only 50% of participants (enrolled to INV) to contrast agent and will be the largest treatment 
strategy trial in advanced  CKD patients with SIHD.   
ISCHEMIA -CKD is designed to run in parallel with it’s parent study, ISCHEMIA , which 
randomizes patients with eGFR >30, SIHD, and at least moderate ischemia in 1:[ADDRESS_864177] moderate ischemia  (see 
section  5.1) will be identified and screened for clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria ( see section 
4.3). Patients who are suspected to be trial eligible may also be pre-screened, for example, prior 
to clinically indicated ischemia  testing  in clinical areas where  SIHD patients are cared for.  
Patients who meet clinical and ischemia (site -interpreted) eligibi lity criteria and are interested in 
participating in the trial will be enrolled by [CONTACT_587870] a study 
number via the interactive voice response system (IVRS) or interactive web response system 
(IXRS) ( see section 5.3). Ischemia  test data (e.g. , images, ECG, report) will be transferred to 
the relevant core lab electronically for enrolled  participant s (see Figure 1 ).   
Participants with known or a high likelihood of  unprotected left main stenosis ≥50% will be 
excluded  before randomization . Timing of Randomization:  Participants determined to be eligible 
for randomization should be randomized within a target of 15 days of consent, and participant s 
randomized to INV strategy should undergo catheterization within a target of 30 days after 
randomization, with optimal revascularizatio n therapy (ORT) soon thereafter as appropriate. 
Participant s will be enrolled over approximately 3.5 years . Randomized participant s will be 
followed for an average of approximately 4 years .  The minimum follow -up period for 
randomized participant s will be approximately 18 -24 months following randomization of the final 
participant. A schedule of assessments is provided in section 9.

5.2 Informed Consent Process  
The study will be reviewed with the prospective study participant  by [CONTACT_15009]/her 
designee . This discussion is a critical component of the consent process and  the prospective study 
participant  will be given adequate time for this discussion and to read the written consent form.  Two 
standard clinical care strategies are being compared in this study and clinicians should enroll 
patients for whom  there is clinical equipoise  regarding their managem ent. Prevailing practice 
patterns vary widely within and between regions; the discussion with prospective participants  should 
note these local patterns . The investigator or his/her designee will be available to answer questions 
about the study including pr ocedures, risks, and alternatives. The informed consent form will be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_587874].  
In addition, prospective study participants  will be requested to  consent to a biorepository sample, 
and to allow use of the biorepository sample for biomarkers and/or genetic analysis  (DNA)  in this 
optional study component conducted at participating sites .  Prospective study participant s will be 
informed that declining participation in the biomarker or genetic analysis  portion of the study does 
not preclude their participation in the main study.  A copy of the signed consent form will be given to 
the participant  and the original(s) will be kept securely with each participant ’s research records.   
Specific consent will be obtaine d before any protocol -mandated procedure that requires consent is 
performed. The consent will allow for protected health information (PHI) to be transferred to the 
Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC ) and/or the Regional Research Organization that serves as the 
Coordinating Center in the country/region unless prohibited by [CONTACT_19124]. This will make it possible 
for another site within that country or the CCC to follow participant s if a site closes down or cannot 
continue follow -up for any reason , and to look up vital status . Privacy regulations in all countries will 
be followed, (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] in the US; Personal 
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act [PI[INVESTIGATOR_15654]] in Canada; European Uni on 
Directive on Data Privacy [EU Directive]). For North American participants only , PHI will also be sent 
to the EQOLCC .

System (IXRS)  
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864182]  criteria has provided informed consent, 
the study coordinator or investigator at the site will call the IVRS  or log on to the IXRS  to receive a 
participa nt identification number.  At this point the participant  is registered as enrolled .   
Several language options will be provided for international sites using IVRS/IXRS. To eliminate any 
manual transcription errors , IVRS/IXRS will be programmed to electronically transfer the participant  
data and study identification number to create the participant ’s case book within the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  
In order to randomize the participant , the study coordinato r or investigator will call IVRS or log in to 
IXRS a second time. Subjects meeting all clinical, and siteinclusion/exclusion criteria will then be 
randomized to either the INV or CON strategy and will be registered as randomized . This information 
will be t ransmitted to the participant ’s electronic case book within the EDC system.  
Detailed information on enrollment and randomization will be provided in the MOO  and in specific 
IVRS/IXRS  materials . 
5.[ADDRESS_864183] data  (e.g., imag es, ECG, reports)  will be transferred electronically to the appropriate 
core lab for enrolled participants . The core lab s will review and interpret the degree of ischemia ; this 
data will be used for post -hoc analysis .    
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  23 6. MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES  
Table 1.  Components of CON and INV management strategies  
 
CON (Section 6.1)  
INV (Section 6.2) 
 Optimal medical therapy (OMT; includes 
angina management) ( Section 6.3) 
 Provisional cardiac catheterization ( Section 
6.6)  Optimal medical therapy (OMT; includes 
angina management) ( Section 6.3) 
 Cardiac catheterization  
 Optimal revascularization therapy (ORT)  
(Section 6.4) 
 
6.1 Conservative (CON) Strategy  
In participant s randomized to the CON strategy, initial management with OMT alone will be 
employed  (described below). A fundamental principle of the CON strategy is to restrict cath to 
participant s who fail OMT, i.e. , those who experience an acute coronary syndrome, acute ischemic 
heart failure  or resuscitated cardiac arrest or who have angina that is refractory to maximal medical 
therapy. In such participant s who require cath during follow -up, revascularization should  be 
performed using the principles of optimal revascularization therapy as outlined below.  
6.2 Invasive (INV) Strategy  
In participant s randomized to INV strategy, initial management with cath  will be performed, with 
subsequent revascularization , as appropria te, based upon coronary anatomy and other clinical 
considerations. The principles of optimal revascularization therapy will be followed (described 
below). In addition, all INV participant s will receive OMT as outlined below.  
6.3 Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT)  
OMT will consist of intensive, comprehensive secondary prevention with lifestyle and pharmacologic 
intervention applied equally to both treatment groups using individualized treatment regimens based 
on treat -to-target algorithms under supervision by [CONTACT_645513] [INVESTIGATOR_587852] ’s 
primary care physician and/or cardiologist. The research team in collaboration with the participant ’s 
treating physicians will implement changes in medical therapy in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_587853]. T he research team will obtain results of routine laboratory tests that reflect 
secondary prevention targets performed by [CONTACT_2299] ’s physician and provide the results of any 
tests obtained by [CONTACT_587876] ’s physician. Behavioral interv entions will focus on 
smoking cessation, nutrition, physical activity, weight control, and medication adherence. 
Pharmacologic interventions will include anti -atherothrombotic and anti -ischemic medications. The 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  24 minimum goals of OMT will be those recommende d for SIHD patient s by [CONTACT_30104]/international 
organizations (e.g., the National Cholesterol Education Program, American College of Cardiology, 
American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, and World Health Organization). 
Details of this strat egy are provided in the MOO and will be updated, as needed, over the course of 
the trial.  
6.3.1  Management of Angina in CON Participant s 
Medical management of angina in CON participant s will be intensified according to the ISCHEMIA -
CKD  angina treatment algorithm (see MOO). The goal for all CON participant s is to control angina 
such that participant s report a good angina -related quality of life. If the level of angina is 
unacceptable to the participant  despi[INVESTIGATOR_133349], th en cath and possible 
revascularization is recommended, consistent with good medical care.  
6.3.2  Management of Angina in INV Participant s 
Participant s randomized to the INV strategy who experience angina following revascularization may 
be treated medically, as pe r the ISCHEMIA -CKD  angina treatment algorithm (see MOO). The goal 
for all INV participant s is to control angina such that participant s report a good angina -related quality 
of life. Unlike the approach to CON participant s with angina, repeat cath and revasc ularization may 
be performed without first maximizing medical therapy in INV participant s. 
6.4 Optimal Revascularization Therapy (ORT)  
Optimal revascularization therapy will be performed based on findings from the diagnostic 
catheterization and relevant clinic al information. While the selection of PCI vs. CABG (or medical 
therapy only in cases of normal coronary arteries, diffuse small vessel disease, etc.) will be left to 
the discretion of the treating team per local standards and expertise, several general pr inciples 
should be followed:  
 The revascularization modality selected should have the highest likelihood to safely and 
effectively relieve significant ischemia in all viable myocardial territories of at least moderate 
size.  
 Decisions regarding viability te sting and revascularization decisions based on such testing 
should be based on routine clinical practice.  
 Revascularization should be performed with a goal of relieving all areas of significant 
ischemia, i.e., ischemia that would be detected by [CONTACT_105] -invasiv e imaging  or FFR . 
 Prior to selection of the revascularization modality, ischemic territories should be identified 
based on the results of noninvasive tests, angiography and, in selected cases, FFR (as 
outlined in the MOO).   
Details of ORT are provided in the MOO and will be updated, as needed, over the course of the trial.  
 
 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864184] PCI vs. CABG  
In general, the decision between PCI and CABG will be determined according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587854]. Guidelines from professional socie ties and appropriateness criteria should 
be incorporated into the decision process. It is desirable for the study Heart Team (interventional 
cardiologist and cardiac surgeon) to discuss each case after diagnostic angiogram to reach a 
consensus as to the be st revascularization technique.  
It is recognized, however, that in some cases of non -complex coronary artery disease the 
performance of “ad hoc” PCI after diagnostic angiography may be preferred by [CONTACT_3445] s and 
physicians. Whenever possible, the Heart  Team should record an opi[INVESTIGATOR_645507], reaching consensus where possible and recording 
disagreement if not possible.   
Details are provided in the MOO.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_864185] to the progressive nature of atherosclerotic heart disease. This goes well beyond the 
intraop erative technical aspects of surgical revascularization.  
 
The principles for optimal CABG include:  
 Accurate assessment and evaluation of potential CABG participant s 
 Complete revascularization (anatomic and physiologic criteria)  
 Optimize intraoperative man agement, including myocardial protection  
 Minimize associated organ and system injury  
 Maximize opportunity for long -term graft patency  
 Optimize secondary prevention of atherosclerot ic heart disease following CABG  
 
Details of this are provided in the MOO.  
 
6.5 Maximizing Adherence to CON Strategy  
Adherence to the CON strategy means that all CON participant s receive OMT and that none 
undergo cath or revascularization after randomization unless they 1) have an acute coronary 
syndrome, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or acute ischemic heart failure or 2) have unacceptable 
angina refractory to maximal medical therapy (see MOO for definition and recommended 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  26 management of refractory angina). Cath performed for any other reason, including changing 
physician or participant  preferences, is not adherent to the CON strategy and is considered a 
protocol violation. All protocol violations will be reported according to the guidelines provided in the 
MOO and may require notification of the local IRB as required by [CONTACT_427] . 
Investigators are discouraged from performing stress tests for the purpose of monitoring participant s 
who are clinically stable. Guidelines for avoidance of crossover in participant s with worsening 
symptoms in the absence of ACS may be found in the MOO. In brief, if angina worsens, medical 
therapy will be intensified. If symptoms are refractory to maximum medical therapy, or become 
unstable, participant s should undergo cath. Site investigators must provide documentation, including 
current intensity of med ical therapy, heart rate, blood pressure, and a repeat SAQ to document the 
appropriateness of cath. Sites are instructed to  call the [ADDRESS_864186].  
6.6 Cath in Participant s Randomized to CON Strategy  
Cath and/or revascularization for an acute coronary syndrome, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or acute 
ischemic heart failure is consistent with the CON strategy. Similarly, cath for refractory symptoms 
(according to the trial defin ition) is also consistent with CON strategy. Figure 2  describes cath in 
participant s randomized to CON and the definitions of protocol adherence and non -adherence as it 
relates to this. Once the decision has been made that the perform ance of cath in a CON participant  
is consistent with the CON strategy, the same principles described for optimal revascularization ( 6.4) 
apply.

Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864187] undergone testing at the site’s 
designated primary laboratory . Patient characteristics (age [recorded for patients <90 years of age, 
recorded as 90 if >90 years of age], sex, and, if excluded, reason(s) for exclusion will be recorded)  
and intended management strategy for patients who are eligible but not enrolled , if known . 
The screening log will be sent to the CCC on a regular basis, where it will help identify the major 
reasons why patients are not enrolled, thus allowing CCC staff to develop corrective action plans for 
sites that are not meeting target enrollment. Depending on the site’s enrollment rate over time, the 
CCC may decide that a given site no longer needs to submit its screening log, although the site 
should continue to maintain the log through the end of enrollment. In the event of poor enrollment, 
sites may be asked to provide comparable information about patients referred to cath without prior 
ischemia  testing . 
  
 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864188] practice  the following tests 
will typi[INVESTIGATOR_587857] ’s treating physician: complete blood count, electrolytes, 
creatinine, glucose, liver transaminases, lipid profile, and HbA1c. If HbA1c results are available for 
nondiabetics they will be re corded. If these test results are not available within specified time 
windows around the randomization visit (see MOO), then the following should  be obtained : complete 
blood count, lipid profile, and HbA1c  (for diabetics only ). Liver transaminases  should only be 
obtained if not available before starting statin therapy . An attempt will be made to coordinate 
participant  follow -up visits so that they occur close in time to routine follow -up visits with their 
physicians when routine blood tests are per formed. At 6 month follow -up visits, if lipid tests (and 
HbA1c at annual visits for diabetics ) are not available within specified time windows they will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_587877] s will be referred to their treating physicians for the 
tests.  Creatinine values obtained clinically for participants at the three month follow -up visit and 
annually will also be recorded.

study visit. See MOO for detailed instructions on collection of source documents.  
8.4 Blood Biomarkers and Genomics Biorepository  
Randomized participant s will b e invited to participate in the biorepository protocol, unless precluded 
by [CONTACT_427]. Participant s who give informed consent will be asked to allow storage of 
samples of their blood in two biorepository protocols, one for biomarkers and one for ge netic 
analysis . Participant s who decline participation in one or both of the biorepository protocols are still 
eligible to participate in the main trial. The biorepositories  will serve as resources for future analyses. 
Although no specific scientific proposals are put forth in the present protocol, we anticipate a wealth 
of opportunities for ancillary studies and sharing of resources with other investigators. Participant s 
will be asked to separately consent for use of their blood samples for the biomarker biorepository 
and the genetic  (DNA) biorepository . If a site is unable to process  blood samples they may still 
participate in the genetic biorepository; in this case saliva s amples may be collected from 
participants.  
Blood will be drawn for the biorepository at the time of randomization, and may be drawn after 
3 months of follow -up. At the time of randomization, up to a maximum of 49  mL of whole blood will 
be collected, which  will be processed and stored as serum, plasma, RNA and, where allowable, 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  30 DNA. At the 3  month follow -up visit, up to 49 mL of blood may be drawn. (If needed, specimen 
collection for genetic analysis  may be collected at any point during the trial .)  
Measure s will be taken to protect the identity of the blood sample donor by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -identifying the 
biospecimen samples at the enrollment site. The link between the participant's name [CONTACT_645532], or any 
investigative personnel requesting samples. Strict confidentiality and maintenance of the chain of 
custody will be observed in the collection and storage of biospecimens. Complete details of the 
biorepository protocol are provided in the MOO.  
8.5 Medication Adherence  
To assess medication adherence, a 4 -item modified Morisky adherence survey (Likert scale 
responses to 4 questions)28-31 will be completed at the randomization visit, 6 month visit, and all 
subsequent visits.  
8.6 Lifestyle Assessment  
To assess each participant ’s readiness to change health -related behaviors, study coordinators will 
use questionnaires developed by [CONTACT_33230] -centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise and 
nutrition (PACE) program. Responses to these brief surveys will be used to tailor counseling for 
lifestyle change. These assessments will occur at randomization, 3 months, 12 months, annually, 
and at the closeout visit.  
8.7 Quality of Life Assessment  
To quantify p atient -reported quality of life outcomes in ISCHEMIA -CKD , a battery of validated 
instruments will be used. Angina -related quality of life will be measured by [CONTACT_645514] (SAQ); dyspnea symptoms from the Rose Dyspnea scale; the EQ -5D as  a measure 
of overall, generic health status; and demographic items ( e.g., marital status, education, perceived 
income).  We will use these data to analyze the health status of participant s in both groups over time 
to quantify both the magnitude and trajec tory of health status recovery as a function of randomized 
management strategy.

Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864191] year and every 6  months thereafter, with clinic visits, phone follow -up, and other 
testing as described below (See Table 2 for complete assessment schedule). The schedule of 
assessments ( Table 2) specifies  the preferred method of contact [CONTACT_587880]. Six -month visits may 
be via telephone or email, depending on participant  stability, risk factor contr ol, and the participant ’s 
distance from the clinic (“geography”) ( see Table 2). In the event that a scheduled clinic visit is not 
possible, to ensure participant  follow -up other forms of contact [CONTACT_587881], such as telephone, 
email, communication from a personal physician, other allied health professional, or family member, 
or review of electronic health record or public records. After the first year, participant s will be 
followed every [ADDRESS_864192] been completed , unles s 
prohibited by [CONTACT_427] . At these long -term follow -up contacts, information on current health 
and medications, and interval hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60614].  
Withdrawal from the Study:  Complete and accurate follow -up is extremely important for  the 
duration of the study . The participant , however, may decline to continue with their assigned 
management strategy at any time. This does not constitute withdrawal from the study. Participant s 
will continue to be followed per the assessment schedule. If  at any time the subject refuses to 
continue with study visits, every attempt will be made to continue contact [CONTACT_107461], written 
communication, email, by [CONTACT_587882], friends, or allied health care providers, or record 
review to determine  if outcome events have occurred, unless the subject specifically refuses such 
follow -up. National data bases that record deaths  will be used to ascertain vital status , unless 
prohibited by [CONTACT_427] . The reason for (and the level of) withdrawal wil l be documented for 
all subjects withdrawn from the study or for those having limited follow -up. The subject must specify 
in writing what follow -up (s)he will allow, if any, at the time of withdrawal discussion.  
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  32 Quality of Life (QOL) and Economics Overview  
A brief set of items capturing selected interval angina and dyspnea symptoms QOL (Brief/Symptom/QOL) will be collected by [CONTACT_941] s ite 
coordinator and entered into the EDC study database at every study visit through 36  months and then each 6  months until the final 
closeout ISCHEMIA -CKD  visit .   A Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645508] -CKD  participant s at each follow -up study interval throughout the trial to provide a meas ure of resource utilization.

Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  40 10. ADJUDICATION OF CLINICAL EVENTS  
An independent clinical event adjudication committee (CEC) will review and adjudicate all 
primary endpoint events and selected se condary endpoints in a blinded fashion based on study 
definitions. Endpoints to be adjudicated include death (including cause), myocardial infarction, 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934], 
and stroke. Because the trial is not blinded, to mitigate bias in the ascertainment of events, 
several strategies will be used to identify (“trigger”) all suspected endpoints in all participant s 
including carefully constructed data collection tools that focus sites on key endpoint events, 
screening of ECG core lab data, site investigator and coordinator education about CEC 
procedures, and processing of events found by [CONTACT_645515]. Care will be taken to blind reviewers to any 
information that could identify the participant  or could reveal the randomized management 
strategy assignment. CEC members do not have access to management strategy assignment in 
order to avoid bias, which is an impo rtant process issue in this unblinded trial.

11.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  42 All major  treatment comparisons between the randomized groups will be performed according to 
the principle of "intent -to-treat;" that is, participant s will be analyzed (and endpoints attributed) 
according to the randomized strategy, regardless of subsequent invasiv e testing or treatment. 
Statistical comparisons will be performed using two -sided significance tests. A statistical 
analysis plan will be finalized before trial completion and data analysis.   
11.2.[ADDRESS_864204] to the primary composite 
endpoint will be a “time -to-event” analysis, and will therefore be based on the time from 
randomization to the first occurrence of any of the components of the pr imary composite 
endpoint (death or nonfatal MI). The Cox proportional hazards will be the primary analytic tool 
for assessing outcome differences between the two randomized groups. To preserve power in 
the face of participant  heterogeneity, the overall com parison may be adjusted for a selected set 
of prognostically important baseline covariates that will be carefully defined and pre -specified in 
the statistical analysis plan. The level of significance for the assessment of the primary endpoint 
will be α=0.0 5. In addition to Cox regression, event -free survival probabilities will be estimated 
as a function of follow -up time in each treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method and 
presented with point wise 95% confidence intervals. If the data provide evidence  of an overall 
difference in outcome between management strategy groups, we will further examine whether 
the therapeutic effect is similar for all participant s, or whether it varies according to specific 
participant  characteristics, which will be pre -speci fied in the statistical analysis plan.  
11.2.2  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints that will be evaluated include: (1) quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_587894]; (2) composite of cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke ; (3) composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587846]; ( 4) all-cause 
death; ( 5) CV death  ( 6) MI; ( 7) resuscitated cardiac arrest; ( 8) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34104]; ( 9) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934]; (10) stroke; (1 1) composite of cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal MI, stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587837]; and (1 2) health resource utilization, cost, and cost effectiveness. Plans for the analysis 
of the quality of life and economic endpoints are addressed below in Sections [ADDRESS_864205] occurrence of the specific secondary endpoint as the response 
variable.  
Unambiguous operational definitions of each study endpoint will be documented in t he Clinical 
Event Committee Charter and statistical analysis plan before performing unblinded analysis. For 
MI we will specify a primary definition (adapted from the universal definition of MI32; to be used 
in the primary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints). Other definitions (to be used in 
secondary analyses) will include the universal definition of MI and criteria to categorize large 
infarctions.  Data collection instruments and the adjudication process will allow construction of 
alternative endpoint MI definitions.  
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  43 11.2.3  Contingency Plan For Insufficient Primary En dpoint Events  
The projected event rate of 60% at [ADDRESS_864206] been 
accrued.  To ensure that the primary analysis is well -powered and useful, a prospective plan to 
allow extending follow -up and/or  changin g the primary endpoint based on aggregate event rate 
data will be established prior to the first review of unblinded trial data . At a designated time 
during the trial, an analysis will be conducted to estimate the overall aggregate  primary endpoint 
event r ate and project the final number of observed events. If the estimated unconditional  power 
(i.e. based on aggregate event rate data; not by [CONTACT_1570]) is less than the originally 
targeted 90% , then one or more of the following options  will be considered:  
1. Extend follow -up to allow more events to accrue.  
2. Change the primary endpoint to one that occurs more frequently.  
 The current primary endpoint would become a secondary endpoint  
 The proposed new primary endpoint would be the composite o f death, MI, 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_587846].  
3. Follow the recommendation of an independent advisory panel.  
An independent advisory panel , separate from the DSMB,  will be convened for the purpose of 
revie wing unconditional power estimates and making a recommendation to the NHLBI Director .  
Members of this panel will not have access to unblinded data by [CONTACT_645516] .33, [ADDRESS_864207] unblinde d interim 
analysis . 
11.2.4  Quality of Life (QOL) Analysis  
All QOL comparisons will adhere to the intention -to-treat principle. For each QOL measure 
examined in this study, data analysis will proceed in several stages. First, we will provide simple 
descriptive and  comparative analyses by [CONTACT_7586] -to-treat. Statistical power estimates for this 
part of our analysis, based on data collected in the COURAGE trial, show that we should have 
in excess of 99% power to detect ¼ SD differences in our [ADDRESS_864208] and assign all other comparisons to a secondary (descriptive) status. Second, 
we will employ a mixed model methodology that makes use of all available QOL data at each 
study assessment point to model the time profile (fixed effect). Using the fitted model, we can 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864209] the global hypothesis of no 
difference over time. We c an also estimate the difference in the areas under the two QOL 
treatment curves (and test the hypothesis of no difference, on average). In addition, we can 
estimate differences in QOL at the end of the study or at intermediate points.  Lastly, to address 
the possibility that international differences in QOL exist despi[INVESTIGATOR_645509], we will examine interactions between key QOL outcomes, treatment, and 
geographic region.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_864210] -effectiveness/cost -utility ratios, although these ratios are limited in their value due to 
their failure to account for long -term benefits and costs and the absence of comparative 
benchmarks. Cost will be adjusted for inflation, and both costs and life expectancy will be 
discounted to present value at a 3% annual discount rate. Plots of cost -effective ness 
acceptability curves indicating the probability that the intervention is cost -effective for a range of 
willingness -to-pay thresholds will be done. Extensive sensitivity analyses will be performed.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_864211] (DSMB) appointed by [CONTACT_645517] o f the trial ( see 13.1). The primary objective of these interim analyses is to ensure 
the safety of the participant s enrolled in the trial and evaluate the accumulating endpoint data by 
[CONTACT_645518] s favoring either of the two randomized 
management strategies. In addition, interim monitoring will involve a review of participant  
recruitment, compliance with the study protocol, status of data collection, an assessment of 
whether control group event rat es are consistent with the rates hypothesized in the sample size 
calculations, and other factors which reflect the overall progress and integrity of the study. 
Because interim analyses may occur when adjudication of an event is in progress, the interim 
analyses will be based primarily on adjudicated events and secondarily on all best available 
events, i.e., as adjudicated by [CONTACT_587898]/Investigator defined if the event has 
not yet been adjudicated by [CONTACT_142223]. The results of the interim analyses a nd status reports will be 
carefully and confidentially reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. Detailed plans for interim monitoring will be 
documented in a separate DSMB analysis plan.  
Interim comparisons by [CONTACT_587899] -cause mortality and the pr imary 
composite endpoint (death and MI). Cox-proportional hazard models with treatment as the 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864212] ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
comparing the INV and CON strategies will be reported. To account  for repeated significance 
testing of the accumulating data, the group sequential method of Lan and DeMets35 will be used 
as a guide for interpreting these interim analyses. Monitoring boundaries for each endpoint will 
be based on a two -sided symmetric O’Brien -Fleming type spending function with an overall two -
sided significance level of α = 0.05. The O’Brien -Fleming approach requires large critical values 
early in the study but relaxes (i.e., decreases) the critical value as the trial progresses.36 These 
proposed monitoring boundaries are intended as a guide for interpreting the interim analyses 
and not as a rule for early termination.  
An additional key parameter for interim monitor ing will be the frequency of early catheterization 
among participant s randomized to the CON strategy. Such catheterizations will be classified 
according to (1) whether the catheterization was allowed by [CONTACT_760] (e.g. for documented 
refractory symptoms ) and (2) whether the catheterization was preceded by a nonfatal primary 
endpoint event (i.e., MI). A pattern of frequent early catheterization in CON participant s without 
prior endpoint events would suggest that the study may have difficulty achieving hig h statistical 
power. Moreover, if this was due to frequent protocol violations, then a finding of no treatment 
effect may be challenging to interpret. To address these concerns, rates of early catheterization 
in the CON group will be analyzed and reported,  with a focus on estimating the probability that a 
CON participant  will undergo catheterization within a specified time interval and before an 
endpoint event. To obtain this probability, the distribution of “time from randomization to 
catheterization” for CON participant s will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function 
method for competing risks.[ADDRESS_864213] date or terminated after the participant ’s first primary endpoint event, whichever 
occurs fir st. 
Judgment concerning the continuation of the study will involve not only the magnitude of 
observed differences between randomized strategies and degree of statistical significance, but 
also careful consideration of many other important factors including  the need for precise 
parameter estimation, the overall progress and integrity of the trial (including the frequency of 
catheterization in the CON group, as discussed above), and information available from other 
studies at the time of DSMB deliberations. I f a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587861], 
this result should be tempered by [CONTACT_587900], but long -term benefit. Although we hypothesize that outcomes will be improved by [CONTACT_645519] , it sh ould be emphasized that a small treatment effect for the primary endpoint is 
not necessarily a negative result for the study. Indeed, evidence suggesting absence of a large 
benefit from the invasive strategy would be highly important to future guidelines a nd clinical 
practice. However, a large sample size is required in order to derive such evidence. If the study 
were to be stopped early with less than the full sample size, the lack of statistically significant 
difference may be accompanied by [CONTACT_645520]. The DSMB will incorporate this perspective along with other considerations when 
making recommendations about continuation.  
 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864214] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
12.1 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System  
The full study dataset will be collected for participant s who enter the randomized phase of the 
study. The primary data collection system for ISCHEMIA -CKD  will use a web -based electronic 
data capture (EDC) system, a validated Electronic Record, Electronic Signatures (ERES) 
compliant platform (21 CFR Part 11). All these data collected at any point in the trial except the 
economic and quality of life informat ion, are entered into this EDC system.  
12.2 Data Management and Quality  
Any out -of-range values and missing or inconsistent key variables will be flagged and 
addressed at the site in real time during the data entry process. When a query is generated on a 
partic ular variable, a flag will be set in a field in the database enabling the system to track the 
queries and produce reports of outstanding queries.  Queries can also be generated from 
manual review of the data forms.  These queries will be entered into the d atabase and tracked 
in the same manner as the computer -generated queries.  At regular intervals, all data will be 
transferred from the EDC database to SAS for statistical summarization, data description, and 
data analysis.  Further cross -checking of the da ta will be performed in SAS, and discrepant 
observations flagged and appropriately resolved through a data query system. The Statistical 
and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) will perform internal database quality -control checks, and 
data audits throughout t he course of the trial.

Electroni c CRFs (eCRFs) will be identified by [CONTACT_34161], to ensure participant  
anonymity. No participant  identifiers will be used in the presentation of data. Study records that 
might identify participant s will be kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Excep t when required by 
[CONTACT_2371], participant s will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], personal identification number (e.g. social 
security number, social insurance number), address, telephone number, or any other direct 
personal identifier in study records. This informatio n will be retained by [CONTACT_587903], 
quality of life and economic follow -up of the participant s. Participant s will be informed that the 
study physician and his/her study team will report the results of study -related tests to the 
Coordinating Center and to the NIH. Participant s will be informed that their records may be 
reviewed in order to meet federal, state or regional/local regulations. Reviewers may i nclude the 
CCC/SDCC monitors, IRBs/ECs, the NIH, other government regulators as dictated by [CONTACT_1769], 
or their delegates.  
Ischemia tests will be stripped of identifiers during the upload process, with the exception of 
date of study  in DICOM headers , by a vendor which will be responsible for ischemia test 
transfer  and storage for this trial.   
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  47 12.4 Training  
All investigational site and core lab staff authorized to enter ISCHEMIA -CKD  study data will 
receive training on the EDC system. Training records will be retained by [CONTACT_645521].  
12.5 Records Retention  
Study records will be maintained by [CONTACT_408111] a period of three (3) years following 
the expi[INVESTIGATOR_408099], whichever is l onger.  
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864216] (DSMB) will be appointed by [CONTACT_587907]. The DSMB will include on its roster a 
nephrologist .  A DSMB charter that outlines the operating guidelines for the committee and the 
procedures for the interim evaluations of study data will be developed by [CONTACT_645522]. Reports will be prepared regularly by [CONTACT_645523], and will include interim analyses of 
primary and secondary endpoints; additional safety events; and other information as requested 
by [CONTACT_942]. After each meeting, the DSMB wil l make recommendations to the NHLBI and 
the trial leadership about the continuation of the study. After approval by [CONTACT_587910], a 
summary of the DSMB report and recommendations will be forwarded by [CONTACT_645524] l ocal, regional and national IRB/Ethics Committees, as 
applicable. DSMB reports will be the primary mechanism for reporting safety concerns to NIH 
and IRBs.  
13.[ADDRESS_864217] moderate ischemia. The risk of  cath and revascularization will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_645525]. These 
risks are justified by [CONTACT_227239] (long -term reduction in events resulting from 
revascularization, as discussed in the background section).  
Risks:  
Cath/PCI/CABG Risks: Each of these procedures is performed in clinical practice for patients 
who meet eligibility criteria for the CKD trial . The major risks of these procedures include death, 
myocardial infarction and stroke. Other risks of catheterization and PCI include severe contrast 
reaction such as anaphylaxis, emergency CABG, bleeding, need for blood transfusion, contrast -
induced AKI, AKI requiring dialysis  and vascular access site complications including 
pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, retroperitoneal bleed or infection. Other risks of CABG include 
return to operating room for bleeding, need for blood transfusion, infection, prolonged intu bation, 
mediastinitis , AKI, AKI requiring dialysis  and atrial fibrillation. Risks of these procedures vary in 
likelihood based on the patient’s risk profile  and are generally higher in the CKD cohort than in 
participants without CKD . 
 
Risk Lowering Measure s: 
The risk of cath  and revascularization will be minimized by [CONTACT_645526]. Strategies to minimize the volume of contrast 
used and reduce the risk of contrast -induced AKI are outlined in the MOO. These risks ar e 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  49 justified by [CONTACT_227239] (long -term reduction in events resulting from revascularization, 
as discussed in the background section). Study procedures are designed to manage and 
minimize risks through careful selection of the patients who particip ate in the trial. Participants 
will be monitored closely through the trial at many time points to check on their health. In 
addition, an independent DSMB will monitor safety of the participants throughout the study (see 
section 13.1 ) 
Benefits:  
The ISCHEMIA -CKD  trial results should provide evidence based data to support management 
of participants with CKD and SIHD. It is hoped the knowledge gained will be of benefit to others 
with a similar medical condition in the future.  
There may be benefit from participation in this study by [CONTACT_645527] s’ health status. Participant s may receive some 
medications and stents free of cost, as available.  
13.3 Safety Monitoring Objectives and Rationale  
The main safety objectives in ISCHEMIA -CKD  are to characterize the risk profiles of the two 
randomized management strategies and to monitor fo r unanticipated risks to study participants. 
All medications and procedures to be used/performed in this study are commonly 
used/performed for clinical indications as part of standard of care and have well -defined safety 
profiles. Because no investigationa l device, drug, diagnostic test or therapeutic intervention is 
being tested in this comparative effectiveness trial, reporting is primarily governed by [CONTACT_587915] (45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A), as well as ICH Guidelines, IRBs and local 
regulations.  
13.4 Adverse Events Reporting by [CONTACT_645528]’ safety will be captured within the EDC database as part of the 
required study data. There are no additional study -specific reporting requirements. Site 
investigators should follow usu al clinical practices at their institutions for reporting serious, 
unexpected events related to standard of care medications and devices to regulatory agencies.  
13.5 Events to be Monitored  
Safety monitoring in ISCHEMIA -CKD  will be concerned with estimating eve nt rates for the 
following types of clinical events:  
1. Complications of cardiovascular tests (e.g. cardiac catheterization) and therapeutic 
procedures (e.g. PCI, CABG)  
2. Events occurring in the time period between consenting to participate in the trial and 
being randomized.  
3. Study endpoints.  
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.[ADDRESS_864218] established safety profile s with known risks and benefits 
and are routinely used in clinical practice.  Events listed below occurring within 72 hours of the 
procedure will be considered as a complication of the procedure.  Some safety events related to 
specific tests and procedures  captured within EDC , in addition to death and MI , include : 
Cardiac catheterization and PCI:  
1. Severe contrast reaction such as anaphylaxis  
2. Periprocedural stroke  
3. Emergency CABG  
4. AKI 
5. AKI requiring dialysis  
6. Vascular access site complications including pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, 
retroperitoneal bleed  
CABG:  
1. Return to operating room for bleeding  
2. Prolonged intubation  
3. Mediastinitis  
4. Atrial fibrillation  
5. AKI requiring dialysis  
 
In addition the incidence of finding significant LM stenosis ( >50%) on cardiac cat heterization will 
be monitored and reported to the DSMB.  
 
2. Events occurring in the time period between consent and randomization  
In general, eligibility for randomization  will not be known at the time  of enrollment but will need 
to be confirmed after pe rforming additional screening procedures (e .g. pregnancy test ). As a 
result, several days may elapse  before the participant  is randomized. Frequency of clinical 
events  (e.g. death, MI) occurring during this time period, prior to randomization , will be 
monitored and reported to the DSMB.  
3. Events that are trial endpoints  
Selected trial endpoints (e.g. all -cause mortality) will be monitored at regular intervals during the 
course of the trial for the purpose of protecting participants’ safety. Event rates  in each 
treatment group will be confidentially reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. These analyses will inform the 
DSMB’s recommendation to stop or continue the study or modify the protocol (see section 
11.2.6).

14.1 Regulatory  and Ethical Compliance  
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the

and society. Women of child bearing potential will be informed that there may be unknown risks 
to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and they were exposed to radiation (e.g. 
cardiac cathet erization and revascularization if randomized to the INV strategy group) and agree 
that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement during 
this period of the study. If there is any question that the prospective participant  will not reliably 
comply with study procedures and/or follow -up, they should not be entered in the study.  
14.3 Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB/IEC/REB  
The protocol and the proposed informed consent forms (main consent form and genetics testing 
consent form) will be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB) a t each site. A 
signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC/REB is required before site initiation. Prior to study start, the site principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_587863] a protocol signature [CONTACT_3264] c onfirming his/her agreement to conduct the study 
in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this 
protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to monitors, auditors, Clinical 
Quality Assurance repr esentatives, designated agents of CCC, IRBs/IECs/REBs, and regulatory 
authorities as required. Investigators must agree to apply due diligence to avoid protocol 
deviations.  
14.[ADDRESS_864220] be approved by [CONTACT_323238], Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC/REB. Only 
amendments that are required for participant  safety may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC/REB 
approval. As soon as possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and, if 
appropriate, the proposed protocol amendment(s) will be submitted: (a) to the IRB/IEC/REB for 
 
Protocol Date:  Dec.18.2014           Version 1.0  52 review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]; (b) to the sponsor, NIH/NHLBI for agreement; and, if 
required, (c) to the r egulatory authority(ies). Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal 
protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the 
safety of any participant  included in this study, even if this action represents a dev iation from the 
protocol. In such cases, CCC should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC/REB at the study 
site should be informed.  
14.5 Early Termination of the Study  
The CCC and NHLBI retain the right to terminate the study, a study site or an investigat or at any 
time. The CCC will monitor the progress of the study. If warranted, the study may be suspended 
or discontinued early if there is an observation of safety concerns posing an unreasonable risk 
to the study population. If the study is terminated ear ly, the CCC will provide a written statement 
to the site Principal Investigators to enable notification to site IRBs/IECs/REBs and study 
participants . The CCC will also inform the appropriate Competent Authorities. The CCC may 
terminate enrollment activity  at a site, or participation in the study by [CONTACT_587917]’s failure to maintain adequate clinical standards or failure to 
comply with the protocol. Notification of enrollment suspension or termination of  the study or 
study site/investigator will be sent to the investigator and the IRBs/IECs/REBs.

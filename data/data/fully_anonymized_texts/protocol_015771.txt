STUDY PROTOCOL  
Purpose    
The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of intravenous  (IV) acetaminophen vs 
placebo, combined with IV propofol vs dexmedetomidine, for postoperative sedation and analgesia 
respectively, in adult patients 60 years or older undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) or 
combined CABG/valve surgeries to as sess the incidence of postoperative delirium wi th the Confusion 
Assessment Method (CAM or CAM -ICU). It is possible  that there may be a  benefit to those enrolled in the 
dexmedet omidine and acetaminophen group, as their incidence of delirium could  possibly be reduced , 
however we  cannot guarantee this.

 Significance and Background    
Approximately 50% of patients have postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery1.  The growing body 
of evidence suggests that in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321815], including a tenfold 
increased risk of death, and a fivefold increased risk of nosocomial related complications2.   Delirium has 
also been associated with serious longer term outcomes such as poor functional recovery, and most 
recently, impaired cognitive function for up to one year after cardiac surgery3. Importantly, intervenable 
factors, such as perioperative se dation and analgesia with opi[INVESTIGATOR_321816].  
In the setting of cardiac surgery done increasingly in older patients, there is an urgent need to test 
alternative sedation and complementary analgesic techniques.  
Dexmedetomid ine, a selective alpha -[ADDRESS_397152] that makes it a unique 
sedative drug.  Currently used sedation drugs (midazolam) release  deliriogenic mediators through binding 
of Gamma -aminobutyric Acid (GABA ) receptors.  Dexmedetomidine has no effect on the GABA receptors. 
Although these characteristics suggest dexmedetomidine to be a unique and promising drug for sedation 
following cardi ac surgery, its efficacy on reducing the incidence, duration and long term effects of delirium 
has not been studied thoroughly.  
Studies involving use of dexmedetomidine in an attempt to reduce the incidence of delirium in cardiac 
surgical patients provide conflicting results . One  meta -analysis concluded that dexmedetomidine in cardiac 
surgery shortened the ventilator time (but not the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]), 
reduced the incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmias and delirium in cardiac surgical patients4. 
However, there are several issues with this meta -analysis, particularly for the systematic assessment of 
postoperative delirium. The problems with the four studies that f ormed the basis of this meta -analysis are 
explained in the next few paragraphs.  
In a retrospective study5 of administrative database from [ADDRESS_397153] savi ngs in the 
dexmedetomidine group.  This study compared two regimens (dexmedetomidine, propofol plus narcotics 
vs. propofol vs. narcotics). Propofol was used in the dexmedetomidine group as well.  This trial specifically 
does not mention how delirium was as sessed in individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].   
A randomized controlled trial6 comparing dexmedetomidine/propofol to morphine/propofol in cardiac 
surgery patients showed a decreased duration of delirium (5 days to 2 days) in the dexmedetomidine group.  
This study found a simila r incidence of delirium in both the groups.  Propofol was used as a sedative in both 
the groups and this could have attributed to similar incidences of delirium in both the groups.  There is a 
possibility the study was not powered adequately as the baselin e incidence of delirium in the control group 
was a surprisingly low 15%, much lower than other cardiac surgery studies that have employed state -of-
the art delirium measures. This study used CAM -ICU for assessing delirium both in intubated and extubated 
patients.  While the CAM -ICU, a delirium assessment that does not require any verbal responses by [CONTACT_4677], is state -of-the-art for intubated patients, it has reduced sensitivity for delirium in verbal patients.  
This design could have underestimated the i ncidence of delirium.   
The third study7 included in the meta -analysis was a prospective, randomized, open labeled trial comparing 
three groups (dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and propofol). This study reported a dramatically decreased 
incidence of delirium in the dexmedetomidine group, 3%, compare d to 50% in propofol and midazolam 
groups. This was a small study, with only [ADDRESS_397154] of Postoperative Intravenous Acetaminophen versus Placebo, Combined with Propofol or 
Dexmedetomidine, on Postoperative In -Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321812]: The DEXACET Randomized Clinical Trial  
5 
 
 
 with 28 patients randomized patients excluded for protocol violations.  This introduces a significant selection 
bias.  Furthermore, a 94% reduction in the incidence of delirium was seen in this study.  This effect size is 
almost implausibly large and has not been seen in other studies.  Nevertheless, this study can provide a 
framework for sample size for future stud ies assuming the best case scenario.   
The final study8 included in the meta -analysis was a prospective randomized c ontrol trial of [ADDRESS_397155] tube sites and leg 
incisions.  Current pain relief strategy includes postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499] ( IV morphine or 
hydromorphone).  While, inadequate pain relief increases the risk of postoperative delirium, opi[INVESTIGATOR_321817], especially in elderly patients.  
A multimodal balanced postoperative pain management is advantageous and provides several beneficial 
effects.  The options in cardiac surgery would include nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and 
acetaminophen.  Their postoperative use decreases the exposure of older patients to opi[INVESTIGATOR_321818].  N onsteroidal Ant i-Inflammatory Drugs (N SAIDs ) have 
contraindications after many kinds of surgery, including cardiac surgery, which include their deleterious 
effects on the gastrointestinal  tract and renal function.   
Acetaminophen has no psychoactive properties and is an attractive option as it lacks bleeding risks 
associated with nonsteroidal agents.  Acetaminophen is for the most part safe but could cause liver 
dysfunction in rare instances.  Oral administration of acetaminophen achieves limited blood levels in 
criticall y ill patients and therefore has limited efficacy. IV acetaminophen addresses this by [CONTACT_321831]9. This 
approach has been shown to reduce pain intensity and also decrease the rescue intravenous morphine 
used during the postoperative period.   
IV acetaminophen has never b een studied in the context of cardiac surgery and delirium prevention.  
Additionally, comparing IV acetaminophen as an adjuvant analgesic in combination with IV propofol or IV 
dexmedetomidine may ascertain additive or synergistic effects on delirium preven tion. Our randomized, 
single -blind, pre -pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 12 patients showed that in patients who received IV acetaminophen as 
adjuvant analgesic (N=6), the incidence of delirium was 17% (1/6) compared to 67% (4/6) in those who did 
not.  The total incidence  was 42% (5/12).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_243379], this provocative finding suggests 
that IV acetaminophen with propofol or dexmedetomidine may offer a significant benefit in reducing the 
incidence of delirium following cardiac surgery.  If this benefit is p roved in a larger study as proposed, this 
will have a significant impact in patient care and satisfaction.

Randomization and Blinding   
After obtaining written informed consent, participants will be randomized to one of four groups by [CONTACT_321833] a sequence of computer –generated random numbers. Blocked randomization 
will be used to assign recruited participants to one of  four combinations of analgesics and sedatives in a 
1:1:1:1 allocation: (1) acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine, (2) acetaminophen and propofol, (3) placebo 
and dexmedetomidine, or (4) placebo and propofol. In order to blind the patient, the care team, and t he 
research staff assessing outcomes to the analgesia group, 1 gram of IV acetaminophen and placebo (0.9% 
saline) were distributed in equal volume IV bags. Due to the distinct appearance of propofol, there was no 
blinding to the sedation group.  
Study Proce dures  
Overview  
The proposed study is a randomized, placebo controlled, factorial design, triple blind, clinical trial designed 
to evaluate the effect of postoperative IV acetaminophen versus placebo, combined with IV propofol versus 
dexmedetomidine, on p ostoperative delirium among older patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  Patients 
will be r andomized to one of four groups  (1) acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine, (2) acetaminophen and 
propofol, (3) placebo and dexmedetomidine, or (4) placebo and propofol . It is possible that the participants 
who receive acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine may benefit from the study as their  incidence of delirium 
could  possibly be reduced , however we  cannot guarantee this.

 Study Groups  
The four treatment arms will be:  
1. Acetaminophen and dexmedetomidine  
2. Acetaminophen and propofol  
3. Placebo and dexmedetomidine  
4. Placebo and propofol  
 
All study medications will be administered intravenously and doses will be weight -based. 
Acetaminophen/placebo will be  administered on ICU transfer and thereafter every six hours for a total of 
eight doses. Volume of the placebo (saline) will match that of IV acetaminophen at 100ml 0.9% sodium 
chloride.  Acetaminophen administration in any form other than the blinded stud y medication during this 
time was not allowed. Propofol or dexmedetomidine was started during chest closure and continued for up 
to six hours postoperatively or until extubation, whichever occurred first. Participants in the 
dexmedetomidine groups will get  a bolus dose of 0.5  - 1mcg/kg IV during chest closure, followed by a  
maintenance infusion of 0.1 -1.4 mcg/kg/hour. Propofol infusions will be avoided in these participants. 
Patients in the propofol groups will receive propofol at a dose of 20 – 100 mcg/kg /min and dexmedetomidine 
infusions will be avoided in these patients.  
Pharmacy  
Once a participant is enrolled, the study team will contact [CONTACT_321834]. 
The research pharmacy at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will b e responsible for preparation and 
distribution of study medications. Study team members will physically deliver the first dose of the 
acetaminophen/placebo (saline) medication. Subsequently the research pharmacy will be responsible for 
delivering the study  medication to the ICU. Any unused drug will be returned to the research pharmacy for 
disposal.   
Study Assessments  
The assessments will be completed at specific time points.  Once consent is obtained, a trained study team 
member blinded to treatment allo cation will proceed with a baseline cognitive and delirium assessment. 
This will include the assessment of cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 
supplemented with days of the week backwards (DOWB) and months of the year backwar ds (MOYB) for 
additional attention testing, the Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI) to capture symptoms of delirium and the 
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to assess for baseline depression.  Using data from the cognitive testing 
and DSI, a study team member  will complete the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), which includes a 
diagnosis of delirium using the CAM diagnostic algorithm.  This detailed assessment will take no more than 
20-[ADDRESS_397157] cogn itive assessment and the 
CAM. These daily assessments will take approximately 10 -15 minutes.  On the day of discharge, the MoCA 
with DOW and MOY, the DSI, and CAM will be completed.  (If the discharge assessment was performed in 
anticipation of discharge o n a specific day but the discharge was delayed (i.e. logistical reasons, clinical 
reasons), this will not be considered a protocol deviation.)  A follow -up assessment will be administered at 
[ADDRESS_397158] -discharge over the telephone and will inc lude a telephone version of the MoCA 
known as the T -MoCA, DSI, GDS, and CAM.  Assessments will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_321835].  
If daily assessments are negative for three  consecutive days (i.e. days 5, 6 & 7), they will then be c ompleted 
every other day until date of discharge. In addition, these assessments will be done at the patient’s convenience 
to ensure ability to finish the evaluations.  The table below outlines the assessments at various time points.

The delirium research assessments will not be provided to the treating clinicians.  Treating clinicians will assess 
and treat delirium as usual, including assessment and correction of reversible causes, behavioral management 
and use of IV haloperidol for agitation, if needed.  Rescue doses of haloperidol will be recorded in the study.  
Blood A cquisition  
Blood will be collect ed at four times points 1) Baseline: at the time of the pre -operative study assessments 
or on day of surgery; 2) on POD 1 while in the intensive care unit; 3) on POD 2 while in the intensive care 
unit; and 4) within [ADDRESS_397159] information, rationale for studying data 
and intended use of data may need to be approved by [INVESTIGATOR_70379]/IRB prior to sharing data.  All such studies will 
be carried out under controlled access and un der the close supervision of the study team.  In these cases, 
the study investigators will maintain confidentiality of the specimens by [CONTACT_321836] -identification of

 patient information to the other scientists.  We plan to store these specimens inde finitely.  None of the 
results from these studies will be shared with participants or their family members and none of the genetic 
information obtained will be included in the patient’s medical records.  All patients approached for 
participation in study w ill also need to agree to participation in blood collection/storage as noted in informed 
consent.  
Follow Up  
A follow -up assessment will be administered at [ADDRESS_397160] -discharge over the telephone and 
will include a telephone version of the MoCA  known as the T -MoCA, DSI, GDS, and CAM.    
Study Outcomes  
Primary Outcome  
The primary objective of this study was the incidence of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321820] a patients’ 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].    
Secondary Outcomes  
The secondary outcomes included duration of delirium, postoperative neurocognition at discharge, 48 -
hour breakthrough analgesic requirements, and ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110011].  
Data Collection  
The participant’s demographic data such as age, sex, ethnicity, race and body mass index wil l be recorded. 
Patient comorbid conditions, surgery and anesthetic drugs used will be obtained from Society of Thoracic 
Surgery database and Anesthesia Information Management System, which is a clinical outcomes registry that 
records and assesses the care of adult patients undergoing cardiac procedures at participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
Pertinent characteristics include: preoperative medications, comorbidities, surgical characteristics, and 
postoperative outcomes, including [ADDRESS_397161] a number of unrelated adverse health events dur ing the course of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  The 
potential adverse effects such as the number  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_12981] (predefined as < 90mm systolic 
for 5 minutes or more), and bradycardia (predefined as <40 beats per minute), will be collected from the 
ICU charts.

 Therefore, we will limit the scope of our AE monitoring and reporting to the following:  
o All Serious Adverse Events, including an unexpected death, believed to be related to the study   
o Unexpected, non -serious Adverse Events believed to be possibly or probably related to the 
intervention  
Evidence for adverse events will be assessed daily during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], for a maximum of 10 days.  
Statistical Analysis  
Please refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for details  of the power calcu lation and analyses .   
Benefits to the Subject  
There is a possible benefit to those enrolled in the dexmedet omidine and acetaminophen group, as their 
incidence of delirium can possibly be reduced , however we  cannot guarantee this. Society as a whole will 
benefit in the future as a result of knowledge gained from the research.    
Risks to the Subject  
Risk of the Drugs Used  
The drugs dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen are FDA approved for sedation and analgesic purposes.   
Bradycardia and hypotension are less common side effects with dexmedetomidine and in an intensively 
monitored setting of cardiac surgical ICU, the risks of bradycardia and hypotension can be managed 
effectively.  Liver dysfunction is a rare side effect a ssociated with IV acetaminophen.  However, the drug is 
commonly used already in the perioperative setting routinely as the benefits seem to outweigh the risks.  
No routine monitoring is done for liver dysfunction in the current standard of care.  
Risk Assoc iated with Blood Draw  
There is a small risk of phlebotomy to obtain serum for the serum biomarker assays at four time points 
during the study.  Wherever possible, the serum collection will be obtained at the same time as phlebotomy 
and other labs for routi ne clinical laboratory work, thereby [CONTACT_321837] a 
separate phlebotomy for study purposes.  However, in rare cases such as at the time of discharge, patients 
may require a separate lab draw. The risks of the phlebotomy procedu re itself are minimal and are primarily 
related to pain or bruising at the needle puncture site.  Since the amount of blood required at each time 
point is small the risks from anemia or blood loss are negligible.  The blood draws will total only 80 cc’s 
over a maximum of four weeks, which is considered minimal risk.   
Risk of Breach of C onfidentiality  
Patients will be referred to by a study number, and records will be password protected on BIDMC network 
servers. No identifiable data will be shared with the  funding agency, or across institutions.  The information 
that we collect from this research project will be kept confidential.  All information will be stored in a HIPAA 
compliant database.   
Risk/Benefit Ratio  
The drugs used for this study are approved b y the FDA for sedation and analgesic purposes.  When 
monitored in the intensive care setting, the risks of lower blood pressures or heart rates are far too small 
compared to the benefits of decreased delirium following cardiac surgery.

[ADDRESS_397162] Protection  
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_321838] . The informed consent will be explained and obtained in a 
secure and private location such as the preadmission testin g clinic, cardiac catheterization holding areas, 
cardiac surgery clinic, and/or in the pre -operative holding area.  Patients will be informed that their decision 
to participate or not to participate will in no way affect their relationship with their health  care provider. 
Furthermore they will still receive all information about their analgesic management, as is the standard of 
care.  Patients will also have the ability to discontinue their participation at any time.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
Introduction  
This Statistical Analysis Plan describes the analysis of the prospective randomized controlled trial that 
has been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_321839] (2014P000413) and will be conducted  in accordance with all applicable human subjects’ 
research requirements and applicable federal regulations.    
Study Aims  
Briefly, this randomized, factorial clinical trial evaluates  the effect of intravenous acetaminophen versus  
placebo, combined with in travenous propofol versus  dexmedetomidine, for postoperative sedation and 
analgesia respectively, in adult patients 60 years or older undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] 
(CABG) or combined CABG/valve surgeries to assess the incidence and duration of  postoperative delirium .  
Study Design  
This is a single -center randomized controlled factorial trial of two sedative and two analgesic regimens.  
Study Population and Sites  
The study will prospectively enroll patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Beth Isra el Deaconess Medical 
Center in [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_005].  This includes patients enrolled between September 2015 and April 2018.   
Randomization  
Randomization will be by [CONTACT_094] -prepared using a computer generated block randomization in SAS 9.3. Details 
of the bl ock size are kept confidential until the completion of study enrollment.  This schema will be created 
by [CONTACT_63539] (Ariel Mueller, MA) and sent to the research pharmacy.  Members of the 
research pharmacy will be responsible for preparing a nd dispensing the study medications following an 
active order for study medications.  Specifically this includes preparation and blinding of the placebo in 
accordance with the study randomization schema.   
Patients will be randomized to one of four groups in a 1:1:1:1 fashion. This includes:  
• Acetaminophen and Dexmedetomidine  
• Acetaminophen and Propofol  
• Placebo and Dexmedetomidine  
• Placebo and Propofol  
Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint will be the incidence of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321821].  This is assessed via the Confusion 
Assessment Method (or CAM -ICU for intubated patients) daily postoperatively, as specified in the study 
protocol.  If a patient is noted to be positive f or delirium on any postoperative day, they will have been 
documented as achieving the primary study endpoint.  
Our pre -specified primary analysis will assess the incidence of delirium between patients receiving IV 
acetaminophen versus placebo.  
Secondary En dpoints  
Secondary outcomes for this study include:  
• Duration of delirium

▪ Definition: This is predefined as less than 90 mm Hg systolic blood pressure for 
five minutes or more  
o Number and duration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1418]  
▪ Definition: This is predefined as less than 40 beats per minute.  
• The proportion of patients who complete the protocol successfully will be measured.  
• If this sedation and analgesic regimen is abandoned by [CONTACT_321842], the reason will be 
qualitatively described at the end of the study.  
• Levels of inflammatory biomarkers

 Sample Size Estimation  
This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double -blinded, factorial design study consisting of 120 
patients to assess the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery.  From the 
previous delirium studies conducted  at our institution, the baseline delirium incidence was 50%.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_321823] a 66% reduction in the incidence of delirium.  For the power calculation, a 50% reduction in the 
delirium incidence was used.  Each group needed 56 patients (alpha=0.05 a nd 1-Beta=0.80). This study will 
not be powered for secondary outcomes.   
Because complete data from 112 patients is required in order for analysis, we plan to enroll enough patients 
to obtain data from 120 patients who received the study intervention ( 60 patients per group - acetaminophen 
vs. no acetaminophen) .  We estimate that approximately 150 patients will be enrolled (consented) in order 
to achieve this sample size.   This increase is required because it is possible that patients can be withdrawn 
both before randomization (i.e. cancelled surgery) as well as after randomization but before receiving the 
study intervention (i.e. change in surgery type intraoperatively).   Enrollment will be stopped once a total of 
[ADDRESS_397164] undergone surg ery and received the study medications.  
General Approach to Statistical Analys es 
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized and presented using descriptive statistics.  
Continuous data will be presented as means ± standard deviations or me dians (interquartile range) 
depending on the distribution of the data.  The Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test will be utilized in order to determine whether 
or not the data follows a Gaussian distribution.  Differences in continuous data between study groups will 
be asses sed using a parametric t -tests or Wilcoxon Rank -Sum tests as appropriate.  Categorical data will 
be presented as frequencies and proportions and assessed with a chi -square test.  In the event that cell 
counts are small (less than 5), we will employ the use  of a Fisher’s Exact test.  For all analyses two -sided 
p-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) 
or later will be utilized for all analyses.   
Analyses will be performed on a modified intention to treat basis, in which all patient who receive at least 
one dose of any of the four study medications will be included.  
 
Analysis of the Primary and Secondary Outcomes  
The DEXACET trial has been designed as a factorial, randomized controlled tr ial with four treatment groups.  
We will therefore aim to test 1) the effect of acetaminophen versus placebo and 2) the effect of 
dexmedetomidine in comparison to propofol in the event that there is no interaction between treatment 
effects.  However, the f irst of these (the effect of acetaminophen) is considered the most interesting and 
the study has been powered to answer this question using an unadjusted chi -squared test.    
To test whether or not there is an interaction we will compose a logistic regression model include indicator 
variables for the acetaminophen group as well as the dexmedetomidine group.  We will further include an 
interaction term in this model composed of the indicator variables multiplied together.  If there is a significant 
interaction between groups when assessing the incidence of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321821], we will interpret the results 
stratified by [CONTACT_321843], presenting the main effects only after tak ing into account the other factor, in a 
‘inside the table analysis’.  If the interaction term is not significant we will present the main effects by [CONTACT_321844].   
Kaplan Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards model was used t o compare time to experiencing 
delirium, after confirming the proportional hazards assumption is met.  To test whether the Proportional

Dexmedetomidine, on Postoperative In -Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321812]: The DEXACET Randomized Clinical Trial

 Hazards (PH) assumption holds, we will include a time varying covariate with group in the model.  Given 
the factorial de sign this approach will be replicated in models for all four factorial groups, as well as the 
pairwise comparisons (dexmedetomidine vs propofol; acetaminophen vs placebo) to ensure this 
assumption remains valid.  In the event that this assumption is not va lid, we will include a time -varying 
covariate in the model.  Hazards ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be reported.   
Repeated measures analyses including generalized estimating equations with robust variance will be 
employed to ass ess for differences in continuous variables that are measured at multiple time points over 
time between groups using mixed model regression.  
Interrater reliability assessments of delirium will be assessed for approximately 10% of patients.  This 
includes assessment of both for the presence of delirium, and for key features including acute change, 
inattention, disorganized thinking and an altered level of consciousness. Percent agreement, kappa and 
weighted kappa will be reported.   
Given the nature of a ra ndomized controlled trial, we do not anticipate seeing differences between groups 
in baseline characteristics; however, we will perform a secondary analysis, adjusting for any differences 
observed between groups and presenting adjusted odds ratios and thei r associated 95% confidence 
intervals.  
Interim Analyses  
There will be no interim analysis.  
Missing Data  
The frequency and percentage of missing values for each variable will be collected, analyzed and reported 
as necessary. If there are missing values for  the outcome variable(s), individual patients will be excluded.  
Highly incomplete covariates (>33% of observations missing) will be excluded from analyses.  In the event 
that a variable is missing more than 10% of the time we will consider imputation.  If  missing values are 
missing at random (MAR) or not at random (MNAR), multiple imputation will be performed. Missing values, 
selection or exclusion of observations and variables and handling of missing values in the statistical analysis 
will be describes ca refully and sensitivity analysis will be provided in the manuscript.   
Statistical Analytical Issues   
Adjustments for Covariates  
Given the randomized nature of this study, there will be no covariate adjustment in the primary analysis.  If 
differences betwee n groups persist after randomization we will perform a post hoc analysis including 
variables that are significantly differ between groups.   
Multiple Comparisons  
There will be no adjustment for multiple testing . Results of secondary outcomes and post hoc a nalyses will 
therefore be considered exploratory.   
Examination of Subgroups  
Our pre -specified primary analysis will assess the incidence of delirium between patients receiving 
intravenous  acetaminophen versus placebo.  Predefined subgroup analyses will be performed for our 
primary and secondary outcomes for the following groups:  
• Two sedative groups: dexmedetomidine versus propofol

 • All four factorial groups including both sedatives (dexmedetomidine and propofol) and anal gesics 
(acetaminophen and placebo).    
Post -hoc Analyses  
Post-hoc data driven analyses are allowed aft er the following are undertaken:  
(a) Document which analyses were conducted after the results for the Primary and Secondary Aims 
are analyzed.  
(b) Document the rationale for these analyses.  
(c) Pre-specify their interpretation in the context of the primary and secondary results and their 
impact on the overall trial conclusions.

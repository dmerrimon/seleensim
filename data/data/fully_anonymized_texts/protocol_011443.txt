 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
 
Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) complicates up to 30% of general abdominal  operations.  It 
results in patient discomfort, embarrassment, interference with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and significant nursing 
burden.  More importantly, urinary retention necessitates use of intermittent catheterization or placement of an indwelling urinary  catheter , which exposes the patient to an increased risk of urinary 
tract infection (UTI), urethral injury, and potentially increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528148].  For these 
reasons, a safe and effective intervention for preventing POUR would be highly valuab le.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_528149] a 
need, no contemporary studies exist evaluating medications that can be used to prevent POUR in broad general surgery populations.  To address this gap, we are designing a prospective, randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trial t o test the hypothesis that preoperative loading with tamsulosin will 
prevent POUR in patients undergoing elective, inpatient complex intra- abdominal surgery and thereby 
[CONTACT_528167] -term outcomes.   
 Tamsulosin is a safe and widely -used selective  alpha
1A adrenergic blocker commonly used for the 
treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy.  It has also been shown to have some benefit in reducing POUR and need for catheterization in men undergoing inguinal 
hern ia repair and other outpatient urologic procedures.  To test our hypothesis, we will conduct a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial in which we administer tamsulosin or placebo for 7 
days pre -operatively to pat ients scheduled for inpatient co mplex intra- abdominal  surgery, and then 
compare the rates of POUR in each group (Aim 1).  We also propose a retrospective analysis  of our data 
to identify risk factors for POUR and subgroups of patients that would derive the greatest benefit from 
preoperat ive tamsulosin (Aim 2).  Furthermore, we propose to determine if preoperative tamsulosin 
therapy leads to improved short -term outcomes, including reduced rate of UTI and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491] (Aim 3).  
  2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
Postoperative urinary retention refers to the inability to void spontaneously or completely following 
surgery.  It complicates up to 69% of operations, depending on the type of surgery, and can have 
significant consequences for the patient.
[ADDRESS_685744] effects of urinary retention 
include patient discomfort, embarrassment, and the consequences of bladder distention such as 
hemodynamic effects (rarely), prolonged detrusor dysfunction, and possible kidney disease.
[ADDRESS_685745] infection (CAUTI).  UTI is one of the 
most commo n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired infections, and 70 -80% of these are associated with an indwelling 
Preoperative tamsulosin for the prevention of postoperative urinary retention: a randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trial 
 
 
Post -Op Urinary Retention Protocol  
Version: 5.0, December 8, [ADDRESS_685746] important predictor of CAUTI is duration of catheteri zation, with an 
estimated 4 to 7% risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_528150].3   Furthermore, 
indwelling catheters cause gross hematuria and  urethral stricture in up to 5% and 7%, respectively, of 
patients with short -term indwelling urinary catheters.4  Concentrated efforts to reduce catheter -
associated UTI invariably involve early removal of indwelling urinary catheters (IUC) .  However, in order 
to facilitate early catheter removal without a large associated risk of catheter reinsertion, targeted 
efforts must be made to redu ce the risk of urinary retention . 
 
Tamsulosin is a selective alpha -1A adrenoreceptor antagonist that has been demonstrated to be 
effective in treating lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy.[ADDRESS_685747] symptoms by [CONTACT_528168], urethral sphincter, and prostate.   Tamsulosin has 
been studied previously in surgical patients, and was found to reduce the rate of POUR from 21.1% 
(placebo) to 5.9% in men undergoing varicocelectomy, inguinal hernia repair, and scrotal surgery.[ADDRESS_685748] this hypothesis, we will accomplish the following aims:  
 
3.1 Specific Aim 1:  Determine if tamsulosin administered preoperatively and perioperatively is 
more effective than placebo in preventing postoperative urinary retention in patients undergoing elective , inpatient , complex intra -abdominal  surgery.  
 
We hypothesize that patients treated with tamsulosin for [ADDRESS_685749] this hypothesis, we will investigate the followi ng sub -aims:  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_685750] a single intermittent catheterization after surgery or 
following the removal of IUC.

volume, and number of intermittent catheterizations.  
 
3.1.3 Aim 1c.   Determine the rate of IUC replacement.  
 
3.1.4 Aim 1d.   Measure frequency of adverse effects  of tamsulosin therapy.  
 
3.2 Specific Aim 2:  Identify risk factors  for postoperative urinary retention based on preoperative 
characteristics and type of operation, and ident ify which patient population benefits the most 
from preoperati ve tamsulosin therapy.  
 
We hypothesize that there are identifiable patient-  and operation -related characteristics that 
can predict postoperative urinary retention.  In testing this hypothesis, the following tw o sub -
aims will be investigated:  
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_685752] benefit from 
preoperative tamsulosin therapy.  
 
3.3 Specific Aim 3: Determine if preoperative tamsulosin therapy results in improved short -term 
outcomes.   
 
In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that reducing the rate of postoperative urinary retention leads to decreased  rate of UTI and decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] .  We therefore propose the 
following sub -aims:  
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_685753] rates of postoperative UTI in patients randomly 
assigned to tamsulosin therapy compared to those in the placebo arm.  
 
3.3.2 Aim 3b.   Determine postoperative length of stay in the two groups of patients.

 5.0 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
5.1 Collaborating sites    
 
There are no collaborating sites.  Patients will be identified from the general surgery clinics at 
UWHC , the UW DHC , The American Center (TAC), and UW East Clinic .  All patients enrolled in 
the study will undergo surgery at , and be admitted to , UWHC.    
 
5.[ADDRESS_685758] ’s medical record  at the time of 
preoperative visit, following enrollment in the study :  date of birth, age,  gender,  race, height, 
weight, information about planned surgery, co -morbidities, past medical history,  past surgical 
history,  current medications,  allergies, and smoking history .  Additional data extracted from the 
subject ’s medical record following their operation includes: operation performed, length of 
operation (minutes), type of anesthesia (general, regional, MAC, local), volume of intravenous fluids administere d intra -operatively, estimated blood loss, placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], type of 
anesthetic medications used,  placement /removal of IUC in the operating room , volume of urine 
output in the operating room, and whether or not straight catheterization was performed a t the 
conclusion of the case in the operating room.  
 
Data to be extracted from the medical record following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480304]: 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (days) , whether or not the subject was discharged with an indwelling 
catheter, diagnos is of urinary tract infection  within [ADDRESS_685759]’s medical record will be entered into the ICTR OnCore 
Clinical Research Management System . 
 
5.3 Data collection  
 
At the time of the pre -operative visit, following enrollment in the study , subjects  will fill out the 
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Survey .  This survey is a validated, self-
administered [ADDRESS_685760] surgery/history questions if they feel uncomfortable or e mbarrassed, and this will not result in exclusion from the study. Case report 
forms (CRFs) will be utilized to collect data prospectively during the subject ’s postoperative 
course  while inpatient.  This data will be collected by a study team member , and will include 
time of arrival and departure from the  operating room, time of first void, date/time of IUC 
removal, date/time of first void after catheter removal, first post -void residual volume, 
date/time of first straight catheterization (if applicable ), date/time of all subsequent straight 
catheterizations (if applicable), date/time of IUC replacement (if applicable) , and date/time of 
the first two adequate voids (if applicable) .  Finally, subjects  will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 30 -

since discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (in order to capture UTIs that are diagnosed outside of our 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619]) .   Additionally, data regarding adverse events will be collected using an Adverse 
Event Log.  A study team member will make contact [CONTACT_528170]: 1) on the day of surgery  (in person, in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) , and 
2) postoperatively via telephone call [ADDRESS_685762]’s EMR.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_685763]’s identifiers (i.e. name, MRN, birthdate) and  the subject ID will be available 
in the OnCore system. All data exported from the system will only contain the Subject ID number, and will not contain other subject ide ntifiers.  
 
All paper forms containing subject  information or data will be kept locked in the offices of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_80721].  
 
5.4.1 ICTR OnCore Clinical Research Management System  
 
This study will utilize the clinical research management software, Online  
Collaborative Research Environment (OnCore), adopted by [CONTACT_257844] (SMPH) and available to all researchers conducting clinical research studies. The instance of OnCore that will be utilized for this study is supported and man aged by [CONTACT_528171] 
(ICTR). OnCore -CRM has been, and continues to be deployed nationally at multiple 
academic medical centers, some of which are NIH Clinical and Translational Science 
Award (CTSA) sites includin g UW ICTR, and is an extension of technology currently 
used in more than two dozen Cancer Centers around the country.  
 
ICTR OnCore is a sophisticated, web -based data management system that: a) 
ensures secure, easy data entry at multiple sites; b) integrat es multiple data sources 
such as individual studies and patient registries; c) provides controlled, secure 
access to sensitive data using role -based access control; d) provides workflow 
automation; and e) allows export and reporting of data for Data and Safety Monitoring Boards and biostatisticians.  
 
This software provides protocol management functions (e.g. subject scheduling; 
screening, data organization), maintains updated forms, addresses budget 
development, billing, and fiscal management, generates su mmary reports, and 
provides essential links with other research administration and electronic medical records systems. ICTR OnCore eases the burden of the individual researcher and unifies protocol management within research programs and including research ers at 
multiple sites, enhancing protocol integrity and regulatory compliance efforts.

Current Status: Both UW ICTR and SMPH are committed to the use of ICTR OnCore 
on an enterprise -wide scale. ICTR OnCore completed the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_528152] [ADDRESS_685764] been identified and standardized within ICTR OnCore for use across the spectrum.  
 
ICTR OnCore -CRM is hosted by [CONTACT_528172] 
(SMPH) Information Technology (IT) Office  on its server farm with redundant 
systems at two, environments are maintained for production, training, and testing. 
The application -programming model employed in ICTR OnCore -CRM conforms to 
the J ava 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) standard for web -based applications. 
J2EE is a widely accepted standard for developi[INVESTIGATOR_528153] -tier enterprise applications 
and is based on standardized, modular components. The J2EE standard includes compliance test s to ensure portability of applications. In addition to portability, J2EE 
provides a JDBC API [INVESTIGATOR_528154] a proven security model that is applicable to Internet applications. J2EE also supports Enterprise JavaBeans components, Java Servlets API , JavaServer Pages, and XML technology. The ICTR 
OnCore -CRM application uses these, Apache Web services, and an application 
server (JBoss/TomCat). The backend is an Oracle® relational database management system maintained by [CONTACT_528173] . Both the database and application servers are 
behind a firewall maintained by [CONTACT_528174]. Several complete environments are 
maintained for production, training, testing, and validation.  This provides for a high 
level of system security and reliability.  
 
The data collected during the course of the study will be stored in OnCore .  
However, as is necessary for the completion of remote data analysis and travel 
to/from conferences where da ta may be presented, data exported from OnCore 
may be transferred  to a l imited number of password -protected and encrypted 
laptops belonging to study staff as necessary.  In this case, data would be stored on 
a password protected and encrypted USB drive in order to transfer data to the 
laptop.  Laptops and USB drives will only contain data that has been exported from 
OnCore and containing only Subject ID number without associated subject 
identifiers.  Only study staff will have access to such USB drives and laptops.  
Laptops and USB drives will not contain the key to the code.  
 
The clinical research pharmacy will maintain the randomization code sheet, and this 
will not be made accessible to other study team members until completion of the 
study (or at interim data and safety monitoring analysis).  Unblinding at interim data analy sis will only occur for subject s whose data collection is complete.  
 
5.5 Sub-studies/correlative studies  
 
The data collected during this study will be used to retrospectively identify risk factors that are associated with urinary retention  as described in Specific Aim 2 .  This analysis will be performed 
both on the placebo treated group alone and the overall  study population .  Logistic regression  
will be used for this analysis.  The response variable will be the primary endpoint (need for a ny

5.6.2 Consent/Enrollment/B aseline  
 
After the pre -screening procedures determine the subject may be potentially 
eligible, and the subject has expressed an interest in participating in the study , we 
will proceed with the informed consent process ( either at the initia l or subsequent 
preoperative clinic visit) .  As part of formal screening for eligibility, all women of 
childbearing age and potential will be given a pregnancy test.  Upon completion of 
the screening procedures, and determination that the subject is eligib le to 
participate, the individual will be considered enrolled in the study. Due to 
constraints of the study related to the medication starting [ADDRESS_685766] an additional preoperative clinic visit scheduled and needs additional time to consider participation in the study, he or she may bring written materials home and study personnel will follow up via telephone call.  If the 
patient is interested in participating in the study, then a visit will be arranged with 
the study coordinator (prior to 7 days preoperatively) for the patient to sign the 
consent form , undergo formal eligibility screening, and  complete enrollment.  
 After enrollment, the subject  will fill out the first data collection form, which 
includes the IPSS survey and questionnaire regarding history of previous urinary retention and urinary tract surgery o r procedures .  The subject may choose to

treatment  (chooses to withdraw from the study)  prior to their scheduled surgery , 
the subject wil l be discontinued and replaced , and reason for withdraw  from study 
will be noted.   Data will continued to be collected for these subjects and their data 
will be included on an intent -to-treat basis, but they will be replaced for sample size.  
If the subject  discontinues study drug any time after their surgery , the subject will 
be followed with intent to treat and will not be replaced.  If a subject’s planned 
surgery is postponed PRIOR to initiation of treatment but is rescheduled to within [ADDRESS_685768] may stay enrolled in 
the trial, will keep their same treatment assignment, and will be given a new start 
date  for treatment (7 days before their rescheduled surgery date).  If, however, the 
surgery is postponed or  cancelled AFTER initiation of treatment, then the subject 
will be taken off treatment and discontinued from the study.  If the subject has not 
yet initiated treatment and their surgery is rescheduled to a date that is more than [ADDRESS_685769]  complete s the bladder management protocol ( is voiding

the subject  completes the bladder management protocol ( has voided twice  
consecutively  with a post -void residual <200mL ).  The mi nimum number of total 
doses is 7 ; the maximum number of total doses is 14.  The 14th dose will be the 
final dose re gardless of bladder function.   No subject s will be discharged from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528155].  
 
7.1.2 Treatment ARM B —placebo:  
 
Placebo capsule orally dosed exactly as outlined above for Treatment ARM A  
 
7.[ADDRESS_685777].  Adverse event screening  will 
occur at three time points: 1) on the day of surgery either pre - or post - operatively (in person, in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , via interview of the subject by a study team  member ), 2) during the  postoperative  
period for  the period from surgery until  48 hours after completion of the intervention ( via 
abstraction of AEs from the subject’s EMR ), and 3) 30- 40 days after surgery (via telephone 
interview of the subject by a study  team member).   Safety data will be monitored and analyzed 
by [CONTACT_126551]  (through ICTR) , and unanticipated problems or 
complications will be reported to the IRB per its reporting guidelines.   Unexpected or severe 
adverse events will also be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_685778] will 
be removed from the protocol .  Follow up outcome data will still be collected to allow for intent -
to-treat analysis.    
 
7.4 Supportive Care  
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the s tudy.   
 
7.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
Treatment will be discontinued within 24 hours of  the subjec t’s complet ion of the bladder 
management protocol with return of normal bladder function ( 2 consecutive voids with PVR less 
than 200mL ) or requir ement of  IUC re -insertion for urinary retention.   The maximum number of 
doses (days) of treatment is 14.  If ongoing urinary retention is present, further management

9.0 DRUG FORMULATION AND PROCUREMENT  
9.1 Tamsulosin  hydrochloride  (NDC 0597- 0058- 01) 
 
9.1.1 Other names:   FLOMAX  
 
9.1.2 Classification: alpha
1A adrenoceptor antagonist  
 
9.1.3 Mode of Action:  Tamsulosin works by [CONTACT_528180] 1A adrenergic receptors in the 
prostate, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck, which results in relaxation of the 
smooth muscles in the bladder neck and pros tate, thereby [CONTACT_528181].  
 
9.1.4 Storage and stability  
 
Stored at 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees F); excursions permitted to 15 degrees C to 
30 degrees C (59 degrees F to 86 degrees F)  
 
9.1.5 Dose specifics: 0.4mg orally dosed one time per day , 30 minutes after a meal,  in the 
evening

9.1.8 Incompatibilities  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other alpha -adrenergic blockers  
 
Per package insert: “ The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions 
between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha -adre nergic blocking agents have not 
been determined. However, interactions may be expected and FLOMAX capsules should NOT be used in combination with other alpha -adrenergic 
blocking ag ents .”  Patients taking concomitant alpha blockers (including 
verapamil, which has alpha blockade action at therapeutic doses) will be excluded from the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cimetidine  
 
Per package insert: “ The pharmacokinetic interaction between cime tidine and 
FLOMAX capsules was investigated. The results indicate significant changes in 
tamsulosin HCl clearance (26% decrease) and AUC (44% increase). Therefore, 
FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, 
particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg .”  Patients taking cimetidine will still be 
eligible for the study, but will be notified about potential increased risk of side effects.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Warfarin  
 
Per package insert: “A definitive drug -drug interaction study between 
tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited 
in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive.  Therefore, caution should be 
exercised with concomitant admi nistration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules.”   
We will exclude patients taking warfarin.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit 
juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
posac onazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, vorico nazole)  and 
CYP2D6 (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine ) 
 It is recommended that doses higher than 0.4mg daily should not be used in 
combination w ith strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or C YP2D6 and that caution 
should be exercised when using tamsulosin in combination with such drugs.   
Studies have demonstrated an increased AUC and C
max when tamsulosin is taken 
in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, but these increases 
have been shown to still fall equivalently or below the higher U.S. dosage of 
0.8mg daily.  One study specifically examining clinical effects (i.e. orthostasis) of

 concomitant tamsulosin/paroxetine and tamsulosin/ketoconazole found no 
significant clinical effect of these medications being co -administered.  Patients 
taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 will not be excluded from the 
study, however they will be advised about potential increased risk of side

cataract surgery .
10  It has been found to occur even up to a ye ar afte r 
discontinuation of tamsulosin, and possibly longer.11  However, one 
prospective study evaluating outcomes after surgery in which IFIS was present found that when surgeons were aware of prior or current tamsulosin use, they were able to employ compen satory techniques

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
10.1 Randomization and stratification  
  Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_547],  pelvic/non -pelvic surgery , and high vs low IPSS score 
(which “high” defined as >=8, and “low” <=7)  prior to randomization.  Subjects  will be 
randomized with a 50/50 chance of being allocated to active drug or placebo.  Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_398377], and the code sheet for 
randomization will be kept by [CONTACT_398384].  Unblinding of study team members will only occur for 
Preoperative tamsulosin for the prevention of postoperative urinary retention: a randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trial

 interim data analysis , which will be performed between  May  15 and May 30, 2016.  Onl y 
subjects for who complete data collection (including 30 -day postoperative outcomes) has 
been obtained will be unblinded at that time.    
 
For purposes of stratification, “pelvic” operations include the following: surgery involving the rectum (colorectal anastomosis, ileo -rectal anastomosis, IPAA, proctopexy, proctocolectomy, 
proctectomy, LAR, and APR).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_685787] a single intermittent catheterization, treated as a binary outcome.  Secondary 
endpoints include need for indwelling catheter replacement (binary), time until first void 
(continuous), number of intermittent catheterizations ( numeric ), post -void residual urine 
volumes (continuous), UTI rates (binary), and length of stay (continuous).  The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint.  We will employ a two -tailed, two sample test 
for eq uality of proportions (chi -squared or Fisher's exact) at a significance level of 0.05 
(equivalent to one -tailed alpha of 0.025) in order to compare urinary retention rates  as 
measured by [CONTACT_195777] .  Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_528158], 
we anticipate that 30% of the placebo group will experience urinary retention, and that the 
tamsulosin group will see a 50% reduction to a 15% urinary retention rate.  In order to achieve 
at least 80% power for detecting a significant group diffe rence, we will need 134 subjects 
included in each study arm , or a total of 268 subjects .  However, to provide for a 10% drop out 
rate, we would need to  plan to enroll 14 7 subjects in each arm, yielding a n enrollment goal  of 
294 subjects.    
 
10.3 Error levels  
 
 Two -sided t ype I error level is set at 0.05, and type II error level is 0.20.   
 
10.4 Differences to be detected for comparative studies  
 
Based on institutional urinary retention rates  and information from the literature, we 
anticipate  that 30% of the placebo group will experience urinary retention, and that the 
tamsulosin group will see a 50% reduction to a 15% urinary retention rate.   This is the pre -
specified difference in the primary outcome that the study is designed to detect at a two -
tailed significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%.  The secondary outcomes that will be compared include  need for indwelli ng catheter replacement, time until first void,  number of 
intermittent catheterizations , post -void residual urine volumes , UTI rates , and length of stay.  
These secondary outcomes can be thought of as more hypothesis -generating.  We 
acknowledge that we may not be powered to achieve statistical significance for our secondary outcome measures.

Page 22 of 32  
 The estimated sample size needed to achieve the pre -specified statistical significance and 
power is a total of 2 68 subjects  (134 subjects in each arm) .  Subjects that withdraw from the 
study prior to surgery will be replaced.   We estimate that there will be a 10% drop -out rate , 
and therefore the enrollment goal to account for drop -outs is estimated to be 29 4 subjects 
(147 in each arm) in order to achieve an actual sample size of [ADDRESS_685788]’s  
date of surgery.  Expected study duration is approximately 3-6 years from the time that 
enrollment begins.  
   
10.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528159] a highly significant difference 
(p<0.0 01) between the tamsulosin group and the pl acebo group in the primary outcome .  Data 
monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_528182] 6 -12 months as needed.  The single 
planned interim data analysis will be performed between May 15 and May 30, 2016, by [CONTACT_978] 
(Evie Carchman ), Greg Kennedy,  Christina Papageorge , and Glen Leverson  for the purposes of 
a Master’s thesis project.  I f the rate of either priapi[INVESTIGATOR_528160] 10 %, then the study will be

10.8 Hypothese s 
 
10.8.1  Primary  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  We hypothesize that subjects  treated with tamsulosin will have a decreased 
need for intermittent catheterization after initial IUC re moval compared to 
those  treated with placebo.  
 
10.8.2  Secondary  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjects treated with tamsulosin will have a lower rate of IUC replacement compared to those treated with placebo.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Subject s treated with tamsulosin will have a higher incidence of abnormal 
ejaculation, dizziness, and orthostasis compared to those treated with 
placebo.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjects  treated with tamsulosin will have a shorter time until first 
spontaneous void compared to those treated with placebo.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject s treated with tamsulosin will have a fewer number of t otal 
intermittent catheterizations required per subject compared to thos e treated 
with placebo.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The tamsulosin group will have a smaller average p ost void residual urine 
volu me after first spontaneous void compared to the placebo group.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The tamsulosin group will have a smaller proportion of patients being discharged from t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528162].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The tamsulosin group will have a lower incidence of u rinary tract infection 
diagnosed within 30 days of operation  compared to the placebo group.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject s treated with tamsulosin will have a shorter average h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_7947] (in days ) compared to those  treated with placebo.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Male gender, high preoperative IPSS score, older age, pelvic operations, larger volume of intraoperative fluids, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_528163].

rate exceeds the allowed 10%, we will enroll additional subject s to maintain 80% power at a 
0.05 significance level.  As  a contingency plan, t he maximum number of subjects we will enroll 
will be based on a 30% drop out rate.  This would yield a maximum number of subjects in each  
arm of [ADDRESS_685791] of proportions (Chi -

crossover from placebo to active drug did not occur.  Additionally, this analysis will be 
performed both including and excluding the subje cts who receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686].     
 The secondary  outcomes will be analyzed using either Chi- squared or Fisher’s exact tests for 
binary outcome measures, and Student t -tests for continuous outcome variables.   
 
The retrospective study to identify risk factors for POUR will be a logistic regression  
using our primary outcome as the response variable and the various preoperative and  
operative variables as the predictor variables.  We plan to look at risk factors b oth in  
the placebo cohort alone and the overall sample of all patients.  We will quantify the  
risks of each variable with odds ratios.   
 
In order to identify groups of patients most likely to benefit from tamsulosin, we will perform chi-squared or Fishe r’s exact tests on subgroups of patients to identify variables that are 
associated with  POUR, and then create interaction variable s between tamsulosin and the key 
factors identified in the initial analysis.  We will also employ binary logistic regression in this analysis to identify odds ratios for the interaction variables.   
 The interim analysis will be a two -sided two sample test of proportions (Chi -squared or 
Fisher’s exact) at a two -tailed alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_685793]’s identifiers (i.e. name, MRN, birthdate) and the subject ID will be

OnCore is a sophisticated, web -based data management system that: a) ensures secure, easy 
data entry at multiple sites; b) integrates multiple data sources; c) provides controlled, secure 
access to sensitiv e data using role -based access control; d) provides workflow automation; 
and e) allows export and reporting of data for Data and Safety Monitoring Boards and 
biostatisticians.  
 
This software provides protocol management functions (e.g. subject scheduling;  screening, 
data organization), maintains updated forms, addresses budget development, billing, and 
fiscal management, generates summary reports, and provides essential links with other research administration and electronic medical records systems. ICTR O nCore eases the 
burden of the individual researcher and unifies protocol management within research programs and across research sites, enhancing protocol integrity and regulatory compliance 
efforts.  
 
The ICTR OnCore support  team will work with the invest igator and study team to ensure that 
relevant, applicable study data are collected and entered into electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) through a secure web -based system with restricted access.

has another scheduled preoperative clinic visit prior to 7 days pr eoperatively, then the patient will 
be given the opportunity to take the consent form home if they so desire, and then signed 
informed consent will be obtained at the next clinic visit.  If that clinic visit is the patient's last 
clinic visit prior to the date of surgery, informed consent will be obtained at that time unless the patient needs additional time to consider participation .  If the patient needs additional time to 
consider participation in the study, he or she may bring written materials home and  study

 personnel will follow up via telephone call.  If the patient is interested in participating in the study, 
then a visit will be arranged with a study team member (prior to 7 days preoperatively) for the 
patient to sign the consent form and complete e nrollment.  
 
The consent process will occur in a private clinic room or office.  
 
 
13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
An adverse event log will be maintained for all subjects enrolled in the study.   A member of the 
study team will directly inquire about adverse events  (via interview of the subject)  when the 
subject  reports to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8557] (after 7 days of taking the study medication).  
The adverse event log will be updated again  based on AEs reported in the EMR from the time of 
surgery until [ADDRESS_685796] time via telephone call 30 -40 days after surgery .  Four  stud y team members ( Evie Carchman, Greg 
Kennedy,  Christina Papageorge , and Glen Leverson ) will meet between May 15 and May 30, 2016, 
to perform interim data analysis on primary endpoint data for the purposes of a Master’s research project.   
 
13.1 Data Monitoring Committee  
 
We plan to utilize the UW ICTR Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to oversee the study.  The 
UW ICTR DMC is co -chaired by [CONTACT_528186] (core plus ad hoc) with expertise required to oversee this study.  The DMC members 
will review protocol -specific reports created by [CONTACT_528187].  These standard reports will include an overview of study objectives, a review of actual and projected accrual rates, an evaluation  of 
patient demographics for balance of randomization, and a summary of the number and seriousness of adverse events.  An interim analysis of study results may be performed and 
source documents may be reviewed to allow the DMC to independently judge whether the 
overall integrity and conduct of the protocol remain acceptable based on data provided and 
reported by [CONTACT_079]. The DMC will make recommendations to the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_262597], modificatio n or termination.  
 In providing oversight for the conduct of this study, the ICTR DMC will meet every 6 months 
during the 3 -year study to review all adverse events.  The predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528164] , or priapi[INVESTIGATOR_528165] .  The 
boundary for excess harm will be an incidence of syncope or priapi[INVESTIGATOR_528166] 5%, or an observed excess harm which in the judgment of the DMC, is excessive.   We will report all serious adverse 
events to the DMC and the IRB oversight committee, the Health Sciences IRB in accordance 
with their reporting guidelines.  
 
The individuals responsible for dat a and safety monitoring are independent of  the 
researchers.

patient (or visit the patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to inquire about adverse events.  
 
Between May 15 -30, 2016, unblinding will occur for subjects for which complete data 
collection (30 days from operation) has been  achieved,  and interim data analysis will then be 
performed by [CONTACT_528188] (the PI) , Greg Kennedy,  Christina Papageorge, and Glen Leverson 
for purpos es of  a Master ’s research project.     
 
13.2 Study Monitoring Service (SMS)  
 
While many institutions involved in clinical research conduct various types of quality 
assurance reviews and audits, UW ICTR is one of a few institutions to offer Study Monitor of 
Recor d services, a robust academic equivalent to the industry Contract Research Organization 
(CRO) standards for ongoing study monitoring.  
 The SMS will offer three types of compliance review activities on this study: 1) Study Monitor of Record Reviews; 2) Rou tine (Random/QA) Reviews; and 3) Directed (For -Cause) Reviews. 
The Study Monitor of Record activities will be contracted for the proposed study, and will include the conduct and follow -up of monitoring visits throughout the life cycle of the study 
(e.g., S ite Initiation Visit, Interim Monitoring Visits, and Close -Out Visit). Study monitoring 
visits will occur off- site (remotely) and/or on -site at a frequency necessitated by [CONTACT_528189].  
 For this study, UW ICTR SMS personnel will conduct a S ite Initiation Visit (SIV) with the UW-
Madison research personnel in person after IRB approval is confirmed and before enrollment 
of any subjects into the study. The SIV will include a detailed review of the protocol, good clinical practice guid elines, and data management expectations of the research team at the 
study site and the SMS personnel. Following the Site Initiation Visit (SIV), SMS Monitoring 
personnel will routinely conduct ongoing Interim Monitoring Visits (IMVs) for all data 
collection sites, either on -site, remotely or a combination of both, following enrollment of the 
first subject(s) and throughout the duration of the study. During IMVs, the monitors will 
review study materials, including but not limited to: regulatory files, conse nt forms, case 
report forms, and device accountability logs. UW ICTR SMS personnel will conduct a Close -Out 
Visit (COV) upon completion of the study at the study site.  
 
Monitoring could consist of full or partial review of study records, depending on risk  level and 
observed compliance. As such, during their monitoring activities, UW ICTR SMS personnel plan 
to review all (100%) of the study -related subject records for 10-20% of the enrolled subjects. 
The subject records of the first two subjects enrolled will be monitored in their entirety, with 
the additional numb er of enrolled subjects to be randomly . SMS personnel could increase the 
percentage of study or subject records to be reviewed if warranted by [CONTACT_528190].  
 
The study monitor(s ) will work closely with the ICTR DMC statistician and the study statistician 
to conduct periodic central data reviews, with follow -up conducted by [CONTACT_528191].

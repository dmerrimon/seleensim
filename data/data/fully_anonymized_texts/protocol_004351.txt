4.[ADDRESS_104749]’s condition has worsened to the degree that it is unsafe for the 
Subject to continue in the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94567]’s condition as 
soon as possible (i.e., during an Unscheduled Visit) and determine whether treatment should be 
discontinued. If the Subject is discontinued from the study during an Unscheduled Visit, the visit will 
be referred to as an Early Discontinuation Visit. 
4.[ADDRESS_104750] whose health or well-being may be 
threatened by [CONTACT_94597], or who may be experiencing unmanageable factors that may 
interfere with the study procedures and/or the interpretation of study results.  Such Subjects should 
be withdrawn from the study rather than continued under a modified regimen. 
Subjects will be removed from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 If the Subject withdraws his or her consent for any reason; 
 If the Subject’s condition has worsened to the degree that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94568]; 
 If the Subject’s drug code is unblinded (on a case- by-case basis in consultation with the MM); 
 If an adverse event occurs for which the Subject desires to discontinue treatment or the

Additional reasons for Subjects to be removed from the study:  
 More than [ADDRESS_104751] 
missed all doses for more than 14 consecutive days  
Medical Monitor/Sponsor notification is required before removing subjects for any of the reasons 
noted above. 
A significant protocol violation is defined as any Subject or Investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of 

 
May 20, 2022 Protocol:  AS012- 20-[ADDRESS_104752] to follow-up, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94570] (at 
least three) attempts to reach t he Subject twice by [CONTACT_94598] a certified follow-up letter. 
In the event that a Subject discontinues from the study at any time due to an adverse event, the 
reason for discontinuation, the nature of the event and its clinical course must be fully documented. 
For such a Subject, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94571], becomes clinically insignificant, is stabilized or the Subject is lost to follow-up. Should a 
serious adverse event be noted, procedures stated in Section 10.[ADDRESS_104753]’s current and past medical conditions. 
Significant medical history should include, but not be limited to, evidence of hypertension, lipid 
disorders, obesity (BMI >/= 30 as per the Metropolitan Index), heart attack, stroke, congestive heart 
failure, kidney disease, auto immune disease and gestational diabetes. Significant surgical history 
should include, but not be limited to, removal of blockage from an artery and gallbladder removal. 
5.2 Physical Examination 
The investigator , sub-investigator or appropriately delegated designee, (Physician’s Assistant , 
Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner , and Registered Nurse as per local regulations) will perform 
a physical examination, prior to the Subject starting study drug and at the end of treatment .   
The physical examina
tion will include, at a minimum, examination of the Subject’s general 
appearance, comprehensive skin examination, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), heart, 
lungs, musculoskeletal system, neurological system, lymph nodes, abdomen and extremities. 
Height and weight will be measured without shoes. 
At the study visits 1, 2, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 13 (Screening, Baseline, and study weeks 20, 44, 48, 52 , 
and 64) the Subject’s body weight will also be measured while the Subject is lightly clothed (e.g., no 
coat or shoes).  
5.3 Vital Signs 
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse rate*, respi[INVESTIGATOR_94572], will be 
documented at every visit. Vital signs will be measured after the Subject has rested in a seated o r 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes.  
* Pulse rate will be measured once by [CONTACT_94599] 60 seconds (the pulse 
rate should not be extrapolated after counting for part of 60 seconds).

been surgically sterilized (by [CONTACT_31658]) or have been postmenopausal for at least [ADDRESS_104755] administration of study drug. For the purpose of this study the following are 
considered acceptable methods of birth control: oral or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive 

 
May 20, 2022 Protocol:  AS012- 20-01  Page 29 of 88  
 5.6 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications, including the use of non-drug treatments/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], in addition to the 
reason for the medication use, will be assessed at baseline and at each subsequent study visit. The 
start and stop date of concomitant medication use during the study should be provided in the data set 
in addition to the reason for the medication use. 
A record of concomitant medications taken by [CONTACT_94600], if 
known, with the corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded will include prescription 
and over-the-counter (OTC) medications and dietary supplements. All medications taken on a regular 
basis, including acetaminophen, should be recorded. 
5.7 Adverse Events (AEs)  
Any AEs reported after signing Informed Consent should be reported. An adverse event is defined as 
any untoward medical occurrence (sign, symptom or abnormal laboratory finding) regardless of 
severity in a Subject or clinical-trial Subject administered a medicinal product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. All adverse events, whether 
observed by [CONTACT_94601], whether related to study 
drug or not related to study drug, shall be documented on Subject records, together with details, i.e. 
date of onset, description of the AE, the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken, the 
relationship to the investigational product and the degree of severity, the seriousness, date of 
resolution, and the outcome.  
5.8 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
Subject will not be eligible to participate in the study if at Screening Subject responded “yes” within 
the last 12 months to Questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section, or any positive response in the 
behavioral section of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).  
5.[ADDRESS_104756]’s 
eligibility criteria as well as at the study visits 4, 7, 9, end of treatment and post treatment follow up 
(study weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, and 64). To avoid impacting results and quality of data, ECG should be 
done before other invasive or stressful procedures. 
The following ECG parameters will be obtained directly from the computerized 12-lead ECG 
recordings: rhythm, ventricular rate, P-R interval (the portion of the ECG between the onset of the P 
wave and the QRS complex), R-R interval, QRS duration and QT. QTcF will be calculated according to 
the Fridericia formula. 
5.10 Treatment Interruption Guidance for AEs 
The treatment period should not be extended beyond 52 weeks due to missed doses or treatment 
interruption periods. Subjects whose condition worsens (e.g. an increase in VASI score from baseline 
by ≥ 25%, or development of allergic reactions or the development of other potentially serious drug 
reactions) should be re-evaluated by [CONTACT_94602]. 
Study drug dosing may be temporarily suspended in the event of: 
 Clinically important laboratory abnormalities 
 Other inter-current illnesses or major surgery or AE related or unrelated to the study treatment  
A decision to discontinue IP and/or to resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation 
due to illness, AE or laboratory abnormality should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. The 
Investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, without consultation with the medical monitor if 
the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the subject’s 
best interest.  Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_94603].

 7 STUDY VISITS ( SEE STUDY VISIT SCHEDULE ) 
At all visits the efficacy assessments have to be performed in the order per instructions below: 
- AE will be evaluated before application of any assessment questionnaire 
- the patient-rated questionnaires like DLQI, , VIPs,  
 must be completed prior to the Investigator assessments* 
*only at a screening visit the patient rated questionnaires can completed after the investigator assessments 
- Physician Global assessment (PGA) for vitiligo,  must be completed prior to other 
efficacy assessments (VASI,  VES) 
Note: changes in study visit schedules, missed visits, or subject discontinuations may lead to missing 
information (e.g., for protocol-specified procedures). It is important to capture specific information in the 
subject records that explains the basis of the missing data, including the relationship to COVID-19, for 
missing protocol-specified information (e.g., from missed study visits or study discontinuations due to 
COVID-19). 
7.1 Visit 1: Screening Visit (Week ≥ -4 / Day -28 to -1) 
Potential subjects will be screened during a 4-week period prior to randomization. CRO/Sponsor ’s 
approval is required on a case- by-case basis for an extension of the Screening Period to obtain all test 
results and to re-screen a subject. Re-screening is allowed once per subject; all assessments should be 
repeated using a new screening number. The new informed consent/assent is not required, unless an 
amended or revised informed consent/assent is introduced during the study. 
The following procedures will be performed at Screening: 
1. Written informed consent will be obtained . Subjects must have provided IRB approved 
written informed consent. Subjects will be given the approved ICF describing the study and 
any risks associated with participation. The Subject will be allowed as much time as needed 
to read and understand the information presented in the consent form. Appropriate study 
personnel will be available to answer any questions the Subject might have regarding the 
study or study-related procedures. If the Subject chooses to participate in the study, he or 
she will be asked to sign and date the consent form and will be provided with a copy for his 
or her records. The ICF must be signed by [CONTACT_94604]. Subjects participating  the study, or those 
having skin biopsies taken, will be asked to sign a separate informed consent form in 
addition to the main study consent. 
2. Demographics will be collected, including date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. 
3. A compliance with applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed. (See Sections 
4.2, 4.3)  
4. After confirming the eligibility, the Subject will be assigned a screening number. 
5. A complete medical history will be obtained for the Subject’s current and past medical 
conditions, including a complete list of current and past (within the previous 30 days ) 
medications . Significant medical history should include, but not be limited to, evidence of 
hypertension, lipid disorders, obesity*, heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, kidney 
disease, and auto immune disease and gestational diabetes. Significant surgical history 
should include, but not be limited to, removal of blockage from an artery and gallbladder 
removal. (See Section  5.1) 
* Obesity = BMI ≥30 (as defined by [CONTACT_94605]) 
6. A urine pregnancy test will be conducted for all females of childbearing potential (see Section  5.4) 
7. A physical examination will be performed. At a minimum, the physical examination will 
include the following: height, weight, assessment of general appearance, comprehensive skin 

 
May 20, 2022 Protocol:  AS012- 20-[ADDRESS_104757] and not chewed or crushed. The doses should be taken with 
approximately 240 mL (8 oz.) of water between meals, approximately one hour after and before 
meals. 
Investigational Product will be used for [ADDRESS_104758] the site for instructions.  
Missed doses : 
The dose will be skipped if the subjects realizes more than [ADDRESS_104759] in the patient diary .  
More than 14 consecutive days of non-compliance to study medication (i.e. subjects who have 
missed all doses for more than 14 consecutive days) will result in subject’s discontinuation from the 
study.  
8.[ADDRESS_104760]’s diary. 
Subjects will be instructed to bring their daily diary and used and unused study drug containers at all 
scheduled visits or Early Discontinuation Visit to allow for tablet count and compliance checks. 
Subjects will also be asked to record in a daily diary the date and time at which they took the study 
drug. In addition, Subjects will be instructed to document all AEs on the diary.  
If the subject does not return the Diary, Subject-reported dosing compliance will be recorded in the 
source notes and will be used to derive compliance between those visits. 
For scheduled visits greater than 4 weeks apart, subjects will be called (at w8, w32, w40) and asked 
about compliance with study drug. 
8.[ADDRESS_104761] is inventoried 
and dispensed. When a drug shipment is received at a study site, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94573]’s Designee must inventory the drug and sign the receipt form provided with the 
shipment. The receipt form should be emailed as per instructions provided on the receipt.  A copy of 
the receipt should remain at the site. 
The Investigator will not supply study test articles to any person not enrolled in this study, or to any 
physician or scientist except those named as sub-investigators. 
A Drug Accountability Log will assist study site staff in maintaining inventory records of study drug. 
Subjects must return used, partially used or unused Investigational Product so that any remaining 
drug supplies can be accounted for and noted in the Drug Accountability Log.  
8.[ADDRESS_104762] may be returned to the Drug Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_94574]-out and final drug accountability is 
reconciled.

 and the AE. Based upon the Principal Investigator’s clinical experience, the association 
of the event with the study drug seems likely.  
 Definite: The AE occurs following the application of the study drug and it cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_94606]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the Subject . It 
disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study drug and reappears on a re-
challenge of the investigational product.  
10.[ADDRESS_104763]. Alternatively, any of the following methods of birth control are 
acceptable: oral or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches, Depo-Provera® (stabilized for at 
least 3 months), NuvaRing® (vaginal contraceptive), Implanon™ (contraceptive implant), double 
barrier methods (e.g. condom and spermicide), IUD, tubal ligation, Essure or abstinence with a 2nd 
acceptable method of birth control should the Subject become sexually active.   Prior to study 
enrollment women of child bearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during study participation. 
A negative result of a pregnancy test having a minimum sensitivity of at least 50mIU/ml for hCG 
should be obtained, prior to study participation, at Visit 1. Pregnancy testing will also be performed at 
every study visit and the results of all pregnancy tests (positive or negative) will be documented. 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a study Subject is pregnant 
or may have been pregnant at the time of Investigational Product exposure, the Investigational 
Product will be permanently discontinued. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94575]. 
Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the 
Subject. Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. In 
addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94576]-up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a 
minimum of eight weeks after birth.   
10.3 Serious Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction  is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death  
 A life threatening adverse event; (Note: the term “life-threatening” as used here refers to an 
event in which the Subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
 In-Subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_94607], without a serious deterioration in health or if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94577] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94578] / logistic reason) are not to be 
considered as SAEs)  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions) 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Any “other” important medical event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94579], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may

1.0 Study Summary  
 
Title: Preliminary Investigation of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial  
 
Background:   Mechanical ventilation of ICU patients universally involves titration of  the 
fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650067], however, the optimal SpO 2 target remains unknown .  Higher 
SpO 2 targets (96 -100%) provide a margin of safety against hypoxia but increas e 
exposure to hyperoxia.  Lower SpO 2 targets (88 -92%) minimize hyperoxia, but may  
increase the risk of hypoxia .  An intermediate SpO 2 target (92 -96%) may avoid the risks 
of both hyperoxia and hypoxia, or may expose patients intermittently to both sets of 
risks.   Current guidelines offer divergent recommendations as to the optimal SpO 2 target 
and clinical safety and efficacy data are lacking.  Therefore, w e propose a 2,250 -patient 
cluster -randomized cluster -crossover trial comparing a lower SpO 2 target (90%) , an 
intermediate SpO 2 target (94%) , and a higher SpO 2 target (98%) with regard to the 
outcome of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation.   
 
Primary Aim : 
• To compare the effect of higher, intermediate, and lower SpO 2 targets on days 
alive and  free of invasive mechanical ventilation among mechanically ventilated 
critically ill adults.  
 
Primary Hypotheses:  
• Use of a lower SpO 2 target (90%) for mechanically ventilated ICU patients will 
result in more days alive and free of invasive mechanical vent ilation than use of 
an intermediate SpO 2 target (94%) or a higher SpO 2 target (98%).  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
• We will include adults (≥ 18 years old) receiving mechanical ventilation through 
an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy who are admitted to the study IC U or for 
whom admission to the study ICU from the emergency department is planned.   
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• We will exclude patients who are pregnant or who are prisoners.  
 
Consent:  Because [1] the study enrolls only patients wh o would have been exposed to 
oxygen therapy as a part of clinical care outside of the study, [2] all SpO 2 targets 
examined are currentl y used in routine care in the study ICU, [3] no high -quality data 
suggest that the choice of SpO 2 target affects clinical  outcomes, and [4] during the trial 
treating clinicians retain discretion to control the SpO 2 target when felt to be required 
for the s afe treatment a specific patient, we feel the study qualifies as minimal risk .

Randomization:   In the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the en tire study  ICU will be assigned to a single SpO 2 
target (cluster -randomized) and the ICU will switch between lower, intermediate, and 
higher SpO 2 targets every two months in a randomly generated sequence (cluster -
crossover) . 
 
Study Interventions:  
• Lower SpO 2 Target – FiO 2 will be titrated according to an oxygen therapy 
protocol to a target SpO 2 of 90% with a range considered compliant of 8 8-92% .   
• Intermediate SpO 2 Target – FiO 2 will be titrated according to an oxygen therapy 
protocol to a target SpO 2 of 94%  with a range considered compliant of 92 -96% .   
• Higher SpO 2 Target – FiO 2 will be titrated according to an oxygen therapy 
protocol to a  target SpO 2 of 98% with a range considered compliant of 96 -100%.  
 
Primary Outcome :   
• Ventilator -free days (VFDs) to stud y day 28, defined as the number of days from 
liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 after enrollment . 
 
Secondary Out comes : 
• Secondary Clinical Outcomes : ICU mortality, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], vasopressor -
free days, duration of vasopressor receipt, renal replacement therapy -free days,  
duration of renal replacement therapy receipt, ICU -free days,  ICU-length of stay,

presence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_41333], Stage II o r greater AKI by 
[CONTACT_104746] . 
• Secondary Safety Outcomes : Atrial arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia, ca rdiac 
arrest, pneumothorax.  
• Secondary F easibility Outcomes : SpO 2, SaO 2, FiO 2, PaO 2, percentage of SpO 2 
values outside tar get range, <88% with Fi O2 <1.0, Pa O2 < 55 with Fi O2 <1.0, Sp O2

 2.0 Background  
 
Each year 2 -3 million intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive invasive mechanical 
ventilat ion,1–[ADDRESS_871722] of more than $20 billion dollars.4,5  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_505607] t advances,6 in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650070] s 25-35%,7 and 
survivors often face cognitive, psychiatric, an d physical dysfunction.8–11   
 
Mechanical ventilation of ICU patie nts universally involves titration of the fraction of 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2).  De spi[INVESTIGATOR_650071], however, the optimal SpO 2 target remains unknown.  Higher SpO 2 targets 
(96-100%) provide a margin of safety against hypoxemia, but may increase exposure to 
excess FiO 2, hyperoxemia, and tissue hyperoxia, causing oxidative dam age, 12–14 
inflammation,15,16 and increased alveolar -capi[INVESTIGATOR_22425].17  Lower SpO 2 targets 
(88-92%) minimize hyperoxia,6,18,19 but may increase the risk of hypoxemia, tissue 
hypoxia, and organ dysfunction.20,21  An intermediate SpO 2 target (92 -96%) may avoid 
the risks of both hyperoxia and hypoxia, or, conversely, may expose patients 
intermittently to both sets of risks.   
 
Current guidelines offer divergent recommendations – ranging  from tolerating SpO 2 
values as low as 88% (ARDS Network)22,23 to pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98% (British 
Thoracic Society)24.  The relative risks and benefits of different SpO [ADDRESS_871723] been 
extensively examined in the setting of the neonatal ICU,25–[ADDRESS_871724] only been 
investigated in adult ICU patients in three small trials.29–[ADDRESS_871725] improved survival in the 
other two.   
 
In clinical practice, however, hyperoxemia remains common.32,33  In our r ecent 
observational study of 2,200 mechanically ventilated ICU patients at 50 centers across 
the [LOCATION_002]  (see Figure) , 
the majority of patient s had a 
lowest PaO [ADDRESS_871726]

> 97%).  The wide variation in

favoring higher SpO 2 targets),

  [ADDRESS_871728]  of SpO 2 targets during mechanical ventilation of 
critically ill adults on clinical outcomes, a randomized trial is needed.  
 
Study Aims:  
• Primary:  To compa re the effect of higher, intermediate, and lower SpO 2 targets 
on days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation among mechanically 
ventilated critically ill adults.  
• Secondary:   
o To evaluate the effect of the same intervention in the same population 
on pre -specified Secondary Clinical Outcomes , Secondary Organ Function 
Outcomes , Secondary Safety Outcomes , Secondary Feasibility Outcomes , 
and Secondary Process of Care Outcomes . 
o To evaluate the effect of the same intervention on days alive and free of 
invasive mechanical ventilation in clinically relevant pre -specified patient 
subgroups.  
 
Study Hypotheses:  
• Primary:  Use of a lower SpO 2 target (90%) for mechanically ventilated ICU 
patients will result in more days alive and free of invasive mechanical vent ilation 
than use of an intermediate SpO 2 target (94%) or a higher SpO 2 target (98%).  
 
• Secondary:  
o Compared wi th use of an intermediate SpO 2 target (94%) or higher SpO 2 
target (98%), use of a lower SpO 2 target (90%) for mechanically ventilated 
ICU patients w ill result in : 
▪ Lower ICU and in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]  
▪ No difference between in other Secondary Clinical Outcome s 
▪ Lower daily SOFA score  
▪ Lower incidence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]  
▪ No difference in other Secondary Organ Function Outcomes  
▪ No differen ce in Secondary Safety Outcomes  
▪ Lower SpO 2, SaO 2, FiO 2, PaO 2, and incidence of SpO 2 >98% with 
FiO 2 > 0.21 or  PaO 2 >120 with FiO 2 >0.21  
▪ Higher PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio and incidence of SpO 2 <88% with FiO 2 <1.0 
or PaO 2 < 55 with FiO 2 <1.0  
▪ No difference in epi[INVESTIGATOR_650073] 2 ≤ 85% lasting > 5 minutes  
▪ No difference in Secondary Process of Care Outcomes

 In order to address the aims outline d above, we propose the Preliminary Investigation 
of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial.  The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650074]  a prospective, un -
blinded, cluster -randomized, cluster -crossover trial conducted between July 1, [ADDRESS_871729] of SpO 2 targets on days alive and free of mechanical ve ntila tion among 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients.   For the 36 months of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the entire 
medical ICU will be assigned to a single SpO 2 target and the ICU will switch between 
lower, intermediate, and higher SpO 2 targets every two months in a  rand omly 
generated sequence (Figure below).   Patients who fulfill inclusion criteria without 
meeting exclusion criteria will be enrolled at the initiation of mechanical ventilation in 
the study ICU or in the emergency department when admission to the stud y ICU  is 
planned.   The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650075] 2 target and all other aspects of 
patients clinical care will remain at the discretion of the treating clinicians.

 6.2  Study Population:   All adults located in the study ICU (or for whom admission to 
the study ICU from the emergency department is p lanned) for whom the treating 
clinicians have decided invasive mechanical ventilation is require d will be enrolled 
unless meeting exclusion criteria.  Patients will be included regardless of age, gender, 
race, weight or body mass index, initial oxygen satu ration , or other clinical factors.   
 
6.3  Enrollment:  All adult patients who do not meet exclus ion criteria will be 
enrolled immediately upon receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in the study ICU or 
in the emergency department when admission to the study ICU is planned.   
 
6.4  Consent:   
All patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation i n an intensive care unit 
receive oxygen therapy titrated to maintain SpO 2 as a part of routine care.  In clinical 
practice, 98% of SpO 2 values experienced by [CONTACT_650215] 
88-100%.32,33  Within this range, current guidelines for oxygen therapy in mechanically 
ventilated adults outline three contrasting approaches: [1] tolerating Sp O2 values as low 
as 88% (NIH/NHLBI ARDS Network),22 [2] titrating within the range 92 -96% (Thoracic 
Society of Australia and New Zealand),34 or [3] pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98% 
(British Thoracic Society).24  The lower SpO 2 target (90%) , intermediate SpO 2 target 
(94%), and higher SpO 2 target (98%)  examined in this study are all intermittently used in 
routine care in the study ICU and recommended by [CONTACT_650216].  
There are currently no high -quality data to suggest that one SpO [ADDRESS_871730] to clinical outcomes.   Although there are no clear data to support 
the choice of SpO 2 target, during the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], treating clinicians  in the study ICU will 
be allowed to change the  SpO 2 target at any point if it is  felt to be required for the sa fe 
treatment a specific patient .   
Because  the interventions studied  [1] are used as part of routine care in the 
study ICU, [2] are interventions o  which the patient would be expected even if not 
participating in the study, [3] have no prior data to suggest the superiority of one 
approach over the other, and [4] are equivalent options from the perspective of the 
treating clinicians (otherwise the tre ating clinician retains control of SpO 2 target), we 
feel the study presents minimal risk.  
  Additionally, obtaining informed consent prior to participation in the study 
would be impractical.  Endotracheal intubation  and initiation of mechanical ventilation  
for critically  ill patients is frequently a time -sensitive procedure.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650076] a formal informed consent document for the endotracheal intubation and initiation 
of mechanical ventilation , time allows discussion of risks and benefits in  less t han 10% of 
airway management events in the study ICU .  The oxygen titration protocol used to 
target SpO2 in this trial begins immediately at the initiation of mechanical ventilation to 
capture the period of mechanical ventilation with the highest ri sk for hyperoxia and 
hypoxia.  Moreover, in this cluster -randomized trial, the entire ICU is assigned to a single 
SpO 2 target delivered by [CONTACT_8508]’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_650077] a unit -wide oxygen

a waiver of informed consent.  
 
 
6.5  Randomization:    
During each two -month block of the study, the ICU will be assigned to either a 
higher SpO 2 target (98%), an intermediate SpO 2 target (94%), or a lower SpO 2 target 
(90%).  The ord er of study group assignments will be  generated by [CONTACT_650217] [ADDRESS_871732] 7 days o f each two -month block will be a washout period during which the ICU 
will continue to target the assigned SpO 2 but new patients will not be enrolled.  
Assuming a duration of mechanical ventilation similar to that observed for mechanically 
ventilated patien ts admitted to the study ICU in a prior year (median 3 [IQR 3 -5] days), a 
7-day washout period will ensure that 98% patients do not experience a “crossover” 
from one assigned SpO 2 target to another.  
 
   
7.0 Study Procedures  
 
7.1       Study Interventions  
 
Choice of SpO 2 targets: In clinical practice, 98% of SpO 2 values experienced by 
[CONTACT_650218] 88 -100%.32,33  Within this range, current 
guidelines for oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated adults outline three contrasting 
approaches: [1] tolerating Sp O2 values as low as 88% (NIH/NHLBI ARDS Network),22 [2] 
titrating within the range 92 -96% (Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand),34 or 
[3] pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98% (British Thoracic Society).[ADDRESS_871733] three study 
groups, each 
emulating an 
approach to SpO 2 
targets represented in 
guidelines and clinical 
practice (Table).  
 
SpO 2 versus PaO 2:  SpO [ADDRESS_871734], PaO 2 is assessed via arterial

 earlier in their clinical course.  Similar to prior studies of oxygen therapy  during 
mechanical ventilation29, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650078] 2 for all patients with 
functioning non -invasive pulse oximetry monitoring.  For patients in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650079] -invasive pulse oximetry monitori ng is unavailable (e.g., inadequate 
plethysmography signal due to hypoperfusion), PaO 2 values corresponding to the 
assigned SpO 2 target will be used to guide oxygen therapy ( see above Table).35 
 
Oxygen T itration  Protocol :  In current usual care in the study ICU, titration of FiO 2 to 
maintain S pO 2 for mechanically ventilated adults is performed by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_46175], 
with input from nurses and physicians.  Other aspects of mechanical ventilation 
(selection of tidal volume, titration of positive end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111], screening for 
spontane ous bre athing trials) are governed by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_650080].  In preparation for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650081], we have collaborated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_650082] 2 target group ( see Figure below ).  Each block 
of the study, the mechanical ventilators in the study ICU will be outfitted by [CONTACT_650219][INVESTIGATOR_650083] 2.  The oxygen titration protocol will also be available to respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], 
nurses, and physicians through the electronic order entry system.

Initiation of Mechanical Ventilation:   The oxygen  titrati on protocol guides respi[INVESTIGATOR_650084]2 to the target SpO2 value within 
15 minutes of the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the participating ED or ICU.  This 
initial 15-minute window is inten ded to g ive the treating clinicians adequate time after 
emergent tracheal intubation to stabilize the patient’s hemodynamics and initiate basic 
ventilator settings, but also to intervene early enough to control the FiO2 and SpO2 
during the critical early p eriod of  mechanical ventilation when exposure to excess FiO2 
and hyperoxemia is most common.   
 
Oxygen Titration during Mechanical Ventilation:   SpO [ADDRESS_871735] managing the patient’s ventilator will t arget 
an SpO 2 value of 98% in t he higher SpO2 group, 94% in  the intermediate SpO 2 group, 
and 90% in the lower SpO [ADDRESS_871736] will titrate FiO 2 as directed 
by [CONTACT_650220] 2 values are outside of the range 96 -98% in 
the higher SpO 2 group, 92 -96% in the intermediate S pO 2 group, and 88 -92% in the lower 
SpO 2 group.  SpO 2 will be reassessed 5 minutes after each change in FiO 2. 
 
Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation:   Each day of mechanical ventilation, all patien ts 
in the study ICU are assessed for safety of a spontaneou s awakening trial (SAT) and 
spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)36 using the SAT and SBT safet y criteria from the

 Awakening and Breathing Controlled trial.37  To prevent patients in the higher SpO 2 
target group from experiencing delays in  qualifying for an SBT based on receipt of higher 
FiO 2 to achieve the higher SpO 2 target, during the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650085]2 ≤ 0.6.  Defi nitions of SAT and SBT failure and 
the ventilator settings and duration of the SBT will not be changed from those used in 
the ABC trial and during usual care in the study ICU.  For patients who have passed an 
SBT and SAT, the decision to discon tinue invasi ve mechanical ventilation will be made by 
[CONTACT_372229].  
 
Modification of SpO 2 Targets: At any time during the course of the study, if a treating 
clinician feels an SpO 2 target other than that assigned by [CONTACT_650221] a specific patient, the SpO 2 target for that patient may be modified.  
To modify the target, the supervising physician will complete a one -page SpO 2 target 
modification sheet documenting the rationale for modifying the target and prompti ng 
reassessm ent of the need for modification every twelve hours.  Details of each SpO 2 
target modification will be collected and monitored.  In our prior cluster -crossover trial 
using the same approach to modification of therapy assignment, treating clinic ians 
exercis ed the ability to modify the assigned therapy for < 5% of patients.[ADDRESS_871737] to override 
the assigned SpO2 target include:  
• pneumothorax,  
• pneumomediastinum,  
• carbon monoxide  poisoning,  
• decompression sickness,  
• bleomycin toxicity,  
• paraquat toxicity  
 
SpO 2 Monitoring:  For all mechanically ventilated patients in the study ICU, SpO 2 is 
continuously monitored using Nellcor™ SpO ₂ Adhesive Sensors (Medtronic, Minneapolis, 
MN), which measure ch anges in red and infrared light absorption in an arteriolar bed 
throughout the pulse cycle to report a non -normalized real -time plethysmographic 
waveform and arterial hemoglobin saturation va lues averaged over the prior 6 seconds 
with a mean difference bet ween SpO 2 and SaO 2 < 2% for SpO 2 values 80 -100%.39  
Plethysmography and SpO 2 values are displayed [1] on IntelliVue MP90 bedside patient 
monitors (PHILIPS, Amsterdam, Netherlands) in each ICU room, [2] on telemetry

Feedback on SpO 2 Target Adherence: [1] During the study, the IntelliVue MP90 bedside 
patient monitors in each room will be set to generate a low priority alarm for SpO 2 
values 1 -3% outside the assigned target range and a high priority alarm for SpO 2 values 
≥ 4% outside the assigned target range ( see Figure  below ).  For example, for patients in 
the lower SpO 2 target group, SpO 2 values 88 -92% will generate no alarm, SpO 2 values 
85-87% or 93 -95% will generate a low priority alarm, and SpO2 values ≤ 84% or ≥ 96%  
will generate a high -priority alarm.  [2] For the first 6 months of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], study 
personnel will remotely monitor SpO 2 values in real -time 8am -5pm Monday through 
Friday and during a 
10% sample of night 
and weekend hours 
to identify instances 
of lag between out of 
range SpO 2 values 
and FiO 2 titration, 
provide feedback 
and reinforcement to 
bedside nurses and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_335613], and 
identify any barriers 
to SpO 2 target 
compliance.  [3] For 
the entire period of 
the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], study 
personnel wil l attend 
quarterly respi[INVESTIGATOR_650088], monthly 
nursing unit board 
meetings, and 
monthly ICU physician leadership meetings to educate staff about the study, solicit 
safety concerns and adverse events, and identify and address barriers to SpO 2 target 
compliance.  This approach to daily monitoring and intermittent feedback to clinical 
personnel successfully achieved 95% compliance with the assigned intervention in a 
prior cluster -crossover trial in the same ICU.38

7.2  Blinding :  Similar to prior SpO 2 target studies among critically ill adults29,30, 
patients and clinicians will not be blinded to study group assignment.  Observer bias will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_650222] [1] study personnel 
blinded to group assignment and [2] automated data extraction from the EHR (see Data 
Collection  below).  
 
 
7.3  Data Collection :  The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650090], exported daily from the institution’s EHR  into an Enterprise Data 
Warehouse, along with data from the patient registration, billing, and laboratory clinical 
information systems.  We have previously validated the quality of this method of data 
collection against the reference standard of two -physi cian manual chart review,[ADDRESS_871738] of three prior pragmatic trials.38,38,51

 Data elements collected manually by [CONTACT_650224]:  [1] all data 
elements for a randomly selected 10% of participants to ensure the quality o f 
electronically extracted data, [2] all primary and secondary outcomes collected at study 
termination for 100% of participants to ensure duplicate data collection of key study 
outcomes, and [3] any data elements for which electronic data extraction has no t been

8.0 Risks and Benefits:  
 
Among adult patients  for whom the treating clinicians have decided invasive 
mechanical ventilation is required, there are currently no established risks or benefits to  
targeting a higher, intermediate, or lower SpO 2.  At this time, there is no reason to 
believe that participation in this study would expose patients to greater medical risks or 
benefits than those experienced by [CONTACT_650226] a part of routine care.  The greater benefit of the study would be to 
society in the form of improved understanding of safe and effective provision of oxygen 
therapy during mechanical ventilation  for critically ill patients.  
 A potential risk to patients participating in this study in volves the collection of 
protected health information (PHI).  In order to limit the associated risks, the minimum 
amount of PHI necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data 
will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) o nly accessible by [CONTACT_473].  
After publication, a de -identified database will be generated to protect participant 
privacy.

9.0 Safety Monitoring and Adverse Events:  
 
9.[ADDRESS_871742], 
and a team of critical care physicians physically located on the study unit twenty -four 
hours a day.  As a part of routine care all patients will be receiving continuous invasive 
or non -invasive monitoring of heart rate , blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oxygen 
saturation.   
Study personnel will monitor compliance with the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, study protocol, and study safety measures daily.  Study personnel will be readily 
available to answer ques tions at any time from patients, legally authorized 
representatives, or treating clinicians.  If, at any point in a patient’s clinical course, the 
treating clinicians believe an SpO2 target different from the assigned target is required 
for the safe treatm ent of the patient, the SpO2 target will be modified to the target the 
treating clinicians judge to be safest.  
A structured plan for prospective collection of study outcomes has been 
specified,  in addition to a process by [CONTACT_650227] A dverse Events 
will be managed and reported as required to regulatory bodies.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to oversee the 
study. The DSMB will be available throughout the trial to monitor enrollment, protocol 
compliance, safet y, and adverse events.  Additionally the DSMB will perform an interim 
analysis for safety and efficacy.  
 
9.2 Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
A system has been established to report and track clinical outcomes and adv erse 
events (AEs). Study personnel will monitor  the safety of subjects and follow AEs until the 
event resolves or is explained.  
 
Clinical Outcomes (not considered Adverse Events). In this study of critically ill patients 
who are at high risk for death or o ther adverse outcomes due to their underlying c ritical 
illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be systematically 
tracked (collected in the case report form) and will be included as part of the analyses 
for this study. For th e purposes of reporting, death and organ dysfun ction will not be 
recorded as AEs unless the investigator believes the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_650228]. 
This approach —considering death and organ dysfunction as outc omes rather than AEs 
Principal Investigator s: Matt Semler            Version Date : 5/1/2018  
Study Title: Preliminary Investigation of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial  
Institution/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  18 
 and systemically tracking expected outcomes for analysis rather than solely recording 
individual AEs —is common in ICU trials because these outcomes/events occur 
commonly in the ICU and thi s system mandates that data regarding death, or gan 
dysfunction, and expected outcomes be tracked systematically for all patients and 
analyzed appropriately. Clinical outcomes will be systemically tracked throughout the 
study period. Listed below are events  that will be tracked as primary or secondary 
clinical outcomes and will not therefore be reported as AEs during this study (unless 
believed to be study related and more severe or prolonged than expected given the 
underlying critical illness):  
 
1. Death (all deaths occurring prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650092]);  
2. Recurrence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], including need for re -intubation or non -
invasive mechanical ventilation, presence of acute respi [INVESTIGATOR_13086], or presence of pneumo thorax;  
3. Circulatory failure, including cardiac arrest or shock with or without receipt of 
vasopressors;  
4. Incidence of sustained atrial and ventricular arrhythmias;  
5. Acute kidney injury, including leading to incr eased creatinine or receipt of renal 
replacemen t therapy;  
6. Hepatic injury or failure leading to increased bilirubin, AST, or ALT;  
7. Coagulation derangements leading to elevated PT/INR or PTT, DIC, 
thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis;  
8. Lactic acidosis;  
9. Delirium , disability, and physical or cognitive impairm ent believed to be newly 
acquired;  
10. All values for SpO 2, SaO 2, FiO 2, PaO 2, or PaO2/FiO2 ratio;  
11. All values for vital signs (e.g., temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO2);  
12. Receipt of co -interventions (e.g., net flui d balance, number of arterial blood 
gasses, red  cell transfusion)  
13. Duration of ICU admission, ICU readmission;  
14. Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715];  
15. Alterations in routine labs, including chemistries, complete blood counts, liver 
function tests , and hemostasis profiles.  
 
Adverse Event Class ifications . An Adverse Event (AE) will be any untoward medical 
occurrence for a patient enrolled in the trial that is not tracked as a clinical outcome, 
regardless of whether the event is considered study rela ted or not. All AEs occurring 
during the observ ational study period will be recorded on the CRF. All AEs will then be 
assessed as to whether they are (1) related to study procedures, (2) serious, and/or (3) 
unexpected according to the following definitions :

Study Title: Preliminary Investigation of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial  
Institution/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  19 
 I. Related to study procedures.  AEs that the in vestigator suspects are related to 
the study will be classified as study related. Certainty of relatedness is not 
required as long as a reasonable possibility exists that the AE is related to a study 
procedure . 
 
II. Serious.  AEs that meet any of the criteria b elow will be considered Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs):  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event and NOT an event that hyp othetically might have 
caused death if it would  have been more severe)  
c. Prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
e. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
f. Important medical event that requires an intervention to prevent any of a -e 
above.  
 
III. Unexpected.  AEs that are more severe or prolonged than expected based on the 
investigator’s discretion will be considered Unexpected.  
 
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650093], track, and report all Clinical Outcomes and AEs as required 
by [CONTACT_156740].  
 
Communic ation and Reporting of Adverse Events . In order to ensure proper and timely 
reporting of all adverse events, there will be a clear communication plan for all study 
personnel to follow. AEs will be recorded in the AE CRF in the electronic database and 
repor ted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_871743] a single interim analysis for efficacy and safety at the

conservative Haybitt le-Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be 
performed using an unchanged l evel of significance (P = 0.05).  Given the minimal risk 
nature of the study and current use of all SpO [ADDRESS_871745] (DSMB).   A formal independent DSMB will 
oversee the conduct of the trial and the planned int erim analysis.  The DSMB will be 
composed of at least one physician  outside the study institution experienced in the conduct 
of critical care clinical trials and  one biostatistical expert who will assist with study 
monitoring and performance of the interim  analysis.  
 
9.5 Data Monitoring Plan . To ensure data are accurately and completely collected 
during the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the study team will follow a specific Data M onitoring Plan. All 
clinical outcomes will be collected in duplicate by [CONTACT_650229].  All study data from random sample of 10% of study records will be 
collected in duplicate by [CONTACT_650230] t he study nurse.  Each of 
these records will also be reviewed annually by [CONTACT_650231], complete, and current.  The study biostatistician will run periodic 
data cleans throughout the study looking for outlie rs or overtly erroneous data. This 
Monitoring Plan will serve as a method for identifying and r esolving systematic 
problems and therefore increase data quality. We will submit progress reports to the 
local IRB annually, or more frequently if requested.  
 
 
10.0 Study Withdrawal /Discontinuation  
 
Patients can be withdrawn from study participation in the foll owing circumstances:  
• The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn for safety 
considerations.  
• There is a significant protocol violation in the j udgment of the PI.  
 
The reason and date of every withdrawal will be recorded in the patient stud y records.  
Follow -up will be performed for all patients who discontinue due to an adverse event or 
any other safety parameter.  Follow -up will also be performe d for all patients who end 
participation in the protocol for another reason, but who also have a n adverse event or 
other safety parameter that could have led to discontinuation.  Follow -up will be 
conducted until the condition has resolved, until diagnosis  of the adverse event or

11.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Power calculation .  In a prior cluster -randomized cluster -crossover trial in the same 
ICU,51 880 mechanicall y ventilated adults were enrolled per year (73.3 per month), with 
a median of 22 VFDs [IQR 0 -25 VFDs] and an intra -cluster intra -period correlation of 
0.01.  During the planned [ADDRESS_871747] an absolute 
reduction in VFDs of 2.0 da ys (similar to the numerical difference in VFDs between SpO 2 
target groups reported in prior studies29,30).

Institution/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  22 
  
Primary analysis .  The primary analysis will be a n intention -to-treat comparison of the 
number of VFDs experienced by [CONTACT_650232] –Wallis 
test.  Secondary analyses will include [1] intention -to-treat comparisons of the pre -
specified secondary outcomes between study group s; [2] intention -to-treat comparison 
of the SpO [ADDRESS_871748] to ventilator free days using a generalized linear 
mixed -effects model adjusting for fixed effects (age, sex, race, source of admission, 
vasopressor receipt, acute diagnosis) and ra ndom effects (study period) to account for 
intra -period correlation, and [3] examination of the differential effects of the 
intervention for patients with different baseline characteristics (heterogeneity of 
treatment effect) (see Figure below).   
 
All of secondary analyses will be considered hypothesis -generating, and no corrections 
for multiple comparisons will be performed.   No imputations will be made for missing 
baseline or on -study laboratory or physiologic data.   Continuous variables will be 
describe d as mean and standard deviation or median and 25th percentile – 75th 
percentile or bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals as appropriate.  Categorical 
variables will be given as number and percentage.  All between -group comparisons with 
continuous variable s will be performed using Kruskal –Wallis test s; categorical variables 
will be compared with chi -square testing or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.  A 
complete pre -specified statistical analysis plan will be published prior to the completion 
of enrollment . 
 
Interim Analysis  
 We will plan for the DSMB to conduct a single interim analysis for efficacy and 
safety at the anticipated halfway point of the trial.  The interim analysis will include 
patients enrolled during the first [ADDRESS_871749] oppi[INVESTIGATOR_650095] P value for the difference between groups is <0.001.  Use of 
the conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be 
performed using an unchanged lev el of significance (P = 0. 05).  Given the minimal risk 
nature o f the study and current use of all SpO [ADDRESS_871750] patient safety.  
 
             
12.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
At no time during the course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will 
patient identities be revealed in any manner.  The minimum necessary data containing 
patient or provider identities will be collected.  All patients will be assigned a unique 
study ID number for tracking.  Data collected from the medical record will be entered 
into the secure online dat abase R EDCap.  Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_650096] s: Matt Semler            Version Date : 5/1/2018

1.0 Study Summary  
 
Title: Pragmatic  Investigation of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial  
 
Background:   Mechanical ventilation of ICU patients universally involves titration o f the 
fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650067], however, the optimal SpO 2 target remains unknown .  Higher 
SpO 2 targets (96 -100%) provide a margin of safety against hypoxia but increa se 
exposure to hyperoxia.  Lower SpO 2 targets (88 -92%) minimize hyperoxia, but may  
increase the risk of hypoxia .  An intermediate SpO 2 target (92 -96%) may avoid the risks 
of both hyperoxia and hypoxia, or may expose patients intermittently to both sets of 
risks.  Current guidelines offer divergent recommendations as to the optimal SpO 2 target 
and clinical safety and efficacy data are lacking.  Therefore, w e propose a 2,250 -patient 
cluster -randomized cluster -crossover trial comparing a lower SpO 2 target ( target 9 0% 
and goal range 88 -92% ), an intermediate SpO 2 target ( target 94% and goal range 92 -
96% ), and a higher SpO 2 target ( target 98% and goal range 96 -100% ) with regard to the 
outcome of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation.   
 
Primary Aim : 
• To compare the effect of higher, intermediate, and lower SpO 2 targets on days 
alive an d free of invasive mechanical ventilation among mechanically ventilated 
critically ill adults.  
 
Primary Hypothes is: 
• Use of a lower SpO 2 target ( target 90% and goal range 88 -92% ) for mechanically 
ventilated ICU patients will result in more days alive and free of invasive 
mechanical ven tilation than use of an intermediate SpO 2 target ( target 94% and 
goal range 92 -96% ) or a higher SpO 2 target ( target 98% and goal range 96 -100% ). 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
• We will include adults (≥ 18 years old) receiving mechanical ventilation through 
an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy who are admitted to the study I CU or for 
whom admission to the study ICU from the emergency department is planned.   
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• We will exclude patients who are pregnant or who are prisoners.  
 
Consent : Because [1] the study enrolls only patients who would have been exposed to 
oxygen therapy as a part of clinical care outside of the study, [2] all SpO 2 targets  
examined are currentl y used in routine care in the study ICU, [3] no high -quality data 
suggest that the choice of SpO 2 target affects clinical outcomes, and [4] during the trial

Randomization:   In the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the entire study  ICU will be assigned to a single SpO 2 
target (cluster -randomized) and the ICU will switch between lowe r, intermediate, and 
higher SpO 2 targets every two months in a randomly generated sequence (cluster -
crossover) . 
 
Study Interventions:  
• Lower SpO 2 Target – FiO 2 will be titrated to a target SpO 2 of 90% with a goal 
range of 88-92% .   
• Intermediate SpO 2 Target – FiO 2 will be titrated to a target SpO 2 of 94% with a 
goal range of 92 -96% .   
• Higher SpO 2 Target – FiO [ADDRESS_871756]  to a target SpO 2 of 98% with a 
goal range of 96 -100%.  
 
Primary Outcome :   
• Ventilator -free days (VFDs) to study day 28, defined as the number of calendar 
days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation from the final receipt of 
invasive mechanical ventilatio n through 28 days after enrollment . 
 
Secondary  Outcome :   
• 28-day in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650105], defined as death from any cause  between 
enrollment and the first of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 28 days after enrollment.  
 
Exploratory Outcomes : 
• Exploratory  Clinical Outcomes : ICU mortality, vasopressor -free days, renal 
replacement therapy -free days,  ICU-free days,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l-free days . 
• Explora tory Organ Function Outcomes : daily non-respi[INVESTIGATOR_541805], 
creatinine, lactate, presence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], Stage II o r 
greater AKI by [CONTACT_104746] . 
• Exploratory  Safety Outcomes : Atrial arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia, ca rdiac  
arrest  with return of spontaneous circulation , pneumothorax  or 
pneumomediastinum , ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction

 2.0 Background  
 
Each year 2 -3 million intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive invasive mechanical 
ventilation,1–[ADDRESS_871757] of more than $20 billion dollars.4,5  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103281],6 in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650106] 25 -35%,7 and 
survivors often face cognitive, psychiatric, and  physical dysfunction.8–11   
 
Mechanical ventilation of ICU patie nts universally involves titration of the fraction of 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650071], however, the optimal SpO 2 target remains unknown.  Higher SpO 2 targets 
(96-100%) provide a margin of safety against hypoxemia, but may increase exposure to 
excess FiO 2, hyperoxemia, and tissue hyperoxia, causing oxidativ e damage,  12–14 
inflammation,15,16 and increased alveolar -capi[INVESTIGATOR_22425].17  Lower SpO 2 targets 
(88-92%) minimize hyperoxia,6,18,19 but may increase the risk of hypoxemia, tissue 
hypoxia, and organ dysfunction.20,21  An intermediate SpO 2 target (92 -96%) may avoid 
the risks of both hyperoxia and hypoxia, or, conversely, may expose patients 
intermittently to both sets of risks.   
 
Current guidelines offer dive rgent recommendations – ranging  from tolerating SpO 2 
values as low as 88% (ARDS Network)22,23 to pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98% (British 
Thoracic Society)24.  The relative risks and benefi ts of different SpO [ADDRESS_871758] been 
extensively examined in the setting of the neonatal ICU,25–[ADDRESS_871759] only been 
investigated in adult ICU patients in three small trials.29–[ADDRESS_871760] improved survival in the 
other two.   
 
In clinical practice, however, hyperoxemia remains common.32,33  In our r ecent 
observational study of 2,200 mechanically ven tilated ICU patients at 50 centers across 
the [LOCATION_002]  (see Figure) , 
the majority of patients had a 
lowest PaO [ADDRESS_871761] 
study day > 100 mm Hg (~SpO 2 
> 97%).  The wide variation in 
current p ractice (frequently 
favoring higher SpO 2 targets), 
conflicting guidelines, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_650072] [ADDRESS_871762] of SpO 2

  [ADDRESS_871763]  of SpO 2 targets during mechanical ventilation of 
critically ill adults on clinical outcomes, a randomized trial is needed.  
 
Study Aims:  
• Primary:  To compare the effect of higher, intermediate, and lower SpO 2 targets 
on days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation among mechanically 
ventilated cri tically ill adults.  
 
• Secondary:   
o To evaluate the effect of the same intervention in the same population 
on the pre-specified Secondary  Outcome  and on pre -specified Exploratory  
Clinical Outcomes , Exploratory  Organ Function Outcomes , and 
Exploratory  Safety O utcomes . 
o To evaluate the effect of the same intervention on days alive and free of 
invasive mechanical ventilation in clinically relevant pre -specified patient 
subgroups.  
 
Study Hypotheses:  
• Primary:  Use of a lower SpO 2 target ( target 90% and goal range 88 -92% ) for 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients will result in more days alive and free of 
invasive mechanical ventilation  (Primary Outcome ) than use of an intermediate 
SpO 2 target ( target 94% and goal range 92 -96% ) or a higher SpO 2 target ( target 
98% and g oal range 96 -100% ). 
 
• Secondary:  Use of a lower SpO 2 target ( target 90% and goal range 88 -92% ) for 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients will result in lower 28-day in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77087] ( Secondary Outcome ) than use of an intermediate SpO 2 target ( target 
94%  and goal range 92 -96% ) or a higher SpO 2 target ( target 98% and goal range 
96-100% ).

 6.4  Consent:   
All patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation i n an intensive care unit 
receive oxygen therapy titrated to maintain SpO 2 as a part of routine care.  In clinical 
practice, 98% of SpO 2 values experienced by [CONTACT_650218] 
88-100%.32,33  Within this range, current guidelines  for oxygen therapy in mechanically 
ventilated adults outline three contrasting approaches: [1] tolerating SpO2 values as low 
as 88% (NIH/NHLBI ARDS Network),22 [2] titrating wi thin the range 92 -96% (Thoracic 
Society of Australia and New Zealand),34 or [3] pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98% 
(British Thoracic Society).24  The lower SpO 2 target ( target 90% and goal range 88 -92% ), 
intermediate SpO 2 target ( target 94% and  goal range 92 -96% ), and higher SpO 2 target 
(target 98% and goal range 96 -100% ) examined in this study are all intermittently used 
in routine care in the study I CU and within the range recommended by [CONTACT_650234].  There are current ly no high -quality data to suggest that one 
SpO [ADDRESS_871765] to clinical outcomes.   Although there 
are no clear data to support the choice of SpO 2 target, during the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], treat ing 
clinicians  in the study ICU will be  allowed to change the  SpO 2 target at any point if it is  
felt to be required for the safe treatment a specific patient .   
Because  the interventions studied  [1] are used as part of routine care in the 
study ICU, [2] ar e interventions to which the patient wo uld be exposed  even if not 
participating in the study, [3] have no prior data to suggest the superiority of one 
approach over the other, and [4] are equivalent o ptions from the perspective of the 
treating cli nicians ( otherwise the tre ating clinician retain s control of SpO 2 target), we 
feel the study presents minimal risk.  
  Additionally, obtaining informed consent prior to participation in the study 
would be impra ctical.  Endotracheal intubation  and initiation  of mecha nical ventilation  
for critically  ill pa tients is frequently a time -sensitive procedure.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650076] a formal informed consent document for the endotracheal intubation and initiation 
of mechanical ventilation , time allows discussio n of risk s and benefits in  less t han 10% of 
airw ay management events in the study ICU .  The oxygen titration protocol used to 
target SpO [ADDRESS_871766] ri sk for hyperoxia and 
hypoxia.  Moreover, in this cluster -randomized trial, the entire ICU is assigned to a single 
SpO 2 target delivered by [CONTACT_8508]’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489] s through a unit-wide oxygen 
titration protocol.   Obtaining informed consent from  ever y eligible patient in  the ICU 
each day would be logistically infeasible and patients who declined to participate would 
need to be transferred between ICUs which might adversely impac t their care.  
 Because the study presents minima l risk, w ould not adversel y affect the welfare 
or privacy rights of the participant, and consent would be impracticable, we will request 
a waiver of informed consent.

  Although the study w ill be conducted with  waiv er of inform ed conse nt, we will 
implement  a process by [CONTACT_650235], familie s, or surrogate s may be made aware  of 
the study and receive investigator s’ contact [CONTACT_650236] y, ask questions, or express concerns.   An information sheet 
providing an IRB -approved lay language summary of the study ac tivities  and contain ing 
the contact [CONTACT_650237] s (who will remain available throughout the 
study period to provide a dditional information to patients and families upon request ) 
will be made available in the following manner : 
1. Throughout the study period, t he information sheet will be poste d 
in at least  two glass di splay case s, on e near the public entrance  to 
the medical ICU and o ne near the mid-point  of the medical ICU.  
2. Throughout the study period, t he information sheet will be 
included in the welcome packet of information about the medical  
ICU, which is  distributed  at the time of ICU admission  to available  
families  or su rrogates by [CONTACT_650238] o r charge nurse  
as a part of routin e clinical care .

6.6  Randomization:    
During ea ch two -month block of the study, t he ICU will be assigned to either a 
higher SpO 2 target ( target 98% and goal range 96 -100% ), an intermedi ate SpO 2 target 
(target 94% and goal range 92 -96% ), or a lower SpO 2 target ( target 90% and goal  range 
88-92% ).  The ord er of study group assignments will be  generated by [CONTACT_650241] [ADDRESS_871768] 7 days of each two -month block wil l be a washout period during which th e ICU 
will continue to target the assigned SpO 2 but new patients will not be included in the 
primary analysis .  Assuming a duration of mechanical ventilation similar to that 
observed for mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the study I CU in a prior  year 
(median 3 [IQR 3 -5] days), a 7 -day washout period will ensure that 98% patients do not 
experience a “crossover” from one assigned  SpO 2 target to another.  
 
   
7.0 Study  Procedures  
 
7.1       Study Interventions  
 
Choice of SpO 2 targets: In cli nical practic e, 98% of SpO 2 values experienced by 
[CONTACT_650218] 88 -100%.32,33  Within this range, current 
guidelines for oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated adults outline three contrasting 
approaches: [1] tolerating Sp O2 values as low as 88% (NIH/NHLBI ARDS Network),22 [2] 
titrating within the range 92 -96% (Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand),34 or 
Principal Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_650104]: 4/7/202 1

  11 
 [3] pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98% (British Thoracic Society).[ADDRESS_871769] three study groups, each emulating an app roach to SpO 2 targets represented in 
guidelines and clinical practice (Table).  
 
 
SpO 2 versus PaO 2:  SpO [ADDRESS_871770], PaO 2 is assessed via arter ial 
puncture intermittently and selectively, particularly among more severely ill patients 
earlier in their clinical course.  Similar to prior studies of oxygen therap y during 
mechanical ventilation29, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650111] 2 for all patients with 
functioning non -invasive pulse oximetry monitoring.  For patients in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650079] -invasive pulse oximetry monitor ing is unavailable (e.g., i nadequate 
plethysmography signal due to hypoperfusion), PaO 2 value s corresponding to the 
assigned SpO 2 target will be used to guide oxygen therapy ( see above Table).35 
 
Oxygen T itration :  In the study ED and ICU, and in the [LOCATION_002] generally, titration 
of Fi O2 to maintain Sp O2 for mechani cally ventil ated adults is most commonly 
performed by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_46175], with input from nurses and physicians .  Other 
aspects of mechanical ventilation (selection of tidal volume, titration of positive end -
expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111], screening for spontaneo us br eathing trials) are governed by 
[CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_650112].  In preparation for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], we collaborated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_650113] O2 to achieve each of the three 
study Sp O2 targets.    
 
Initiation of Mechanical Ventilation:   The study  protocol guides respi[INVESTIGATOR_650114] 2 to the target SpO 2 value within 15 minutes 
of the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the participating ED or ICU.  This initial 15-
minute window is intended to g ive the treating clinicians adequate time after emergent 
tracheal intubation to stabilize the patient’s hemodynamics and i nitiate basic ventilator 
settings, but also to intervene early enough to control the FiO 2 and SpO 2 during the

  [ADDRESS_871771] common.   
 
Oxygen Titration during Mechanical  Ventilation:   SpO [ADDRESS_871772] managing the patient’s ventilator will t arget 
an SpO 2 value of 98% in t he higher Sp O2 group, 94% i n the intermediate SpO 2 group, and 
90% in the lower SpO [ADDRESS_871773] will titrate FiO 2 as directed by 
[CONTACT_650220] 2 values are outside of the range 96 -100% in the 
higher SpO 2 group, 92 -96% in the intermediate  SpO 2 group, and 88 -92% in the lower 
SpO 2 group.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_650115] O2 
when Sp O2 values are not outside the range considered to be at  goal in order to achieve 
SpO2 values closer to the assigned Sp O2 target, to facilitate weaning from mechanical 
ventilation, or for oth er clinical reasons.  SpO 2 will be r eassessed 5 minutes after each 
change in FiO 2 or sooner if clinically indicated .  Study protocol determines the Sp O2 
target from enrollment until the firs t of: (1) extubation from i nvasive mechanical 
ventilation, (2) tra nsfer out of a participating study location, (3) completion of an Sp O2 
target modification sheet by [CONTACT_274408], or (4) end of the two -month study 
period.  Study protocol does not de termine the Sp O2 target  du ring time -periods in 
which the patient is not physically located in a study location (e.g., during transport) or 
when Fi O2 is not being titrated to achieve an Sp O2 target (e.g., when an Fi O2 of 1.0 is 
being administered for a pro cedure).  
 
Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation:   Each day of mec hanical ventilation, all patien ts 
in the study ICU are assessed for safety of a spontaneous awakening trial (SAT) and 
spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)[ADDRESS_871774] passed an S AT 
and S BT, the deci sion to discontinue invasive mechanical ventilation will be made b y the 
treating clinicians.  
 
Modification of SpO 2 Targets: At any time during the course of the study, if a tre ating 
clinician  or a p atient, family member, or surrogate feels an SpO 2 target o ther than that 
assigned by [CONTACT_650242] a specific patient, the SpO 2 
target for that patient may be modified.  To modify the target, the supervising physician 
will complete a one -page  SpO 2 target modif ication sheet docume nting the rationale for 
modifying the target .  Details of each SpO 2 target modification will be collected and

 monitored.  I n our prior cluster -crossover trial us ing the same approach to modification 
of therapy assignment, treating clinicians exercised the ability to modify the assigned 
therapy for < 5% of patients.[ADDRESS_871775] to override 
the assig ned Sp O2 target include:  
• pneumothorax  
• pneumomediastinum  
• carbon monoxide poisoning  
• deco mpression sickness  
• bleomycin toxicity  
• paraquat toxicity  
 
SpO 2 Moni toring:  For all mechanically ventilated patients in the study IC U, SpO 2 is 
continuously monit ored using Nellcor™ SpO ₂ Adhesive Sensors (Medtronic, Minneapolis, 
MN), which measure changes in  red and infrared light absorption in an arteriolar bed 
throughout the pulse cycle to report a non -normalized real -time plethysmographic 
waveform and arterial h emoglobin saturation va lues averaged over the prior 6 seconds 
with a mean difference between SpO 2 and SaO 2 < 2% for SpO 2 values 80 -100%.39  
Plethysmography and SpO 2 values are displayed [1] on IntelliVue MP90 bedside patient 
monitors (PHILIPS, Amsterdam, Netherlands) in each ICU room, [2] on telemetry 
monitors located at ICU nursin g stations and ad jacent  to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_650086], 
and [3] in real -time in the ins titutional EHR, available from any physical location.  SpO 2 
values are archived every 60 seconds into an intuitional data warehouse.40,41  Collecting 
SpO 2 values every 6 0 seco nds will allow the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650116], severity, and duration of desaturation than prior trials in which SpO 2 
values were collected every 4 -24 hours.29,30 
 
Feedback on SpO 2 Target Adherence: [1] During the study, the IntelliVue MP90 bedside 
patient monitors in  each room will be  set to generate an alarm for SpO2 values outside 
the range considered to be at goal for the assigned SpO2 ta rget group.  For example, for 
patients in the intermediate SpO2 target group, SpO2 val ues 92 -96% generate no alarm, 
whereas SpO2 values ≤ 91% or ≥ 97% generate an alarm alerting nursing staff and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_650117] -of-range value .  [2] Study personnel will remotely 
monitor SpO 2 values every four hour s from 4 AM through 10 PM Mon day through Friday 
and during a 10% sample of night and weekend hours to identify instances of l ag 
between out of range SpO 2 values and FiO 2 titration, provide feedback and 
reinforcement to bedside nurses and respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], and identify any barrie rs to 
SpO 2 target compliance.  [3] Study pe rsonnel wil l attend respi[INVESTIGATOR_650118], nursing unit board meetings, and ICU physician leadership meetings to 
educate staff about the study, solicit safety concerns and adverse events, and identify  
and address barriers to SpO 2 target compli ance.  This approach to daily monitoring and

spontaneous breathing tri als (SBT).36,37 
 
7.2  Blinding :  Similar to  prior SpO 2 target studies among critically  ill adults29,30, 
patients and clinicians will not be blinded to study group assignment.  Observer bias will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_650222] [1] study personnel 
blinded  to group assignment and [2] automated data extraction fro m the EHR (see Data 
Collection  below).  
 
7.3  Data Colle ction :  The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650090], exported daily from the institution’s EHR into an Enterprise Data 
Warehouse, along with data from the pati ent registration, billing, and laboratory clinical 
information systems.  We have previously validated the quality of this method of data

  [ADDRESS_871780] ed health information (PHI).   In order to limit the associated risks, the minimum 
amount of PHI necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After collection, the data 
will be stored in a secure online database (REDCap) o nly accessible by [CONTACT_650244].  
After publication, a d e-identified database will be generated to protect participant 
privacy.

and a team of critical care physicians physically located on the study unit twenty -four 
hours a day.  As a part of routine care all patients will be receiving continuous invasive 
or non -invasive monitoring of heart rate , blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_98157], and oxygen 
saturation.   
Study personnel will monitor compliance with the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, study protocol, and study safety measures daily.  Study personnel will be readily 
available to answer ques tions at any time from patients,  legally authorized 
represen tatives, or treating clinicians.  If, at any point in a patient’s clinical course, the 
treating clinicians believe an Sp O2 target different from the assigned target is required 
for the safe treatm ent of the patient, the Sp O2 target will be modified to the target the 
treating clinicians judge to be safest.  
A structured plan for prospective collection of study outcomes has been 
specified,  in addition to a process by [CONTACT_650227] A dverse Events 
will be managed an d reported as required to re gulatory bodies.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to oversee the 
study. The DSMB will be available throughout the trial to monitor enrollment, protocol 
compliance, safet y, and adverse events.  Addition ally the DSMB will perform a n interim 
analysis for safety and efficacy.  
 
9.2 Adverse Event  Reporting

 A system has been established to report and track clinical outcomes and adverse 
events (AEs). Study personnel will monitor  the safety of subjects and foll ow AEs until the 
event resol ves or is explained.  
 
Clinical Outcomes (not considered Adverse Events) . In this study of critically ill patients 
who are at high risk for death or other adverse outcomes due to their underlying c ritical 
illness, clinical outcom es, including death and orga n dysfunction, will be systematically 
tracked (collected in the case report form) and will be included as part of the analyses 
for this study. For the purposes of reporting, death and organ dysfun ction will not be 
recorded as AE s unless the investigator be lieves the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_650228]. 
This approach —considering death and organ dysfunction as outc omes rather than AEs 
and systemi cally tracking expected outc omes for analysis rather than solely recording 
individual AEs —is common in ICU trials because these outcomes/events occur 
commonly in the ICU and this system mandates that data regarding death, or gan 
dysfunction, and expected ou tcomes be tracked systematic ally for all patients and 
analyzed appropriately. Clinical outcomes will be systemically tracked throughout the 
study period. Listed below are events that will be tracked as primary , secondary , or 
exploratory  clinical outcomes a nd will not therefore be rep orted as AEs during this study 
(unless believed to be study related and more severe or prolonged than expected given 
the underlying critical illness):  
 
1. Death (all deaths occurring prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650092]);  
2. Recurrence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], including need for re -intubation or non -
invasive mechanical ventilation, presence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086], or presence of pneumo thorax  or pneumome diastinum ; 
3. Circulatory failu re, including cardiac arrest or shock with or without receipt of 
vasopressors;  
4. Incidence of sustained atrial and ventricular arrhythmias;  
5. Acute kidney injury, including leading to increased creatinine or receipt of renal

Adverse Event Class ifications . An A dverse Event (AE) will be an y untoward medical 
occurrence for a patient enrolled in the trial that is not tracked as a clinical outcome, 
regardless of whether the event is considered study related or not. All AEs occurring 
during the observ ational study pe riod will be recorded on the  CRF. All AEs will then be 
assessed as to whether they are (1) related to study procedures, (2) serious, and/or (3) 
unexpected according to the following definitions:  
 
I. Related to study procedures.  AEs that the in vestigator suspe cts are related to 
the study  will be classified as study related. Certainty of relatedness is not 
required as long as a reasonable possibility exists that the AE is related to a study 
procedure.  
 
II. Serious.  AEs that meet any of the criteria b elow will be con sidered Serious 
Adverse Even ts (SAEs):  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event and NOT an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it would  have been more severe)  
c. Prolongs an existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
e. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
f. Important medical event that requires an intervention to prevent any of a -e 
above.  
 
III. Unexpected.  AEs t hat are more severe or prolo nged than expected based on the 
investigator’s discretion will be considered Unexpected.  
 
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650093], track, and report all Clinical Outcomes and AEs as required 
by [CONTACT_156740].  
 
Communic ation and Report ing of Adverse Events . In or der to ensure proper and timely 
reporting of all adverse events, there will be a clear communication plan for all study 
personnel to follow. AEs will be recorded in the AE CRF in the electronic database and 
repor ted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_231067] 5 days of occurrence. T he PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a report of all AEs 
annually to the IRB and DSMB as part of the annual review process as required. All SAEs 
will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours of occurrence. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318], in turn, repor t all 
SAEs to th e IRB, DSMB, and funding bod y within 7 calendar days of occurrence.

conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be 
performed using an unchanged l evel of sig nificance (P = 0.05).  Given  the minimal risk 
nature of the study and current use of all SpO [ADDRESS_871783] (DSMB).   A formal independent DSMB will 
oversee the conduct of the trial and the planned int erim analys is.  The DSMB will be 
compos ed of at least one physician  outside the study institution experienced in the 
conduct of critical care clinical trials and one biostatistical  expert who will assist with 
study monitoring and performance of the interim  analysis.  
 
9.5 Data Monitoring Plan . To ensure data are accurately and completely collected 
during the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the study team will follow a specific Data Monitoring Plan. All 
clinical outcomes will be collected in duplicate by [CONTACT_650245] d by 
[CONTACT_74309].  All s tudy data from random sample of 10% of study records will be 
collected in duplicate by [CONTACT_650246].  Each of 
these records will also be reviewed annually by [CONTACT_650247] e data 
collection is accurat e, complete, and current.  The study biostatistician will run periodic 
data cleans throughout the study looking for outliers or overtly erroneous data. This 
Monitoring Plan will serve as a method for identifying and r esolving sy stematic 
problems and theref ore increase data quality. We will submit progress reports to the 
local IRB annually, or more frequently if requested.

Patients can be withdrawn from study participation in the foll owing circu mstances:  
• The investigator d ecides that the patient should be withdrawn for safety 
considerations.  
• There is a significant protocol violation in the judgment of the PI.  
 
The reason and date of every withdrawal will be recorded in the patient stud y records.  
Follow -up will be performed  for all patients who discontinue due to an adverse event or 
any other safety parameter.  Follow -up will also be performed for all patients who end 
participation in the protocol for another reason, but who also have a n adverse e vent or 
other safety paramet er that could have led to discontinuation.  Follow -up will be 
conducted until the condition has resolved, until diagnosis of the adverse event or 
safety parameter is deemed chronic and stable, or as long as clinically  appropriat e.  This 
follow -up will be d ocumented in the patient study record as well.   
 
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Power calculation .   
In a prior cluster -randomized cluster -crossover trial in the same ICU,51 880 
mechanically ventilated adults were enrolled per year (73.3 per month), with a median 
of 22 VF Ds [IQR 0 -25 VFDs] and an in tra-cluster intra -period correlation of 0.01.  During 
the planned [ADDRESS_871784] an absolute difference  between groups  in VFDs of 2.0 da ys 
(similar to the numerical difference in VFDs between SpO 2 target groups reported in 
prior studies29,30). 
 
Primary analysis  of the Primary Outcome .   
The primary analysis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary 
outcome of VFD s between the higher, intermediate, and lower SpO2 target groups 
among all patients enrolled in the trial except [1] those admitted during one of the 7 -
day washout periods and [2] those with a laboratory -confirmed diagnosis of  Coro navirus 
disease 2019 ( COV ID-19).  We will use a proportional odds model with independent 
covariates of group assignment (higher, intermediate, or lower SpO2 target) and time .  
Time (in days) will be treated as a continuous variable with values ranging from 1 (first 
day of enrollme nt) to 1,097 (final day of enrollment) and will be analyzed using 
restricted cubic splines with multiple knots to allow for non -linearity resulting f rom 
seasonality or secular trends.  For the purposes of declaring a statistically significant 
Principal Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_650104]: 4/7/202 1 
Study Title: Pragmatic Investigation of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) Trial   
Institution : Vanderb ilt Un iversity Medical Center  
 
  [ADDRESS_871785] from the proportional odds model and a two -sided P value of 0.05 .  In addi tion to 
the overall comparison of the three study groups, we will perform pair -wise 
comparisons between the lower and intermediate groups, lower and higher groups, and 
intermediate and higher groups using the same statistical approach.  
 
Sensitivity Anal yses of the Primary Outcome  
• We will repeat the primary analysis using alternative statistical approaches to  
comparing the VFDs outcome between groups.  These statistical approaches will 
include:  
o zero -inflated Poisson regression;  
o zero -inflated negative binomial regression;  
o global ran k scale analysis (see Supplementary Appendix) ; and  
o Fine and Gray competing risk  regression in which extubation from 
invasive mechanical ventilation is the event of interest and mortality is a 
competing event.  
• We will repeat the primary analysis with a djustment for pre -specified baseline 
covariates .   
• We will repeat the primary analys is replacing the continuous covariate of time 
with a categorical covariate of season defined as: winter (Januar y, February, 
March); spring (April, May, June); summer (July, August, September); and  fall 
(October, November, December).  
• We will repeat the prim ary analysis among all patients enrolled in the trial, 
including [1] patients initiated on invasive mechanical ventilation in a study 
location during one of the pre -specified 7 -day washout periods and [2] patients 
with a diagnos is of COVID -19 (estimated sa mple size of 3,000 patients) . 
 
Analysis of Effect Modification for the Primary Outcome . 
We will examine whether pre -specified baseline variables modify t he effect of 
study group on the primary ou tcome using formal tests of statistical interaction in a 
proportional odds model.  Independent variables will include study group assignment, 
the potential effect modifier of interest, and the interaction between t he two (e.g., 
study group * presence of se psis or septic shock) and time.  Significance will be 
determined by [CONTACT_941] P value for the interaction term, with values less than 0.[ADDRESS_871786] of 
study group on the primary outcome:  
• Age (continuous variable);  
• Race and ethnicity (Hispanic, Non -Hispanic Black, Non -Hispanic White, Other);  
• Source of admission to the ICU (ED, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494] , another ICU in the study 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  operating room, outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]);

 • Durati on of invasive mechanical ventilation prior to enrollment (0 minutes; 1 to 
360 minutes; >360 minutes);  
• Chronic comorbidities (categories are not mutually exclusive)  
o Receipt of su pplemental oxygen at place of reside nce prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517] (yes, no);  
o Coronary artery disease or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(yes, no);  
• Acute diagnoses at enrollment (categories are not mutually exclusive)  
o cardiac arrest (yes, no) ; 
o acute myocardial infarction ( yes, no);  
o sepsis or septic shock (yes, no);  
o acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (yes, no);  
• Receipt of vasopressors at enrollment (yes, no);  
• Non -respi[INVESTIGATOR_650123] (continuous variable) ; 
• Time period (before t he COVID -19 pandemic [July 2018 - December 2019], 
during the COVID -19 pandemic [January 2020 – August 2021]).  
 
Analysis of the Secondary Outcome  
 The sole pre -specified secondary outcome of [ADDRESS_871787] udy groups in an intention -to-treat fashion in the 
primary analysis population using a logistic regression model with independent 
covariates of group assignment ( higher, intermediate, or lower SpO2 target) and  time.  
We also will perform pair -wise comparis ons between the lower and intermediate 
groups, lower and higher groups, and intermediate and higher groups using the same 
statistical approach.  
 
Analysis of the Exploratory Outcomes  
Each of the exploratory out comes will be compared between groups in an 
intention -to-treat fashion in the primary analysis population.  Continuous outcomes will 
be compared between groups using a proportional odds model with independent 
covariates of group assignment (higher, interme diate, or lower SpO2 target) and time.  
Categor ical outcomes will be compared between groups using a logistic regression 
model with independent covariates of group assignment (higher, intermed iate, or lower 
SpO2 target) and time.  
 
Corrections for multiple testing  
We have pre -specified a single primary outcome and a single secondary 
outcome.  Consistent with recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration  and 
the European Medicines Asso ciation , each will be tested using a two -sided p -value with 
a signifi cance level of 0.05.  For all other analyses, e mphasis will be placed on the 
estimate of effect size with 95% confidence intervals, as recommended by [CONTACT_1268] : [INVESTIGATOR_650104]: 4/7/202 1

  [ADDRESS_871788] 18 months of the trial.   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650095] P value for the difference between groups is <0.001  using a 
proportional odds model with independent covariates of group assignment (higher, 
intermediate , or lower SpO2 targe t) and time  with regard to  the primary outcome of 
VFDs .  Use of the conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final 
analysis to be performed using an unchanged lev el of signi ficance (P = 0.05).  Given the 
minimal risk nature o f the study and current use of all  SpO [ADDRESS_871789] patient safety.  
 If the 18 -month interim analysis reveals an enrollment indicative of <80% 
statistical power at completion, we will ask the DSMB to approve ext ending enrollment 
of the study to ensur e the trial is not underpowered to detect the p lanned difference 
between groups in the primary outcome.

 ARTICLE SUMMARY  
Strengths and limitations of this study  
• This ongoing pragmatic trial will provide inf ormation on the optimal oxygen 
saturation target during invasive mechanical ventilation of critically ill adults  – 
informing a common therapy in current clinical practice for which there is limited 
available evidence on which to base care  
• Broad inclusion criteria will increase generalizability and the sample size will 
allow  examin ation of  important patient subgroups  
• The trial is being conducted at a single center  
• The nature of the study intervention does not allow blinding  
• Decisions regarding oxygen administration before and after invasive mechanical 
ventilation are deferred to treating clinicians

 INTRODUCTION  
Each year 2 -3 million intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive invasive 
mechanical ventilation [1–3].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650135] -protective ventilation  [4], 
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650136] 25 -35% [5].   
Mechanical ventilatio n for ICU patients universally involves titrati ng the fraction of 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2) within a goal range .  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650137], however, the optimal SpO 2 target remains unknown.  
Higher SpO 2 targets (96 -100%) provide a margin of safety against hypoxemia, but may 
increase exposure to excess FiO 2, hyperoxemia, and tissue hyperoxia, causing 
oxidative damage [6–8], inflammation [9,10] , and increased alveo lar-capi[INVESTIGATOR_370097] [11].  Lower SpO 2 targets (88 -92%) minimize exposure to excess FiO 2, 
hyperoxemia, and tissue hyperoxia [4,12,13] , but may increase the risk of hypoxemia  
and tissue hypoxia [14,15] .  An intermediate SpO 2 target (92 -96%) may avoid the risk s 
of both hyperoxia and hypoxia or, conversely, may expose patients intermittently to both 
sets of risks  [16,17] . 
The relative risks and benefits of different SpO [ADDRESS_871799] been 
extensively examined in the setting of the neonatal ICU [18–21] and have been 
examined  among  adult ICU patients in a series of recently -published clinical  trials [22–
27].  Together, these trials have suggested that both higher and lower oxygenation 
targets are safe – although some trials have potentially suggested  better outcomes with 
higher targets [25] and other trials have suggested potentially  better outcomes with lower 
targets [24]. 
 
5 
 Given the still incomplete  evidence from randomized trials, c urrent guidelines 
offer divergent recommendations – ranging from tolerating SpO 2 values as low as 88%  
[28–30] to pursuing SpO 2 values as high as 98%  [31].  In clinical practice , hyperoxemia 
remains common  [32,33] , even among patients care d for by [CONTACT_650252] -identify 
as avoiding high oxygen levels [34].   
The wide variation in current practice, conflicting guidelines, and conflicting data 
from some available  trials indicate the need for further clinical  trials to determine  the 
effect of SpO 2 target on patient outcomes  [12,35] .  We designed the Pragmatic 
Investigation of optima L Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial to examine  the effects of higher, 
intermediate, and lower SpO2 targets on the number of days alive and free of invasive 
mechanical ventilation among mechanically ventilated ICU patients.

Study Design  
 The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650139] a prospective, unblinded, pragmatic, cluster -crossover trial 
being conducted in the emergency department and medical ICU at Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center in Nashville, TN, [LOCATION_003] .  PI[INVESTIGATOR_650134] a lower SpO 2 target 
(target 90% and goal range 88 -92%), an intermediate SpO 2 target ( target 94% and goal 
range 92 -96%), and a higher SpO 2 target ( target 98% and goal range 96 -100%) with 
regard to the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation among 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients.   Consistent with the concept of a pragmatic 
clinical trial [37], the eligibility criteria are broad , the delivery of the intervention is  
embed ded in routine clinical care and executed by [CONTACT_261571] , and data 
collection prioritizes clinical outcomes over mechanistic evaluation .  The trial was 
approved by [CONTACT_650253] (IRB) 
(IRB 171272 ). The trial is investigator -initiated with funding provided by [CONTACT_650254], Lung, and Blood Institute (K23HL143053).  The trial protocol  was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov on May 25, 2018 prior to initiation of patient enrollment on July 1, 
2018 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
 
Patient and Public Involvement  
Materials used to communicate about  the study with patients and famil ies were 
developed with input from the Vanderbilt Community Engaged Research Core  and the 
Vanderbilt Community Advisory Council.   
 
7 
 Study Site and Population  
The trial is being conducted in the adult emergency department  (ED) and medical 
ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  
 
The inclusion criteria are:  
1. Age ≥ 18 years  
2. Receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy  
3. Admitted to the study ICU or admission to the study ICU from the ED is planned  
 
The exclusion criteria are:  
1. Known pregnancy or beta hCG  level greater than the laboratory upper limit of 
normal in a patient capable of becoming pregnant  (if measured clinically)  
2. Known to be a prisoner  
 
Adults located in the study ICU or for whom admission to the study ICU from the 
ED is planned who meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria are 
enrolled immediately upon receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in a study location.  
The time of enrollment for the trial (“time zero”) is the time of first receipt of invasive 
mechanical ventilation in a participating study location.  
 
Randomization and Treatment Allocation  
For each of the 18 two-month block s during the  36 months of enrollment  in the  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the medical ICU is assigned to a single SpO 2 target  (cluster -level 
8 
 allocation).   Every two months, t he ICU will switch between use of a lower SpO 2 target 
(target 90% and goal range 88 -92%), use of an intermediate SpO 2 target (target 94% 
and goal range 92 -96%), and use of a higher SpO 2 target (target 98% and goal range 
96-100%)  in a randomly generated sequence  (cluster -level crossover)  (Figure 2).  The 
order of study group assignments for each two -month block was generated by 
[CONTACT_650255] [ADDRESS_871800] of 
seasonal variation  and temporal changes .  For the 36 months of enrollment in the  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068] , patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED for whom 
admission to the medical ICU is planned will receive the same SpO 2 target assigned to 
the medical ICU. The study did not enroll in April and May of 2020 due to disruptions in 
research and c linical care from  the Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) 
pandemic  (Figure 2) .   
 
Washout Periods  
The last 7 days of each two -month block are considered a n analytic  washout 
period during which the ICU continues to target the assigned SpO 2 but data from new 
patients are not included in the primary analysis.  Assuming a median duration of 
mechanical ventilation of 3 [IQR 3 -5] days, a 7 -day washout period will ensure th at 98% 
patients in the primary analysis do not experience a “crossover” from a period assigned 
to one assigned SpO 2 target to  a period assigned to  another  SpO 2 target .  Data from 
patients admitted during washout periods will be included in a pre -specified sensitivity 
analysis (see Statistical Analysis  section) .  Any patient who does remain mechanically 
ventilated in the study ICU through  a crossover from a period assigned to one  SpO 2 
9 
 target to a period assigned to another SpO 2 target will be analyzed in the SpO 2 target 
group to which the ICU was assigned at the time of the patient’s enrollment in the trial 
(intention -to-treat analysis).  
 
Study Interventions  
Choice of SpO 2 targets  
In clinical practice, 98% of SpO 2 values experienced by [CONTACT_650256] 88 -100%  [32,33] .  Within this range, current guidelines for oxygen 
therapy in mechanically ventilated adults outline three contrasting approaches: (1) 
allowing the lower end of the range of acceptable SpO 2 values to be as low as 88%  
[28,29]  to avoid excess FiO 2, hyperoxemia, and hyperoxia; (2) titrating within an 
intermediate  range  of SpO 2 values, such as  92-96% [38]; or (3) targeting  higher SpO 2 to 
avoid the risks of hypoxemia and hypoxia  [31].  The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650140], 
each emulating a  different  approach to SpO 2 targets represented in guidelines and 
clinical practice (Table  1).   
 
Oxygen Titration  
In the study ED and ICU, titration of FiO [ADDRESS_871801] 
managing the patient’s ventilator  to target an SpO 2 value of 90% in the lower SpO 2 
target group, an SpO 2 value of 94% in the intermediate SpO 2 target group, and an SpO 2 
value of 98% in the higher SpO 2 target group  (Table 1) .  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489] s and 
other treating clinicians titrate FiO [ADDRESS_871802] of: (1) 
discontinuation of  invasive mechanical ventilation, (2) transfer out of a participating 
study location, (3) completion of an SpO 2 target modification sheet by [CONTACT_274408], 
or (4) end of the two -month study period .  The protocol does not determine the SpO 2 
target  during time-periods in which the patient is not physically located in a study 
location (e.g., during transport) or when FiO 2 is being administered for purposes other 
than achieving a target SpO 2 (e.g., when an FiO 2 of 1.0 is being administered for a 
procedure ).   
At any time, if a treating clinician or a patient, family member, or surrogate feels 
that an SpO [ADDRESS_871803] and supervising physician complete a one -
11 
 page SpO 2 target modification sheet documenting the  new SpO 2 target and  the 
rationale for modifying the target.  Examples of con ditions for which t he assigned SpO 2 
target  may be modified  that were specified in the initial trial protocol include d: 
pneumothorax; pneumomediastinum;  carbon monoxide poisoning; decompression 
sickness; bleomycin toxicity; paraquat toxicity .  Examples of conditions for which the 
assigned SpO 2 target  may be modified that were not explicitly specified in the initial trial 
protocol include: severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]; severe anemia; status post lung transplantation; and 
receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.  Trial protocol directs only the 
titration of FiO 2 to the assigned SpO 2 target.  Other aspects of invasive mechanical 
ventilation, such as tidal volume  [4], positive en d-expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111]  [39,40] , and use of 
rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_650141], are determined by [CONTACT_650257] (see sections 9-17 of supplemental file 1 ). 
 
Blinding  
Similar to prior studies of SpO 2 target s among critically ill adults  [22,24,26] , 
patients and clinicians will not be blinded to study group assignment.  
 
Data Collection  
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_650142] : 
(1) manual data collection by [CONTACT_509520] (2) automated collection of structured 
data recorded  in routine clinical care, exported daily from the institution’s electronic 
health record and patient registration, billing, and laboratory clinical information systems  
[ADDRESS_871804] of two -physi cian 
manual chart review  [41] and have employed this approach for the conduct of prior 
pragmatic trials  [42,43] .  Data are stored, curated, and secured in REDCap  [44].   
 
Outcomes  
Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome is v entilator -free days (VFDs) to study day 28 .  VFDs will 
be defined as the number of whole calendar days alive and free of  invasive mechanical 
ventilation beginning at midnight on the day of  the final receipt of invasive mechanical 
ventilation through day 28 after enrollment [45,46] .  Outcome ascertainment will cease 
at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] [ADDRESS_871805] of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767]  28 
days after enrollment.  
 
Exploratory Clinical Outcomes

Statistical Analysis and Reporting  
Sample Size Estimation  and Power Calculation  
15 
 In a prior cluster -randomized cluster -crossover trial in the same ICU  [51], 880 
mechanically ventilated adults were enrolled per year (73.3 per mon th), with a median 
of 22 VFDs [IQR 0 -25 VFDs] and an intra -cluster intra -period correlation of 0.01.  We 
estimate 2,[ADDRESS_871806] an absolute reduction in VFDs of 2.0 
days (similar to the numerical difference in VFDs between SpO 2 target groups reported 
in prior studies  [22,24] ). 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board and Interim Analysis  
An independent  Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversee s the trial .  
On March 23, [ADDRESS_871807] point of the trial and recommended the trial continue without 
modification  (see DSMB charter in online supplemental file 2 and details of interim 
analysis in supplemental file 1, section 22 ).  The DSMB is composed of two physicians  
outside the study institution  with expertise in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine  
clinical practice and clinic al research , one bioethicist , and one biostatistician.   
 
Statistical Analysis Principles  
16 
 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for 
analyses. Analyses will be conducted at the level of an individual patient during an 
individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650145] -to-treat fashion , unless otherwise specified. 
Continuo us variables will be reported as mean ± SD or median and IQR; categorical 
variables will be reported as frequencies and proportions.   
 
Main  Analysis of the Primary Outcome  
The main  analysis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary 
outcome of VFDs between the higher, intermediate, and lower SpO 2 target groups  
among all patients enrolled in the trial except  [1] those  admitted during one of the 7 -day 
washout periods  and [2] those with a laboratory -confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19.  
Patients with a diagnosis of COVID -[ADDRESS_871808] received significant exposure to the SpO 2 target 
intervention in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068].  Patient s enrolled during washout periods and patients 
diagnosed with COVID-19 will be included in sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity 
Analys es below) .  
It is possible to estimate a conditional effect, which is interpreted as the effect of 
a given SpO [ADDRESS_871809] of 
implementing a given SpO 2 target as a general policy [52]. Since an SpO [ADDRESS_871810], we  will use a proportional odds model with 
independent covariates of group assignment  (higher, intermediate, or lower SpO 2 
target)  and time [53,54] .  Time (in days) will be treated as a continuous variable with 
values ranging from 1 (first day of enrollment) to 1,097 (final day of enrollment) and will 
be analyzed using restricted cubic splines with multiple knots to allow for non -linearity 
resulting from seasonality or secular trends.   For the purposes of declaring a statistically 
significant difference between groups in  the primary endpoint, we will consider the 
conditional effect from the proportional odds model  and a  two-sided P value of 0.05.  
To es timate the marginal effect, we will use generalized estimating equation s 
(GEE) with study period as the cluster and an independent variable for group 
assignment (higher, intermediate, or lower SpO 2 target).  
For both approaches, in addition to assessing for an overall group effect within 
the model, we will estimate the differences between each pair of SpO 2 targets by 
[CONTACT_121698] 95% confidence intervals  from the model . 
 
Sensitivity  Analyses of the Primary Outco me 
• We will repeat the primary analysis using alternative statistical approaches to 
compar ing the VFDs outcome between groups  such as zero-inflated Poisson 
18 
 regression  or zero-inflated negative binomial regression , global rank scale 
analysis [55], and Fine and Gray competing risk regressi on. 
• We will repeat the primary analysis with adjustment for pre -specified baseline 
covariates  of age, sex, race  and ethnicity , source of ICU admission, vasopressor 
receipt, and acute diagnoses at enrollment, and severity of illness as assessed 
by [CONTACT_11339] -respi[INVESTIGATOR_541805].  
• We will repeat the primary analysis replacing the continuous covariate of time 
with a categorical covariate of season defined as: winter (January, February, 
March); spring (April, May, June); summer (July, August, September); and fall 
(October, November, December) . 
• We will repeat the primary analysis  among  all patients enrolled in the trial, 
including [1] patients  initiated on invasive mechanical ventilation  in a study 
location  during one of the pre-specified 7 -day washout periods  and [2] patients 
with a diagnosis of COVID -19. 
 
Analysis of Effect Modification for the Primary Outcome  
We will examine whether pre -specified baseline variables modify the effect of 
study group on the primary outcome using formal tests of statistical interaction in a  
proportional odds model .  Independent variables will include study group assignment, 
the pot ential effect modifier of interest, and the interaction between the two (e.g., study 
group * presence of sepsis or septic shock)  and time .  Significance will be determined 
by [CONTACT_941] P value for the interaction term, with values less than 0.[ADDRESS_871811] of 
study group on the primary outcome:  
1. Age; 
2. Race and ethnicity (Hispanic, Non -Hispanic  Black, Non -Hispanic White, Other);  
3. Source of admission to the ICU (ED, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494], another ICU in the study 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], operating room, outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) ; 
4. Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation prior to enrollment;  
5. Chronic comorbidities  (categories are not mutually exclusive)  
a. Receipt of supplemental oxygen at place of residence prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517] (yes, no);  
b. Coronary artery disease or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(yes, no);  
6. Acute diagnoses at enrollment  (categorie s are not mutually exclusive)  [56] 
a. cardiac arrest (yes, no);  
b. acute myocardial infarction (yes, no);  
c. sepsis or septic shock (yes, no);  
d. acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]  (yes, no);  
7. Receipt of vasopressors at enrollment (yes, no);  
8. Non-respir atory SOFA score at enrollment ; 
9. Time period (before the COVID -19 pandemic [July 2018 - December 2019], 
during the COVID -19 pandemic [January 2020 – August 2021]) . 
 
Analysis of the Secondary Outcome  
20 
  The sole pre -specified secondary outcome of 28 -day in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650146] -to-treat fashion in the main  
analysis population  using a  logistic regression model with independent covariates of 
group assignment (higher, intermediate, or lower SpO 2 target) and time.   In addition to 
assessing for an overall group effect within the model, we will estimate the differences 
between each pair of SpO 2 targets by [CONTACT_121698] 95% confidence intervals from t he 
model . 
 
Analysis of the Exploratory Outcomes  
Each of the exploratory outcomes will be compared between groups  in an 
intention -to-treat fashion in the main  analysis population .  Exploratory outcomes will be 
compared between study groups in a similar manner as for primary and secondary 
outcomes. A logistic model will be used for binary outcomes, a multinomial model for 
categorical outcomes, and a proportional odds model will be used for ordinal and 
continuous outcomes.

ABSTRACT
Introduction  Mechanical ventilation of intensive care unit 
(ICU) pa tients universally involves titration of the fraction 
of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_650157] 
(SpO2). However, the optimal SpO2 target remains 
unknown.Methods and analysis
 The Pragma tic Investigation of 
optimaL Oxygen Targets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial is a prospective, unblinded, pragmatic, cluster-
 crossover trial being 
conducted in the emergency department (ED) and medical ICU a t Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, 
Tennessee, [LOCATION_003]. PI[INVESTIGATOR_650134] a lower SpO

target (target 90% and goal range: 88%–92%), an intermediate SpO
2 target (target 94% and goal range: 
92%–96%) and a higher SpO2 target (target 98% and 
goal range: 96%–100%). The study units are assigned to a single SpO
2 target (cluster-  level allocation) for each 
2- month study block,  and the assigned SpO2 target 
switches every 2  months in a randomly generated 
sequence (c luster-  level crossover). The primary outcome 
is ventilator-  free days (VFDs) to study day 28,  defined as 
the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation from the final receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation through [ADDRESS_871830]. The results will be 
submitted for publication in a peer-  reviewed journal and 
presented at one or more scientific conferences.Trial registration number
 The trial protocol was 
registered with  ClinicalTrials.  gov on 25 May 2018 prior to 
initiation of pa tient enrolment (  ClinicalTrials.  gov identifier:

INTRODUCTION
Each year 2–3  million intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients receive invasive mechan-ical ventilation.
1–3 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650158]-  protective ventilation,4 in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650159] 25%–35%.

Mechanical ventilation for ICU patients 
universally involves titrating the fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO2) to maintain arterial 
oxygen saturation (SpO2) within a goal range. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_650137], however, the optimal SpO
2 target remains unknown. 
Higher SpO2 targets (96%–100%) provide 
a margin of safety against hypoxaemia, but may increase exposure to excess FiO
2, hyper -
oxaemia, and tissue hyperoxia, causing oxidative damage,
6–8 inflammation9 10 and 
increased alveolar-  capi[INVESTIGATOR_22425] .11 
Lower SpO2 targets (88%–92%) minimise 
exposure to excess FiO2, hyperoxaemia and 
tissue hyperoxia,4 12 13 but may increase the 
risk of hypoxaemia and tissue hypoxia.14 15 An 
intermediate SpO2 target (92%–96%) may 
avoid the risks of both hyperoxia and hypoxia or, conversely, may expose patients intermit-tently to both sets of risks.

 ►This ongoing pragmatic trial will provide information 
on the optimal oxygen saturation target during inva-sive mechanical ventilation of critically ill adults—informing a common therapy in current clinical practice for which there is limited available evidence on which to base care.
 ►Broad inclusion criteria will increase generalisability and the sample size will allow examination of im-portant patient subgroups.
 ►The trial is being conducted at a single centre.
 ►The nature of the study intervention does not allow blinding.
 ►Decisions regarding oxygen administration before and after invasive mechanical ventilation are de-ferred to treating clinicians.Section.

tropin level greater than the laboratory upper limit of normal in a patient capable of becoming pregnant (if measured clinically).
2.

Adults located in the study ICU or for whom admis-
sion to the study ICU from the ED is planned who meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria are enrolled immediately on receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in a study location. The time of enrolment for the trial (‘time zero’) is the time of first receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in a participating study location.
Randomisation and treatment allocation
For each of the 18 2-
 month blocks during the 36 months 
of enrolment in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], the medical ICU is assigned to a single SpO
2 target (cluster-  level alloca -
tion). Every 2  months, the ICU will switch between use 
of a lower SpO2 target (target 90% and goal range: 
88%–92%), use of an intermediate SpO2 target (target 
94% and goal range: 92%–96%) and use of a higher SpO
2 target (target 98% and goal range: 96%–100%) in 
a randomly generated sequence (cluster-  level crossover) 
(figure  2). The order of study group assignments for each 
2- month block was generated by [CONTACT_650263]-
sation using permuted blocks of three to minimise the impact of seasonal variation and temporal changes. For the 36 months of enrolment in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED for whom admission to the medical ICU is planned will receive the same SpO
2 target assigned to the medical 
ICU. The study did not enrol in April and May of 2020 due to disruptions in research and clinical care from the COVID-
 19 pandemic ( figure  2).
Washout periodsThe last 7
 days of each 2-  month block are considered an 
analytic washout period during which the ICU continues to target the assigned SpO
2, but data from new patients 
are not included in the primary analysis. Assuming a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 3 (IQR: 3–5)
 days, a 7-  day washout period will ensure that 98% 
patients in the primar y analysis do not experience a 
‘crossover’ from a period assigned to one assigned SpO2 
target to a period assigned to another SpO2 target. Data 
from patients admitted during washout periods will be included in a prespecified sensitivity analysis (see Statis-tical analysis section). Any patient who does remain mechanically ventilated in the study ICU through a crossover from a period assigned to one SpO
2 target to a 
period assigned to another SpO2 target will be analysed in 
the SpO2 target group to which the ICU was assigned at 
the time of the patient’s enrolment in the trial (intention-  
to- treat analysis).

Choice of SpO2 targets
In clinical practice, 98% of SpO2 values experienced 
by [CONTACT_650218] 88% and 100%.
32 33 Within this range, current guidelines for 
oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated adults outline three contrasting approaches: (1) allowing the lower end of the range of acceptable SpO
2 values to be as low as 
88%28 29 to avoid excess FiO2, hyperoxaemia and hyper -
oxia; (2) titrating within an intermediate range of SpO2 
values, such as 92%–96%38; or (3) targeting higher SpO2 
to avoid the risks of hypoxaemia and hypoxia.31 The 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_650140], each emulating a different approach to SpO
2 targets represented in guide-
lines and clinical practice (table  1).

other than achieving a target SpO2 (eg, when an FiO2 of

Statistical analysis and reportingSample size estimation and power calculationIn a prior cluster-

the same ICU,51 880 mechanically ventilated adults were 
enrolled per year (73.3 per month), with a median of 22 VFDs (IQR: 0–25 VFDs) and an intracluster intra-period correlation of 0.01. We estimate [ADDRESS_871842] 92% statistical 
power to detect an absolute reduction in VFDs of 2.0  days 
(similar to the numerical difference in VFDs between SpO
2 target groups reported in prior studies22 24).

Statistical analysis principles
R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses. Analyses will be conducted at the level of an individual patient during an individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650166]-
 to- treat fashion, 
unless other wise specified. Continuous variables will be 
reported as mean±SD  or median and IQR; categorical 
variables will be reported as frequencies and proportions.
Main analysis of the primar y outcome
The main analysis will be an intention-  to- treat compar -
ison of the primar y outcome of VFDs between the higher, 
intermediate and lower SpO2 target groups among all 
patients enrolled in the trial except1 those admitted 
during one of the 7-  day washout periods and2 those with 
a laboratory-  confirmed diagnosis of COVID-  19. Patients 
with a diagnosis of COVID-  [ADDRESS_871844] received significant 
exposure to the SpO2 target intervention in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650081]. Patients enrolled during washout periods and patients diagnosed with COVID-
 19 will be included in 
sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity analyses below).
It is possible to estimate a conditional effect, which is 
interpreted as the effect of a given SpO2 target on an indi-
vidual patient given the values of the covariates for that patient, or a marginal effect, which is interpreted as the population effect of implementing a given SpO
[ADDRESS_871845], we will use a propor -
tional odds model with independent covariates of group assignment (higher, intermediate or lower SpO
2 target) 
and time.53 54 Time (in days) will be treated as a contin-
uous variable with values ranging from 1 (first day of enrolment) to 1097 (final day of enrolment) and will be analysed using restricted cubic splines with multiple knots to allow for non-
 linearity resulting from seasonality 
or secular trends. For the purposes of declaring a statisti-
cally significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, we will consider the conditional effect from the proportional odds model and a two-
 sided p value of 0.05.
To estimate the marginal effect, we will use generalised 
estimating equations with study period as the cluster and an independent variable for group assignment (higher, 
intermediate or lower SpO2 target).
For both approaches, in addition to assessing for an 
overall group effect within the model, we will estimate the differences between each pair of SpO
2 targets by 
[CONTACT_121698] 95% CIs from the model.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome
 ►We will repeat the primary analysis using alterna-
tive statistical approaches to comparing the VFDs outcome between groups such as zero-
 inflated Poisson 
regression or zero-  inflated negative binomial regres -
sion, global rank scale analysis55 and Fine and Gray 
competing risk regression.
 ►We will repeat the primary analysis with adjustment for prespecified baseline covariates of age, sex, race and ethnicity, source of ICU admission, vasopressor receipt, acute diagnoses at enrolment, and severity of illness as assessed by [CONTACT_11339]-
 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y SOFA score.
 ►We will repeat the primary analysis replacing the continuous covariate of time with a categorical covar -
iate of season defined as: winter (January, February, March); spring (April, May, June); summer (July, August, September); and fall (October, November, December).
 ►We will repeat the primary analysis among all patients enrolled in the trial, including
[ADDRESS_871846] and the interaction between the two (eg, study group × presence of sepsis or septic shock) and time. Significance will be determined by [CONTACT_941] p value for the interaction term, with values <0.[ADDRESS_871847] a potential interaction and values <0.[ADDRESS_871848] of study group on the primary outcome:1.

No statistically significant difference was observed between groups. Although outcomes 
appeared to numerically favor the higher SpO 2 target group, interpretation was limited

the initiation of mechanical ventilation [5].  Patients in the intervention group received 
the lowest FiO 2 that maintained SpO 2 > 90%.  Patients in the control group received

modest separation between groups and sample size may have limited power to detect 
differences in patient-centered outcomes.   The sixth trial randomized 2,928 adult ICU

several reasons.  In routine clinical care in the study ICU, titration of FiO 2 to maintain 
SpO 2 for all mechanically ventilated adults is performed by 2 to 4 respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], 
with input from nurses and physicians.  The management of mechanical ventilation 
(selection of tidal volume, titration of positive end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111], screening for and 
performance of spontaneous breathing trials) is governed by [CONTACT_273080]-wide protocols 
implemented by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_871871] 
common in the minutes- to-hours immediately following initiation of invasive mechanical 
ventilation [7,8].  In a recent randomized trial examining tracheal intubation of cri tically ill 
adults, the median values for lowest SpO [ADDRESS_871872] FiO 2 were 97% and 1.0, 
respectively, in the first hour of invasive mechanical ventilation, compared with 96% and 
0.6 between 1 hour and 6 hours and 94% and 0.5 between 6 hours and 24  hours [9].  
Even brief periods of early hyperoxia or hypoxia may affect organ function [10 –12] and 
clinical outcomes [13 –16].  Enrollment immediately after initiation of invasive 
mechanical ventilation minimizes pre-study exposure to excess FiO 2, hyperoxemia, and 
hyperoxia and facilitates on-study separation between groups.  Multiple prior trials 
examining SpO [ADDRESS_871873] aimed to enroll patients shortly after the initiation of 
invasive mechanical ventilation [5,17].  In these patient-level parallel-group trials,

 however, the logistical challenges of performing screening, enrollment, randomization, 
and study group assignment immediately following initiation of invasive mechanical 
ventilation resulted in the exclusion of 60-90% of eligible patients – raising concern for 
systematic exclusion of important patient groups (e.g., patients with higher acuity of 
illness).  In PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571], group assignment at the cluster level allows enrollment immediate ly 
on initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED or ICU.  This approach 
emulates the manner in which oxygen therapy is managed in practice, precludes 
systematic exclusion of important patient groups, decreases pre-study exposure to 
hyperoxia and hypoxia, and facilitates early separation in oxygen therapy between 
groups.

mechanical ventilation [1,5], the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650187] 2 rather than PaO 2 for patients 
with functioning non-invasive pulse oximetry monitoring.  For patients in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650188]-invasive pulse oximetry monitoring is unavailable or inaccurate (e.g., 
inadequate plethysmography signal due to hypoperfusion), PaO 2 values corresponding 
to the assigned SpO 2 target are used to guide oxygen therapy [18].

 6. Approach to Monitoring SpO 2  
 
For all mechanically ventilated patients in the study ED and ICU, SpO 2 is 
continuously monitored using Nellcor™ SpO ₂ Adhesive Sensors (Medtronic, 
Minneapolis, MN), which measure changes in red and infrared light absorption in an 
arteriolar bed throughout the pulse cycle to report a non-normalized real-time 
plethysmographic waveform and arterial hemoglobin saturation values averaged over 
the prior 6 seconds with a mean difference between SpO 2 and SaO 2 < 2% for SpO 2 
values 80-100% [19].  Plethysmography and SpO 2 values are displayed [1] on IntelliVue 
MP90 bedside patient monitors (PHILIPS, Amsterdam, Netherlands) in each ED and 
ICU room, [2] on telemetry monitors located at ED and ICU nursing stations and 
adjacent to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_650086], and [3] in real-time in the institutional 
electronic health record, available from any physical location.  SpO 2 values are archived 
every 60 seconds into an Enterprise Data Warehouse [20 –22].

17 
 7. Feedback on SpO 2 Target Adherence 
 
During the study, the IntelliVue MP90 bedside patient monitors in each room are 
set to generate an alarm for SpO 2 values outside the range considered to be at goal for 
the assigned SpO 2 target group.  For example, for patients in the intermediate SpO 2 
target group, SpO 2 values 92-96% generate no alarm, whereas SpO 2 values ≤ 91% or ≥ 
97% generate an alarm alerting nursing staff and respi[INVESTIGATOR_650117]- of-range 
value.   
Study personnel remotely monitor SpO 2 values every four hours from 4 AM 
through 10 PM Monday through Friday and during a 10% sample of night and weeke nd 
hours to identify instances of lag between out- of-range SpO [ADDRESS_871875] meetings, and ICU physician leadership meetings to provide 
continuing education about the study, reinforce elements of the study protocol including 
the process for SpO 2 target modification by [CONTACT_274408], screen for safety 
concerns or potential adverse events, and identify and address barriers to achieving the 
SpO 2 targe ts.

 8. SpO 2 Targets in Patients who return to Invasive Mechanical Ventilation 
 
Patients who discontinue invasive mechanical ventilation and return to invasive 
mechanical ventilation in a study location during the same two-month study period  
continue to be managed using the same assigned SpO 2 target.  Similarly, patients who 
are transferred out from a study location and return to receiving invasive mechanical 
ventilation in a study location during the same two-month study period continue to be  
managed using the same assigned SpO 2 target.  Patients who remain on invasive 
mechanical ventilation in a study location through the end of a two-month study peri od 
receive the SpO 2 target assigned by [CONTACT_650275]-
month study period ends, after which time treating clinicians determine the SpO 2 target 
with which the patient is managed.   Similarly, for patients who are enrolled during one 
two-month study period, discontinue invasive mechanical ventilation or transferred out 
of the study location, and return to receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a 
subsequent two-month study period, treating clinicians determine the SpO 2 target with 
which the patient is managed during the subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_650189].

 9. Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation 
 
Each day of mechanical ventilation, all patients in the study ICU are assessed for 
safety of a spontaneous awakening trial (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) 
[23] using the SAT and SBT safety criteria from the Awakening and Breathing 
Controlled trial [24].  To prevent patients in the higher SpO [ADDRESS_871876] passed an SBT, the decision to discontinue invasive 
mechanical ventilation is made by [CONTACT_372229].

 10. Protocol for Ventilator Management in the Study ICU 
 
Predicted Body Weight (PBW) Calculation: 
            Males:          PBW (kg) = (height in inches – 60)*2.3+50 
            Females:      PBW (kg) = (height in inches – 60)*2.3+45.5 
 
Mode: Assist Control 
 
Tidal volume : 6 ml/kg PBW 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] : Set to maintain 60-70% minute ventilation prior to tracheal intubation.  
Adjust rate to maintain pH 7.30-7.45, NOT TO EXCEED 35 bpm or PC02 < 25. 
 
I:E Ratio : Avoid inverse ratio ventilation 
 
PEEP titration : 
FiO2  0.3-0.[ADDRESS_871877] level of FiO2 & PEEP while maintaining goal SpO2. 
 
Acidosis Management: 
1. If pH <7.30, increase RR to 35 as needed. 
2. If pH remains <7.3 with RR = 35 call House Officer 
3. If pH <7.15, consider bicarbonate administration, may increase TV by 1 ml/kg 
PBW increments until pH is >7.15 or TV = 8 ml/kg PBW (under these conditions 
Pplat targets [see below] may be exceeded). 
Alkalosis Management : If pH >7.45, decrease RR. 
 
Management of Tidal Volume: 
1. Titrate TV by 1ml/kg increments (minimum of 4ml/kg PBW) to maintain a Pplat 
below 30cm H2O. 
2. Measure & record Pplat (0.5 sec inspi[INVESTIGATOR_109907]), SpO2, Total RR, TV and pH 
(if available) at least every 4 hours AND after each change in PEEP or TV.

 19. Definition of Days Alive and Free of a Supportive Therapy 
 
Each of the outcomes related to the number of days alive and free of a sp ecific 
supportive therapy (e.g., vasopressor-free days, renal replacement therapy-free days, 
ICU-free days, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-free days) will be defined using the same approach as the 
primary outcome of ventilator-free days. 
Days alive and free of the supportive therapy will be defined as the number o f 
calendar days alive and free of the supportive therapy from the final receipt of the 
supportive therapy through 28 days after enrollment [67,68].  The day of enrollment will 
be considered to be day 0.  Outcome ascertainment will cease at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l 
discharge or [ADDRESS_871880].   
Receipt of the supportive therapy will be considered to end at the time of the 
patient’s final receipt of the supportive therapy between  enrollment and 28 days after 
enrollment.  Patients who continue to receive the supportive therapy at day 28 will 
receive a value of zero.  Patients who die prior to day 28 will receive a value of zero.  
Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97011] 28 and are receiving the 
supportive therapy at the time of discharge will receive a value of zero.  Patients who 
are removed from the supportive therapy and are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650195] 28 days will be assumed to remain free of the supporti ve 
therapy between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650196] 28.  For patients who are removed from 
the supportive therapy, return to receiving the supportive therapy, and are subseq uently 
removed again from the supportive therapy prior to day 28, days alive and free of  the 
supportive therapy will be counted from the final receipt of the supportive therap y prior 
to day 28.

[ADDRESS_871884] pre-specified a single primary outcome and a single secondary 
outcome.  Consistent with recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration [65] 
and the European Medicines Association [66], each will be tested using a two-sided p-
value with a significance level of 0.05.  For all other analyses, emphasis will be placed 
on the estimate of effect size with 95% confidence intervals, as recommended by [CONTACT_19483] [67], and no corrections for multiple 
comparisons will be performed.

 25. Handling of Missing Data 
 
The primary outcome of VFDs is not anticipated to be missing for any patients.  
Missing data will not be imputed for the primary outcome or any secondary or 
exploratory outcomes.  None of the covariates pre-specified for the adjusted analysis 
are anticipated to be missing for any patients.  In additional adjusted analyses, any 
missing data for covariates will be imputed using multiple imputations.

 26. Rationale for Waiver of Informed Consent 
 
For a ll mechanically ventilated ICU patients, FiO 2 is titrated to maintain SpO 2 as 
a part of clinical care. In current clinical care, 98% of SpO 2 values experienced by 
[CONTACT_650280] 88-100% [31,32].  Within this 
range, current guidelines for oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated adults advocate 
contrasting approaches: [1] tolerating SpO 2 values as low as 88% (NIH/NHLBI ARDS 
Network) [33], [2] titrating within the range 92-96% (Thoracic Society of Australia and 
New Zealand ) [34], or [3] allowing SpO 2 values above 96% (British Thoracic Society) 
[35]. The lower SpO [ADDRESS_871885] that one SpO 2 target is better than the others for patient 
outcomes .  During the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650068], whenever treating clinicians feel that the optimal 
SpO 2 target for a specific patient is known, that SpO 2 target is used.  Thus, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_650200] 2 target for patients whose treating clinicians are uncertain 
which SpO 2 target would be optimal for the patient and feel all three targets represent 
comparable and reasonable approaches. 
Because the SpO 2 targets being compared in the study [1] are common 
approaches to managing a universal supportive therapy to which patients would be 
exposed as a part of clinical care if not participating in the study, [2] have no high- quality 
data suggesting the superiority of one approach over the others, and [3] are all 
comparable approaches for the patient from the perspective of the treating clinician ,

 participation in the study presents minimal incremental risk compared to clinical care for 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients outside of the study. 
Initiation of mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients is frequently a time-
sensitive procedure. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_249669] a formal informed consent document for 
tracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation, time allows for discussion of 
risks and benefits of these clinical procedures in less than 10% of cases during clinical 
care in the study ICU. Titration of FiO [ADDRESS_871886] prevalence of excess FiO 2, hyperoxemia, and hyperoxia. Moreover, in this 
cluster-randomized trial, the entire ICU is assigned to a single SpO 2 target delivered by 
[CONTACT_8508]’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489] s through a unit-wide oxygen titration protocol. Obtaining 
informed consent from every patient receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the 
study ED and ICU prior to the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation would be 
impracticable and would potentially delay delivery of a time-sensitive intervention. 
Because the study presents minimal incremental risk, the study does not 
adversely affect the welfare or privacy rights of the participants, and obtaining informed 
consent prior to enrollment is impracticable, the study is being conducted with a waiver 
of informed consent.

 27. Plan for Communication of Protocol Changes 
 
 Any changes to the trial protocol (e.g., changes to eligibility criteria, outcomes, 
analyses) will require a new version of the full trial protocol which will be tracked with 
the date of the update and the version number of the trial protocol. A list summ arizing 
the changes that are made with each protocol revision will be included at the end of 
each protocol. The updated protocol will be sent to the Vanderbilt IRB for approval prio r 
to implementation of the protocol change. At the time of publication, the o riginal trial 
protocol and the final trial protocol, including the summary of changes made with each 
protocol change, will be included in the supplementary material for publication.

Version 1.2 
 6/29/[ADDRESS_871905] (DSMB) f or the Preliminary 
Investigation of optimaL Oxygen T argets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571]) trial. 
 
The Charter is intended to be a living document. The DSMB and investigators will review  it at 
regular intervals to determine whether any changes in procedure are needed. 
 
2. Responsibilities of the DSMB 
The DSMB is responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, assessi ng the 
safety and efficacy of study procedures, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the study. 
 
The DSMB is an independent group advisory to the investigators and affiliated institution,  and is 
required to provide recommendations about starting, continuing, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. The 
DSMB makes recommendations about: 
• Participant safety and risk/benefit ratio of study procedures and interventions , including 
whether new data from other sources affects the study 
• Initial approval of the protocol and subsequent amendments (with specific attenti on to 
study population, intervention, and study procedures) 
• Adherence to the protocol requirements 
• Completeness, quality, and planned analysis of data  
• Ancillary study burden on participants and main study 
 
3. Communication Plan 
 
Communication with DSMB members will be primarily through the DSMB Chair and the primary 
investigator ([CONTACT_650290]) or study biostatistician ([CONTACT_650291]).  Study investiga tors will not 
communicate about the study with DSMB members outside of DSMB meetings. The  primary 
investigator may contact [CONTACT_650281]. 
 
4. DSMB Members and Research Staff 
DSMB members and their expertise are listed in Appendix A.   The DSMB Chair will perform the 
functions of the Executive Secretary (ES).  He will draft meeting summaries, com pose final 
recommendations, and assure the accurate and timely transmission of the fina l 
recommendations to the investigators.   The primary investigator ([CONTACT_650290]) will be responsible 
for timely notification of co-investigators of all DSMB recommendat ions.  Ad hoc  members may 
be added to supplement expertise for single or multiple meetings. 
 
5.  Scheduling, Timing, and Organizatio n of Meetings 
DSMB meetings will be held by [CONTACT_577].  The purpose of the first meet ing is to review 
and discuss this Charter, provide an overview of study activities, review the trial protocol, review 
the DSMB data reportin g template, and finalize the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Each 
DSMB member will sign and return this Charter to the primary investigat or ([CONTACT_650290]) to

 3 indicate recommendation for approval.  Enrollment in the trial will not beg in until the DSMB has 
recommended approval and IRB approval has been obtained. 
 
• Meetings by [CONTACT_650282] a year, with additional meet ings scheduled 
as needed. Conference calls will be scheduled by [CONTACT_34351] ([CONTACT_650292] r) 
in collaboration with the DSMB members. 
 
• A single interim analysis will be performed in the [ADDRESS_871906] 18 months of the t rial. 
  
• The DSMB will conclude its operations when all study procedures, follow up, analysi s, 
and publication of the primary results have been completed. 
 
The agenda for DSMB meetings will be drafted by [CONTACT_34351] ([CONTACT_650290]) and 
study biostatistician ([CONTACT_650291]), and finalized in consultation with the DSMB Chair . The agenda 
and meeting materials will be distributed by [CONTACT_34351] ([CONTACT_650290]) or his 
appointee, two (2) weeks before each meeting. The NHLBI Program Office will receive this 
material at the same time as DSMB members.  
 
When the agenda is distributed, DSMB members will be asked to report any new  conflicts of 
interest since the last DSMB meeting. New conflicts will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] C hair and study 
staff to determine if the conflict limits the ability of the DSMB member to participate in the 
discussion according to conflict of interest policy at the study institution.  
 
To ensure proper trial conduct, at each meeting the DSMB will review the foll owing data:  
• adverse events and other safety data,  
• quality and completeness of study data, and  
• enrollment data 
 
At the single pre-planned interim analysis after 18 months of enrollment, t he DSMB will review a 
formal interim analysis for efficacy by [CONTACT_53229] ( as outlined below in the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_70697] ). 
 
It is expected that all DSM B members will attend every meeting.  For the purposes of voting on 
recommendations, a quorum is three (3) members of the Board.   All standing Monitoring Board 
members are voting members. The Board may also decide in advance whether ad hoc  
members can vote. 
 
6.  Organization of Meetings 
Meetings a re organized into open, closed, and executive sessions. 
 
• Open session  - information is presented to the DSMB by [CONTACT_30967], with 
time for discussion.    
 
• Closed session  - the DSMB and blinded study staff (NHLBI program staff may be 
invited to a ttend at the Chair’s discretion)  discuss confidential data (any study data 
grouped by [CONTACT_2939]), including information on efficacy and safety. The DS MB can 
decide to be unblinded to treatment assignments by [CONTACT_4305].  The principal

• Executive session  (optional) DSMB members (and NHLBI program staff at the Chair’s 
discretion) may elect to convene to discuss study issues independently. If the executive 
session occurs on a conference call, steps will be taken to ensure that only the 
appropriate participants are on the call, and to invite others to re-join the call only at the 
conclusion of the executive session. 
 
• Recommendations (optional) – Meeting attendees may be reconvened to receive the 
DSMB’s recommendations.  
 
At the conclusion of the closed and executive sessions, the participants will be re-conven ed so 
that the DSMB Chair can provide a summary of the DSMB’s recommendations. This provides 
an opportunity for study investigators to ask questions to clarify the recommenda tions. The 
meeting is then adjourned. 
 
 
7. Expedited Safety Reporting 
A system has been established to track and report adverse events (AEs). Study pe rsonnel will 
monitor the safety of subjects and follow AEs until the event resolves or is expl ained. 
 
Clinical Outcomes (not considered Adverse Events). In this study of critically il l patients who are 
at high risk for death or other adverse outcomes due to their underlying critical illness, clinical 
outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be systematically tracked (collected i n the 
case report form) and will be included as part of the analyses for this study. Fo r the purposes of 
reporting, death and organ dysfunction will not be recorded as AEs unless the investiga tor 
believes the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_650283] d than 
expected given the underlying critical illness. Listed below are events that will be tracked as 
primary or secondary clinical outcomes and will not therefore be reported as AEs (unl ess 
believed to be study related and more severe or prolonged than expected given the underlying  
critical illness): 
 
1. Death (all deaths occurring prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650209]); 
2. Recurrence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], including need for re-intubation or non-invasi ve 
mechanical ventilation, presence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or presence of 
pneumothorax; 
3. Circulatory failure, including cardiac arrest or shock with or without receipt of 
vasopressors; 
4. Incidence of sustained atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; 
5. Acute kidney injury, including leading to increased creatinine or receipt of renal 
replacement therapy; 
6. Hepatic injury or failure leading to increased bilirubin, AST, or ALT; 
7. Coagulation derangements leading to elevated PT/INR or PTT, DIC, thrombocytopenia, 
or thrombocytosis; 
8. Lactic acidosis; 
9. Delirium, disability, and physical or cognitive impairment believed to be newly acquired ; 
10. All values for SpO 2, SaO 2, FiO 2, PaO 2, or PaO2/FiO2 ratio; 
11. All values for vital signs (e.g., temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO2); 
12. Receipt of co-interventions (e.g., net fluid balance, number of arterial blood gasses, r ed 
cell transfusion) 
13. Duration of ICU admission, ICU readmission;

15. Alterations in routine labs, including chemistries, complete blood counts, liver function  
tests, and hemostasis profiles. 
 
Adverse Event Classifications. An Adverse Event (AE) will be defined as any untowar d medical 
occurrence for a patient enrolled in the trial that is not tracked as a clinical  outcome, regardless 
of whether the event is considered study related or not. All AEs occurring du ring th e 
observational study period will be recorded on the CRF. All AEs will then be assessed  as to 
whether they are (1) related to study procedures, (2) serious, and/or (3) unexpected according 
to the following definitions: 
 
I. Related to study procedures. AEs that the investigator suspects are related to the study 
will be classified as study related. Certainty of relatedness is not required as long as a 
reasonable possibility exists that the AE is related to a study procedure. 
 
II. Serious. AEs that meet any of the criteria below will be considered Serio us Adverse 
Events (SAEs): 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event and NOT an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
would have been more severe) 
c. Prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
e. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
f. Important medical event that requires an intervention to prevent any of a-e  above. 
 
III. Unexpected. AEs that are more severe or prolonged than expected based on the 
investigator’s discretion will be considered Unexpected.  
 
Communication and Reporting of Adverse Events. AEs will be recorded in the AE  CRF in the 
electronic database and reported to the primary investigator ([CONTACT_650290]) wit hin 5 calendar days 
of occurrence. The primary investigator will provide a report of all AEs annua lly to the IRB, and 
semi-annually to the DSMB as part of the semi-annual DSMB meetings. A ll SAEs will be 
reported to the primary investigator within 72 hours of occurrence. The prim ary investigator will, 
in turn, report all SAEs to the IRB, DSMB, and funding body within 7 calenda r days of 
occurrence.   Consistent with NHLBI policy, unanticipated problems that do not qualify as an 
SAE will be reported by [CONTACT_85213], DSMB, and NH LBI within 14 calendar days 
of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
 
Review by [CONTACT_4318].   All AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_650284]-annual 
DSMB meetings.  All SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_650285] (3) days of 
notification.  The DSMB Chair will respond to the primary investigator ([CONTACT_650293]) and NHLBI 
program office with recommendations within seven (7) days. 
  
 
8. Reports to the DS MB 
For each meeting, the study biostatistician ([CONTACT_650291]) will prepare summary repor ts and tables 
to facilitate the oversight role of the DSMB. The DSMB will discuss at the first  and subsequent 
meetings what data they wish to review and how it should be presented (Appendix B) .

 6 9. Reports of DSMB Deliberations  
 
• Full Summary and Recommendations : The DSMB Chair/ ES is responsible for sending 
the DSMB meeting summary to the Board within seven (7) calendar days of the  meeting. 
The summary should be signed by [CONTACT_650286][INVESTIGATOR_139431] , 
the response of the investigators to previous recommendations, and the 
recommendations of the DSMB. The study statistician may receive the full summary as 
decided by [CONTACT_650287] a meeting by [CONTACT_650288]. 
 
Voting on recommendations will follow Roberts’ Rules of Order ( Robert's Rules of 
Order Newly Revised (11th Edition) RONR. 
 
• Board Recommendations  - signed by [CONTACT_45453], will be sent to the investigators 
within fourteen (14) calendar days after the meeting . Recommendations should include a 
statement as to whether the study is approved to continue as planned, should continue 
with specified changes, or should be stopped. Requests for additional data from the 
investigators or DCC/statistician should include an expected due date. In addition to 
recommendations memos issued to investigators (for review and IRB distribution), 
recommendations related to blinded data or data analysis issues may be issued 
separately for DCCs or statisticians. 
 
The recommendations will be distributed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_650210]-invest igators, 
to the local IRB, and to the NHLBI Program Office. 
 
• Action plan : This lists the DSMB’s recommendations and the primary investigator ’s 
action plan outlining the steps required to implement the DSMB recommendations.  It is 
submitted to the NHLBI Program Office and DSMB within fourteen (14) cal endar days 
after the DSMB meeting. 
 
10. Statistical Monitoring Guidelines  
In addition to ongoing monitoring of safety throughout the trial, the DSMB wi ll conduct a single 
interim analysis for efficacy and safety at the anticipated halfway point of t he trial.  The interim 
analysis will include patients enrolled during the first 18 months of the tri al.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650211] P value for the difference between gr oups is <0.001 
using a proportional odds mixed effects model accounting for fixed effects (group) and random 
effects (period) with regard to the primary outcome of VFDs.  Use of the conservative Haybittle-
Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be performed usi ng an unchanged 
level of significance (P = 0.05).  There will be no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650212] f utility.  The DSMB will 
reserve the right to stop the trial at any point, request additional data or i nterim analyses, or 
request modifications of the study protocol as required to protect patient safety.   If the 18-month 
interim analysis reveals an enrollment indicative of <80% statistical power at completion , we will 
ask the DSMB to approve extending enrollment of the study to ensure the trial  is not 
underpowered to detect the planned difference between groups in the primary outcome.

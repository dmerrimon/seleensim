PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS   
Protocol Title:  A Novel Analgesia technique for ACL Reconstruction: Adductor 
Canal Block with an IPACK versus Adductor Canal Block  
Protocol Number:  2017-0934 
Protocol Date:  7/25/2019  
Sponsor:  Department of Anesthesiology

Objective:  A comparison of two pain control methods - the combination of 
Adductor Canal  Block (ACB)/Periarticular Injection  
(PAI)/Infiltration of the interspace between the  popliteal artery  
and the capsule of the posterior knee (IPACK) versus the  
Periarticular Injection (PAI) - in patients undergoing total knee  
arthroplasty.  Primary outcome is NRS pain scores with  
ambulation on  postoperative day one  ([ADDRESS_433231] -block 
administration).

 Page [ADDRESS_433233] erior knee compartment pain remains a postoperative concern.  Sciatic 
and posterior tibial nerve blocks are also anesthetic options, but again result in motor 
blockade.  A small percentage of patients receiving sciatic nerve blockade also exhibit foot 
drop due to peroneal nerve injury11. Alternatively, as a sensory block, the  periarticular 
injection (PAI) proves to hasten ambulation and recovery after TKA12. The PAI blind injection 
into the posterior capsule seems to aid in pain control of the posterior com partment and 
reduces the total number physical therapy sessions13.  
 
Injection in the interspace between the Popliteal Artery and Capsule of the posterior Knee 
(IPACK) provides an alternative to the PAI blind technique for analgesia in the posterior 
compartment14. The IPACK block is not a nerve block, but rather infiltrates the area between 
the popliteal artery and the femur15. This area is rich with sensory nerve fibers from the 
posterior capsule of the knee, which originate from the sciatic and post erior tibial nerve16.  
There have been several studies validating adductor canal blocks to be noninferior in 
analgesia and superior in quadriceps strength for both TKR (7) and ACL (15) surgeries in 
comparison to the FNB.   There also are retrospective stud ies validating the use of the 
sciatic nerve block with the femoral nerve block for ACL surgery (16,17,18). There are 
currently no studies published on the use of IPACK with ACB for ACL surgery.  Currently, 
there is an IRB approved prospective study under e nrollment at HSS investigating the use of 
the IPACK block for TKR.  
 
In this prospective study, we will be the first to compare pain scores between the two 
groups: ACB/IPACK and ACB in patients undergoing BTB ACL surgery.  We will determine 
whether there is  a difference between groups in AUC NRS pain at rest for 24h.

2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
Adductor canal blocks have been shown to effectively pr ovide adequate analgesia without 
compromising quadriceps strength. IPACK has been shown to optimize pain relief by 
[CONTACT_348746]. The IPACK is also known as the SPANK block ( sensory posterior articular nerves 
of the knee) and is shown to involve blocking the superior medial and lateral genicular 
nerves, providing analgesia to the capsule of the knee joint as well as the intraarticular and 
extra -articular ligaments.  By [CONTACT_348747], it may be possible to optimize 
pain relief without compromising motor strength. This may facilitate ambulation threshold

and reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (with its associated adverse effects), possibly leading to an 
earlier discharge.  The reason to do this study is to investigate whether the ACB/IPACK 
(anterior/posterior) in combination would be a better alternative to ACB alone.  Furthermore, 
the study will also determine whether ACB/IPACK is superior to ACB in lowering pain scores 
at [ADDRESS_433235] of pain.  We hypothesize that superior analgesia early in 
recovery may contribute to an improvement in DVPRS and functional outcomes (KOS) well 
after block resolution.  In addition, questions related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_348743].  
The aim of this study is to determine will the IPACK group will have lower pain scores . 
3.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES  
This is a prospective study to assess whether Patellar -autograft ACL reconstruction patients 
who receive ACB + IPACK will have reduced NRS pain in the first [ADDRESS_433236] 2 4 hours  postoperatively 
(starting at [ADDRESS_433237] spi[INVESTIGATOR_100126]): every 30 min for 3  hours , then 6, 12, 18, 
and 24 h ours.

7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
1. Proposed analysis (e.g., student’s t -test, ANOVA, chi -square, regression, etc.):  
Regression based on a generalized estimating equations approach  
2. Alpha level:   0.05 
3. Beta or power level: 80%  
4. Primary outcome variable estimate (mean +/ - s.d. for continuous o utcome, 
frequency/percentage for categorical variable): Within -group standard deviation of 
NRS pain at rest = 4.1 points (based on Abdallah et al, 2016 [1])  
5. Number of groups being compared (use 1 for paired analysis within the same 
subjects):  [ADDRESS_433241] siz e or change expected between groups:   2 points is considered a clinically 
significant difference in pain scores in previous literature [1,2,3])  
7. Resulting number per group: 47  
8. Total sample size required: 120 (original:  100, use120 total to account for 20% 
attrition/withdrawal)  
 
Primary outcome:  
The primary outcome, NRS pain at rest during the first 24 hours postoperatively, will be 
compared between the ACB and ACB + IPACK groups regression based on a generalized

estimating equations approach. The observed d ifference between the ACB and ACB + 
IPACK groups will also be compared to the previously defined clinically meaningful 
difference in NRS pain for the first 24 postoperative hours.  
 
Secondary outcome : 
The secondary outcomes will also be compared between the  ACB and ACB + IPACK 
groups. Specific statistical approaches will be determined by [CONTACT_348748]:  
• As a sensitivity analysis, AUC of NRS pain at rest during the first 24 hours 
postoperatively (calculated using the trapezoidal r ule [similar to Abdallah et al. 2016 
[1]) will be compared between groups using the Mann -Whitney -Wilcoxon U test or 
two-sample t -test (depending upon the distribution of the data).  
• Continuous and categorical outcomes measured at multiple time points (e.g.,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023], DVPRS score at rest, SF -8 and KOS assessment, patient satisfaction 
with pain control, etc.) will be analyzed using a generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) approach.  
• Categorical outcomes measured at one time point (e.g., continued opio id 
consumption at 2 weeks, etc.) will be analyzed using chi -square and/or Fisher’s 
exact tests.  
• Continuous outcomes measured at one time point (e.g., time to meet discharge 
criteria, time to PT clearance, induction time, block duration, incidence  and duration 
of transient peroneal palsy, etc.) will be analyzed using Mann -Whitney -Wilcoxon U 
test or two -sample t -tests.  
 
Baseline characteristics:  
Demographics and other baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, etc.) will be compared 
between the ACB a nd ACB + IPACK groups. Balance diagnostics may be used to determine 
similarity of baseline covariates between the two study groups, such as described in Austin 
2009 [2].

2 Randomized, Double -Blind Clinical Study Evaluating Efficacy of Intravenous versus 
Enteric Acetaminophen in Donor Nephrectomy and Robot -Assisted, Laparoscopic 
Nephrectomy.  
Principal Investigator :  [INVESTIGATOR_13993], MD  
1.  BACKGROUND, PURPOSE and OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY   
1.1 Background:  
Obtaining effective postoperative analgesia following major surgery can be difficult. Nonnarcotic 
regimens have been applied to specific procedures to improve outcomes. Intravenous 
acetaminophen may be more efficacious for the management of postoperative pain than oral 
acetaminophen.    
There is not a large body of literature addressing this subject.  A literature search was done 
through Miner Library through PubMed and Embase using the following strategies:  “Infusions, 
Intravenous” [Mesh] OR “Administration, Intravenous” [Mesh] OR “Injections, Intravenous” 
[Mesh] AND “administration, oral AND elective surgery AND acetaminophen” yielded only 12.  
Of those, only two were relevant.  One study compared plasma levels following IV or oral administration of acetaminophen.  Another study was sim ilar to our proposed trial but compared 
IV versus oral tramadol.  
A search through Clinicaltrials,gov showed that several groups (12 trials) are studying this topic 
(comparing IV versus oral acetaminophen) but are studying different populations (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hip fracture, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, lumbar 
discectomy, cesarean section).  Of these, only 4 are double blind.  
In summary, we feel that the proposed study will add knowledge to the field.  
1.2.  Purpose of the Study:  
The aim of this study is to compare pain control for oral and intravenous acetaminophen for 
post-operative pain control in patients who undergo either (1) donor nephrectomy, or (2) 
nephrectomy for cancer.  Many clinicians believe that intravenous acetaminophen is superior to 
enteral acetaminophen for the management of perioperative pain. However, the intravenous 
formulation of acetaminophen is six -hundred times more expensive than the enteral form. To 
date, there is no empi[INVESTIGATOR_13994]. Our objective is to conduct a pragmatic RCT to determine whether IV acetaminophen provides 
superior pain control compared to PO acetaminophen in the setting of routine clinical practice.  
Patients undergoing laparoscopic donor nephrectomies or robot -assisted donor nephrectomies 
were chosen to be included in this study for the following reasons:  
1. These two procedures are associated with similar levels of surgical stress and tissue 
trauma.  
RSRB# [ADDRESS_13358] -operative pain control. The primary outcome  is the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_13995] (when the first dose of acetaminophen is administered in 
the pre- anesthesia holding area) to [ADDRESS_13359] -operatively (in morphine equivalents).   
This will include opi[INVESTIGATOR_13996] -operatively.  
1.4.  Secondary Objectives .    
The secondary outcomes  are:  
1. Average surgical pain intensity on a 0 -10 numeric rating scale (NRS) administered 
between [ADDRESS_13360] -operatively.  
2. Average surgical pain intensity on a 0 -10 numeric rating scale (NRS) administered 
between [ADDRESS_13361] -operatively.  
3. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13997] (between 1- [ADDRESS_13362] -operatively).  The inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13998] a percentage of the subject’s baseline (pre- operative) inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13999]  
4. Dynamic pain score with incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_14000] 1- [ADDRESS_13363] -operatively.  
5. Surgical pain score on a 0- 10 numeric rating scale (NRA) obtained during the [ADDRESS_13364] donor nephrectomies or robot -assisted laparoscopic nephrectomies.  
RSRB# [ADDRESS_13365] enrolled subjects to 
represent the racial/ethnic composition of the patients at the URMC.  
2.5.  Inclusion Criteria . The subject must:   
1. Be at least [ADDRESS_13366] cognitive ability to verbally rate their pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).  
   
2.6.  Exclusion Criteria.  The subject must not:  
1. Age younger than 18 years old or older than 90 years old  
2. Pregnancy (Pre -operative pregnancy test is routinely performed for all elective 
operating room cases)   
3. Weight less than 50 kg (lowest weight for safe dosing of 1000mg of acetaminophen) 
4. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14001]  
5. Known liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis, liver failure).  
6. Patient unable to take enteral medications (i.e. cannot swallow pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], have a feeding tube, or are on TPN). However, patients who become NPO postoperatively due to ileus, persistent nausea and vomiting will be included in the analysis. These results 
will b e evaluated using intention- to-treat analysis.  
7. Previous adverse reaction to acetaminophen  
2.7.  Vulnerable Subjects.  
This study design excludes many vulnerable subjects, including children, pregnant women, and 
subjects with impaired cognition (who cannot provide accurate and consistent reports of their 
pain scores). Other potentially vulnerable subjects, such as employees, or the elderly, may enter 
the study; those who do will be afforded the same protections from risk as subjects not 
considered specifically vulnerable, and all subjects will be treated and monitored according to the same protocols and by [CONTACT_14030]. Prisoners will not be included in the study given 
limitations in access prior to surgery and additional screening required for this population.  
3. METHODS AND PROCEDURES   
3.1  Overview.  
This is a single center, randomized, double blinded study (pre, peri and post -operative days) 
clinical trial. Subjects will be randomized to receive:  1.) IV acetaminophen and placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_14002] 
2) placebo IV (normal saline) and PO acetaminophen. It is expected that this trial will take 
approximately 1- 2 years to complete.

3.1.10 Adverse events and serious adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse event (AE).  An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in 
a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study which is 
temporally associated with the use of a treatment, whether or not considered related to 
the treatment. Adverse events may be reported by [CONTACT_102], or detected by [CONTACT_14040]. For the purpose of adverse event recording, the study 
period will begin with the initiation of study procedures (including pretreatment  
procedures) and will continue to the end of the trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intensity of adverse events.  The intensity or severity of adverse events will be 
graded as follows:  
Mild:  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not expected to have 
a clinically significant effect on the patient’s overall health and wellbeing. Not 
likely to require medical attention.  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity or affects 
clinical status. It may require medical intervention.  
Severe:  Incapacitating or significantly affecting clinical status. Likely requires 
medical intervention and/or close follow -up. 
RSRB# [ZIP_CODE]

11 [IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to study medication.  The principal investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a delegated sub           
investigator will be responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study medication              
using the following definitions:  
Probable:  a clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, in which a 
relationship to the study drug seems probable because of such factors and consistency with known effects of the drug, a clear temporal association with the 
use of the drug, improvement upon withdrawal of the drug, lack of alternative 
explanations for the experience, or other factors.  
Possible:  a clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the study drug, but which could 
not be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacki ng. 
Unlikely:  a clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study drug administration, which makes a causal relationship 
improbable and in which other factors suggesting an alternative etiology exist. 
Such factors include a known relationship of the adverse experience to 
concomitant medication, the patient’s disease state, or environmental factors including common infectious diseases.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious adverse event (SAE).  Any adverse drug experience occurring at any 
dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• life threatening complication 
• inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or patient and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions tha t do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of adverse events.  All adverse events that occur during the study 
period will be recorded, regardless of the severity of the event or judged relationship to 
the study drugs, and a diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. The onset date, 
stop date, action taken with the  study drugs, and outcome of each adverse event will be 
recorded. The relationship to study drug, severity, and seriousness of each adverse 
event as judged by [CONTACT_14041]. In addition, subjects w ho 
experience an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study at any time at the discretion of the investigator. The subject will be monitored until the event has resolved 
or stabilized, determination of a cause unrelated to the study is made, or the subj ect is 
referred to the care of a local physician.

4.  DATA STORAGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY    
The privacy of the subjects including their personal identity and all personal medical information 
including medical record numbers, date of birth, date of service will be maintained at all times.   Subjects will be identified by a unique subject identific ation number and all data will be 
presented in aggregate reports.   
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Subject data will be entered into electronic spreadsheets.  One spreadsheet wil l serve as the correlation 
tool and contain the subject name, medical record number and unique study subject identifier.  The second spreadsheet will contain the unique study subject identifier as well as all the variables required for the study.  The two spreadsheets will be stored as separate files, 
protected by [CONTACT_14043].  Only the investigators and key study staff will have access to the files and their passwords.  All the results of this research will be presented in the form of aggregate data.  
5.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION   
The primary outcome is total opi[INVESTIGATOR_14022] (from the time of the 
administration of acetaminophen in the pre -anesthesia holding area to 24 hours postoperatively) 
in morphine equivalents.  We assume that the IV acetaminophen is ass ociated with a decreased 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_14023] [ADDRESS_13378] size of 0.4 with a significance level 0. 05, a sample size of 200 achieves 80% 
power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups in the mean values of total opi[INVESTIGATOR_14024]. Assuming approximately 15% of participants will not complete the study after consenting (e.g., due to  COVID cancellations, surgical changes, PI [INVESTIGATOR_14025]), we plan to enroll  265 subjects.  
6.  DATA ANALYSIS    
All analyses of this study will be based on the principle of modified intention- to-treat (ITT).  
Patients who did not undergo surgery or who did not receive the study drug prior to surgery will 
be excluded from the analysis.  
6.1 Analysis of primary outcome:  
The primary outcome is the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_14004] (when the first dose of 
acetaminophen is administered in the pre- anesthesia holding area) to [ADDRESS_13379] -operatively 
in morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Pain as measured by [CONTACT_14044] a 0 -10 numeric rating scale (NRS) administered between 20 and 24 hours 
postoperatively will be a second primary outcome, with gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_14026].  
RSRB# [ZIP_CODE]  
 1-13-2023  
13 We anticipate some missing data in the study. Subjects who do not undergo surgery or who do 
not receive the study drug prior to undergoing surgery will be excluded from the analysis (the 
missing data here are assumed to be missing completely at random [MCA R]). For remaining 
missing data on the primary outcome, we will assume that the data are missing at random 
(MAR), which means that the missing data only depend on observed factors.  In this case, we 
will model the probability that a patient’s data are miss ing on the primary outcome with logistic 
regression conditional on patient demographics (age, sex, BMI), and the type of surgery (donor 
nephrectomy versus nephrectomy for cancer). For the primary analysis, inverse probability 
weighted (IPW) semiparametric linear regression analysis will be used to study the effect of 
group indicator, adjusting for, age, sex, BMI, type of surgery (donor nephrectomy versus nephrectomy for cancer) and block (yes vs. no). The primary analysis will be performed first for 
the tot al opi[INVESTIGATOR_14027]. If the treatment effect for that analysis is positive, the similar 
analysis will be repeated for the pain score. Sensitivity analyses will be performed that do not 
include the block as a covariate because the block is often admini stered after the first dose of 
experimental Tylenol, although the choice to administer the block is not based on pain or distress or any other outcomes that are related to success of analgesia. We will also perform a 
per-protocol analysis in which only subjects who received all [ADDRESS_13380] size larger than 0.3 
would support a conclusion that the disadvantages do not outweigh the benefits of using IV 
Tylenol. We will use the 95% con fidence intervals of the primary (opi[INVESTIGATOR_14028]) and key 
secondary outcome (pain score) to determine whether an effect size of 0.3 can be ruled out (i.e., 
the 95% CI excludes an effect size of 0.3). This interpretation will be limited as it is not the 
primary  objective of the study, but will be more likely to be an accurate conclusion given the 
prespecification of the parameters upon which to conclude the study supports a truly negative 
result rather than an inconclusive result.  
6.2 Analysis of secondary outcomes:  
Inverse probability weighted semiparametric linear regression or logistic regression method, as 
appropriate, will be used to analyze the secondary outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, type 
of surgery (donor nephrectomy versus nephrectomy for cancer), and  block (yes v. no).  
6.3 The significance level is set at 0.05 for each analysis.  All analyses will be implemented with 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC).  
7. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
Potential Risk.  
There are minimal risks to the subjects associated with this clinical study.  The use of 
acetaminophen is currently used pre -, intra -, and post -operatively with various surgical 
procedures.  Subjects will be excluded if they have any known co- morbidities t hat pose a risk

The most common rare side effects that may occur are skin rash, shortness of breath, chest 
pain, problems with blood, headache and liver damage or failure (with chronic use). Subjects will 
be monitored throughout the post -surgical time and any potential si de effects will be evaluated 
and treated as standard of care. If subjects have any concerns about potential side effects of the 
study medication subjects can discuss this with the study team.  
Potential Benefits to the Subjects .  
Subjects potentially may have improved pain control post procedure that can facilitate recovery 
time.  
Alternatives to Participation .  
Subjects can elect not to participate in this clinical study.  
Costs  
There will be no cost to research subjects to participate in this study.  All study medications will 
be covered under this research protocol.

8. DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING:    
The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be composed of:  
Raymond Zollo, MD (Anesthesiology) Chair  
Richard Wissler, MD, PhD (Anesthesiology) Biostatistician 
After clinical data collection is complete for the initial 6- [ADDRESS_13381] being rela ted to participation in 
the study.  Any determination that the adverse event is possibly or likely related to participation, or that the DSMB association of causality differs from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_14029].   The distribution of adverse events will be compared between 
the IV acetaminophen and placebo group (statistical testing may be deferred until sufficient 
completor data is available to reduce the possibility of Type I error).   If it is determined that 
there is a statistical difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups, then 
enrollment in the study will be stopped with this reported to the RSRB. If the study is stopped by 
[CONTACT_14035]# [ADDRESS_13382].  Adverse events will be 
considered possibly related (ie a suspected adverse drug reaction) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257].   
All members of the DSMB have agreed to perform in this role and have no relevant conflicts of 
interest.

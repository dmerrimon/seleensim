System (Evolute®) in Subjects with Elevated Intraocular Pressure 
SPONSOR : Mati Therapeutics Inc.  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, OPEN- LABEL: The Travoprost Evolute (Travoprost 
Punctal Plug Deliver y System)  is an L -shaped, silicone punctal plug with a drug eluting core that 
contains travoprost (active).  The Travoprost Evolute is pre -loaded onto a disposable inserter  tip 
and individually packaged and sterilized to prevent contamination. The Travoprost Evolute is 
stored at  refrigerated temperature.   
Travoprost Evolute System  
 
NUMBER OF SITES : Up to 8 sites within the U.S.A.  
STUDY POPULATION: Up to 30 qualified male or female subjects (~ 30 qualified  eyes) who 
have given HIPAA and informed consent, have met all screening, washout  and treatment phase 
inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study, will be enrolled and will receive a Travoprost Evolute 
inserted in to the lower punctum of each eye.  
STUDY OBJECTIVE : Using a punctal plug delivery system ( Evolute ) to deliver a hypotensive 
(travoprost) drug to the eye, evaluate the safety and ocular effects of a Travoprost Evolute system 
in reducing intraocular pressure in individuals diagnosed with OAG or OH. STUDY DESIGN: This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], open- label, multi- center clinical study.  Each potential subject 
that has given HIPAA and informed consent and has meet all screening inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will undergo a six-week washout  phase where they will discontinue the use of their topi[INVESTIGATOR_689581]. In ad dition, during the washout phase, each potential study subject will 
also discontinue the use of all prohibited systemic medications. 
After the six-week washout , each potential subject will return for a baseline visit (Visit 2) . 
Investigators will verify that a potential subject has discontinued the use of their topi[INVESTIGATOR_689581](s) and all their prohibited systemic medications for the last [ADDRESS_935384] discontinued the use of all other ocular drops, gels or ointments 
24 hours prior to the visit (Visit 2) and continues to meet all screening and washout criteria. After

 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements.  
2.1 Background Information 
Open -angle glaucoma (OAG) is a chronic ocular disorder characterized by [CONTACT_689643] (IOP) with clinical signs of v isual field loss and/or optic nerve damage with patients rarely 
experience any ocular symptoms. If the condition is left untreated, irreversible vision loss due to 
optic nerve damage will occur. The effect of elevated IOP on the optic nerve is gradual , leading to 
vision loss that patients may not realizes until they have irreversibly lost a majority of their vision.  
Based on estimates from the World Health Organization and the Glaucoma Foundation, this chronic disease is believed to affect approximately 67 to 105 million people worldwide 
(Leonard  2002) and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. In 2011, 2.[ADDRESS_935411] OAG.  
Treatment however of OAG/ OH by [CONTACT_689644] a disease where compliance tends to be a significant 
problem due to the fact patients lack positive feedback from treatment. Treatment benefits with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_689586] , which is not noticeable by [CONTACT_1962] . 
Treatment compliance is therefore a key issue in the successful control of OAG/OH and the 
prevention of vision loss. Traditionally, the term compliance has been employed to mean the extent 
to which a patient  remembers  and complies with the physician 's advice of when , and amount of 
medication to use. When treating a condition with an ocular drop from a bottle , treatment also 
depends upon the patient s’ physical ability to properly instill/place the correct amount of the 
medication /drop on the eye . A patients’ ability to correctly self-administer  ocular drops can be 
affected by a number of factors such as coordination, manual dexterity, n, good vision, all of which 
tend to decrease in aging glaucoma patients , and the presence of co -morbid conditions (Choy et 
al. 2019). Study has also shown tha t adding a second medication is associated with a statistically 
significant decrease in compliance ( Robin 2005). 
Effective treatment of OAG/ OH is compounded if the drop is not appropriately placed on the eye. 
The ideal location for instilling/placing  of an eye drop is in the eyelid cul -de-sac, or directly onto 
the surface of the eye. Due to patient s having difficulty holding the eyelid open or unable to control 
reflex blinking during installation, results in ma ny missed glaucoma eye drops over time and can 
lead to suboptimal treatment or costly wasting of medication. In addition, m any OAG/OH patients, 
find it difficult applying the correct amount of pressure to the bottle to release only one drop at a 
time.

 Primary risk factors for silicone  punctal plugs  for use in humans are ocular discomfort, epi[INVESTIGATOR_119230], 
loss of plug, ocular inflammation, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. Less common, but serious, 
side effects are pyogenic granuloma, damage to the muscle at the opening of the punctum, 
canaliculitis, or migration of the plug into the canalicula requ iring irrigation or surgery. In previous 
studies using models of the proprietary plugs, adverse reaction s (AEs) were noted in subjects, 
including device migration, lacrimation increased, ocular discomfort, eye irritation, conjunctival 
hyperemia, inflammation of lacrimal passage, eye pain, and eyelid ede ma. 
2.3.[ADDRESS_935418] Evolute® is the ability to deliver a sustain release of 
travoprost over a 90-day period, reducing a patient’s elevated IOP while eliminating his/her need 
to remember to correctly self -administer an eye drop on a daily basis  at a specific time of day . 
Additional benefits would include, relieving the difficult y some patients have instilling an ocular 
drop, or the uncertainty  they may have  if they properly instilled his/her drops. Uncertainty of drop 
instillation c an lead to either under dosing (drop instilled improperly) or overdosing , patient 
instilled first drop properly however, believes drop was not dosed properl y and instills a second  
drop. 
A summary of known benefits to humans of 0.004% or 0.003% travoprost ophthalmic drops can 
be found in the TRAVATAN®, TRAVATAN Z® or IZBA ® prescribing information (see Appendices  
I, J & K). 
[ADDRESS_935419] clinical studies with topi[INVESTIGATOR_689590] 0.004% and 0.003% ophthalmic solutions of travoprost 
(TRAVATAN/TRAVATAN Z  and IZBA ) have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of travo prost 
ocular drops in the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open- angle glaucoma 
or ocular hypertension. The objective for this study is to evaluate the use of a punctal plug delivery 
system  that can deliver a sustained, safe and effective concentration of travoprost to a subject with 
OAG/OH that can reduce elevated intraocular pressure. 
[ADDRESS_935420] that has given HIPAA 
and informed consent and has meet all screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will discontinue the 
use of his/her topi[INVESTIGATOR_689585](s) for the next six-weeks.  In addition, during this 
perio d a potential study subject will also discontinue the use of all prohibited systemic medications, 
and all other ocular drops, gels or ointments that have not been prescribed by [CONTACT_093]  24-
hours prior to Visit 2.

system products have a retest  date indicated on their label . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_935453] Evolute is for single -patient use only. The procedures for inserting a study plug 
are similar to those for commercial silicone plugs  and procedures for insertion of a study plug  are 
detailed in Appendices F & G. If the size of the study subject puncta ha s not be measured, gauge 
(Appendix E ) the size of each punctum prior to dilating. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Determining Punctum Size (see  Appendix E  for detailed instructions ) 
Anesthetize the area around the lower punctum of each eye. Use a C oroneo P unctal Gauge  
(Figure 5) to determine the size of the punctum.  
NOTE:  Measurement of the punctum size should be evaluated prior to dilating the 
punctum.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dilation of the Lower Punctum ( Appendix F  for detailed  instructions) 
Prior to inserting a Travoprost Evolute , it is required that the lower punctum must be dilated to  
at least 1.[ADDRESS_935454]’s eye.  
a. If required, measurement of the punctum size should be evaluated prior to dilating the punctum. 
b. Procedure for dilating the punctum to at least 1.[ADDRESS_935455] for 15 to 30 
seconds to allow the sphincter to fully relax. 
NOTE : For  small puncta, hold and rotate the dilator in the punctum and canaliculus for as 
long as required to achieve dilation to 1.[ADDRESS_935456] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67  
 
Version 3:  08 Apr 22  31 Mati Therapeutics Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL  
 time. Dilation may require very firm pressure however; care must be taken NOT 
to apply excessive force to dilate the punctum . Add more anesthesia if needed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedure for Insertion of a Travoprost Evolute® (Appendix G  for detailed instructions ) 
Lubricants are NOT to be used to insert a Travoprost Evolute. Physicians inserting the study 
plug will have been briefed with the instructions and guidelines. It is recommended that the 
punctum be dilated to at least [ADDRESS_935457] Evolute is appropriately positioned.  
NOTE:  The punctum may constrict before the plug can be inserted, additional dilation 
would then be required. If a plug is partially inserted (e.g., cap not flush with the lid margin) the plug should be removed and the punctum re- dilated or dilated to a 
larger diameter.  
If the Travoprost Evolute cannot be inserted after a few attempts with gentle dilation, the subject 
is not eligible for the study.   
6.1.[ADDRESS_935458] Evolute on his/her 
own. In addition, instruct the subject to restrict eye rubbing, swimming, scuba diving, or other 
actions or activities that may result in physical manipula tion of the eye region. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_935459] Evolute ( Appendix E for detailed instructions) 
The Travoprost Evolute should be removed from the study subject’s lower puncta using sterile 
ophthalmic forceps, such a s Castroviejo Suture forceps (Appendix H , Figure 6) or similar toothed 
forceps , with a gentle tugging motion.  A drop of anesthetic may be administered if necessary.  
NOTE:  Removal of a Travoprost Evolute immediately after insertion may result in 
the cap of the plug being torn off ; the Investigator should wait at least 24 hours 
after insertion before attempting to remove a study plug . Use of a jeweler’s forceps 
is not advisable 
a. Care must be taken not to grasp the outermost edge of the  cap on the punctal plug as this may 
cause the cap to tear and separate  
b. The motion to remove the plug should be towards the medial canthus (not up or temporally) 
If the cap becomes separated, try to remove the plug using toothed 0.12 forceps (0.12 Castrovi ejo 
forceps or similar) by [CONTACT_106244][INVESTIGATOR_689596].  If this is not possible, 
and only if you feel comfortable doing so, you may attempt to irrigate the canal until the plug flushes out of the nasolacrimal duct.

 NOTE : Study plugs are larger than commercially available silicone plugs and may become 
lodged in the canal more easily. Referral to tertiary care is advised in cases where 
the plug cannot be retrieved by [CONTACT_689656]/milking through the punctal opening or by [CONTACT_689657].  
6.1.8 Unable to Insert/Extruded/Lost Travoprost Evolute
® 
If either eye of a study subject cannot be dilated to at least [ADDRESS_935461] will not be eligible 
for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unable to Insert Travoprost Evolute 
If a Travoprost Evolute cannot be inserted af ter a few attempts with dilation, the subject will not 
be eligible for the study.  Lubricants are NOT  to be used .  
NOTE:  If the first attempt to insert a plug was successful however, the investigator is 
unable to insert the second plug, the first plug will be removed and the subject will 
be discontinued from the study. Removal of a Travoprost Evolute  immediately 
after insertion may result in the cap of the plug being torn off ; the Investigator 
should wait at least 24 hours after insertion of the study plug . Retain the plug for 
accountability of investigational supplies. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Extrusion of a Travoprost Evolute 
A study subject that has noticed a study plug has been extruded or los t during the treatment phase, 
the study subject should immediately contact [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her staff and return to the 
Investigator’s office as soon as possible . If the study subject can find the extruded plug, they should 
return with the plug  where the Investigator and/or his/her staff will collect  and retained the plug 
for investigational supply accountability. If the return plug has torn or has separated, report this as 
a technical complaint ( Section 8.6). If a study plug has been lost, the Investigator will retro -
illuminate or palpate the canaliculi to confirm the plug has not migrated into the canal. Information regarding the loss of any plug must be recorded in the source documents, CRFs and Accountability Logs.  
If a single plug has been extruded during the study , the Investigator will re -insert a new plug and 
instruct the study subject to return to the investigator office based on their originally study visit(s)  
scheduled . At any time during the study, a study subject experiences a second extrusions or a n 
extrusion in the fellow eye , the study subject will return to the Investigator’s office as soon as 
possible and will have the remaining plug removed. The study subject will be discontinued from the study and WILL be replaced.

 6.2 Study Plug Accountability Procedures  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining the study treatment (punctal plugs) accountability 
log, which will contain inventory records acknowledging the receipt and dispensing of all study plugs. The study center will keep a complete accounting of all used, unused, damaged, extruded and lost study plugs. All lost/extruded study  plugs must be recorded into the accountability log 
and on the CRFs of the study subject who lost/extruded a study plug, noting the suspected date the study plug was lost/extruded.  
All used and unused study plugs must be accounted for and kept in the desi gnated secure area at 
the study center until the Sponsor provides instructions for the return of all study materials. Final 
accountability for investigational study plugs will be verified by [CONTACT_1052]/or their representatives and considered complete when the study plugs are no longer actively used and all 
study plugs (used, unused, extruded, lost) have been accounted for and returned to the Sponsor.

Version 3:  08 Apr 22  45 Mati Therapeutics Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL  
 To optimize consistency of A E/SAE reporting across sites, the study subject will be asked a 
standard question to elicit any AE/SAE . At each study visit or telephone evaluation of the study 
subject, study personnel will ask the following question:   
"Have you had any problems since your last visit?" 
8.2 Definitions  
8.2.1 Adverse Event  
Adverse Event (AE):  any un anticipated sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the administration of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product or device.  
Medical conditions or diseases present before a subject starts study treatment are only considered 
AEs if they worsen after the subject starts study treatment.  
8.2.2 Serious Adverse Event 
Serious A dverse Event (SAE): defined as any AE that (at any dose):  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening.  NOTE:  The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more intense  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• May jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if these events should 
be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
In addition, an AE that results in overdose or produces congenital abnormality or cancer is always 
considered an SAE.  
A subject admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of an AE, even if released on the same day, would 
qualify for inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  An emergency room visit that results in admission to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689605].  However, emergency room visits that do 
not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689606], instead, should be evaluated for one of the other criteria for SAEs (e.g., life -threatening AE or medically 
significant event).  
IND [ADDRESS_935493] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67  
 
Version 3:  [ADDRESS_935494] has elective surgery for a condition present at 
screening  into the study, and the condition did not worsen during the study, the reason for elective 
surgery, and resulting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (if applicable), should not be considered or reported as an 
SAE.  Surgery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689607]. For AEs that 
result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, refers to a substantial disruption of a subject's ability to carry out normal life functions.  
The investigator must also submit documentation of the following to the Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, or Research Ethics Board (collectively referred to as an IRB):  
• Site-specific SAEs and follow -up: The type of serious event that must be submitted (e.g., all 
or only suspected), as well as the required timing of submission (e.g., within 10 days of 
occurrence), is defined by [CONTACT_689667]/guidance from regulatory authorities.  
• Any documentation provided by [CONTACT_689668]:  The 
Sponsor will provide documentation of reportable events to the investigator, as specified in 
Section 8.7. 
The investigator should ensure that the subject receives appropriate medical treatment and that the subject is fo llowed up until the SAE resolves or becomes chronic, as defined in Section 8.4. 
8.3 Adverse Event Descriptions  
8.3.1 Intensity 
The intensity of AEs will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, as follows: 
• Mild: Usually transient, req uiring no special treatment, and does not interfere with the 
subject's daily activities  
• Moderate:  Introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere 
with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_689669]  
• Severe:  Significantly interferes with a subject's usual daily activities and requires systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment, if available  
8.3.[ADDRESS_935495] medical judgment, as follows: 
• Suspected:  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with use of the study 
treatment, such as a temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration, or 
IND [ADDRESS_935496] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67  
 
Version 3:  08 Apr 22  47 Mati Therapeutics Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL  
 when other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event 
• Not suspected:  A relationship between the AE and the study treatment can reasonably be ruled 
out based on lack of any temporal rel ationship of the event to study treatment administration, 
or when the subject's underlying condition, medical history, or other therapy provide sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
8.[ADDRESS_935497], all AEs will be followed until they resolve or 
become chronic (as judged by [CONTACT_093]).  
At the final study visit, new AEs, as well as follow -up information for continuing AEs, will be 
recorded in the CRF and source document. If an SAE (defined in Section 8.2.2)  is unresolved at 
the final study visit, it will be followed by [CONTACT_689670] (as 
judged by [CONTACT_093]).  Follow- up data for such SAEs will be recorded in the source document 
and reported to the safety monitors (refer to Section 8.7.2).  Non-serious ongoing AEs will be 
followed beyond the final study visit at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the source documents.   
8.[ADDRESS_935498] follow -up data regarding the pregnancy, birth, and status of the child. The Sponsor will 
provide special CRFs for data collection in the case of pregnancy.  Follow- up should be continued 
until study close -out at the study site . After close -out, the Sponsor's Safety designee will continue 
to obtain follow-up information. 
Pregnancy should be recorded as a protocol deviation. Pregnancy is not an AE; however, any 
complication related to pregnancy would be considered an AE.

8.6.3 Punctal Plug Delivery System Serious Adverse Events and Technical Complaints 
The Sponsor will evaluate all SAE reports and technical complaints received in the study to 
determine if the report meets the definition of an unanticipated A DE. Unanticipated A DEs are 
defined  as follows:

 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The primary analysis population will be an ITT (Intent -to-Treat) analysis for all study subjects 
who had the lower puncta of each eye inserted with a study punctal plug and had no major protocol 
violations. Individual study subjects or individual visits may be excluded if a major protocol 
violation occurs (such as violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria or non- compliance with protocol 
requirements that can potentially have significant i mpact on study outcomes).   
10.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The Null Hypothesis:  There are no differences between baseline and follow -up visit intraocular 
pressure values  
Alternative Hypothesis:  There are differences between baseline and follow -up visit intraocular 
pressure values  
10.3 Analysis of Datasets 
Data will be pooled from all study sites for data analysis, unless otherwise specified.  Study dataset 
will be generated (keypunched) from original (white) case report forms (CRFs) that have been 
reviewed and collected from clinical sites.  Dataset will contain rows of individual subject data; 
each row will be clearly labeled with the study subject assigned study  number and initials. Each 
column of the dataset will contain a specific parameter for all study subjects.   
10.4 Description of Statistical Methods  
10.4.1 General Approach  
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, etc.) will be provided for all continuous 
variables and frequency distributions will be generated for all categorical variables collected in this study.  Analyses of the intent -to-treat (ITT) data set, will include all data from all subjects with 
a recorded screening visit IOP OU.  Per protocol (PP) analyses dataset, will exclude data from 
subjects or visits with significant protocol deviati ons (e.g., IOPs obtained before 8:00 AM and 
after 10:00 AM will be excluded). 
10.4.2 Analysis of Primary Study Variable  
The primary study outcome variable will be the change in IOP at Visit s 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Day s 7, 28, 
[ADDRESS_935515] -insertion) compared with the Baseline IOP (Visit 2, Day 0 ), obtained between

 Appendix C  
Examination Tests/ Procedures  and Equipment  
1. TESTS/PROCEDURES  
a. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  
Throughout the study, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) will be taken with the subject 
in the sitting position after the subject has rested for at least five minutes.  Blood pressures 
may be determined manually with a blood pressure cuff and auscultation or with an automated Blood Pr essure monitor. Heart rates may be determined electronically with an 
automated Blood Pressure monitor. Manually obtained heart rates should be recorded after a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_935554] (Infrared) thermometer or orally. Oral 
temperatures should not be taken within five minutes of ingestion of any food or drink 
c. Visual Acuity  
Best-corrected distance visual acuity will be measured using a Snellen chart while the subject 
is wearing his or her glasses. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_689597] a Snellen chart 
while the subject is looking through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_58163]. The test distance and lighting conditions specified for the investigator’s chart must be used and kept constant throughout 
the study. 
d. Automated Perimetry  
Full threshold visual fields will be measured using a Humphrey's Visual Field Analyzer 
(manufactured by [CONTACT_689660]., Dublin, CA) with at least a standard full -threshold 
24-2 program or Swedish interactive threshold algorithm (SITA) program. Visual fields 
measured up to SIX months  before the Screening Visit are acceptable to fulfill the screening 
procedure. 
e. Pachymetry  
Corneal thickness can be measured by [CONTACT_689661], such as ultrasound and confocal microscopy (CONFOSCAN), noncontact [CONTACT_689662] a single Scheimpflug camera (such as SIRIUS or PENTACAM), dual Scheimpflug camera (such as GALILEI), or Optical Cohe rence Tomography (OCT), such as Visante.  Corneal thickness 
data that is documented in the patient chart is acceptable to fulfill the screening procedure.  
f. Evaluation of Slit- Lamp Findings (Lids, Cornea, Conjunctiva)  
The severity of a sign will be graded  by [CONTACT_689684]:  
NONE (0) = Normal ;  
TRACE (1) = Slightly visible;  
MILD (2) = Somewhat visible and diffuse;  
IND [ADDRESS_935555] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67

 MODERATE (3) = Visible and diffuse;  
SEVERE (4) = Extremely visible and  dense 
g. Intraocular Pressure Measurements  
(see Appendix D for details)  
h. Dilated Fundus Examination 
Using an ophthalmoscope, the investigator will examine the back part of the eye (fundus), 
including the retina, optic disc, choroid and blood vessels. 
i. Position Evaluation of the Study Plug 
Study plug position will be evaluated as either: 
• Normal  
• Present but requires adjustment 
• Extruded/Recovered  
• Extruded/Lost 
Othe r 
j. Punctal Measurements  
(see Appendix E  for details)  
k. Adverse Event /Adverse Device Event  
To optimize consistency of AE reporting across centers, the subject will be asked a standard 
question to elicit any AEs. At each study visit or telephone evaluation of the subject, study personnel (non-observer) will ask the following question:   
"Have you had any problems since your last visit?"  
2. EQUIPMENT  
a. Coroneo Punctal Gauge 
Description  
The Coroneo Punctal Gauge ( Figure 5) is designed to aid the physician in determine the size 
of the punctum. In addition, the instrument provides a simple and controlled method for 
punctal dilation prior to plug insertion. 
The system consists of a single handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], with gauging and dilation marks at each end. The 
instrument is manufactured from medical grade Titanium, and is autoclavable. A ll Coroneo 
Gauges are shipped with tip protectors which must be removed before use, cleaning, 
disinfecting, or sterilizing.  
For proper measurement and insertion of punctal plugs, the following procedures are 
recommended. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_689614]. ALWAYS measure the punctum first before dilation . See

Procedure for Performing Applanation Tonometry  
Goldmann applanation tonometry will be used for measuring the intraocular pressures (IOP) of 
each eye. Just prior to the start of the study, the tonometer should be calibrated  and at least 
once every month  during the duration of the study . 
Accurate and precise IOP readings are imperative, studies have found tight collars, ties or other 
restrictive clothing around the neck may cause an increase in venous pressure when the patient 
extends his or her neck forward, resulting in an inaccurately high IOP reading. Have a patient 
loosen any collars or neckties that may be restrictive to obtain an accurate measuremen t. 
The IOP of each eye will be measured by a qualified evaluator [Study investigator, Co-
investigator(s) or Sub- investigator(s)].  If there is more than one evaluator in the office, the same 
individual and the same Goldmann applanation tonometer used to mea sure the screening IOPs 
should be used to take measurements at all study visits.  
NOTE:  Study subjects IOP measurements must be evaluated between 8:00 and 10:00 AM  
Measuring and Recording of IOPs  
A topi[INVESTIGATOR_689615]. Afterwar ds a fluorescein strip or drop will be 
placed onto the cul -de-sac of each eye. The IOP will be measured by [CONTACT_689688]. When the evaluator  has obtained a desired endpoint (i.e., mires 
of equal size, centered in the field, with the inner surfaces of the circles "kissing" ), the tip can be 
withdrawn from the cornea ( Figure 4-B). 
Figure [ADDRESS_935560] end point :(diagram “B”):  
Inner  edges of the semi -circles

PROCEDURE FOR GAUGING (MEASURING) PUNCTUM SIZE  
The Coroneo Punctal Gage  (Figure 5) is a reusable double -ended instrument that allows you to 
gauge the size of the puncta from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm. Do not dilate the punctum before gauging 
the size of the punctum. 
Figure 5 
Coroneo Punctal Gage  
 
 Expanded view of the 
punctal gauge tips  
 
NOTE : Care should be taken when gauging the punctum  not to perforate the punctal 
sphincter . If the size of the study subject puncta has not be measured, gauge) the 
size of each punctum prior to dilating.  
1. The study subject may be seated at the slit-lamp or placed in a reclined position 
2. Anesthetize the area around the lower punctum  
NOTE : Placing a drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_689616]. Then adding lidocaine gel on a cotton- tipped swab 
and placing the swab directly on the lower punctum of the eye for [ADDRESS_935564] gauge tip (0.5, 0.6, 0.7) of the Coroneo gage  
5. Gently insert the tip of the gauge in to the punctum vertically  
6. Once the horizontal canaliculus has been reached,  if necessary, gently turn the instrument 
horizontally to continue inserting past the vertical canaliculus.   
7. If the instrument can be inserted past the third ring on the tip of the Coroneo gage  without 
observing tightening of the punctal ring – stop and  remove the gauge  
8. Repeat the above procedure using the larger end of the Coroneo gage  (0.8, 0.9, 1.0) 
9. When tightening of the punctal ring is observed around the instrument read the appropriate 
size from the gauge.  There are three “grooves” in each en d of the gauge that correspond 
to the three sizes indicated on the handle  
10. Record the punctal size in the appropriate section of the case report form.  
If gauging the size of the punctum is immediately followed by [CONTACT_689689] ([COMPANY_003]S), refer to Appendix F for details regarding the dilation of the lower punctum.

PROCEDURE FOR DILATION OF THE PUNCTUM  
Use the C oroneo Punctal Gage ( Figure 5) to dilate the punctum. If the size of the study subject 
puncta have not be en measured , gauge  (Appendix E ) the size of each  punctum prior to dilating . 
NOTE : Care should be taken when dilating the punctum not to perforate the punctal 
sphincter .  Dilating and inserting the punctal plug delivery system ([COMPANY_003]S) 
should be performed on ONE  eye at a time . 
1. The study subject may be seated at the slit- lamp or placed i n a reclined position. The 
following s teps 1 -6 are the same procedure used to measure (gauge) the size of the 
punctum 
2. Anesthetize the area around the lower punctum  
NOTE : Placing a drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_689616]. Then adding lidocaine gel on a cotton- tipped swab 
and placing the swab directly on the lower punctum of the eye for [ADDRESS_935566] gauge tip (0.5, 0.6, 0.7) of the Coroneo gage  
5. Gently insert the tip of the gauge in to the punctum vertically  
6. Once the horizontal canaliculus has been reached,  if necessary, gently turn the instrument 
horizontally to continue inserting past the vertical canaliculus  as you gently dilate 
7. Once the instrument is inserted past the third ring on the tip of the Coroneo gage , repeat  the 
above procedure using the larger end of the Coroneo gauge (0.8, 0.9, 1.0) 
8. The punctum must be dilated to at least 1.[ADDRESS_935567] for 20 to 30 seconds to allow the sphincter to fully relax. During 
this time  prepare the [COMPANY_003]S to be inserted . 
NOTE : For small puncta, hold and rotate the dilator in the punctum and canaliculus 
for as long as required to achieve dilation to 1.0 mm. This may take some considerable time (1 -2 minutes). Dilation may require very firm pressure 
however; care must be taken NOT to apply excessive force to dilate the 
punctum . Add more anesthesia if needed.

PROCEDURES FOR INSERTION  OF A [COMPANY_003]S  
The procedure for inserting Mati’s [COMPANY_003]S punctal plug is similar to those for commercial plugs.  
Mati’s [COMPANY_003]S is for single -patient use only .  
NOTE:   Do not use a lubricant when inserting the plug , this may facilitate inadvertent 
plug intrusion below the punctal opening. 
1. Once the punctum has been dilated to 1.[ADDRESS_935569]’s punctum 
4. Insert the plug, coming straight down perpendicular to the punctum until the cap of the plug 
is flush with the lid margin  
5. Once the plug is in the proper position, release the lower lid and press the release button and 
pull the insertion instrument away from the study subject’s punctum 
After insertion, the punctal opening should be visually inspected using a slit -lamp to confirm the 
retention and proper placement of the [COMPANY_003]S, with the cap still visible. The position of the [COMPANY_003]S 
may be adjusted with forceps or the tip of the inserter if necessary. However, if unable to position the cap of the plug flush with the lid margin , the plug should be removed and the punctum re -
dilated or dilated to a larger diameter. Placement of the plug can then be re -attempted. Multiple 
attempts are sometimes necessary  
NOTE : Removal of a properly positioned [COMPANY_003]S immediately after insertion may result in 
the cap of the plug being torn off. Investigator should wait until the following day 
to allow the punctal sphincter to adjust (relax) before attempting to remove a [COMPANY_003]S. If the plug tears or separates, report this as a technical complaint ( Section  
8.6.3). Retain all removed or damaged [COMPANY_003]S for accountability of investigational supplies.   
If the [COMPANY_003]S cannot be inserted after a few attempts with gentle dilation, the subject is not eligible for the study.

If the cap becomes separated, removal of the plug can be attempted using toothed 0.12 forceps 
(0.12 Castroviejo forceps or similar) by [CONTACT_106244][INVESTIGATOR_689596]. If this is not possible, and it does not appear that the plug will lodge in the canal, and only if the investigator feels comfortable doing so, he or she may attempt to irrigate the canal until the plug flushes out of the nasolacrimal duct.

TRAVATAN® (travoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.004% Sterile  
DESCRIPTION  
TRAVAT AN® (travoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.004% Sterile DESCRIPTION Travoprost is a 
synthetic prostaglandin F2α analogue. Its chemical name [CONTACT_386138] (Z)-7[(1R,2R,3R,5S)-3,5-
dihydroxy-2-[(1E,3R)-3-hydroxy-4- [(α,α,α- trifluoro -m-tolyl)oxy] -lbutenyl]cyclopent yl]-5-
heptenoate. It has a molecular formula of C26H35F3O6 and a molecular weight of 500.56.  The chemical structure of travoprost is:  
 
Travoprost is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow oil that is very soluble in acetonitrile, methanol, octanol, and chloroform. It is practically insoluble in water.  
TRAVATAN® Ophthalmic Solution 0.004% is supplied as sterile, buffered aqueous solution of 
travoprost with a pH of approximately 6.0 and an osmolality of approximately 290 mOsmol/kg.  
Each mL of TRAVATAN® 0.004% contains [ADDRESS_935574]. Benzalkonium chloride 0.015% is 
added as a preservative. Inactive Ingredients are: polyoxyl 40 hydrogenate d castor oil, 
tromethamine, boric acid, mannitol, edetate disodium, sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid (to adjust pH) and purified water. 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Mechanism of Action  
Travoprost free acid is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce 
intraocular pressure by [CONTACT_689690]. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.  
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics  
Absorption:  Travoprost is absorbed through the cornea and is hydrolyzed to the ac tive free acid. 
Data from four multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies (totaling 107 subjects) have shown that 
plasma concentrations of the free acid are below 0.01 ng/ml (the quantitation limit of the assay) in two-thirds of the subjects. In those individuals with quantifiable plasma concentrations (N=38), 
the mean plasma Cmax was 0.018 ± 007 ng/ml (ranged 0.01 to 0.052 ng/mL) and was reached 

IND [ADDRESS_935575] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67  
 
Version 3:  [ADDRESS_935576] a plasma half -life of 45 
minutes. There was no difference in plasma concentrations between Days 1 and 7, indicating 
steady -state was reached early and that there was no significant accumulation.  
Metabolism: Travoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by [CONTACT_689691]. Systemically, travoprost free acid is metabolized to inactive 
metabolites via beta -oxidation of the α (carboxylic acid) chain to give the 1,2- dinor and 1,2,3,4-
tetranor analogs, via oxidation of the 15 -hydroxyl moiety, as well as v ia reduction of the 13,14-
double bond.  
Elimination: The elimination of travoprost free acid from plasma was rapid and levels were 
generally below the limit of quantification within one hour after dosing.  The terminal elimination half-life of travoprost free acid was estimated from fourteen subjects and ranged from 17 minutes 
to 86 minutes with the mean half -life of 45 minutes.  Less than 2% of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_689618] [ADDRESS_935577] free acid.  
Clinical Studies  
In clinical studies, patients with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and baseline pressure 
of 25 - 27 mmHg who were treated with TRAVATAN® Ophthalmic Solution 0.004% dosed once -
daily in the evening demonstrated 7 - 8 mmHg reductions in intraocular pressure. In subgroup 
analyses of these studies, mean IOP reduction in black patients was up to 1.8 mmHg greater than 
in non- black patients. It is not known at this time whether this difference is attributed to race or to 
heavily pi[INVESTIGATOR_463279]. In a multi -center, randomized, controlled trial, patients with mean 
baseline intraocular pressure of 24 - 26 mmHg on TIMOPTIC* 0.5% BID who were treated with 
TRAVATAN® 0.004% dosed QD adjunctively to TIMOPTIC* 0.5% BID demonstrated 6 - 7 
mmHg reductions in intraocular pressure.  
TRAVATAN® has been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and also in patients with renal 
impairment.  No clinically relevant changes in hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis laboratory data were observed in these pati ents.  
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE  
TRAVATAN® Ophthalmic Solution is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open- angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are intolerant of other intraocular 
pressure lowering medications or  insufficiently responsive (failed to achieve target IOP 
determined after multiple measurements over time) to another intraocular pressure lowering medication.

 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
TRAVATAN® is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to travoprost, benzalkonium 
chloride or any other ingredients in this product.  
WARNINGS  
TRAVATAN® has been reported to cause changes to pi[INVESTIGATOR_193879]. The most frequently 
reported changes have been increased pi[INVESTIGATOR_689619] (eyel id) 
and increased pi[INVESTIGATOR_689620]. These changes may be permanent . 
TRAVATAN® may gradually change eye color, increasing the amount of brown pi[INVESTIGATOR_689621] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_689588]) in melanocytes. The long -
term effects on the melanocytes and the consequences of potential injury to the melanocytes and/or deposition of pi[INVESTIGATOR_689589]. The change in iris color occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for months to years. Patients should be informed of the possibility of iris color change.  
Eyelid skin darkening has been reported in association with the use of TRAVATAN®.  TRAVATAN® may gradually change eyelashes in the treated eye; these changes inclu de 
increased length, thickness, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and/or number of lashes.  Patients who are expected to receive treatment in only one eye should be informed about the 
potential for increased brown pi[INVESTIGATOR_386067], periorbital and/or eyelid tissue, and eyelashes in the treated eye and thus heterochromia between the eyes. They should also be advised of the potential for a disparity between the eyes in length, thickness, and/or number of eyelashes. 
PRECAUTIONS  
General  
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple -dose containers 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_689622]. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by [CONTACT_689692], in most cases, had a concurrent cornea1 disease or a disruption of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_200071] (see 
Information for Patients).  
Patients may slowly develop increased brown pi[INVESTIGATOR_386067]. This change may not be noticeable for months to years (see Warnings). Iris pi[INVESTIGATOR_689623], i.e., blue -brown, grey -brown, yellow -brown, and green-
brown; however, it has also been observed in patients with brown eyes. The color change is believed to be due to increased melanin content in the stromal melanocytes of the iris. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the brown pi[INVESTIGATOR_689624], but the entire iris or parts of it may 
IND [ADDRESS_935579] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67  
 
Version 3:  08 Apr 22  80 Mati Therapeutics Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL  
 become more brownish. Until more information about increased brown pi[INVESTIGATOR_689625], 
patients should be examined regularly and, depending on the situation, treatment may be stopped if increased pi[INVESTIGATOR_689626].  
TRAVATAN® should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation 
(iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation.  
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F
2α analogues. These reports have mainly occurred in aphakic patients, 
pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema. TRAVATAN® should be used with caution in these patients.  
TRAVATAN® has not been evaluated for the treatment of angle closure, inflammatory or 
neovascular glaucoma.  
TRAVATAN® Ophthalmic Solution should not be administered while wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
Patients should be advised that TRAVATAN® contains benzalkonium chloride which may be 
absorbed by [CONTACT_391815]. Contact [CONTACT_689693]. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of TRAVATAN®.  
Information for Patients  
Patients should be advised concerning all the information contained in the Warnings and 
Precautions sections.  
Patients should also be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact 
[CONTACT_689694] s could cause the tip to become contaminated by 
[CONTACT_689695]. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions.  
Patients also should be advised that if they develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma, 
or infection) or have ocular surgery, they should immediately seek the physician’s advice 
concerning the continued use of the multi-dose container.  
Patients should be advised that if they develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and 
lid reactions, they should immediately seek his/her physician’s advice.  
If more than one topi[INVESTIGATOR_689627], the drugs should be administered at least 
five (5) minutes apart.

Version 3:  08 Apr 22  81 Mati Therapeutics Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL  
 Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats at subcutaneous doses of 10, 30, or 100 
µg/kg/day did not show any evidence of carcinogenic potential.  However, at 100 µg/kg/day, male 
rats were only treated for 82 weeks, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in 
the mouse study.  The high dose (100 µg/kg) corresponds to exposure levels over 400 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human ocular dose (MRHOD) of 0.04 µg/kg, 
based on plasma act ive drug levels. Travoprost was not mutagenic in the Ames test, mouse 
micronucleus test and rat chromosome aberration assay. A slight increase in the mutant frequency 
was observed in one of two mouse lymphoma assays in the presence of rat S -[ADDRESS_935581] mating or fertility indices in male or female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 10 ug/kg/day [250 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose of 0.04 ug/kg/day on a ug/kg basis (MRHOD)]. At 10 ug/kg/day, the mean number  of corpora lutea was reduced, 
and the postimplantation losses were increased. These effects were not observed at 3 ug/kg/day (75 times the MRHOD).  
Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects  
Pregnancy Category: C Travoprost was teratogenic in rats, at an intravenous  (IV) dose up to 10 
ug/kg/day (250 times the MRHOD), evidenced by [CONTACT_689696], such as fused sternebrae, domed 
head and hydrocephaly. Travoprost was not teratogenic in rats at IV doses up to 3 ug/kg/day (75 
times the MRHOD), and in mice at subcutaneous doses up to 1.0 ug/kg/day (25 times the MRHOD). Travoprost produced an increase in postimplantation losses and a decrease in fetal 
viability in rats at IV doses > 3 ug/k g/day (75 times the MRHOD) and in mice at subcutaneous 
doses > 0.3 ug/kg/day (7.5 times the MRHOD). 
In the offspring of female rats that received travoprost subcutaneously from Day 7 of pregnancy 
to lactation Day 21 at the doses of ≥ 0.12 ug/kg/day (3 time s the MRHOD), the incidence of 
postnatal mortality was increased, and neonatal body weight gain was decreased. Neonatal 
development was also affected, evidenced by [CONTACT_689697], pi[INVESTIGATOR_689628], and by [CONTACT_689698].  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women.  TRAVATAN® should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.    
Nursing Mothers  
A study in lactating rats demonstrated that radiolabeled travoprost and/or its metabolites were 
excreted in milk. It is not known whether this drug or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when 
TRAVATAN® is administered to a nursing woman.

Version 3:  [ADDRESS_935583] common ocular adverse event observed in controlled clinical studies with 
TRAVATAN® 0.004% was ocular hyperemia which was reported in 35 to 50% of patients. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia.  
Ocular adverse events reported at an incidence of 5 to 10% included decreased visual acuity, eye 
discomfort, foreign body sensation, pain, and pruritus.  
Ocular adverse events reported at an incidence of 1 to 4% included, abnormal vision, blepharitis, 
blurred vision, cataract, cells, conjunctivitis, dry eye, eye disorder, flare, iris discoloration, 
keratitis, lid margin crusting, photophobia, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and tearing.  
Nonocular adverse events reported at a rate of 1 to 5% were accidental inj ury, angina pectoris, 
anxiety, arthritis, back pain, bradycardia, bronchitis, chest pain, cold syndrome, depression, 
dyspepsia, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hypotension, infection, pain, prostate disorder, sinusitis, urinary incontinence, and urinary tract infection.    
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once -daily in the evening. The dosage 
of TRAVATAN® should not exceed once -daily since it has been shown that more frequent 
administration may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect. Reduction of intraocular 
pressure starts approximately [ADDRESS_935584] is reached after 12 hours.  
TRAVATAN® may be used concomitantly wit h other topi[INVESTIGATOR_689629]. If more than one topi[INVESTIGATOR_689627], the drugs should be 
administered at least five (5) minutes apart.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women to inform a drug -associated 
risk.  
In animal reproduction studies, subcutaneous (SC) administration of travoprost to pregnant mice 
and rats throughout the period of organogenesis produced embryo -fetal lethality, spontaneous 
abortion, and premature delivery at potentially clinically relevant dos es.  
Advise pregnant women of a potential risk to a fetus. Because animal reproductive studies are not 
always predictive of human response, TRAVATAN Z should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the  fetus.  
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clini cally recognized pregnancies.  
Data  
Animal Data  
An embryo -fetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered travoprost once daily by [CONTACT_689699] (GD) 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. At 10 mcg/kg ([ADDRESS_935594] Evolute®, 166 µg, L67  
 
Version 3:  08 Apr 22  87 Mati Therapeutics Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL  
 times the max imum recommended human ocular dose [MRHOD], based on estimated plasma 
Cmax), travoprost was teratogenic in rats, evidenced by [CONTACT_689696], including fused sternebrae,  domed 
head and hydrocephaly. Travoprost caused post -implantation loss at 10 mcg/kg. The no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for post -implantation loss was 3 mcg/kg (18 times the MRHOD, 
based on estimated plasma Cmax). The maternal NOAEL was 10 mcg/kg .  
An embryo-fetal study was conducted in pregnant mice administered travoprost once daily by [CONTACT_689700] 6 to 11, to target the period of organogenesis. At 1 mcg/kg (6 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax), travoprost caused postimplantation loss and decreased fetal weight. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for malformations was 0.3 mcg/kg (2 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The maternal NOAEL was 1 mcg/kg.  
Pre/postnatal studies were conducted in rats administered travoprost once daily by [CONTACT_689701] 7 (early embryonic period) to postnatal Day 21 (end of lactation period). At doses of greater than or equal to 0.12 mcg/kg/day (0.7 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax), adverse pre gnancy outcomes (embryo -fetal lethality, abortion, and early delivery), 
low-birth weight and developmental delays were observed. The NOAEL for adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, low -birth weight and developmental delay was 0.1 mcg/kg (0.6 times the MHROD, 
based o n estimated plasma Cmax). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 0.72 mcg/kg (4 times 
the MHROD, based on estimated plasma Cmax).  
8.[ADDRESS_935595] and/or its metabolites were excreted in

C26H35F3O6 and a molecular weight of 500.55 g/mol. The chemical structure of travoprost is: 
 
Travoprost is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow oil that is very soluble in acetonitrile, methanol, 
octanol, and chloroform. It is practically insoluble in water.  
TRAVATAN Z is supplied as sterile, buffered aqueous solution of travoprost with a pH of 
approximately 5.7 and an osmolality of approximately 290 mOsmol/kg.  
TRAVATAN Z contains Active: travoprost 0.04 mg/mL; Inactives: polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility   
Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats at subcutaneous doses of 10, 30, or 100 
mcg/kg/day did not show any evidence of carcinogenic potential. However, at 100 mcg/kg/day, 
male rats were only treated for 82 weeks, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the mouse study. The high dose (100 mcg/kg) corresponds to exposure levels 326 times (mouse) and 547 times (rat) the human exposure at the MRHOD of 0.04 mcg/kg, based on estimated plasma Cmax for active travoprost free acid.  
Travoprost was not mutagenic in the Ames test, mouse micronucleus test or rat chromosome aberration assay. A slight increase in the mutant frequency was observed in one of two mouse lymphoma assays in the presence of rat S-[ADDRESS_935604] mating or fertility indices in male or female rats at subcutaneous doses 
up to 3 mcg/kg/day (18 times the MRHOD based on estimated plasma Cmax). At 10 mcg/kg/day (60 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma  Cmax), the mean number of corpora lutea was 
reduced, and the post- implantation losses were increased.  
14 CLINICAL STUDIES  
In clinical studies, patients with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and baseline pressure 
of 25 to 27 mmHg, who were treated with TRAVATAN or TRAVATAN Z dosed once daily in the evening, demonstrated 7 to 8 mmHg reductions in IOP. In sub- group analyses of these studies, 
mean IOP reduction in black patients was up to 1.8 mmHg greater than in non- black patients. It is 
not known at this time whether this difference is attributed to race or to heavily pi[INVESTIGATOR_463279].  
In a multi- center, randomized, controlled trial, patients with mean baseline IOP of 24 to 26 mmHg

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category C  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of IZBA (travoprost ophthalmic solution 
0.003%) administration in pregnant women. Malformations were observed in rats at doses that 
were 1500 times higher the maximum recommended human ocular dose (MRHOD) based on estimated Cmax values for the active free acid. Embryo lethality and decreased fetal/neonate viability were observed in mice at subcutaneous doses 9- fold higher than the MRHOD based on 
estimated Cmax for the active free acid. IZBA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
Travoprost was teratogenic in rats, at an intravenous (IV) dose up to 10 mcg/kg/day ([ADDRESS_935619] did not produce malformations in rats at IV doses up to 3 mcg/kg/day (470 times the MRHOD), or in mice at subcutaneous doses up to 1 mcg/kg/day (9 times the MRHOD). Travoprost produced an increase in post -implantation losses and a decrease in fetal viability in rats at IV doses 
of 10 mcg/kg/day (1500 times the MRHOD) and in mice at subcutaneous doses of 1 mcg/kg/day (9 times the MRHOD).  
In the  offspring of female rats that received travoprost subcutaneously from Day 7 of pregnancy 
to lactation Day 21 at doses of ≥ 0.12 mcg/kg/day (3.2 times the MRHOD), the incidence of postnatal mortality was increased, and neonatal body weight gain was decreas ed. Neonatal

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats at subcutaneous doses of 10, 30, or 100 
mcg/kg/day did not show any evidence of carcinogenic potential. However, at 100 mcg/kg/day, 
male rats were only treated for 82 weeks, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the mouse study. The high dose (100 mcg/kg) corresponds to exposure levels over 400 times (for the mouse) and 700 times (for the rat) of the human exposure at the maximum recommended human ocular dose (MRHOD) of 0.03 mcg/kg, based on estimated plasma Cmax for active free acid.  
Travoprost was not mutagenic in the Ames test, mouse micronucleus test or rat chromosome aberration assay. A slight increase in the mutant frequency was observed in one of two mouse lymphoma assays in the pres ence of rat S -[ADDRESS_935629] mating or fertility indices in male or female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 10 mcg/kg/day (40 times the MRHOD based on estimated plasma Cmax for active free acid). At 10 mcg/kg/day, the mean  number of corpora lutea was reduced, and the post implantation  losses 
were increased. These effects were not observed at 3 mcg/kg/day (12 times the MRHOD).

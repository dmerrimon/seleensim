2 INTRODUCTION  
Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plate of the upper and lower eyelids, where they terminate 
along the interior rim (o r margin) of the eyelids.  These glands secrete meibum, which is a lipid -rich 
essential component of a healthy tear film. When sufficient meibum is not present in the tear film, the 
aqueous layer of the tear film is disrupted and readily evaporates causing  irritation, redness, and 
inflammation of the lid margin and surrounding tissues.  Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is 
associated with a failure of these glands to produce adequate quantities of meibum due to atrophy, 
inflammation, or obstruction, and is thought to be the most common cause of evaporative dry eye 
disease [1]. 
 
A common clinical treatment to restore normal gland function in patients with obstructive MGD 
involves the application of heat and pressure therapy to the eyelids to express the meibomian gland 
obstruction and other material from the gland  [2].  Warming the eyelid tissue softens or melts the 
meibum, which is known to facilitate expression  using pressure.  
 
3 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The iLux™ System is a medical device intended for use by [CONTACT_275304] (ECP) to apply localized 
heat and pressure therapy to a patient’s eyelids.  The system consists of a handheld instrument 
coupled to a single -use, sterile Disposable component that is positioned behind the eyelid. The iLux 
device allo ws an ECP to view the eyelid margin through a magnifier, then warm the eyelid tissue to a 
range of 40 to 42˚C, and then apply compression to the eyelid in order to express melted meibum from 
obstructed glands.  
3.1 iLux Indications for Use  
The iLux System is indicated for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in adult patients 
with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), also 
known as evaporative dry eye.  
3.2 iLux Components  
The iLux system is shown i n Figure 1.

3.2.2 iLux Instrument  
The iLux Instrument  is a handheld , electronic  instrument used together with the iLux Disposable  to 
apply heating and pressure  to the eyelid.   The Instrument  includes electronic circuits that  read sensors 
in the Inner and Outer Eyelid Pads  to measure temperatures  representative of inner and outer eyelid  
temperature, respectively .  Warming is accomplished using light energy emitted from LEDs  in the 
Instrument .  A mechanism in the Instrument allows the operator to apply pressure to the eyelid by 
[CONTACT_275307].  The force applied to the Compression Control is measured by a sensor in this mechanism.  A 
graphic Screen displays information for operating the Instrument  during a treatmen t. A magnifier 
allows the operator to view the e yelid margin during treatment.  
 
Eyelid temperature is measured using sensors in the Disposable including two sensors  in the Outer Pad 
and two in the Inner Pad.  When the Disposable is attached to Instrument, spring loaded pi[INVESTIGATOR_275277].  Electronic  circuitry  in 
the Instrument reads the sensors and determines temperatures more than 20 times a second.  The 
accuracy of the temperature measurement system is ± 1 °C.  The circuitry performs self -test checks to 
ensure the sensors are operating properly.  If  the electronics detect a failure, an error code is displayed  
and the heat source  is disabled . 
 
The Instrument features an integrated Display Screen shown in Figure 3.  The Display Screen shows 
the elapsed warming time that the temperature is above 38 °C ( in seconds), the compression force 
applied by [CONTACT_28024], the highest of the two temperature sensors located in the Inner Eyelid Pad, and 
status of the rechargeable batteries as indicated by a battery icon. The Display also provides messages 
regarding status  or conditions that require the operator’s attention.

Figure 3: The information displayed on the screen.   Any operating message is displayed on the bottom row.  
Pressure applied to the eyelid is controlled by [CONTACT_275308], which causes the Outer Pad to move towards the opposing Inner Pad.  The 
mechanism that connects the Compression Control button to  the Outer Eyelid Pad is shown in Figure 
4.  When the Disposable is attached to the Instrument, the Outer Eyelid Pad automatically attaches to 
the front of the Shroud.  The Compression Control button is connected to the movable Shroud by a 
linkage, which r educes the force applied to the Compression Control button by [CONTACT_2669] 50%.  The ECP 
can retract or advance the Outer Eyelid Pad and Shroud combination as well as control the amount of 
pressure applied using the Compression Control button.   A sensor is mou nted in this mechanism to 
measure the force applied by [CONTACT_275309].  Electronic circuitry monitors 
the sensor output and then displays the compression force on the Screen to provide feedback for the 
user during a treatment.

The eyelid tissue is warmed by [CONTACT_275310] .  The LEDs are located behind a clear window on the open end of the 
Shroud. Two wavelengths of light are used : lime -green (568 nm) and near -infrared (850 nm).  
Chromophores in the eyelid absorb the light energy and heat the surrounding tissue  [3].  Similarly , 
chromophores in the black plastic of the Inner Pad absorb the light energy and warm nearby [CONTACT_275311]

so that when it is released, or when the ECP’s thumb or forefinger is relaxed, the Heater Control switch 
returns to its norma l “off” position.  The highest temperature measured by [CONTACT_275313].  When the heater is turned on by [CONTACT_275314], circuitry adjusts power to the LEDs to 
raise eyelid temperatures to 40 to 42 °C.  At any time during heating , if any of the measure d eyelid 
temperatures exceeds 42  ⁰C, the high -temperature alert symbol is displayed  and the light source is 
dimmed.  If any one of the temperatures exceeds 44  ⁰C, the attention required  symbol is displayed  the 
Instrument autom atically turns off the light source  until the temperature drops below 40 ⁰C.  The 
elapsed time that the tissue is warmed above 38°C is displayed on the screen.  The duration that the 
LEDs can be operated is limited to 90 seconds from initial activation ; after this period , sliding the 
Heater Control switch forward will no longer turn on the LEDs .  Momentarily depressing the  Instrument 
power ON/OFF switch resets the 90 second LED timer and the elapsed warming  timer . 
 
The instrument records temperature and for ce along with other operating data in internal memory.  
Data.  The performance data can be downloaded to an external compute r by [CONTACT_275315] . 
3.2.3 Device Operation  
The Instrument is turned ON by [CONTACT_274054] t he ON/OFF button  for four seconds .  The instrument first 
verifies proper operation of the internal electronics and beeps once if no errors are detected.   Without 
a Disposable attached, the Screen displays the “Attach Disposable” message.  If the Screen dis plays an 
error message, the operator should refer to the Troubleshooting section of this manual.  If the battery 
power is low, which is indicated by a flashing battery icon with a single bar, the Instrument should be 
turned OFF and the batteries removed an d placed in the charging stand.  When the Instrument is 
ready, th e Disposable  is removed from the packaging immediately before a treatment and attached 
to the Instrument  by [CONTACT_275316].   The Screen now displays the  elapsed time, 
which is “0”, the compression force, and the highest Inner Pad temperature.  
After the patient is prepared, t he Inner Eyelid Pad is placed  adjacent to the region of the palpebral  
conjunctiva contain ing the meibomian glands to be treated .  Figure [ADDRESS_336107] the outer surface of t he eyelid by [CONTACT_275317] .  
Since the Outer Eyelid Pad  opposes the Inner Eyelid Pad , this action applies pressure to the eyelid that 
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page [ADDRESS_336108] ayed on the Screen 
to provide feedback to the user.  If compressing the glands using a gentle pressure (force < 3) does 
not produce secretions,  then the tissue should be warmed to approximately [ADDRESS_336109] causes the Instrument to 
energize the LEDs.

3.3 Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275278] w System  
The Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275279] a commercially available device used in the treatment of 
MGD.  It is cleared to be marketed by [CONTACT_275318].  
3.4 Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177] I ndications for Use  
The Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275280], including meibomian gland 
dysfunction (MGD), also known as evap orative dry eye or lipid deficiency dry eye.  
3.5  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275281], including all 
software, algorithms and control elements.  The Activator, a single -use sterile device, del ivers 
automated therapeutic energies to each meibomian gland.  Its contoured design vaults the cornea and 
protects the eye allowing a maximum therapeutic temperature of 43 degrees Celsius to reach glands 
from the inner eyelid, without damaging the eyelid o r delicate structures of the globe. Insulation 
protects the cornea from exceeding a safe 39.5 degrees Celsius, while a pressure feedback loop sends 
pulsed sequences to expel blockages.  Force equalization protects the globe from pressure 
transmission by [CONTACT_275319].   Delivered through the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275282], Vectored 
Thermal Pulse™ (VTP) technology applies a combination of heat and pressure to the inner eyelid to 
safely remove gland obstructions and stagnant gland content. Vectored he at and adaptive force 
equalization targets the pulse, heat, and pressure on the meibomian glands to maximize effectiveness. 
Therapeutic motion provides proximal -to-distal parastalsis to clear gland contents.

4 CLINICAL STUDY  DESIGN   
4.1 Objective  
The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the iLux System for adults with 
meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) . 
4.2 Description of the Study  
This study is a randomized , open -label, multisite clinical trial comparing the iLux System to an active 
control, which will be the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177]® Thermal Pulsation System.  The goal of this study is to verify that 
technological differences between the iLux System and the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275284].   The comparison between the two systems will determine if the iLux System 
is non -inferior to the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275285].  The proposed sample size is 256 eyes (128 subjects) to 
demonstrate non -inferiority of treat ment with iLux relative to treatment with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275286].  A total of 14 2 subjects is requested to allow for 10% fallout during 
patient screening. One hundred twenty -eight subjects will be randomized for bilateral tr eatment and 
will be assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_336110] 7 study sites.  
4.3 Non -Significant Risk  
The iLux device is a non -significant risk device because it does not meet the criteria for a significant 
risk device . 
The criteria for a significant risk device are as follows1: 
1. The device is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety, or welfare of a subject;  
2. The device is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and 
presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
3. The device is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for 
serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
4. The device otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject.  
4.4 Outcome Measures  
4.4.1 Co-Primary E ffectiveness Endpoint s 
The co-primary  effectiveness endpoint s are the changes from baseline  to the 4 -week exam  in total 
Meibomian Gland Score (MGS)  and Tear Break -Up Time (TBUT) .  MGS must be assessed by a masked

2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 17 of 36 
rater .  Clinical and statistically significant improvements from baseline for each parameter are 
required to achieve success for these co -primary endpoints.  
The MGS is determined  for the lower eyelids  using a device  that applies a standardized pressure  to an 
area including 5 glands (Meibomian Gland Evaluator, Model MGE -1000, TearScience , Inc.)  while 
viewing the eyelid margin using a slit lamp microscope to determine the presence and quality of the 
gland secretions.  A  total of  15 glands  in three lower eyelid zone s (nasal,  medial, temporal ) will be 
evaluated.  Each gland is graded from 0 to 3 (0 =  no secretion,  1 = inspi[INVESTIGATOR_89057],  2 = cloudy, 3 =  clear  
liquid).  The maximum MGS score is 45  in each eye .  This endpoint has been used in previous studies 
evaluating the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275287]  [5, 6].  The clinician performing the MGS must not be involved in the 
study procedure and must be blinded to which arm of the study the subject is randomized.  
TBUT is evaluated  using the fluorescein method [4].  This measurement provides an aggregate 
assessment of the effectiveness of treatments to both the lower and upper eyelids.  
4.4.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The secondary effectiveness endpoint will be the c hange from base line in p atient symptoms using the 
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)  at the 4-week exam .  OSDI is a scoring that evaluates patient 
symptoms based on a validated questionnaire  [7].  This assessment has been used in several clinical

[ADDRESS_336119] deviation, minimum, 
maximum, and median.  Categorical or binary endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_48361]. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess the treatment effect between baseline and 4 
weeks for iLux and Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177] (LF) treatments for the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoint s. 
For each endpoint analyzed, the baseline value will be used as a covariate.  
Given that non -inferiority  is demonstrated for the iLux endpoints , success will not be claimed unless 
the mean change from baseline in the test arm is clinically significant and significantly different from 
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page [ADDRESS_336120] for superiority will be performed.  
All subjects enrolled  and treated  in the study shall be included as part of the safety analysis.  
Subjects who are randomized  but not treated for any reason will be included in the intent -to-treat 
analysis as part of the arm to which they are randomized but they will be excluded from the per -
protocol analysis.  
7.1 Clinically Significant Effects  
The values for clinical significance a re used to establish the non -inferiority margins.  
7.1.1 Meibomian Gland Score (MGS)  
The clinical significance of the MGS score change  both from baseline and in comparing study arms  is 
based on a severity ranking using an alternative scoring method established by [CONTACT_275323] [4].  A difference in score of [ADDRESS_336121] strip 
(Table 2).  The diagnosis of dry and abnormal tear stability is determined by a span of [ADDRESS_336122] of 50%, then a difference in TBUT of 2.5 seconds is determined to 
be clinically significant.  Based on this determination of a clinically significant change, a value of 2.5 
seconds for the non -inferiority margin is used for TBU T primary endpoint.  
Table 2: AMCON DET strip labeling  
TBUT (seconds)  Significance  
≥ 10  Normal  
> 5 to < 10  Borderline dry eye  
< 5 Dry eye  
7.1.3 OSDI  
A change in score of 7 is the minimal clinically significant difference for patients with moderate and 
severe dry eye established in a clinical study by [INVESTIGATOR_140362] [9] using an anchor -based method.  For this 
study, this value is being used both from baseline and in comparing study arms.  
7.2 Non -Inferiority Compared to Control  
7.2.1 Primary Effec tiveness Endpoint s Hypothesis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MGS  
The co-primary effectiveness endpoint, MGS, will be tested for non -inferiority against Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275292] 
a 5-point  non-inferiority delta (δ) in a one -tailed test.   
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 25 of 36 
It is hypothesized that the MGS mean score from the iLux group will not be lower than (not inferior 
to) the MGS mean score from the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275293] 4 -week exam : 
Null Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -MGS – LF-MGS) + δ ≤ 0  
Alternate Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -MGS – LF-MGS) + δ > 0  
Where μ (iLux -MGS – LF-MGS) is the  mean difference in the MGS between iLux and Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275294] 4 and δ = 5.  
The MGS was found to be highly correlated across eyes in the previously complet ed pi[INVESTIGATOR_9958] 
(correlation of 0.68); consequently, OD and OS values will be averaged to form an overall person score.  
An ANCOVA model, with baseline MGS as a covariate, will be used to assess the difference between 
the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275295].  The lower boundary of the least square means group 
confidence interval will be tested against t he non -inferiority boundary of [ADDRESS_336123] exceed -5. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  TBUT  
The co -primary end point, Tear Break -Up Time (TBUT) will be tested for non -inferiority against Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275296] a 2.5 -second non -inferiority delta (δ) in a one -tailed test.  A similar ANCOVA model will be used 
to compare TBUT between devices, with covariate adjustment for base line TBUT.  It is hypothesized 
that the TBUT mean time for the iLux group will not be less than (not inferior to) the TBUT mean time 
for the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275297] 4 -week exam:  
Null Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -TBUT – LF-TBUT) + δ ≤ 0  
Alternate Hypothesis:   μ (iL ux-TBUT – LF-TBUT) + δ > 0  
Where μ (iLux -TBUT – LF-TBUT) = mean difference in the TBUT between iLux and Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275294] 4 and δ = 2.5.  
7.2.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis  
If the co-primary effectiveness endpoint s demonstrate non -inferiority, the secondary effectiveness 
endpoint, change from baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) at the [ADDRESS_336124] for non -inferiority .  A similar ANCOVA model will be use d 
to compare OSDI between devices, with covariate adjustment for baseline OSDI.   
It is hypothesized that the OSDI mean score from the iLux group will not be lower than (not inferior 
to) the OSDI mean score from the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275293] 4 -week exam : 
Null Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -OSDI – LF-OSDI) - δ ≥ 0 
Alternate Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -OSDI – LF-OSDI) - δ < 0 
Where μ (iLux -OSDI – LF-OSDI) = mean difference in the OSDI between iLux and Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275298] 4 and δ = 7. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_336125] be successful to demonstrate non -inferiority.  The 
secondary endpoint is only tested if the co -primary effectiveness endpoints are non -inferior.  
7.2.4 Sample Size Justification  
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 26 of 36 
The proposed sample size is 256 eyes  (128 subjects) for this open -label, prospective multicenter trial 
designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with iLux relative to treatment with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275299].  A total of 142 subjects is requested to allow for 10% fallout during 
patient screening.  This study design provides a combined power of 88% to demonstrate non -
inferiority given the following primary endpoint assumptions:  
• MGS non -inferiority delta of [ADDRESS_336126] deviation of 8 points, provides a MGS 
primary endpoint power of 93.9% . 
• TBUT non -inferiority delta of 2.[ADDRESS_336127] deviation of 4 seconds, provides a TBUT 
primary endpoint power of 93.9%  
• Power that both endpoints are significant, assuming independence, is 0.9392 = 0.882, or 88.2% 
power.  
For the secondary endpoint, a standard deviation of 14 is assumed based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_275300] -
inferiority delta is set to 7.  The chosen sample size and α =.025 provides 80% power for this endpoint.  
7.2.5 Safety  Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoint is the c omparison of the incidence of device -related adverse events (e.g., 
changes in the lid margin, development of floppy eyelids, entropi[INVESTIGATOR_250025]; and lash integrity) 
for the two treatments .  The reporting period is from baseline  through the last study visit.  
The secondary safety endpoint is the evaluation of discomfort and pain during treatment and changes 
from baseline following treatment for the test and control devices for the following a ssessments:  
• Ocular Surface Staining  
• Intraocular Pressure  
• BSCVA  
Adverse events a nd other  findings shall be summarized  by [CONTACT_275324].  Continuous  endpoints shall be summarized using  summary  statistics such as means, 
medians, standard deviations,  minima, maxima, and relevant percentiles.   Definitions of adverse 
events, serious adverse events, and categorizations of events can be found in Appendix D.  
All adverse events shall be evaluated beginning with onset, and  evaluation shall continue until 
resolution is noted, or until the investigator determines that the subject’s condition is stable.  
All AEs shall be characterized by [CONTACT_4868] (see Adverse Event Definitions in Appendix D): 
• Event diagnosis

2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 36 of 36 APPENDIX D:  ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event (AE)  Any untoward and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an investigational drug or device, or other protocol -imposed intervention, 
regardless of the suspected cause  
• Chronic but stable c onditions or diseases are not A Es 
• Changes in a chronic condition o r disease consistent with natural disease progression 
are not AEs  
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  SAEs are AEs that:  
• Led to death  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the patient that resulted in:  
o A life -threatening illness or injury  
o A permanent impairment of a body function  
o In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to body structure or a body function  
AE Severity  Mild :  Awareness of sign o r symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause i nterference with usual activity  
Severe :  Incapacitating with inabili ty to work or do usual activity  
• Severity is irrespective of procedure relationship or seriousness of the event  
• Severity is a measurement of intensity but not seriousness; thus, a severe reaction is 
not necessarily a SAE  
AE Expectedness  Anticipated :  The nature, severity, or degree of i ncidence was previously described, 
including those anticipated events listed in the protocol and/or 
IFU/User Manual  of the device . 
Unanticipated : The nature, severity, or degree of incidenc e was not previously 
described.  
AE Relatedness  Not related : Clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the subject, 
and does not follow a known response pattern  to the procedure  
Related :  Follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of procedure 
and/or follows a known response pattern to the study procedure and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_141477]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant therapy administered to 
the subject

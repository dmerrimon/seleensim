     STUDY SUMMARY  
Title:  Phase 2 , Parallel -Arm Study of MGCD265 in Patients with Locally 
Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) with 
Activating G enetic A lterations in  Mesenchymal -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_296935]  (MET ). 
Rationale:  MET plays a central role in epi[INVESTIGATOR_296936] ( RTKs ) in several human cancers .  
Oncology indications in which MET  is reported to be genetically 
altered by  [CONTACT_296968], renal, 
colorectal, glioblastoma , gastric, and head and neck cancers .  MET  
mutations and/or gene amplification have recently been reported as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas program in approximately 7% of 
lung adenocarcinoma patients .  Furthermore, the expression of both 
MET and H epatocyte G rowth F actor ( HGF ), its sole, high- affinity 
ligand, was demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or 
metastatic progression in a number of major human cancers , 
including NSCLC .  Inappropriate activation of MET is involved in 
multiple tumor oncogenic processes such as cell growth, angiogene sis, invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic 
process .   
MGCD265 is a small molecule inhibitor of MET and Axl .  In vitro 
studies have demonstrated that MGCD265 is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation in cells where MET is overexpressed o r 
activated, but not in cells that lacked MET expression/activation .  
These results are consistent with in vivo studies demonstrating activity of MGCD265 in human tumor xenograft -bearing mouse 
models including marked tumor regression in models exhibiting MET mutations and/or gene amplification .  Additionally, Axl 
dysregulation may contribute to tumor progression or further cooperate in drug resistance, and simultaneous inhibition of both of these targets may cooperate to overcome therapeutic resistance to 
selected anticancer agents.  
Target Population:  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating genetic alterations of MET  (mutations or gene amplifications), who 
have received at least one platinum -based chemotherapy or licensed 
immunoth erapy regimen for advanced/metastatic NSCLC.    
Number in 
Primary Trial:  Total enrollment up to approximately 290 patients

     Primary 
Objective:  • To determine  the tumor response  to MGCD265 in the selected 
patient population. 
Secondary Objectives:  • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MGCD265 in the selected population.  
• To evaluate secondary efficacy endpoints with MGCD265 treatment in the selected population. 
• To assess correlation between selected tumor gene alterations using different analytical  techniques in tumor tissue and 
circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA).  
• To assess change in genetic alteration status in ctDNA with 
MGCD265 treatment over time in the selected population .   
• To assess the population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics 
(PK/PD) of MGCD265 in the selected population.  
Primary Endpoint  • Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) as defined by [CONTACT_290233] 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ). 
Secondary Endpoints  • Safety characterized by [CONTACT_24975], incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study treatment of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. 
• Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
o Duration of Response (DR);  
o Progression- Free Survival ( PFS); 
o 1-Year Survival Rate; and  
o Overall Survival (OS).  
• Gene alterati ons in tumor tissue and ctDNA  at 
prescreening/ baseline.  
• Change in ctDNA through time . 
• Blood plasma MGCD265 concentration. 
• Blood plasma concentration of selected soluble biomarkers.

     Study Design:  Study [ADDRESS_362410] 1.1 .  Secondary objectives include evaluation of safety, 
secondary efficacy endpoints, genetic alterations in tumor tissue and 
ctDNA at pre -screening/ baseline, change in ct DNA through time , 
and population PK/PD .  The Schedule of Assessments to be 
performed in the study is presented in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3
.   
MGCD265 will be administered as an oral therapeutic twice daily (BID) in 21 -day cycles .  Guidelines for study drug administration 
and dose reduction in the event of toxicity are provided in the 
protocol .  Study t reatment will continue until disease progression, 
unacceptable adverse events, patient refusal or death .   
Disease response and progression as documented by [CONTACT_296969] ( CRF ) will be the basis for patient 
management, study expa nsion decision making and secondary and 
supportive statistical analys es.  Central r adiology r eview for disease 
response  will be the basis for the primary statistical analyses  to 
estimate the objective response rate and its confidence interval , as 
well as the duration of response and PFS .  The importance of timely 
and complete disease assessments in this study is critical for the efficacy endpoints .  The need to truncate treatment cycles to manage 
toxicity may result in inconvenient scheduling of disease assessments.  Disease assessments must be performed as scheduled according to the calendar to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy based on toxicity.  
This Phase 2 , parallel -arm study will be conducted in four  groups of  
patients having genetic tumor alterations activating MET :  
A. MET  activating mutations  in tumor tissue ,  
B. MET  gene amplifications  in tumor tissue,  
C. MET activating mutations in ctDNA, and  
D. MET gene amplifications in ctDNA .

     The Phase 2 study will use a Bayesian P redictive Probability Design 
(Lee-2008 ), applied separately and using the same assumptions in 
each treatment arm (see Statistical Considerations) .  Emerging 
efficacy data will be evaluated continuously beginning after 
[ADDRESS_362411] on -study 
disease assessment  and are considered part of the Modified 
Intent -to-Treat ( mITT ) population (defined under Statistical 
Considerations) .  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_296937] .  Assuming the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_296938], the total sample size to be evaluated in each treatment arm of the Phase 2 study is 45 patients .  The primary analysis will be 
conducted in the mITT population.   
There is potential for one or more  arms of the Phase 2 study to yield 
results indicating that MGCD265 should be considered to provide an 
important advancement in treatment in this setting of unmet medical need .  If emerging data indicate that an accelerated approval market 
application may be undertaken for MGC D265 for one or more  of the 
selected patient populations, an analysis of the combined populations may be undertaken, or additional patients may be enrolled into the study, to increase the precision of the 95% confidence interval around the ORR endpoint and/or to increase the size of the safety database in the target patient population.  As many as 55 additional patients included in the mITT population may be enrolled in up to two treatment arms to ensure collection of sufficient data to support 
an accelerat ed approval market application.   
Considering the sample size planned for the four treatment arms in the Phase 2 study (45 patients each) and the possible addition of 
patients to prepare for market application in this setting ( 55 patients  
in each of two treatment  arms ), the ultimate sample size for this 
study could include as many as 290 patients .  Enrollment through the 
stages of this study will proceed without planned interruption while data are accruing .  Decisions will be made expeditiously by [CONTACT_296970]-enrollment and include only outcomes among the specified 
number of patients according to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s. 
Statistical Considerations  This Phase 2, parallel -arm study will use a Bayesian Predictive 
Probability Design ( Lee-2008) that minimizes the number of patients 
enrolled to test the hypothesis .  The design will be applied separately 
and using the same assumptions in each of four treatment arms .   
  
265-109  v3.0 – Phase [ADDRESS_362412] 1 .1 is the primary endpoint .  With 
currently available treatments, ORR is assumed to be 20% (p 0); thus 
this rate is considered uninteresting .  The target ORR using 
MGCD265 in this study is 40% (p 1).  The trial will monitor the 
number of observed responses c ontinuously after evaluating the first 
on-study disease assessments of the first 10 patients in  each 
treatment arm in the mITT population.  In creating the statistical 
design, the Type 1 error (α) is constrained to <  0.05 and Power (1 -β) 
is constrained to ≥  0.90. 
Using the parameters identified, the ultimate sample size for each 
treatment arm is as many as 45 patients in the mITT population .  The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (rejection regions), expressed as number of responses per patients treated, are 0/10, 1/14, 2/18, 3/22, 4/26, 5/29, 6/32, 7/35, 8/37, 9/39, 10/41, 11/43, 12/44, and 13/45.  Thus, if more than [ADDRESS_362413] 45 patients  enrolled who 
meet the criteria for the mITT population, the drug will be declared 
efficacious .  If the true  ORR is 20% (null hypothesis), the probability 
of early termination during the study is 0.92, and the expected sample size prior to termination is 28 patients; the Type 1 error equal to 0.0499 and Power equal to 0.9065.  If the true ORR is 40%  and 
N=[ADDRESS_362414] 95% confidence interval (Clopper -Pearson) around 
the point estimate for ORR will be (25.7; 55.7) .   
If the outcome is promising and the option is taken to enroll an additional number of patients up to 100 in the mITT population in a specific treatment arm to increase the size of the safety database and narrow the confidence interval around the ORR point estimate, the 95% confidence interval around a true ORR of 40% will be (30.3; 50.3) .  Data collected in patients enrolled beyond the planned Phase

11 ECGs: Assessments will include an evaluation of rhythm, heart rate, and PR, QRS, QT, and  QTc intervals.  Single ECG to be performed at screening  and at the end of 
treatment visit.  Triplicate ECGs at Cycles 1 and 2 as described in  Table 3.   
12 Disease Evaluations: To be performed at screening (28 -day window allowed) and every 6 weeks from dosing date [Cycle 1, Day 1] ( -7/+[ADDRESS_362422] 
on-study assessment, ± 10 days window for all other assessments) until Week 49 (~1 ye ar) and then every [ADDRESS_362423] day of dosing .  In general, assessments at screening/baseline as well as on -study are to include Computed Tomography (CT) scan 
with contrast or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the chest abdomen and pelvis.  In addition, at screening/baseline, a MRI  with and without gadolinium or CT with 
contrast  of the brain,  a whole -body bone scan and evaluation of any superficial lesions wil l be performed.  Subsequent disease assessments should also include whole body 
bone scans and/or MRI of the brain if metastatic disease is identified at screening/baseline by [CONTACT_296976].   Bone scans may be 
performed at one -half the frequency of other radiology evaluations (every 12 weeks) and should be performed during assessment for confirmation of disease response.  All 
scans will be sent to the central radiology reviewer.  More detailed guidance on exception al circumstances is provided in the protocol (Section 7.3).

• On Cycle 1, Day 1 Pre -dose, two sets of triplicate ECGs should be done to firmly establish the baseline for the patient.   
o Example:  ~1.0 hr (Triplicate ECGs); ~30 mins (Triplicate ECGs); ~15 mins (Vitals/PK)  
• Vital signs should be assessed prior to blood sampling.  
• ECGs should be ta ken in triplicate, each reading approximately  2 minutes apart.   
• In Cycle 2, Pre -dose and 6 hour samples may be collected on either Day 1 or Day 15.  Flexibility has been provided so i f samples are missed on Day 1, they 
can be do ne on Day 15 (pre -dose and/or 6 hour).   Steady -state exposure is expected, so samples should be representative regardless of when they are 
collected .   
• If the MGCD265 dose is taken before arrival in the clinic, special care is needed to collect the exact d osing time from the patient.  
• In the event of significant toxicities or withdrawal due to toxicity, an additional unscheduled PK blood sample should be dra wn as soon as possible.   In the 
event of a dose modification or formulation change, an additional unsc heduled PK sample should be drawn at least one week after the modification or 
change .

     1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease and Therapeutic Strategy  
1.1.1   Non-Small  Cell Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of  cancer -related  death in the [LOCATION_002] (US) .  
Approximately 221,200 new cases of lung cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the US 
in 2015, and approximately 158,040 deaths will be attributed to lung cancer (Cancer  Facts and Figures -2015) .  Non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 
approximately 83% of lung cancer cases ( Cancer Facts and Figures -2015), of which 
approximately half are classified as adenoca rcinoma of the lung ; squamous cell 
carcinoma accounts for approximately one -third of NSCLC cases and large cell 
carcinoma is less frequently diagnosed.  
In 1995, t he use of cisplatin -based chemotherapy was reported to lead  to modest 
improvement in survival in patients with advanced NSCLC  as compared to best 
supportive care , with a 27% reduction in death as reported in a meta -analysis of 11 trials 
(NSCLC Collaborative Group- 1995) .  Subsequently, other  chemotherapeutic agents have 
been reported to be active in  NSCLC, leading to a comparison of [ADDRESS_362434] -line treatment setting, all of which demonstrated similar activity 
(Schiller -2002) .  The importance of histology in the selection of first -line treatment for 
NSCLC was later described in the development of bevacizumab and pemetrexed.  In a 
Phase [ADDRESS_362435] vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) , demonstrated an improvement in 
survival when added to doublet chemotherapy , specifically in patients with 
non-squamous NSCLC ( Sandler -2006) .  Similarly, treatment with pemetrexed, an 
antifolate chemotherapeutic agent, results in an improvement in survival when used as 
part of a chemotherapy doublet in patients with non- squamous NSCLC, but with a 
probable decrease in survival among patients with squamous cell NSCLC (Scagliotti- 2008) .  Based on the results of these and other trials, platinum -based 
chemotherapy doublets, with or without bevacizumab in selected patients, re main a 
standard of care for most patients with advanced NSCLC in the first -line treatment 
setting.   More recently, a trial of pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody 
directed against PD -1, demonstrated an advantage of pembrolizumab over standard 
chemotherapy in patients with untreated, advanced NSCLC characterized by  ≥ 50% 
tumor PD -L1 expression.  Improvement was reported  across multiple efficacy endpoints 
including survival along with a favorable safety profile ( Reck -2016 ), leading  to the 
approval of pembrolizumab in the first -line treatment setting in this patient population in 
the US . 
Non-clinical and clinical studies have led to increased understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis  of NSCLC .  Abnormalities of genes involving 
signaling pathways have been described primarily in adenocarcinoma, and have included mutations in EGFR, HER2 , ROS , RON , MET , KRAS , and BRAF, as well as translocations 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362436] been made in concert with the development and 
market  authorization of several drugs targeting these pathways, including gefit inib 
(Mok- 2009), erlotinib ( Shepherd- 2005; Rosell -2012), and afatinib ( Sequist -2013) 
inhibiting the EGFR ( Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] G rowth Factor R eceptor) pathway; as well as crizotinib 
(Shaw -2013) and ceritinib ( Shaw -2014) inhibiting the ALK pathway .  Clinical trials with 
these targeted agents have demonstrated that patient selection on the basis of tumor genetics can result in high disease response rates in all lines of treatment and have 
revolutionized the treatment of NSCLC, with targeted agents rapi [INVESTIGATOR_296946] ( NCCN -2016) .  These 
observations have led to the paradigm whereby [CONTACT_296978], and the identification and targeting of these pathways lead to significant improvements in outcomes for these patients. 
Ongoing studies indicate that aberrations in the MET pathway may be similarly important 
in identifying patients with NSCLC, particularly those with adenocarci noma, for targeted 
therapy .  The MET pathway may be dysregulated through many mechanisms in NSCLC, 
including focal gene amplification, mutations leading to aberrant splicing such that the amino acid sequence correlating to exon [ADDRESS_362437] may be associated with  significant activity , and with the  potential for a  
better safety profile as compared to current treatment options.  
1.1.2  Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors  
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) provide ideal targets for cancer therapeutics .  The 
rationale for use of kinase inhibitors to treat cancer is supported by a well -established 
paradigm in oncology that robust clinical efficacy can be achieved with well -tolerated 
inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are genetically  altered through 
activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification .  Examples of tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors that have become standards of care in cancer diseases include imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c -KIT or chronic  myelogenous leukemia 
with BCR- ABL gene translocations, erlotinib in NSCLC  with mutant EGFR , sunitinib 
targeting the VHL (von Hippel -Lindau) -dependent VEGF pathway in renal cell 
carcinoma, and vemurafenib in BRAF
V600E mutation -positive melanoma.  
1.1.3  Dysregulat ion of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Cancer  
RTKs are families of kinases involved in the transmission of signals that regulate cell growth, survival, and migration.  Dysregulation of RTKs through genetic alteration or ectopic or uncontrolled expression is i mplicated in cell proliferation and tumor 
progression.   
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362438] frequently mutated or otherwise abnormally activated RTKs in 
several human cancers ( Christensen -2005) .  Malignancies  in which MET  has been 
reported to be genetically altered by  [CONTACT_296968], renal, 
colorectal, glio blastoma , gastric, and head and neck cancers (Christensen -2005) .  MET  
mutations and high level gene amplification were also recently identified as significant cancer gene alterations in l ung adenocarcinoma studies performed as part of the Cancer 
Genome Atlas  consortium project ( TCGA- 2014 a).  In the Cancer Genome Atlas  lung 
adenocarcinoma genomics analysis, MET dysregulation resulted from exon 14 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which results in increased protein stability, overexpression, and activation.  Approximately 6.5 % of lung adenocarcinoma sample demonstrated MET  exon 14 splice 
site mutations with  exon 14 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_296947] .  
Furthermore, the expression of both MET  and HGF , its sole, high- affinity ligand, w ere 
demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or metastatic progression in a number of major human cancers including NSCLC ( Christensen -2005) .  Inappropriate activation of 
MET is involved in multiple tumor oncogenic processes such as cell growth, angiogenesis, invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic process .  MET has also 
been implicated  as a key factor in resistance to both targeted agents and 
chemotherapeutics .  A key example is illustrated by [CONTACT_296979] s, including erlotinib, gefitinib and cetuximab 
(Engelman -2007; Yano -2011) .  The simultaneous inhibition of MET and EGFR in 
nonclinical lung cancer models with acquired resistance to erlotinib through dysregulation of MET, circumvented resistance and led t o tumor regression 
(Engelman -2007; Yano -2011) .   
Overexpression or ectopic expression of the Axl RTK and its ligand Gas6 has been reported in a wide array of human cancers including lung, colon, head and neck, breast, ovarian, hepatocellular, and glioblastoma ( Li-2009; Rankin- 2010) .  The ectopic 
expression of high levels of Axl in fibroblasts or epi[INVESTIGATOR_296948] a tumor igenic 
phenotype implicating it as a transforming oncogene ( O’Bryan -1991; Li-2009; 
Rankin- 2010) .  Axl has been demonstr ated to regulate tumor cell proliferation and 
survival and has also been implicated in tumor angiogenesis ( Li-2009; Rankin- 2010) .  
Axl expression was correlated with clinical stage and lymph node status in NSCLC .  
Furthermore, a fusion of AXL with MBIP  was recently reported in NSCLC .  Through this 
fusion, MBIP provided Axl with dimerization motifs enabling Axl kinase to be constitutively activated and become a primary oncogenic driver ( Seo-2012) .  Moreover, 
recent data have implicated Axl in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib in NSCLC and cetuximab in HNSCC ( Zhang -2012; By[CONTACT_3727] -2013).  
Collectively, the dysregulation of MET and Axl through genetic alterations and ectopic expression in multiple cancers and during cancer drug resistance provides an important 
opportunity to utilize MGCD265 in the therapeutic intervention in these cancers.  
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362439] become 
accepted for identification of patients for clinical trials of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], increasing 
evidence supports the genetic analysis of circulating DNA in the blood plasma of patients with cancer as an effective and quantitative method for evaluating tumor genetic mutation profiles .  Tumor cells  release a significant amount of DNA into circulation during cancer 
progression;  cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can comprise greater than 90% of 
total circulating plasma DNA ( Bettegowda -2014, Diehl -2008) .  Correlative analyses have 
demonstrated a high degree of concordance for detection of selected genetic mutations (e.g., EGFR, KRAS  or multi- gene panels with annotated known cancer mutations ) 
between tumor tissue and ctDNA with specificity for plasma vs . tissue concordance of 
99% for mutations with  allelic fractions > 0.10% ( Bettegowda -2014, Newman -2014) .  
The clinical utility of a ctDNA -based assay to identify a patient population that benefits 
from treatment with a specific therapeutic agent was demonstrated using a plasma 
DNA- based companion diag nostic to detect EGFR mutations in the tumors of patients 
with NSCLC treat ed with gefitinib ( Douillard -2014); the result was European regulatory 
approval for gefitinib in the indication .   
Availability of tumor tissue for tumor gene sequencing and other potentially interesting diagnostic testing is inherently  limited in the NSCLC disease setting  and becoming more 
problematic with the increasing number of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_296949] -diagnostic tests .  The capabi lity to evaluate tumor 
mutation status with non -invasive techniques has the potential to benefit a significant 
segment of the patient population .  In addition, specimens available for tumor tissue -
based analysis are frequently archival diagnostic biopsy ti ssue that are not necessarily 
reflective of tumor genetic status in more advanced and treated disease.  A benefit of analysis of ctDNA is that the sample represents a patient’s current tumor genetic profile.  In addition, it allows ongoing monitoring to identify new mutations that may occur and indicate resistance to treatment.  
In the current study, a ctDNA -based targeted next -generation sequencing (NGS) platform 
will be used to identify patients having selected MET  mutations and/or MET  gene 
amplification .  The ctDNA -based NGS platform was evaluated in more than 150 paired 
tumor and plasma samples , collected across multiple clinical institutions .  The evaluation 
used 10 well -established genetic markers and demonstrated 97% diagnostic accuracy, 
98% specificit y and more than 85% sensitivity for the comparison of tumor genes in 
tissue and plasma samples  (data on file at central laboratory) .  In addition, the analytical 
technique passed quality control analysis for 99.8% of the more than [ADDRESS_362440] performance and concordance with tissue -based 
analyses, the method will be used to identify patients for two  independent study tre atment 
arms in the current study, patients having MET  mutations or MET  gene amplification.

When MGCD265 was administered as a single agent, the most common related 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea (62%), nausea (39%), fatigue 
(31%), vomiting (26%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (25%), and alanine aminotransferase increased (2 0%).   Grade 3 related TEAEs reported in more than one 
patient included diarrhea (8%), fatigue (5%), aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase i ncreased, lipase increased, nausea, and  vomiting (2% each), 
and abdominal pain, anemia, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood phosphorus decreased, dehydration, hypertension, and hypokalemia (1%  each) ; Grade 4 related 
TEAEs included lipase increased ( 1%) and amylase increased and lymphocyte count 
decreased ( < 1%).  
The MGCD265 formulation and regimen to be used at the initiation of the current study is non- aqueous suspension capsules (MGCD265 free base suspended in Miglyol
® in soft 
gelatin capsules  and referred to as soft  gel capsules ), administered twice daily (BID) in a 
continuous regimen (delivered in 21- day cycles).   In the Phase 1 study, MGCD265 
systemic exposure in creased with increasing dose from 600 to 1050 mg BID , with  a less 
than dose proporti onal manner between 1050 and 1200 mg BID .  The maximum tolerated 
dose with the soft  gel capsules was established at 1050 mg BID .  Following single dose 
administration of 1050 mg BID soft gel  capsules, MGCD265 was absorbed, with 
maximum concentration (C max) occurring at a median time of 8 hours (4- 12 hours range) 
after dosing.   The mean elimination half -life was 36.7 ± 13.6 hours (mean ± SD).  At 
steady state, the geometric mean C max,ss, Cave,ss and AUC 0-12,ss   values were 510 ng/mL, 
464 ng/mL, and  5572 ng•h/mL, respectively.  Drug accumulation was observed after 
multiple dose administration, whereby C max and AUC 0-[ADDRESS_362442] consisting of a spray -dried dispersion (SDD) tablet 
formulation was developed in order to reduce the number of unit doses (pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551]) and eliminate the Miglyol
® excipi[INVESTIGATOR_296950].  The SDD 
tablet formulation was  introduced into this study with Protocol Version 2.0.  The SDD 
tablet formulation was evaluated in the Phase 1 trial at doses of 500, 750 and 1000 mg BID; 750 mg BID was e stablished as the maximally tolerated dose.   Following single 
dose ad ministration of 750 mg  SDD tablets, MGCD265 was  absorbed, with C
max 
occurring at a median time of 6 hours (2- 24 hours range) after dosing.  The mean 
elimination half -life was 30.9 ±  13.9 hours (mean ± SD) hours.  At steady state, 
geometric mean C max,ss, Cave,ss and AUC 0-12,ss   values were 432 ng/mL, 396 ng/mL , and 
4751 ng•h/mL, respectively.  Drug accumulation with this regimen was  observed and was 
associated with a C max and AUC 0-12 values  4.0-fold and 4.5- fold higher than single dose 
administration, respectively, and mean peak to through ratio at steady state was 1.12.  T he relative bioavailability comparing 750 mg BID SDD to 1050 mg BID capsules 
based on steady state dose normalized param eters was around 1.2.  The increase in

     exposure from 500 mg BID to 750 mg BID at steady state was less than dose proportional 
with t he 750 mg BID  dose level yielding  approximately 17% higher steady state exposure 
(geometric mean C ave,ss and AUC 0-12,ss) than the 500 mg BID  dose level .   
The rates of absorption and elimination of multiple dose administration of 750 mg BID SDD were comparable to 1050 mg BID soft gel capsules, while the extent of absorption at steady state was approximately 1.2 times greater  with 1050 mg BID soft gel capsules 
as compared to 750 mg BID SDD  tablet .

1.[ADDRESS_362444] frequently dysregulated RTKs in several human cancers .  Oncology indications 
in which MET  was reported to be genetically altered by [CONTACT_296980], renal, colorectal, glioblasto ma, gastric, and head and neck cancers .  MET  
mutations and/or gene amplification have recently been reported as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas program in approximately 7% of lung adenocarcinoma patients .  
Furthermore, the expression of both MET and HGF, its sole, high- affinity ligand, was 
demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or metastatic progression in a number of major human cancers  including NSCLC .  Inappropriate activation of MET is involved in 
multiple tumor oncogenic processes such as cell growth, angiogenesis, invasive growth, and especi ally in the metastatic process.  
MGCD265 is a small molecule inhibitor of MET and Axl .  In vitro studies have 
demonstrated that MGCD265 is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation in cells where MET is overexpressed or activated, but not in cells that l acked MET 
expression/activation .  These results are consistent with in vivo studies demonstrating 
activity of MGCD265 in human tumor xenograft -bearing mouse models , including 
marked tumor regression in models exhibiting MET  mutations and/or gene amplification .  
Additionally, anti -tumor activity has been observed in patients treated with MGCD265 in 
the Phase 1 study.  
The current study is designed to evaluate the tumor response to MGCD265 in patients with NSCLC with activating genetic alterations of  MET  consisting of either MET  
activating mutations or MET  amplification .  The primary endpoint of the study is 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) . 
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Objectives 
2.1.1  Primary  Objective  
• To determine  the tumor response to MGCD265  in the selected patient population.

     2.1.2  Secondary  Objective  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MGCD265 in the selected population. 
• To evaluate secondary efficacy endpoints with MGCD265 treatment in the selected 
population. 
• To assess correlation between selected tumor gene alterations using different analytical techniques in tumor tissue and ctDNA.  
• To assess change in genetic alteration status in ctDNA with MGCD265 treatment over time in the selected population.   
• To assess the population PK /PD of MGCD265 in the selected population. 
2.2 Endpoints  
2.2.1  Primary Endpoints  
• ORR as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. 
2.2.2  Secondary En dpoints  
• Safety characterized by [CONTACT_24975], incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship 
to study treatment of adverse events and laborator y abnormalities.  
• Secondary  efficacy endpoints:  
o DR; 
o PFS;  
o 1-Year Survival Rate; and  
o OS. 
• Gene alterations in tumor tissue and ctDNA  at prescreening/ baseline.  
• Change  in ctDNA through time.  
• Blood plasma MGCD265 concentration. 
• Blood plasma concentration of selected soluble biomarkers.  
  
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362445] 1.1.  Secondary objectives include evaluation of safety, secondary efficacy endpoints, tumor genetic alterations in tumor tissue and ctDNA  at pre screening/ baseline, change in ctDNA  through time , and 
population PK /PD.  Schedule of Assessments to be performed in the study is presented in 
Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.   
MGCD265 will be administered as an oral therapeutic twice daily (BID) in [ADDRESS_362446] be performed as scheduled according to the calendar to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy based on toxicity.  
This Phase 2 parallel -arm study will be conducted in four  groups of patients having 
genetic tumor alterations activating MET :  
A. MET  activating mutations in tumor tissue,  
B. MET  gene amplifications in tumor tissue,  
C. MET activating mutations in ctDN A, and  
D. MET gene amplifications in ctDNA  
Full and timely enrollment of patients into Treatment Arms A and B are central to this 
study meeting its objectives .  In addition, for patients enrolled based on a 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362447] (to be documented in the patient records).   
Individual patients with gene alterations are likely to qualify for entry into two or more treatment arms .  The correlation between target gene mutations in tumor tissue and 
ctDNA is expected to be high.  In addition, patients may have both target gene mutation and amplification .  The priority for assignment to treatment arm will be in the order A to 
D listed above .   
The Phase 2 study  will use a Bayesian Predictive Probability Design ( Lee-2008), applied 
separately and using the same assumptions in each treatment arm (see S ection 9.1) .  
Emerging tumor response data will be evaluated continuously beginning after [ADDRESS_362448] on -study disease assessment  and are 
considered part  of the mITT population.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_296951] 9.1.  Assuming the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_296952], the total sample  size to be 
evaluated in each treatment arm of the Phase 2 study is 45 patients .  The primary analysis 
will be conducted in the mITT  (defined in Section  9.3.1) .   
There is potential for one or more  arms of the Phase 2 study to yield results indicating 
that MGCD265 should be considered to provide an important advancement in treatment in this setting of unmet medical need .  If emerging data indicate that an accelerated 
approval market application may be undertaken for MGCD265 for one or more  of the 
selected patient populations, an analysis of the combined populations may be undertaken, or additional patients may be enrolled into the study, to increase th e precision of the 95% 
confidence interval around the ORR endpoint and/or to increase the size of the safety database in the target patient population.  As many as 55 additional patients in the mITT population may be enrolled in up to two treatment arms to ensure collection of sufficient data to support an accelerated approval market application .  Whether additional 
enrollment will include patients with MET mutation and/ or MET  gene amplification will 
depend on the emerging efficacy data in the populations as the study progresses.   
Considering the sample size planned for the four treatment arms in the Phase 2 study 
(45 patients each) and the possible addition of patients to pre pare for market application 
in this setting ( 55 patients  in each of two treatment arms ), the ultimate sample size for 
this study could include as many as 290 patients .  Enrollment through the stages of this 
study will proceed without planned interruption w hile data are accruing .  Decisions will 
be made expeditiously by [CONTACT_296981]-enrollment and include only outcomes among the specified number of patients 
according to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s.

anti-emetics, anti -diarrheals, or electrolyte supplementation), treatment may be resumed 
at the same dose; if not, treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose as described in  
Table 7.  Recurrence of the toxicity may be managed similarly .  If treatment is 
interrupted for more than 3 weeks, permanent discontinuation from study treatment 
should be consi dered.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Diarrhea  
Prevention and treatment of diarrhea should be aggressive to limit patient morbidity and 
to prevent potentially premature study drug discontinuation.  Example treatment regimens are recommended here and in Section 5.4.1, Concomitant Medications.  
Prophylactic anti- diarrheal treatment may be implemented at the discretion of the 
investigator .  A regimen recommen ded for primary prophylaxis for diarrhea is 
loperamide 2- [ADDRESS_362464] dose of MGCD265, followed by 2 mg every 
6–[ADDRESS_362465] subjects  by 
[CONTACT_296988]
® (loperamide) and, when indicated, with the 
addition of Lomotil® (diphenoxylate and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) .  Patients treated with MGCD265 
should be given instructions to be aware of the potential of developi[INVESTIGATOR_296957]265 and to start treatment with loperamide immediately upon the first sign 
of diarrhea .  If there is no improvement in severity of symptoms within 24 hours, 
additional anti -diarrheal medication in the form of Lomotil
® should be added.  If this does 
not effectively control symptoms, patients should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_296989] a dose reduction as indicated per protocol .  Patients with severe or prolonged diarrhea should be observed 
and treated for dehydration. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Increased Transaminases  
Increased transaminases should be evaluated to determine whether confounding factors 
exist, such as metastatic lesions or biliary obstruction .  For cases where treatment -related 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362466] ed recommendations are shown in Table 8.   
Table 8: Treatment Modification for Increase d Hepatic Transaminase 
Toxicity  Treatment Delay  Dose Modification  
Grade 1 ( > ULN to 3.0 ×  ULN)  May be implemented based on Investigator and patient discretion  
Grade 2  (> 3.0 to 5.0 ×  ULN)  Not required  Decrease by 1 dose level  
Grade 3/4 ( > 5.0 × ULN)  Hold until ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_362467] dose reduction; decrease by [CONTACT_2669] 1 dose level if dose is already reduced.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Hy’s Law  Cases  
In the event a patient develops concurrent increas e in AST and/or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN, 
bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN but without concurrent increases in alkaline phosphatase 
(i.e., alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN), that is not attributable to liver metastases or biliary obstruction , investigational study treatment should be permanently discontinued. 
5.3 Medication Error  
Medication errors may involve patient exposure to a wrong study drug, at a wrong dosing frequency , or at a wrong dose level  (e.g.,  a dose that is not planned in the study) .  
Medication errors occurring during the conduct of this study will be documented as AEs (regardless of whether clinical signs or symptoms are observed) and if serious consequences are observed, will be reported on Serious Adverse Event (SAE) forms .  In 
all cases of medication error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .   
5.4 Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
5.4.1  Concomitant Medication(s)  
Concomitant medications  must be locally -approved and used at doses and regimens that 
are co nsidered standard  of care.   
Treatment for co -morbidities, disease signs and symptoms and treatment emergent 
adverse events should be provided as necessary in the judgment of the investigator .  
Patients may continue to use any ongoing medications not prohi bited by [CONTACT_296070]/exclusion criteria or treatment plan .  Supportive medication (e.g., antiemetics, 
analgesics, anti -diarrheal s, etc.) is permitted .   
Prophylactic anti- diarrheal medication may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator  as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

     Antibiotics and analgesics should be used as needed.  Patients with neutropenic fever or 
infection should be treated promptly .  Therapeutic colony -stimulating factors should be 
used in accordance with American Society for Clinical Oncology  guidelines .  Packed red 
blood cell and platelet transfusions may be administered as clinically indicated.  
5.4.2  Concomitant Surgery or Radiation Therapy  
The use of surgery or radiation to manage cancer lesions during study treatment c an 
jeopardize assessment of  the primary objective  of the study, evaluation of disease status ; 
thus where clinically justified and possible, such treatment shoul d be undertaken prior to 
study enrollment .   
Although bleeding events have been reported with MGCD265 treatment, t here have been 
no reported bleeding complications following surgical procedures performed in subjects treated with MGCD265.  Significant inhibition of the VEGF r eceptor ( VEGFR ) pathway 
is not expected with MGCD265.  For patients requiring surgery while on- study,  
MGCD265 dosing should be held for 3 -7 days prior to any applicable procedure  when 
possible, and treatment should be re -initiated once adequate closure or healing of the 
surgical site is established .   
Any foreseeable need for palliative radiotherapy should be addressed before study entry, 
if possible and clinically appropriate (e.g., bone lesions at risk for spontaneous micro -fractures or painful lesions) .  However, these treatments may be used on- study  
where it is medically necessary .  For patients requiring radiation while on- study, 
MGCD265 should be interrupted during the period that the patie nt is receiving radiation 
treatment .   
5.4.[ADDRESS_362468] be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed .  Patients who completed the informed consent 
process but did not enroll on the study will be considered as screen failures .  Limited 
information will be recorded in the C RF for these patients .

6.4 Long- Term Follow -up and End of Study Assessment  
Patients will be followed for survival at two month intervals as outlined in the Schedule of As sessments ( Table 2 ).  Treatments received following participation in the study will 
be collected  in the CRF .   
6.5 Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
Patients may discontinue from study treatment or from the study at any time at their own 
request, or they may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral reasons, or the inability of the patient to comply  with the 
protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site .   
Criteria that may be used to discontinue patients from receipt of study medication will include, but will not be limited to:  
• Objective disease progression according  to RECIST 1.1 as determined by [CONTACT_1275]  (patient s who may deriv e clinical benefit may continue on treatment at 
the discretion of the investigato r); 
• Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;  
• Adverse event;  
• Significant protocol violation;  
• Lost to follow -up; 
• Refusal for further treatment;  
• Study termination  by [CONTACT_2728];

For ctDNA based analysis, a positive result for MET  mutation or gene amplification by 
[CONTACT_1034] -provided central laboratory (Guardant) is required.   
The method used to establish eligibility and the result will be documented in the patient’s site source documents and the CRF .   
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362472] establish eligibility of molecular alterations; those patients with qualifying mutations will then undergo clinical screening,  and eligible patients [ based on both 
qualifying mutation(s) and clinical screening ] will then be  assigned into a patient 
treatment arm upon confirmation of study eligibility .   
Testing of  tumor tissue is prioritized over ctDNA for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for this study .  Tumor tissue samples preferred for testing are the most recent 
tumor sample available; however, testing may be performed on samples taken any time during the disease course .  Testing may be performed on primary, recurrent, or metastatic 
lesions .  Biopsies having significant risk should not be performed for the purpose of 
determining patient eligibility, including but not limited to biopsies of the lung/mediastinum or endoscopic procedures ext ending beyond the esophagus, stomach, 
or bowel .  However, in the event that a patient desires to consider study participation and 
no tumor specimen is available, procedures having less risk may be considered.   
Tumor tissue or ctDNA may be test ed using the  Sponsor -provided central laboratory or a 
Sponsor -approved local laboratory to establish eligibility , with follow -up tissue or 
ctDNA sample (s) retrospectively analyzed in the Sponsor -provided central laboratory .   
Qualifying results by [CONTACT_296992] .   
The analytical techniques employed by [CONTACT_1034] -provided central laboratories  and 
criteria for acceptable genetic tumor alterations for this study  are described in the Study 
Laboratory Manual .  Included are:  
1. Gene panels for the next generation sequencing tests for tumor tissue and ctDNA 
samples,   
2. List of MET  mutations known to be a ctivating,  
3. Description and use of RT -PCR for detection of MET  exon [ADDRESS_362473] results returned to the study site .  Questions concerning adequacy of samples will result in delays beyond this 
timeframe .  It is possible that testing could be more rapid, e.g., 8 -10 days, but the patient 
and site should be prepared to wait for confirmation of eligibility for the full duration.

     The laboratories employed by [CONTACT_296993] (CLIA) .  Guidance on sample preparation and submission 
can be found in the Study Laboratory Manual.  
The following laboratories are considered Sponsor -approved local laboratories for this 
study  and prospective confirmation of eligibility from our central laboratory is not 
required prior to enrollment .  Additional Sponsor -approved local laboratories may be 
added during the study.  Tissue and ctDNA samples for retrospective analysis are 
requested for all patients that are enrolled based on a Sponsor -approved local laboratory 
test: 
• FoundationOne

Positive results from a site -specific local laboratory that may meet the criteria for 
molecular profiling eligibility will need to be confirmed by [CONTACT_1034] -provided central 
laboratory prior to full clinical screening .   
7.3 Efficacy  
All patients enrolled in the study are to be evaluated for disease activity as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2) .  Disease assessments are to be performed as 
scheduled according to the calendar days regardless of treatment delays .  On -study 
assessments will be performed at [ADDRESS_362474] study 
treatment for screening/baseline assessments and ±[ADDRESS_362475] is medically contraindicated, the imaging 
modality to be used (either CT without contrast or MRI) should be the modality which best evaluates the disease, and the choice should be determined by [CONTACT_4637] .  Depending on the adequacy for evaluation of 
disease, a combination of CT without contrast and MRI should most often be used.  CT 
without contrast is preferred for evaluation of lesions in l ung parenchyma .  MRI is not 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362476] the individual’s disease, in which 
case CT without contrast is preferred .   
For patients having effusions or ascites, cytological proof of malignancy should be  
obtained prior to selection of the effusion as a  non-target lesion .  Effusions that have not 
been evaluated using cytology or were found to be non- malignant should not be 
considered to be cancer lesions.  
Screening/baseline tumor assessments should include CT or MRI of the chest and abdomen, pelvis, whole body bone scan, MRI of the brain and evaluation of any 
superficial lesions .  For those s ites that routinely use  PET scans for assessment of bone 
lesions in lieu of skeletal scintigraphy , PET scans may be used on- study, with the same 
modality planned throughout the study for any given patient.  CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be conducted at every subsequent assessment.  D isease 
assessments subsequent to baseline assessment should also include whole body bone scans and /or MRI of the brain if metastatic disease is identified at screening/baseline by 
[CONTACT_296976].  Bone scans may be performed at one -half the frequency (every 12 weeks) of other disease assessments .  All other 
suspected sites of disease should be evaluated at each assessm ent.  Disease response will 
be assessed in accordance with RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer -2009 ).  Appendix [ADDRESS_362477] 1.1 to 
address potential temporary treatment effects such as tumor lesion cavitation .  
Assessments will be performed until objective disease progression is documented by  [CONTACT_1275], or subsequent anti -cancer therapy is begun .   
Patients experiencing tumor response (Partial Response [PR] or Complete Response [CR]) should undergo confirmatory assessment at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response .  It is acceptable to perform confirmatory assessments at the 
next appointed evaluation per protocol .  Bone scan is required as an element of the 
assessment of PR or CR response confirmation if bone lesions were identified at the baseline assessment.   When bone sc ans are not protocol -specified, assessment for time 
point response will be based on assessment of all other lesions with imputation of Non-CR/Non -PD for bone lesions recorded  as non -target lesions . 
The investigator’s assessment of disease response and prog ression will be the basis for 
patient management and study expansion decision making .  Potential exists for individual 
tumor lesions to cavitate or become otherwise difficult to evaluate for a period of time as the result of beneficial study treatment impa ct.  For example, t umor necrosis and 
cavitation may result in minor increase in overall individual lesion size or unclear tumor 
margins prior to recovery to a smaller lesion , development of scar tissue, or complete 
resolution.  For this reason, investigators may delay reaching the conclusion of disease progression until subsequent on- study disease assessments are performed .

7.4.1  Adverse Events  
Assessment of adverse  events will include type, incidence, severity (graded by [CONTACT_201439] [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
[CTCAE, Version 4.03] ), timing, seriousness, and relatedness to study treatment. 
Signs and symptoms of the patient’ s cancer diagnosis and/or comorbidities present at 
baseline will be recorded in the CRF  as adverse events .  Treatment -emergent adverse 
events  will be reported separately from  signs and symptoms of the patient’s cancer 
diagnosis and/or comorbidities that ar e present at Day [ADDRESS_362479] 
the date of change entered as the “end date” and a new AE record should be opened with the changed details .   
7.4.2  Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
A physical examination including all major body systems is mandated at Screening and 
End of Treatment Visits only .  During study treatment, s ymptom directed physical 
examinations will be performed .   
Vital signs to be asse ssed include weight, body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse 
rate.  Height will be recorded at screening only .  On days when both vital signs and PK 
sampling are scheduled, the vital signs should be assess ed prior to blood sampling .   
Clinically signif icant findings noted during screening will be reflected on the medical 
history CRF, while those noted during study treatment will be collected on the AE CRFs .   
7.4.3  Laboratory Safety Assessments

7.5 Laboratory Studies  
Laboratory studies for which blood will be collected include evaluation of PK, PD and ctDNA.  The schedules for sa mple collection are outlined in  Table 2 and Table 3.  Blood 
samples will be collected using an in -dwelling catheter or venipuncture into specified 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362482] nominal times relative to dosing .  A variation 
window is allowed for  each time poi nt as outlined in Table 3.  The actual time of drug 
administration and each PK sample collection will be recorded in the patient’s source 
document and the CRF . 
At each PK time point, blood samples will be collected into 6- mL K2EDTA  tubes .  For 
PK analysis, a total of approximately 48 mL of blood will be collected from each patient .  
Analysis of plasma samples for MGCD265  will be performed using specific validated 
bioanalytical methods .   
7.5.2  Pharmacodynamic Evaluation  
Pharmacodynamic parameters that may be investigated in this study include but are not limited to plasma levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and shed -MET re ceptor, prior 
to and during treatment .  At each PD time point, whole blood samples will be collected 
into 10- mL K2EDTA tubes .  For PD analysis, a total of approximately 40 mL of blood 
will be collected from each patient.  
7.5.3  Circulating Tumor DNA  
Blood samples  for ctDNA analysis will be c ollected at pre -screening or baseline , at the 
time of disease evaluation to confirm a disease response (PR or CR)  and at the End of 
Treatment visit, as outlined in Table 2.  For patients who  are enrolled based on 
prospective ctDNA testing, an additional sample may be requested prior to dosing to ensure adequate amounts of blood have been received to complete the remainder of analyses required per protocol.  Parameters that will  be evaluated include but are not 
limited to MET  mutations, MET  gene amplification, MET  gene rearrangement, and other 
genetic mutations or gene copy number changes associated with the path ogenesis of 
human cancers .   
At each ctDNA time point, blood samples will be collected into two 10mL Streck brand Cell-Free DNA Blood Collection tubes allowing shippi[INVESTIGATOR_296941] .  For ctDNA analysis, the  total volume of blood t o be collected between 
pre-screening and End of Treatment will be up to approximately 60 mL of blood.   
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362483] or other 
methods every 2 months (±  14 days) until death or lost to  follow -up.  Treatments received 
subsequent to study participation will be collected and recorded in the CRF. 
 
[ADDRESS_362484] information for the sponsor's Medical Monitor personnel for this trial is 
available in the  study contact [CONTACT_296997].  
8.2 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any reaction, side effect or other undesirable medical event that occurs during participation in a clinical trial,  regard less of treatment group or suspected 
causal relationship to study treatment.  All observed or volunteered AEs will be recorded 
in source documents and reported in the CRF .  The best available medical terminology 
should be used to describe AEs in source doc uments and CRFs .  Terms describing the 
diagnosis are preferred over individual signs and symptoms of the diagnosis .  If 
determination of the diagnosis is delayed, record signs and symptoms and add the 
diagnosis as an additional AE when available ; follow al l recorded AEs  to resolution.  
Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:   
• Signs or s ymptoms of co-morbidity, illness , or toxicity of study treatment ; 
• Signs or symptoms of worsening malignancy under study (disease progression 
assessed by [CONTACT_296998]).  
• Laboratory abnormal ities (see Section 8.2.1 for guidance for reporting in CRF);  
• Hypersensitivity;  
• Drug abuse , dependency , overdose , withdrawal or misuse ; 
• Signs or symptoms of drug interactions;  
• Extravasation;  
• Exposure during pregnancy  or via breastfeeding ; 
• Medication error;  or 
• Occupational exposure . 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362485] results should be reported as an AE in the CRF only if it is  
associated with one or more of the following:  
• Clinical symptoms;  
• Requires  additional tests (beyond repeats), treatment or  intervention;  
• Results in c hange in study treatment dosing;  
• Requires discontinuation from study treatment ; and/or  
• Considered by [CONTACT_296999].  
Hy’s Law  
Hepatic function abnormality de fined by [CONTACT_297000]/or ALT to ≥  3 × ULN 
concurrent with an increase in total bilirubin to ≥ 2 × ULN but without increase in 
alkaline phosphatase (i.e., alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN) meets the criteria for Hy’s Law and raises the concern for d rug-induced liver injury when no other cause of the 
abnormal laboratory results is  identified.  Follow -up investigations and inquiries will be 
initiated promptly by [CONTACT_120066]/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease (e.g., ch olelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an 
agent other than the investigational product.  
Cases meeting Hy’s Law should be reported as SAEs.  Study drug should be permanently discontinued for a Hy’s Law case.   
8.2.2  Severity Assessm ent 
AEs occurring during this study will be graded in accordance with the NCI  CTCAE 
Version 4.03.  Documentation of AE grading in the source documents and CRF should be consistent with provided definitions. 
8.2.3  Causality  
For each AE, the investigator should de termine and document whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused or contributed to the AE .  The 
investigator’s assessment should be recorded in the source document .  The CRF will 
provide the options for attribution to stud y treatment as “related” and “not related .” If the 
investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational 
product," this should be recorded in the CRF as “not related .” If the investigator does not 
know whether or not the study treatment is causally -related to the event, reporting for 
study purposes will be as “ related ” to study treatment.

8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
8.3.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an y event that meets any of the following criteria : 
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_296962]; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/permanent damage (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions);  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or 
surgical inter vention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition .  
Examples of such events are:  
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Progression of the malignancy under study, including any signs or symptoms of progression that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], should not  be reported as an SAE unless the 
outcome is fatal within the safety reporting period.   
Definition of Terms  
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the patient  was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form might have caused dea th.  For example, drug -induced hepatitis that 
resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening 
even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_296963] p rocedures that are 
not the result of AE (e.g., elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not

     worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs .  If anything untoward is reported during 
the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, eithe r 'serious' or 'non- serious' 
according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85765] (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or 
treatment that wo uld not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient 
setting .  When in doubt as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious. 
Disability/permanent damage: An AE is disabling or caused permanen t damage i f it 
resulted in a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions, 
e.g., a significant, persistent or permanent change , impairment, damage or disruption in 
body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality  of life .   
8.3.2  Exposure During Pregnancy  
Exposure during pregnancy (i.e., exposure in- utero  [EIU] ) may occur  in a female study 
participant , the female partner of a male study participant or study site personnel working 
with the investigational product (e.g., occupational exposure) if:  
• A female becomes o r is found to be pregnant during treatment or with in [ADDRESS_362486];  
• A male  is exposed to the investigational product prior to or around the time of 
conception or during the pregnancy of his partner.  
If exposure in- utero occurs, the investigator must submit an SAE f orm and an EIU  
Supple mental  Form  within [ADDRESS_362487] document on the EIU Form  that the patient 
was given this letter to provide to his partner.  
Follow -up to obtain pregnancy outcome information is to be conducted for all EIU 
reports .  In the case of a live birth, the health of the neonate should be assessed at the 
time of birth  and for up to 3 months after birth.  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will 
be handled on a case -by-case basis (e.g., follow -up on preterm infants to identify 
developmental delays) .  In the event the pregnancy is terminated , the reason(s) for 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase 2 in Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  Confidential  
MGCD265  Page 58 of 79 
 
 
 Mirati Therapeutics Inc.   
   
     termination should be reported and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the 
terminated fetus should be asse ssed by [CONTACT_4692]. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (i .e., ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fet al demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly) , 
an SAE report should be submitted to the Sponsor.  
8.4 Reporting of S AEs and AEs  
8.4.1  Reporting Period  
The active reporting period for SAEs begins from the time that the patient provides main study informed consent (i.e., prior to undergoing any study -specific procedure or 
assessment) and continues until all SAEs have resolved or stabilized to a chronic condition, whichever is later .  Death must be reported if it occurs during the active 
reporting period for SAEs regardless of whether a subsequent anticancer the rapy is 
administered .  Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active reporting 
period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them and if the investigator assesses at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug .   
The reporting period for non- serious AEs begins from the day of first dose of study 
treatment and continues until at least [ADDRESS_362488] administration of study treatment and/or until recovery from all acute toxicitie s associated with the drug administration  to a 
chronic condition, whichever is later .  If a patient begins a subsequent anticancer therapy, 
the AE reporting period ends at the time the new treatment is started .   
8.4.[ADDRESS_362489] be rep orted within 24 hours of Investigator/site knowledge of the event , 
irrespective of the extent of available AE information,  by [CONTACT_297001]’s pharmacovigilance representative designated in the Study Manual .  The 
24-hour timeframe als o applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously 
forwarded SAE reports and to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during 
pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding .  The need for an expedited report to 
regulatory authorities will be determined by [CONTACT_297002] .  The Sponsor will notify study investigators of all S uspected, 
Unexpected (as judged against the Investigator Brochure) S erious A dverse Reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R)  reports .  The i nvestigator is responsible for reporting all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the 
IRB/EC .   
All AE (including  SAEs ) must be documented in source documents and reported in the 
CRF .  Please note that the CRF and SAE report forms may  collect information in 
somewhat different formats .  Where the requested data overlap  in different formats , the 
information should be consistent between the two forms .

     9 STATISTICS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this 
study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_1034] .  The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any 
major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its anal ysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment. 
9.1 Hypothesis and Sample Size  
This Phase 2, parallel -arm study will use a Bayesian Predictive Probability Design 
(Lee-2008 ) that minimizes the number of patients enrolled to test the hypothesis .  The 
design  will be applied separately and using the same assumptions in each of 
four treatment arms .  As many as 45 patients are planned for inclusion in the primary 
analysis  for each treatment arm .  The study also provides for the addition of up to 
55 patients to  each of  two treatment arms to provide sufficient safety and/or efficacy data 
to support an accelerated approval market application  in two study populations .  Thus, 
the ultimate sample size for this study could include as many as [ADDRESS_362490] v1.1 is the primary endpoint .  With currently available 
treatments, ORR is assumed to be 20% (p
0), thus this rate is considered uninteresting .  
The target ORR using MGCD265 in this study is 40% (p 1).  The trial will monitor the 
numbe r of observed responses continuously after evaluating the first on- study disease 
assessments of the first 10 patients  in each treatment arm  in the mITT population.  In 
creating the statistical design, the Type 1 error (α) is constrained to < 0.05 and Power  
(1-β) is constrained to ≥ 0.90. 
Using the parameters identified, the ultimate sample size for each treatment arm is as 
many as 45 patients in the mITT population.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (rejection regions), 
expressed as number of responses per patients treat ed, are 0/10, 1/14, 2/18, 3/22, 4/26, 
5/29, 6/32, 7/35, 8/37, 9/39, 10/41, 11/43, 12/44, and 13/45.  Thus, if more than 
[ADDRESS_362491] 45 patients enrolled who meet the criteria for 
the mITT population, the drug will be declared efficacious .  If the true ORR is 20% (null 
hypothesis), the probability of early termination (under H 0) during the study is 0.92 and 
the expected sample size prior to termination is 28 patients .  The Type 1 error is equal to 
0.0499 and Power equal to 0.9065.  If the true ORR is 40%, the probability of rejecting 
the hypothesis at each evaluation of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_296964], but cumulatively is 0.0935.  
If the true ORR is 40% and N=45, the exact 95% confidence interval (Clopper -Pearson) 
around the point  estimate for ORR will be (25.7, 55.7) .  If the outcome in a treatment arm 
is promising and the option is taken to enroll up to 100 patients in the mITT in a specific 
treatment arm  (45 patients in the initial arm plus 55  patients) , to narrow the confidence  
interval around the ORR point estimate and to increase the size of the safety database, the 
exact 95% confidence interval around a true ORR of 40% will be (30.3, 50.3) .  Data 
collected in patients enrolled beyond the planned Phase 2 sample size will be us ed in 
secondary and supportive analyses .  The primary analysis includes independent 
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362492] 45 patients; study expansion 
enables confirmation of the results of the primary analysis .  The use of the Bayesian 
Predictive Probability Design within each arm effectively controls the overall Type I 
error to a maximum of 5% for each population of interest. 
9.2 Data Handling  
Listings of all patient data will be prepared .  Data summaries will be presented in tabular 
and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, by [CONTACT_297003] , where appropriate .  If some (or all) of 
those four groups of patients show similar objective response rate, data summaries 
(efficacy and safety) will also be presented for those groups combined as supportive 
analyses .  Response rates will be considered similar between groups, if they are within 
± 10%.  Further d etails of planned analyses will be described in the SAP .   
For all variables, only the observed data from patients will be used in the statistical analyses; there is no plan to estimate missing data .  Patients without a valid clinical 
response assessment will be assigned a best overall response of not evaluable (NE) .  Dat a 
from patients who are lost to follow -up or have missing observations before reaching an 
endpoint in any of the time -to-event analyses will be treated as censored with specific 
rules defined in the SAP.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
9.3.1  Modified Intent -to-Treat Popula tion 
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population is defined in each arm as all patients 
who receive treatment at least one dose of MGCD265 on this study.  
The primary efficacy analys es of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
performed in the mITT population.   
9.3.[ADDRESS_362493] of all patients in the mITT population for whom results of gene alteration tests in tumor tissue and/or ctDNA are available.  
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362494] v1.1 (Appendix 2
).  Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percent of patients 
documented to have a confirmed  Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as 
reported by [CONTACT_297004] .  The primary analy sis will be conducted 
approximately [ADDRESS_362495] patient is enrolled , allowing for observation of an 
early disease response and confirmation of PR or CR .  ORR as reported by [CONTACT_297005] . 
Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) for ORR, CR, and PR will be presented.  The exact 95% con fidence interval of these response rates will be constructed .  An exact 
test for single proportion (two- sided α=5%) will be performed to test H0: ORR ≤  20% 
against H1: ORR > 20% .  Other details will be described in the SAP.  
9.4.2  Duration of Response  
Duration of  Response (DR) is defined as the time from date of the first documentation of 
objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of Objective Progression of Disease (PD) or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD .  
Censoring f or the DR endpoint will be assigned on the date of the last tumor assessment 
if no assessment of tumor progression is identified by [CONTACT_297006] .  DR will only be calculated for the subgroup of 
patients with an objective response .  The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to obtain the 
estimate of median DR .

 Mirati Therapeutics Inc.   
   
     9.4.3  Progression Free Survival  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to 
first PD or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD .  Censoring for the 
PFS endpoint will be assigned on the date of the last tumor assessment if no assessment 
of tumor progression is identified by [CONTACT_297007] s tudy.  For patients in whom two or more sequential assessments are missed, 
followed by [CONTACT_297008], the PFS endpoint will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment before the gap .  Patients lacking an evaluation of 
disease after first study treatment will have their PFS time censored on the date of first dose with duration of [ADDRESS_362496] on-study follow -up that the patient is reported to be alive .  The Kaplan -Meier method 
will be used to estimate the median OS and 1 -year Survival Rate; the 95% confidence 
interva l of the 1- year survival rate will also be reported .   
9.5 Safety Data Presentations and Summaries

     (as defined in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan) will be included in the summary 
statistics and a listing of individual data points or subjects excluded from the analysis will 
be presented .   
9.6.2  Gene Alterations in Tumor DNA 
Tumor tissue and c tDNA ge netic alterations  activating MET  will be presented 
descriptively, by [CONTACT_2939].  Moreover, change -from -baseline in  ctDNA will be 
presented by [CONTACT_297013]265 treatment over time.  
A concordance analysis will be conducted between target gene alterations identified in 
tumor tissue versus ctDNA  in individual patients  at prescreening/ baseline.  Cohen's 
Kappa, sensitivity and specificity will be estimated  for ctDNA  as well as Spearman 's 
correlations between tumor tissue and ctDNA.   
An analysis of covariance will be performed on changes in ctDNA through time including Time and Treatment as fixed effects and ctDNA at baseline as covariate.  
Further details of the analyses will be presented in the SAP .   
9.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim statistical analysis is planned during this study .  However, ORR will be 
evaluated throughout the study as per the Bayesian Predictive Probability Design in order to decide whether or not a group should be stopped for lack of tumor response . 
9.8 Internal Data Management Committee 
Interim data will be reviewed for the purpose of study expansion decision making .  The  
Internal Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be comprised of a limited group of Sponsor repres entatives  not directly involved in the conduct of the study .  The IDMC  will 
review emerging data in accordance with a separate c harter .  Investigators will be 
informed of enrollment decisions but details of efficacy results will be protected until communic ation points specified in the IDMC charter .   
9.9 Evaluation of Enrollment Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_296965] .  The following guidelines  will 
apply to each treatment arm when  determin ing number of events in the numerator and 
denominator  in the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] : 
  
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase 2 in Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  Confidential  
MGCD265  Page 65 of 79 
 
 
 Mirati Therapeutics Inc.   
   
     1. The numerator will include patients with objective responses (PR or CR) at any time 
prior to disease progression as assessed by [CONTACT_297014] .  Unconfirmed responses will be included until sufficient time has elapsed to 
allow  confirmation  of response ; if the response is not confirmed, the response will be 
excluded from  the numerator during  subsequent re views .   
2. The denominator will include:  
a. Patients included in the numerator;  
b. Patients discontinued from treatment;  
c. Patients at the second or subsequent on- study disease assessment (scheduled after 
4 treatment cycles, at Week 13) without PR, CR or PD (i.e., patient has Stable 
Disease [SD] or Not Evaluable [NE]) .   
3. The denominator will exclude:  
a. Patients on treatment that have not yet reached the first on -study disease 
assessment;  
b. Patients on treatment with SD or NE at the first on -study disease assessment 
(scheduled after 2 treatment cycles, at Week 7) .   
At each evaluation of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the contribution of each participant ’s experience to 
the numerator or denominator will be updated based on current data .  For example , a 
patient having SD at Week 13 m ay contribut e only to the denominator at one evaluation , 
but be included also in the numerator at the next evaluation based on new data 
documenting PR or CR  at Week 19. 
A degree of discordance is expected between investigator assessments of disease 
respons e/progression and central review of disease response /progression.  No attempt 
will be made to retrospectively apply the later emerging cent ral review assessments to the 
enrollment stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] .   
The IDMC may  elect  to apply  the Bayesian Predictive Probability Design only to those 
patients taking the SDD formulation  in order to mitigate the potential confounding effects 
from formulation change .  These details are outlined in the IDMC charter.

[ADDRESS_362504] to patients may be implemented immediately, provided the  
IRB/EC is notified within [ADDRESS_362505] be submitted to the IRB/EC and the investigator must await approval before implementing the changes .  The Sponsor will be responsible for 
submitting protocol amendments to the appropriate regulat ory authorities for approval.  
If in the judgment of the IRB/EC, the investigator, and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the patient and/or has an impact on the patient's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification .  In 
such cases, informed consents (revised as appropriate to address protocol amendments) will be obtained for patients enrolled in the study before continued participation. 
13.2 Protocol Deviations  
Prospective permission to deviate from the eligibility criteria for this protocol will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_1034] .  Study specified assessments should not be omitted and the

265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362509] 1.1 has been made  to account for the possibility of temporary 
changes resulting from the potentially beneficial treatment response of tumor necrosis and cavitation .   
Categorizing Lesions at Baseline  
Measurable Lesions  
• Accurately measured in at least one dimension.  
• When assessed by [CONTACT_462], l ongest diameter at least 10 mm or greater (slice 
thickness 5- 8 mm), measured in the axial plane .  If the slice thickness is greater than 
5 mm (including any inter -slice gap), the longest diameter must be at least twice the 
slice thickness . 
• Malignant lymph nodes with a short axis (defined as the largest measurement perpendicular to the longest diameter of the lesion) [ADDRESS_362510] axis for all 
other lesions .   
Non-Measurable Disease  
• Lesions too small to be considered measurable (including nodes with short axis 
between 10 and 14.9 mm) or  truly non- measurable disease such as pleural or 
pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory b reast disease, leptomeningeal disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal masses identified by [CONTACT_297019].  
• Bone disease is non- measurable with the exception of soft tissue c omponents that can 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_297020] .   
• Previously irradiated lesions  (or those  subjected to other local treatment) are 
non-measurable unless  they have  progressed since completion of treatment.  
Normal Lesions  
• Non-malignant s imple cysts should not be recorded either as target or non- target 
disease.  Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they meet the specific definition above .   
• Lymph nodes with short a xis < 10 mm are considered normal and should not be 
followed as disease.  
  
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362511] be done  within the window 
of time specified in the Schedule of Assessments prior to treatment.  If the baseline 
assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generally should be indeterminate .   
The determination of whether lesions are measurable is performed only at baseline .  
“Measurable” at baseline means eligible for selection as target lesions, and thus for 
quantitative assessment throughout the trial .  Once selected as a target lesion, a lesion 
remains target throughout the trial.  
Target Lesions  
All measu rable lesions up to a maximum of 2  lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline .  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability f or 
accurate repeated measurements .  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in 
the case of pathological lymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesi ons) for all 
target lesions at baseline will be the basis for comparison to look for partial response at later assessments .   
• If [ADDRESS_362512] diameter measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a large target lesion splits, the  sum of the parts is used. 
• Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesion becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_362513] disappeared; otherwise a default valu e of 5 mm should be 
recorded.  
• When nodal lesions decrease to < 10 mm (normal), the actual measurement should 
still be recorded.  
Non-Target Lesions  
All non- measurable disease is non -target .  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non- target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather 
qualitative evaluations of status will be recorded .  Multiple non- target lesions in one 
organ may be recorded as a single item on the CRF  (e.g., ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
Objecti ve Response Status at Each Evaluation  
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent administration of contrast .  If not, subsequent objective statuses may be indeterminate .

     Target Disease  
• Complete Response (C R): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease .  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
< 10 mm) .  All target lesions must be assessed.  
• Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease un der baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions .  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target 
lesions .  All target lesions must be assessed .   
• Stable  Disease (SD) : Does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions 
must be assessed .  Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases 
by [CONTACT_21316] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds .   
• Progressive Disease (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy) with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm .   
• Indetermin ate: Progression has not been documented, and  
o one or more target lesions have not been assessed,  
o or assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline and impaired assessment,  
o or one or more target lesions cannot be measured accurately  (e.g., poorly visible 
unless due to being too small to measure),  
o or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared 
or increased .   
Non-Target Disease  
• CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor mar ker 
levels .  All lymph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size ( < 10 mm short axis). 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of any non -target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits .   
• PD: Unequivocal progression of pre -existing lesions .  Generally the overal l tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy .  In the presence 
SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non- target 
disease should be rare .   
• Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined a nd one or more non- target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline.  
  
  
265-109  v3.0  – Phase [ADDRESS_362514] assessment giving the impression of progression.  If 
repeat assessments indicate that the change was a process  of transition, then NE (not 
evaluable)  should be recorded during the period of transition, and PR or CR may be 
recorded for subsequent evaluations .  The CRF will collect information on the 
observations during the period of transition to support the assessment conclusions.   
Supplemental Investigations  
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completely, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.

     Subjective Progression  
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment due to worsening health status attributable 
to advancement of the malignancy under study but without objective evidence of disease progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs .  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health Status .

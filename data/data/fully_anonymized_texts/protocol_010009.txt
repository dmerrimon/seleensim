 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title: An Open -Label and Long-Term Extension Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Ustekinumab in the Treatment of Patients with Ichthyoses 
 
Investigation Type: Drug  
 Study Type: Open Label  Purpose and Rationale:  The ichthyoses are a group of lifelong genetic disorders that share 
characteristics of generalized skin thickening, scaling and underlying cutaneous inflammation. The vast majority are orphan disorders and are associated with extremely poor quality of life related to social ostracism from altered appearance, associated itchiness and discomfort, and functional limitations from the skin disease. Among the more common “orphan” forms of ichthyosis are autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI; includes la mellar ichthyosis/LI and congenital ichthyosiform 
erythroderma/CIE), Netherton syndrome (NS) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_418197] (EI). However, there are dozens of other syndromic and non- syndromic ichthyotic disorders as well. Therapy is time- consuming 
for patie nts or parents and is supportive, focusing on clearance of the scaling. There are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_418198]. We have recently found marked 
elevations in Th17/IL -[ADDRESS_527740] similar to the inflammatory pattern of psoriasis. While the significance of the high expression of 
Th17/IL-[ADDRESS_527741] genes across all forms of ichthyosis studied to date is unknown, the high expression of genes of th e Th17/IL-[ADDRESS_527742] in psoriasis is thought to be causative for the disease manifestations. 
We propose that IL -12/IL-23 - targeting therapeutics will safely suppress the inflammation and possibly 
the other features of ichthyosis, improving quality of life. As a proof-of-concept study, we propose to treat children (6 years of age and higher) and adults with ichthyotic disorders with ustekinumab in an open- label trial to serially assess clinical response to and safety of ustekinumab for this group of 
disorders.   
Co-primary objectives :  
• To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab for ichthyosis, as measured by [CONTACT_418226] 50% reduction 
in severity (using the Ichthyosis Severity Score ( ISS) measure) at 7 months  after initiation  of 
study drug (Visit 6)  
• To evaluate the safety of ustekinumab for ichthyosis, based on occurrence of bacterial and fungal infections  
 
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate reduction in  ISS, and ISS  subset measures for erythema and scaling ( ISS-E, ISS -S) at 
months 7, 13, 19 and 25 after study drug initiation. 
• To evaluate  improvement in quality  of life assessments at  months 7, 13, 19,  and 25 after  study  
drug initiation  (Dermatology Life  Quality  Index/ DLQI  for 16  years  and older;  Children’s  
Dermatology Life  Quality  Index/ CDLQI  for children  6-15 years;  specific  questions  about impact  
of scaling  on daily  life) 
• To evaluate  non-infectious AEs and all  SAEs  related  to ustekinumab use,  particularly  injection  
reactions 
Page 8 of 60  
  
These clinical indices will be assessed as per the Schedule of Assessments flowchart (Appendix 1) and 
require minimal input or time commitment from the study participants but are critical to analyze trends 
over time.  
 
Study Design: Patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. If using a systemic retinoid 
or immunomodulatory agent, the patient will wait four weeks to initiate therapy. Washout for topi[INVESTIGATOR_418199]. If the patient has not had testing for TB ( QuantiFERON gold, given that the 
generalized skin scaling and erythema precludes [COMPANY_003]i) in the previous three months, testing will be 
performed at screening and must be negative before starting ustekinumab. All patients who have not had genetic testing (research or a CLIA -approved lab) will be required to have testing sent to [CONTACT_418256] at Yale University and will enroll in [CONTACT_418257]’s “Screening for the Genetic Basis of 
Dermatologic Disease” study IRB# 2009 -[ZIP_CODE]. As long as the clinical diagnosis is ichthyosis / an 
ichthyotic disorder, having a known gene with mutation is not required before entry in to this study , but is 
required before study end. Each subject will receive ustekinumab at Baseline (Day 0), month 1, and then 
every 8 weeks thereafter (months 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11).  Subjects who do not achieve a 25% reduction in the 
Ichthyosis Severity Score (ISS) at month 7 (Visit 6) will be withdrawn from the study due to lack of efficacy. The final assessment of the open label period will be month 13. Those subjects who have evidence of improvement (per the subject) will have the option to continue in the Long Term Extension  
(LTE)  portion of the study for an additional [ADDRESS_527743]’s baseline visit of the LTE, or a subject can return for an LTE 
baseline visit any time after completion of the open -label phase. During the LTE, subjects will have visits 
every 8 weeks (month s 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25). Safety labs including hematology, chemistry and 
QuantiFERON gold will be repeated at  months 13 and 25.

● Before  screening visit , females must be:  
• Postmenopausal, defined as  
≥ [ADDRESS_527747] 18 months,  
OR  
• ≥ [ADDRESS_527748] 6 months and a serum FSH level > 40 IU/mL  
OR 
• Of childbearing potential, in which case she must satisfy at least one of the below: 
 Surgically sterile (has had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy), or 
 If heterosexually active, practicing a highly effective method of birth control, 
including hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, 
contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, double -barrier method ( e.g., condoms, 
diaphragm, or cervical cap, with spermicidal foam, cream, film, gel or suppository), or male partner sterilization, consistent with local regulations regarding use of birth control methods for subjects participating in clinical trials, for a period of [ADDRESS_527749]  administration of study agent, 
OR  
 Not heterosexually active. Abstinence is  allowed  as an acceptable form of 
contraception. 
 Note: If a woman participant’s childbearing potential changes after start of the study (e.g., a premenarchal woman experiences menarche) or if women of childbearing potential who are not heterosexually active at screening become heterosexually active, they must agree to utilize a highly effective method of birth control, as described above.  
 Female participants of childbearing potential (menstrual and not surgically sterile), must have a negative serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin ( ᵦ-hCG) pregnancy 
test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at Week 0 (prior to screening visit) and agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted 
reproduction during the study and for a period of [ADDRESS_527750] administration of study agent.  
• Male participants who are not surgically sterilized and are heterosexually active with a 
woman of childbearing potential, must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., 
Page 10 of 60  
 condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) and to not donate sperm during 
the study and for [ADDRESS_527751] study agent administration.  
● Subjects must have a confirmed clinical diagnosis of ichthyosis/ichthyotic disorder, and either 
have completed genotype or  be willing to be genotyped (genotype results will not be required for 
entry into the study).  
● Subjects must have at least moderate erythema (ISS -erythema score ≥ 2) related to his/her 
ichthyosis/ichthyotic disorder.  
● Subjects must be clinically judged to be immunocompetent  based on baseline laboratory testing 
(chemistry and hematology) , medical history and physical examination . 
● Subjects will have baseline negative QuantiFERON®-TB gold, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV laboratory testing.  
 
Exclusion criteria  
● Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent or assent (or who do not have consent from 
a Legally Authorized Representative if < 18 years).  
● Subjects with  ichthyosis vulgaris or X- linked recessive ichthyosis . 
● Subjects who have a known allergy to ustekinumab or its products. 
● Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who are considering becoming pregnant.  
● Subjects who have prior biologic use targeting IL-12/IL-23 monoclonal antibody. 
● Subjects who have used a systemic retinoid or systemic anti -inflammatory  agent within 4 weeks 
prior to baseline. 
● Subjects who have used topi[INVESTIGATOR_418200], retinoid or keratolytic  agent  in the 
previous 24 hours . 
● Subjects with active infections or recent history of serious infections, malignancies or history of malignancies, recent immunizatio ns with live vaccines, or any severe, progressive, or 
uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, 
or cerebral disease, or signs or symptoms thereof  
● Subjects who are under 6 years of age at the time of screening.  
 Ustekinumab is approved for Crohn's  disease  and has been tested/ found to be safe for psoriasis as young 
as 6 years of age with pK and safety validation to this age level. Although we would love to use in younger children with ichthyosis, we chose 6 years of age because of the extensive experience and safety testing to this age level.  
 We are focusing on inflammatory forms of ichthyosis with Th17 skewing in the skin and blood.  Neither ichthyosis vulgaris nor recessive X -linked ichthyosis are inflammatory forms of ichthyosis and neither 
has been tested for Th17 skewing; both are easily amenable to available topi[INVESTIGATOR_418201], especially using a systemic agent. 
 Duration of Treatment: [ADDRESS_527752] will receive ustekinumab at Baseline (Day 0)  and Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. During the 
LTE, subjects will receive injections every 8 weeks for one year: Month 13 , Month 15, Month 17, Month 
19, Month 21, and Month 2 3. Subjects will come back in for a follow-up visit at Month 25 for an end of 
study visit (no drug administration).     Efficacy Assessments  
● ISS: Ichthyosis Severity Score  and subscores ( ISS-E, ISS- S) 
● Ichthyosis Severity Self- Assessment  
● DLQI: Dermatology Life Quality Index (for those 16 years and older) 
● CDLQI: Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (for those 6 - 16 years of age) 
● IFTB: Ichthyosis Financial and Time Burden 
● 8-item short form PROMIS itch and Stigma score for children 8 and above (parent proxy for under age 8)  
● Itch and Pain NRS: Numerical Rating Systems (0-10) for pruritus and pain  
● TEWL (transepi[INVESTIGATOR_418202]): Functional assessment of barrier  
 Note the severity assessments will be performed by a trained study team member with PI [INVESTIGATOR_58619] .  
 Safety Assessments  
● Adverse events and serious adverse events monitoring  
• Adverse events of special interest include all malignancies  and all cases of active 
tuberculosis (TB). 
● Laboratory assessments: Quanti FERON  Gold, chemistry, hematology 
● Vital signs, physical examination 
 Other Assessments  
● Photography 
● Serum samples for cytokine analysis or proteomics 
● Microbiome samples  
● Tape strips to evaluate mRNA expression and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_1800]  
● Saliva for DNA analysis (stored; [ADDRESS_527753].  Keith  Choate at Yale University if gene 
unknown/untested and subject consents to IRB# 2009-[ZIP_CODE]). IRB 2009-[ZIP_CODE] is separately supported only by [CONTACT_418227].  
 Data Analysis 
Statistical analysis will be performed by  [CONTACT_418228]. 
 
The primary analysis population will be based on a modified intention- to-treat (mITT) population, which 
is defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the treatment. Because the loading dose is 
given at baseline, this should effectively include all the treated patients. 
 Efficacy and other data will be summarized. Descriptive statistics of demographics and other baseline characteristics will be presented for all subjects. The primary efficacy variable is the ISS (composite) at 7 
Page 12 of 60  
 months after study drug initiation. The primary safety variable is t occurrence of bacterial and fungal 
mucocutaneous infections by 13 months after study drug initiation. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_418229]. The number 
and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE/SAE will be stratified by [CONTACT_418230], or a 
preferred term, and severity of the adverse event, and recorded and tabulated overall by [CONTACT_199231]- strata.

 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease  
The ichthyoses are a group of lifelong genetic disorders that  share characteristics of skin thickening, 
scaling and underlying cutaneous inflammation. Other than ichthyosis vulgaris (commonly associated 
with atopic dermatitis) and recessive X -linked ichthyosis (1: 1500 boys), the > 30 subtypes of ichthyosis 
are rare (<1:100,000 individuals). Among these rare subtypes are (i) epi[INVESTIGATOR_418197]  (mutation in 
one of the genes encoding suprabasal keratins ), (ii) Netherton syndrome (mutations in SPI[CONTACT_66150]5, leading to 
excessive epi[INVESTIGATOR_418203] ), (iii) autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis or ARCI  
(associated with biallelic mutations in a dozen genes and ranges in appearance from darker, plate- like 
scaling as in lamellar ichthyosis or LI  to intense erythema with fine scaling as in congenital ichthyosiform 
erythroderma or CIE, which includes harlequin ichthyosis, the most severe form ), (iv) various forms of 
erythrokeratodermas (often defects in genes that encode connexins or desmosomal components) , and ( v) 
other ichthyosiform disorders, such as IFAP. A ll ichthyosis types share a defective protein and lipid 
barrier, which manifests functionally as increased transepi[INVESTIGATOR_418204].  
 These forms of ichthyosis lead to life -long disfigurement due to the highly visible erythema and scaling. 
The quality of life of affected children and adults is poor, not only because of their appearance and social ostracism, but also because of the frequent associated itchiness (pruritus) and functional limitations related to the inflamed, often fissured , skin and limited joint mobility related to skin tightness and pain. 
Affected individuals also have a markedly reduced ability to sweat, restricting sport s and outdoor 
activities in warmer weather.  
 Therapy for the ichthyoses is supportive and time-consuming for patients. Most use long baths, emollients and agents that peel the thick scale, specifically keratolytics and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775]. Oral retinoids are most effective at removing scale and skin th ickening but tend to increase skin and mucosal inflammation and 
have potential side effects (most commonly hypertriglyceridemia, teratogenicity  and, with chronic use, 
hyperostosis). The high risk of systemic absorption of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (and side effects of systemic steroids) restricts their use for  the cutaneous inflammation associated with these lifelong diseases. There 
remains a huge unmet need for more effective and safer treatments, ideally therapy that improves both the scaling and the cutaneous inflammation with its associated pruritus and discomfort.  
1.2 Clinical Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that: a) intervention with  ustekinumab will improve the severity  of ichthyosis features; 
and b) the administration of ustekinumab will be well -tolerated.  
1.3 Rationale for Ustekinumab Use  
Ustekinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds 
both human interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 via a common IL-12/23p40 subunit. Ustekinumab neutralizes the activities of IL -12 and IL-23 by [CONTACT_418231]-12 receptor beta-1 receptor protein, which is expressed on the surface of immune cells. 
Ustekinumab has been shown to be an effective treatment and has a favorable benefit risk profile 
for adult and pediatric psoriasis patients age 12 and older. Its use in psoriasis patients ages ≥ 6 
 
Page 14 of 60  
 and < 12 is currently being investigated 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]?term=ustekinumab&cond=psoriasis&rank=1). We have recently found marked elevations in Th17/IL-[ADDRESS_527754] similar to the inflammatory pattern of psoriasis. While the significance of the high expression of Th17/IL- [ADDRESS_527755] genes across all forms of 
ichthyosis studied to date is unknown, the high expression of genes of the Th17/IL-[ADDRESS_527756] in psoriasis is thought to be causative for the disease manifestations.  We had experience with initiation of ustekinumab in a 10 year old patient with erythrokeratoderma with cardiomyopathy; despi[INVESTIGATOR_418205] (and being on oral tacrolimus/rapamycin after cardiac transplant), her erythroderma was intense and her scaling was uncomfortable. We found high levels of Th17/IL-23 cytokines in her skin and blood.  Within 4 months of ustekinumab use (and with continued improvement thereafter), her skin color had normalized,  and her scaling was dramatically improved (Paller et al. The spectrum of 
manifestations in desmoplakin gene (DSP) spectrin repeat 6 domain mutations: immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_418206]. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2018;78:498-505). We propose that IL-12/IL-23 - targeting therapeutics will safely suppress the inflammation and 
possibly the other features of ichthyosis, improving quality of life. 
1.4 Risks of Ustekinumab 
Per the STELARA®  (ustekinumab ) Prescribing Information (version June 2018 ): 
 
The most common (≥ 3%) adverse reactions associated with ustekinumab in patients being treated for 
psoriasis were nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], headache, and fatigue. Sometimes 
serious infections have occurred in patients on ustekinumab. There is a theoretical risk for infections from 
mycobacteria, salmonella, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in patients deficient in IL-
12/IL- 23. Patients will be evaluated for mycobacterium tuberculosis and treated for latent TB prior to 
administration of ustekinumab. Ustekinumab may increase the risk of malignancy; the safety of 
ustekinumab in patients with history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. Anaphylaxis or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Cases of noninfectious pneumonia, including interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post -approval monitoring of ustekinumab. Allergic alveolitis has also been reported 
during the post- approval monitoring period. One case of Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy 
Syndrome (RPLS) was also reported. The potential discomforts, side effects and risks associated with ustekinumab will be discussed with all subjects during the informed consent process.  
2. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Primary Endpoints  
Co-primary objectives :  
• To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab for ichthyosis, as measured by [CONTACT_418226] 50% reduction 
in severity ( using the Ichthyosis Severity Score (ISS) measure) at 7 months  after initiation  of 
study drug (Visit 6)  
• To evaluate the safety of ustekinumab for ichthyosis, based on occurrence of bacterial and fungal infections  
 
Page 15 of 60  
 2.2 Secondary O bjectives:  
• To evaluate reduction in ISS , and ISS subset measures for erythema and scaling (ISS -E, ISS-S ) at 
months 7, 13, 19 and 25 after study drug initiation. 
• To evaluate  improvement in quality  of life assessments at  months 7, 13, 19,  and 25 after  study  
drug initiation  (Dermatology Life  Quality  Index /DLQI  for 16  years  and older;  Children’s  
Dermatology Life  Quality  Index/CDLQI  for children  6-15 years;  specific  questions  about impact  
of scaling  on daily  life) 
• To evaluate  non-infectious AEs and all  SAEs  related  to ustekinumab use,  particularly  injection  
reactions 
 
Exploratory objectives:  
• Skin and blood biomarkers will be stored. In the future, should ustekinumab prove effective, investigators will seek funding (ideally, through the NIH) to evaluate the reduction in stratum 
corneum and blood IL-12/IL-23 and Th17 marker expression, along with other involved 
biomarkers  
 
These clinical indices will be assessed as per the Schedule of Assessments flowchart (Appendix 1) and require minimal input or time commitment from the study participants but are critical to analyze trends 
over time.  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Centers  
This study will be performed at one site: the Department of Dermatology at Northwestern University  
Feinber g School of Medicine /Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_418207]. The entire clinical component will be 
performed and database housed at Northwestern University.  
3.2 Study Organization 
The Principal Investigator (PI) or the delegated sub-investigators of this project will be responsible for 
protocol development, consenting of subjects, performing skin biopsies, treatment and evaluation of 
subjects, review of adverse events, and reporting adverse events to the  IRB. Our site will have a project 
manager whose duties will include protocol development, grant administration for the individual study site, purchasing, case report form and source document design and development, and oversight of t he project at 
the study site. The project manager at Northwestern will also be responsib le for any reporting needed to 
Company.    
The site project manager will also  review consents, serious adverse events, and source verification on a 
quart erly basis throughout the study. The site project manager  will work with the statisticians  to complete 
any statistical analysis. Data will be entered by [CONTACT_418232] a central REDCap database based at 
Northwestern  University . The Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit currently manages both international and 
national multisite REDCap databases.

Page 18 of 60  
 ● Subjects who are under 6 years of age at the time of screening.  
 
Ustekinumab is approved for Crohn's  disease  and has been tested/ found to be safe for psoriasis as young 
as 6 years of age with pK and safety validation to this age level. Although we would love to use in younger children with ichthyosis, we chose 6 years of age because of the extensive experience and safety testing to this age level.  
 
We are focusing on inflammatory forms of ichthyosis with Th17 skewing in the skin and blood.  Neither 
ichthyosis vulgaris nor recessive X -linked ichthyosis are inflammatory forms of ichthyosis and neither 
has been tested for Th17 skewing; both are easily amenable to available topi[INVESTIGATOR_418208], especially using a systemic agent.  
All screened subjects initially considered for this study will be documented. Study staff will create and 
maintain p re-screening logs and will contact [CONTACT_418233]-approved recruitment 
methods. If the subject is excluded from the study, reasons for exclusion will be documented in the pre-screening log.  
5. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
5.1 Investigational Treatment  
The following study treatment will be used:  
● Ustekinumab (STELARA®)  
5.2 Dispense and Use of Investigational Treatment  
5.2.1 Dispensing the Investigational Treatment 
The r esearch pharmacy at  Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_418209] (STELARA® ) 
from the Company. Ustekinumab will be shipped to a designated, licensed pharmacist at the 
investigational pharmacy at  Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
When delivery of a test medication is received at the investigational site, the Pharmacist, or a member of their staff specifically authorized and delegated by [CONTACT_737], will check for accurate delivery and 
acknowledge receipt by [CONTACT_2960] (or initia ling) and dating the required documentation and returning it as 
instructed. The date, time and condition of the package should also be documented at the time of receipt. 
A copy of this documentation will be retained for the Investigator file. This individual must store the treatment according to instructions specified on the packaging. An accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of these study agents will be kept by [CONTACT_418234]. All unused study 
material will be returned by [CONTACT_418235].  
 
The ustekinumab for this study will be supplied as final vialed product (FVP), single-use 2 mL Schott 
Type I glass vial closed with a Daikyo D777-1 FluroTec®-coated stopper and a West 13 mm aluminum 
seal and plastic light green flip -off button. The FVP formulation is composed of 90 mg/mL ustekinumab 
 
Page 19 of 60  
 with excipi[INVESTIGATOR_269253] 6.7 mM L- histid ine, 7.6% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.004% (w/v) polyso rbate 
80, pH 6.0. There is 1 dose strength (i.e. 45 mg in 0.5 mL volume). No preservatives are present.    
5.2.2 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment  
Throughout the study, treatment will be via subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab, administered by a 
physician or nurse licensed in the state of Illinois. All subjects enrolled in the study will receive ustekinumab at Baseline (Day 0), Month 1, and then every 8 weeks thereafter (Months 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). 
Dosing every 8 weeks is based on a case report of a pediatric patient with autosomal recessive congenital 
ichthyosis (ARCI) who had initial dramatic improvement with ustekinumab injection but subsequent 
worsening of skin symptoms prior to dosing every 12 weeks (Poulton, 2019) . Improvements were 
sustained by [CONTACT_51034] 8 weeks. This patient did not experience any adverse events related to increased dosing frequency. While psoriasis patients treated with ustekinumab generally receive dosing every 12 weeks, patients with inflammatory bowel disease receive ustekinumab every 8 weeks The safety 
profile in clinical trials with dosing every 8 weeks (i.e. those for inflammatory bowel disease) has been 
consistent with the safety profile in clinical trials with dosing every 12 weeks (i.e. those for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis)  (Ghosh, 2019).   
 
 Subjects who have evidence of improvement (per the subject) will have the option to continue in the 
Long-Term Extension portion of the study for an additional 12 months and will receive ustekinumab every 8 weeks (Months 13, 1 5, 17, 19, 21, and 2 3). At each dosing visit, subject weight will be measured 
and the dose of ustekinumab will be adjusted accordingly.  The weight -based dosing used will be  the 
standard  dosing used in clinical trials for pediatric patients receiving ustekinumab for psoriasis (Landells, 
2015; Phillipp 2020). Subjects will receive one of the following dose levels depending on their weight:  
• Weight < 60 kg: 0.75 mg/kg 
• Weight ≥ 60 kg to ≤ 100 kg: 45 mg  
• Weight > 100 kg: [ADDRESS_527763] 6 months  other than bland emollients. After the 6 -month time point, keratolytics, including but 
not limited to agents containing tazarotene, salicylic acid, alpha-hydroxyacids, and urea, can be added to the regimen as per investigator discretion. Subjects  may not be on any systemic agents for the treatment 
of ichthyosis. Subjects  who experience skin infection requiring antibiotics during the study may  continue 
on study drug and stay in the study, unless per investigator discretion. The se therapi[INVESTIGATOR_418210].  
 All concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including prescription medications, over -the- counter medications, vitamins, 
herbal supplements) will be recorded throughout the study.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_527764] Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Subjects will be evaluable if they complete all required assessments and visits through and including 
Month 13. If subjects fail to return for study visits, or become lost to follow up, subjects will be 
considered withdrawn. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designated study staff will attempt to follow up with these 
individuals to discern the reason for their withdrawal. Similarly, if subjects choose to discontinue their 
participation in the study, which  can be done at any time per subject discretion, study staff will attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_418236].  
 
Subjects who do not achieve a 25% reduction in the Ichthyosis Severity Score (ISS) at month 7 (Visit 6) will be withdrawn from the study due to lack of efficacy.  Treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances due to concern for subject safety: 
 
• The investigator believes that for safety reasons (e.g., AE  or SAE ) it is in the best interest of the 
subject to discontinue study treatment;  
• An AE temporally associated with study drug injection, resulting in bronchospasm with wheezing 
and/or dyspnea requiring ventilatory support, or symptomatic hypotension with a greater than 40 
mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure;  
• A severe study drug injection- site reaction;  
• The subject or their legally acceptable representative withdraws consent/assent for administration 
of study drug;  
• Pregnancy, or pregnancy planned within the study period or within [ADDRESS_527765] study 
drug injection;  
• Malignancy;  
• An opportunistic infection;  
• A recurrent or chronic serious infection;  
• The subject is deemed ineligible according to the following TB screening criteria:  
− A diagnosis of active TB is made.  
− A subject has symptoms suggestive of active TB based on history or physical 
examination, or has had recent close contact [CONTACT_4490] a person with active TB.  
− A subject undergoing evaluation has a positive QuantiFERON®- TB Gold test result 
and/or an indeterminate QuantiFERON® -TB Gold test result on repeat.  
 S
ubjects who discontinue study treatment will return at next scheduled visit to undergo an end of study 
visit and then be discontinued from the trial.  
5.[ADDRESS_527766] completed their treatment course as per 
the protocol and the complete data analysis  has been performed.  
 
Upon completion of their study participation, subjects will return to individual treatment, as determined 
by [CONTACT_418237].  
 
Page 21 of 60  
 6. VISIT SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS  
Appendix 1 lists the assessments and indicates with an “X” the visits at which each assessment will be 
performed. Subjects should be seen for all visits on the designated day or as close as possible to the 
original planned visit schedule (recommended visit windows are provided in Appendix 1).   
 
In the event subjects do not present for their study visit, study staff will document their attempts to contact [CONTACT_418238].  
6.1 Sc reening /Baseline Visit  
The Screening and Baseline visit procedures may be combined on the same day if the subject meets all screening eligibility criteria. All patients who have not had genetic testing (research or a CLIA -approved 
lab) will enroll in [CONTACT_418257]’s “Screening for the Genetic Basis of Dermatologic Disease” IRB# [ADDRESS_527767].  Keith  Choate at Yale University. If  the clinical diagnosis is ichthyosis / 
ichthyotic disorder, having a known gene mutation is not required  before entry into the study. The saliva 
sample for genetic testing will be obtained at the screening visit and before drug dosing/Baseline Visit. Urine pregnancy test (female subjects of childbearing potential only) will be completed prior to any baseline study procedures and ustekinumab injection. The saliva sample is part of study #2009-[ZIP_CODE]. 
6.1.1 Consent  
Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_418239] (Visit 1) as indicated in Appendix [ADDRESS_527768] information regarding relevant medical history/current 
medical conditions at every study visit  as indicated in Appendix 1. All collected information will be 
documented. When possible, diagnoses (rather than symptoms) will be recorded. The history regarding the patient’s ichthyosis will also be obtained including date of diagnosis and prior treatments. Medications including current medications and those taken within six months preceding enrollment will be recorded. Attention should also be paid to current treatments for ichthyosis (including bleach baths, any recent topi[INVESTIGATOR_418211] , skin care regimen  and use of any topi[INVESTIGATOR_418212] ).  
6.1.3 Vital Signs and Height/Weight 
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and weight will be collected at Screening, Baseline, and every visit at which there is study drug administration, as indicated in Appendix 
1. Height will be recorded at the first visit, the end of the open label phase, and the end of the long- term 
extension,  as indicated in Appendix 1.  
 
Page 22 of 60  
 6.1.4 Complete Physical Examination & Skin Examination 
A complete physical  examination will be performed by a physician at the screening and baseline visits , as 
well as the end of the open label phase and the end of the long-term extension. A full skin exam will 
occur at Baseline and then at every visit at which there is study drug administration, as indicated in 
Appendix 1. If the history and/or skin examination at interim visits suggests an additional issue, an unscheduled physical examination may be needed. Results will be documented in the Medical History if present before signing the informed consent. If examination shows abnormal findings that meet criteria 
for an AE after the informed consent form has been signed and the subject  has been enrolled with study 
drug initiation, the se findings  will be documented as such in the subject’s file.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_527769] or trained study team member per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59692].  QuantiFERON gold, chemistry 
and hematology testing will also be done at visits for Months 13 and 2 5.  
 
All female study subjects of child -bearing potential (i.e. female subjects who have experienced menarche) 
will be tested for pregnancy at the screening and baseline as indicated in Appendix 1. Urine HCG testing 
will be obtained. Any woman with a confirmed positive pregnancy test during screening is not eligible for 
participation in this study. In addition, female subjects of child-bearing potential will have urine HCG testing prior to every administration of the study drug. 
6.1.6 Severity Evaluations - ISS  and Ichthyosis Severity Self-Assessment  
Physician severity evaluations will be performed at every in-person study visit. Severity assessments will 
be performed by [CONTACT_418240] ( ISS). ISS  is a composite score that captures differences in 
severity in different body regions as a function of their body surface area. As in the EASI score for atopic dermatitis and the PASI score for psor iasis, ISS  evaluates erythema and scaling as a 0 -4+ scale and 
provides pi[INVESTIGATOR_418213]. Sev erity is determined  at each of four locations: head 
and neck (including scalp); arms (including palms); legs (including soles); and trunk, prorated based on body surface area. Separate scores are g iven for face, scalp, neck, groin, palms, soles, elbows and knees 
within their regions to allow for serial assessments of specific body regions that may cause special functional or psychosocial effects.   
6.1.7 TEWL and Tape Strips  
TEWL (transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044])  will be performed on the nondominant upper outer arm  to assess the 
skin barrier  at all in -person study visits. Tape strips will be also be obtained from subjects  at Baseline,  
Month 7, Month 13, Month 19, and Month 25. TEWL will be performed at four different times during 
visits in combination with tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: prior to applying tape strips, after application of the 6th tape 
strip, after application of the 11th tape strip, and after application of the 16th tape strip. TEWL 
measurements at each time will be collected in triplicate. Tape  strips are purchased from CuDerm. Tape 
strippi[INVESTIGATOR_418214] 2x2 or 3x3 cm transparent tape strips at lesio nal skin sites.  Equal pressure will be applied to affected areas for [ADDRESS_527770]’s study ID as well 
as subject visit number and date  of the photo. Photos will be uploaded to a secure, research server 
maintained by [CONTACT_418241]. Photos will be used to track visible skin changes that may occur 
throughout the duration of the study. Photographs may be taken of lesional skin at ad hoc times 
throughout the study if the subject experiences changes in their ichthyosis.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_527771]’s study ID, study visit number, and visit date  and stored at -80oC at Northwestern 
University. Samples will stay at Northwestern University only. Samples will not be shipped to outside individuals or institutions .  
6.1.11  DLQI / CDLQI   and IFTB  
Quality of life measures will be obtained at the baseline, Month 7, Month 13, Month 19, and Mon th 25 
visit as indicated in Appendix 1. The Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ; Appendix 3) is the most 
commonly used and first dermatology -specific quality of life assessment tool (Basra et al 2008) used for 
ages 16 and older. It can be used to assess various dermatologic conditions and has been a reliable measure of quality of life (Finlay 1994). CDLQI  (Appendix 4) is designated for use in children as young 
as four and has been validated (Lewis-Jones and Finlay, 1993). CDLQI will be used for ages 6-15 years. 
The Ichthyosis Financial and Time Burden (IFTB) is an ichthyosis- specific questionnaire with a scale that 
 
Page [ADDRESS_527772] is 17 years or younger.  
6.1.12  STIGMA Questionnaire  
STIGMA Questionnaire  (Appendix 7) is used to assess subjects’ perceived social stigma in regard to their 
condition and will be administered at the Baseline, Month 7, Month 13, Month 19,  and Month 25 visits  
(Appendix 1). All subjects will complete, and a proxy survey will also be collected if the subject is 
between the ages of 6yo -17yo.  
6.1.13  Itch and Pain NRS /PROMIS Itch  
A Numerical Rating Score (NRS) from 0 -10 for both itch and pain will be administered to all subjects at 
every in -person study visit (Appendix 1). Parent proxy will be used for children 6 to 17 years of age. 
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a patient -centered measure 
that evaluates physical, mental and social health in adults and children with regards to impact of their itch. 
PROMIS Itch evaluation (Appendix 6) will be conducted at Month 0, Month 7, Month 13, Month 19, and Month [ADDRESS_527773] scores ≥ 2 on the Itch NRS (Appendix 6). All subjects will complete and a p arent 
proxy will also be collected  for children [ADDRESS_527774] the option to 
continue to the Long- Term Extension with in -person study visits every 8 weeks (Months 15, 17, 19, 21, 
23, and 25). The final in -person study visit will be at Month 25, with the final administration o f study 
drug at Month 2 3 (Appendix 1). 
6.2.[ADDRESS_527775] patient identifiers attached to them (i.e., name, initials, DOB, or S ocial  
Security  number). They will be labeled with a unique patient ID number or code and date of visit. The 
key to the code will be kept at each institution in study files on a secure research server within the 
Department of Dermatology maintained by [CONTACT_78143].   
6.4.3 Transporting specimens 
Specimens needing transport  to outside collaborating laboratories will be done so using a competent 
courier ( e.g. FedEx  or World Courier ). Samples  will be retained in the Paller L ab at Northwestern 
University until shipment. The s hipment will be traceable,  and the chain of custody will be documented. 
The specimens will be delivered to a competent member of the study team  at the collaborating laboratory, 
who will assure that the specimens have been properly de -identif ied and stored/transported in the proper 
environment.  
6.4.4 Specimen management  
Samples will be stored at Northwestern University following the date the analysis is complete and used 
solely for objectives outlined in this study. Patient confidentiality will be maintained. Results of all 
experiments will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_418215]. Regular meetings of the specimen/data analysis team will occur. Regular study monitoring will also occur by [CONTACT_418242]. The samples will be retained until data analysis is complete for this  the 
study. In addition, samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of the subject.  
7. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING AND REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a subject after completing written informed consent to participate in a clinical study. A Es may not be causally or temporally 
associated with the investigational product or procedure. AEs include any occurrence that is new in onset 
or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Lack of drug effect is not considered an AE because 
the purpose of the study is to establish drug effect.  
 
All AE s, SAEs, pregnancies, adverse events of special interest, special reporting situations, and product 
quality complaints (PQCs) will be recorded and reported from the time the subject signs the informed consent form to [ADDRESS_527776] article. Subjects will be instructed to 
report AE s and S erious AEs  (SAEs)  during this time period. The investigators will follow up on all AE s 
 
Page [ADDRESS_527777] subsided, returned to baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until 
the condition stabilizes.   
Aggregated AE s will be evaluated monthly by [CONTACT_978]/research team . Safety data will be reviewed b y the 
investigators, study team , biostatisticians and project manager  unrelated to the study approximately every 
[ADDRESS_527778]'s primary care physician for continuity of care and ongoing subject safety. 
7.3 Serious Adverse Events   
7.3.1. Definition of SAE  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event which:  
● is fatal or life- threatening   
● results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
● constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
● requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
○ routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition  
○ elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
○ treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
○ social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general 
condition 
● is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require 
medical or surgical intervention  
● is suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product 
 
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met.  
 Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of  death at 
the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe or ongoing.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_527779] or might require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_418216] . 
 Death for any reason will be reported as a serious adverse event.  
 All AEs (serious and non- serious) are captured on the case report form ; SAEs also require individual 
reporting to Company as per Section 7.3.2. 
7.3.2. SAE , Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Special  Reporting  Situations  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, adverse events of special interest and special reporting situations occurring after the subject has provided informed consent and until [ADDRESS_527780] be reported as follow -up to the 
original epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], regardless of when the event occurs. An SAE that is considered completely unrelated to 
a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
 
Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow up information) is collected and recorded on the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to study 
treatment, complete the SAE Report Form in Eng lish, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] 
[ADDRESS_527781]’s source documentation at the study 
site. Follow-up information should be provided using a new paper SAE Report Form stating that this is a 
follow-up to a previously reported SAE. 
 Follow-up information provided should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow- up to that 
event regardless of when it occurs.  
 Deaths will be reported to the IRB and Company within [ADDRESS_527782]  
In addition to the us ual expedited reporting of all “ serious” adverse events (per ICH criteria), the 
following AEs of special interest must also be reported to the Company in an expedited fashion, i.e., per 
SAE reporting timelines, even when not serious (AE does not meet any of the ICH serious AE criteria): 
 
• All malignancies  
• All cases of active tuberculosis (TB)  
Special consideration should be given to reporting adverse events that are opportunistic infections and 
clinically significant as serious adverse events based on the “otherwise medically significant” criteria for 
seriousness, when they do not meet other Serious AE ICH criteria (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
7.5. Pregnancy Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring while the subject is on study treatment must be 
reported to the IRB  and Company within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence using the Serious Adverse 
Event Form.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.   
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomaly, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study treatment.  
 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in 
partners of male subjects exposed to a Janssen medicinal product will be reported to the Company within [ADDRESS_527783] that require expediting reporting and/or safety 
evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal) 
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal product 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen 
medicinal product 
• Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without patient exposure 
to the Janssen medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]) 
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via administration of a medicinal product 
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal product  
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_527784] Quality Complaint (PQC)  
A product quality compliant is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect related to a potential quality 
issue during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or 
distribution of the product, or delivery system. Not all PQCs involve a subject. Lot and batch numbers are 
of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to: 
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product 
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules 
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g., autoinjector button not working, needle detaching 
from syringe  
• Suspected Contamination • Suspected Counterfeit 
 
PQC Reporting 
A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of patients, investigators, and the COMPANY, and are mandated by [CONTACT_67819]. The COMPANY 
has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate 
reporting of PQC information. Lot and/or Batch #s shall be collected or any reports failure of expected 
pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect). The product should be quarantined immediately and if 
possible, take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]. 
 
All initial PQCs involving a Janssen medicinal product under study must be reported to the COMPANY by [CONTACT_83409] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_527785] will provide additional information/form to be completed. 
 
If the defect for a Janssen medicinal product under study is combined with either a serious adverse event 
or non- serious adverse event, the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR [INVESTIGATOR_418217]. A sample of the suspected product should be 
maintained for further investigation if requested by [CONTACT_418243]. 
8. DATA REVIEW AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT  
The project m anager at Northwestern will  be responsible for grant applications and yearly reports. Data 
will be entered by [CONTACT_418232] a central REDCap database based at Northwestern. The 
Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit currently manages both international and nati onal multisite REDCap 
databases. The statistician will meet with the project manager  to discuss the progress of the study.  
8.1. Site Monitoring  
The Project Manager at Northwestern will monitor the site. The site will also be monitored internally by 
[CONTACT_1201] . 
 
Page [ADDRESS_527786]’s name [CONTACT_418254] a 
Coded Identifier List (CIL), on a secure research server maintained by [CONTACT_78143] .  
  
Subject medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential and disclosure to third parties other than the principal investigators and the study team is prohibited. Data generated as a result of this study will be available fo r inspection on request by [CONTACT_4707] . Subjects’ 
personal information collected from medical records and paper source documents will be maintained 
within study files that will be kept in a locked room in the Department of Dermatology. Any electronic documents will be saved on a secure research server within the Department of Dermatology and maintained by [CONTACT_78143].  
9. DATA ANALYSIS  
Statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_418228]. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], data will be gathered to analyze efficacy to potentially develop a larger trial in the future.  
9.1. Analysis Sets  
Definition of Trial Analysis Sets : All subjects who provide informed consent and are registered in the trial 
will be accounted for in the clinical trial report.  
 
‘Modified Intention -to-T reat’ Analysis Set : The primary analysis population will be based on a modified 
intention- to-treat (mITT) population, which is defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the  
treatment. Because the loading dose is given at baseline, this should effectively include all enrolled 
patients.  
9.2. Subject Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics of demographics and other baseline characteristics will be presented for all subjects. 
Demographics include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and skin type. Other baseline characteristics include height, weight, and vital signs, concurrent diagnoses (from medical history and indications for concomitant medication), concomitant medications, and previous treatments.  Due to the small subject 
population size, we will not adjust for demographics or baseline c haracteristics during analysis and 
assume that patients will be homogenous in these variables.  
 
Page 31 of 60  
 9.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Primary and secondary endpoints will be anal yzed at the time points specified in S ection 2.0 
(adjusting for baseline scores) using a paired T- test. The percent change from baseline will also 
be calculated. Data will be plotted across time to visually analyze for trends.  
9.4 Safety Variables  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_418244] . The number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE/SAE will be stratified by [CONTACT_29974], or a preferred term, and severity of the adverse event, and recorded and tabulated overall by 
[CONTACT_199231] -strata. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
using the adverse events with the highest severity within each category. All information pertaining to 
adverse events noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim given by [CONTACT_1275], preferred term, system organ class, date of onset, date of resolution, severity, and relationship to treatment. A tabulation o f Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  will be provided by [CONTACT_1130]. The 
specific system organ classes and preferred terms analyzed will be those that are reported by [CONTACT_418245] .

parent/proxy and written assent from subjects 12- 17 years of age  (Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_418218] 12 years of age only) . A copy of the subject’s signed consent /assent  form 
must be retained in the study file . Documentation of consent /assent  process will be placed in source 
document for each study subject.  
10.3. Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB  
A periodic review will be submitted to the IRB at least once per year. The IRB will be notified of 
completion of the study. After study completion or termination, a final report will be provided to 
the IRB to close the study. The investigator will maintain  an accurate and complete record of all 
submissions made to the IRB, including a list of all reports and documents submitted.

 Appendix 2 : Ichthyosis Severity Score ( ISS) 
What is the ichthyosis scoring system (ISS)?  
  
The ISS is a comprehensive and user -friendly instrument for assessing the extent  
and clinical severity  of ichthyosis. It aims to be a validated tool that will be 
adopted by [CONTACT_1622]. We addressed several of the FDA’s concerns and 
specifications through developi[INVESTIGATOR_418219] 8 years of age and patients older than 8 years in order to take into account differences in relative body proportions.  
 
  
Scores will grade: 1) scale severity and 2) erythema .   
 
Scoring overview   
Scoring for scale (0 -4) should be done for the entire region.  It should be an 
average  of affected areas, not the worst score for that region.   
  
Half-points are allowed. 2 limbs=one body region.  
  
Erythema score (0- 4) for a particular region should be the worst  score for that 
region because erythema can be obscured by [CONTACT_99722].   
  
Body regions scored for each patient:   
 
Each region will be scored separately  
 
 
 
   
Anatomical d
 efinitions of body parts:   
  1. Head and neck:  Scalp, face, neck  
2. Trunk: Groin and chest/abdomen/back   
3. Upper extremities:  Elbow and palms   
4. Lower Extremities: Knees and soles   
 
   
 Head and neck   
• Head   
o Face: extends from the forehead to the chin and includes the mouth, nose, cheeks, 
eyes, and ears. It excludes the neck. (1/3)  
o Scalp: extends from the junction of forehead skin to the occiput (back of head). It 
excludes the face. (1/3)  
• Neck: extends from the mandible to the attachment of the sternocleidomastoid at the 
clavicle. It also includes the back of the neck, which extends from the C1 vertebrae to the 
trapezius muscle. (1/3)  
  
Torso  – I ncludes back, chest, abdomen, and groin  
• Chest, abdomen, groin: extends from one anterior axillary fold to the other and from the 
clavicles to the anterior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]   
• Back :  extends laterally from one posterior axillary fold to the other and from T1-S1.  It 
excludes posterior arms and neck.  
  
Upper extremities : e xtends from the acromial process to the fingers and includes the anterior 
axillary fold and antecubital fossa.  (It excludes the elbow and any portion of the trunk that may be visible.)  
  
Lower extremities : e
 xtends from the superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_418220].  
  
Elbows and knees   
• Elbows: Includes attachment of the humerus to the proximal radius and ulna. It excludes 
antecubital fossa.   
• Knees:  I ncludes attachment of the femur to the tibia and patella. It excludes the popliteal 
fossa.   
  
Palms:  e xtends from the tip of the phalanges to the carpal bones (wrist joint) and includes the 
area between the five phalanges. It includes glabrous skin.  
  
Soles:  e xtends from the tip of the toes to the calcaneus (heel). It includes glabrous skin.  By 
[CONTACT_22242], because erythema can be obscured by [CONTACT_99722], the erythema score for a particular 
region should be the worst score for that region.

or herniated nucleus pulposus  affecting  either 1 to 3  
contiguous levels between C2 and C7 (for cervical 
patients) or L 1 and S1 (for lumbar patients) . 
Purpose : The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and 
radiographic outcomes in patients who undergo 1-3 level 
anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) or lumbar 
interbody fusion (TLIF, PLIF, ALIF, LLIF)  using ViBone. 
Subjects  will be followed for 12 months following surgery 
to determine the number of study subjects that are solidly 
fused at or before 12 months postoperatively.  
The data for cervical and lumbar fusions will be analyzed 
separately and will be compared to published and/or 
retrospective data for autograft or other similar graft 
materials .  
Design:  Up to 50 patients undergoing ACDF using ViBone will be 
enrolled.   
Up to  50 patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion  
using ViBone will also be enrolled.  
Subjects  will be followed via the enrolling center’s 
standard of care  for the procedure.    
Data from patients meeting the study criteria will be gathered at baseline, [ADDRESS_1136828]-

3 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_820162] a multitude of clinical problems including pain, 
weakness, numbness, tingling and deformity. When conservative (non- surgical) treatment fails 
after at least a 6- month  period and/or non -operative treatment is not indicated, patients and 
physicians may turn to a surgical solution. Surgical options consist of decompressing nerves, 
correcting and/or stabilizing deformities if required and fusing the segment, depending on the 
clinical sit uation. The "gold standard" for aiding healing in spi[INVESTIGATOR_820163]'s iliac crest and placing it in and around the segments of 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_820164]. Autograft is considered the "gold standard" because it 
contains the essential elements required for successful bone grafting: osteogenesis, 
osteoconduction, and osteoinduction.  
However, the morbidity of harvesting autograft has been well documented and includes chronic donor -site pain, inf ection, neurologic injury, blood loss, deformity, bowel injury, hernia, and 
prolonged surgical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106131]. There are now a number of products on the market 
to minimize or replace the use of autograft. However, few of these products contain all three 
essential bone- forming elements (osteogenesis, osteoconduction, and osteoinduction) .

transplant in procedures on a si ngle occasion by a licensed physician or surgeon.  
3.3 Description of ViBone 
ViBone provides all three components  critical for bone regeneration: osteoconductivity,  
osteoinductivity, and osteogenicity. It is a next generation cellular bone matrix that has been 
optimized to preserve the health of native bone cells and yield more readily av ailable bioactive 
agents to enhance new bone formation while ensuring a safe allograft tissue for transplantation. 
 ViBone  is supplied ready to use and must be stored in its original  packaging at - 75°C to - 85°C 
until prepared for use.  It is the responsibility of the transplant facility or clinician to maintain the 
allograft intended for transplantation in the appropriate recommended storage conditions prior to 
transplant.  Refer to the package insert (Appendix 4) for warnings and precautions and usage 
instru ctions.

Revision 4   Effective Date: 04/15/[ADDRESS_1136840] package insert will be used to explain the study and fully disclose known 
risks and benefits. Subjects  will not directly benefit from being in this study ; however, the 
results of this study may help people undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_820165].  As with 
implantation of all human allograft tissue, risks associated with the implantation of ViBone 
include lack of  response from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (e.g. , lack of fusion  or non- union with adjacent 
tissue). It is also possible for a host site to  beco me infected or the allograft tissue may cause 
an inflammatory  response. Current technologies may not preclude the transmission of 
infectious agents or disease, including hepatitis and HIV. ViBone is preserved in 5% dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 0.9%  sodium chloride solution. Povidone iodine, Dulbecco’s phosphate  
buffered saline, sodium chloride irrigation solution, sodium phosphate, hydrochloric acid and 
hydrogen peroxide are all used for  processing, preservation and storage of the allografts and 
trace amounts of these solutions may be present in the product.  
There are no additional medical risks involved in participating in this study. The only additional 
risk from taking part in this study is that the confidentiality of subject  information may be los t or 
compromised.  
The ICF must include the elements required by [CONTACT_763726] 21 CFR 50 and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines . 
Patients will also be required to consent to the use of their PHI according to all applicable health information privacy regulations. This authorization can be part of the ICF or can be a 
separate document.  
Each Investigator participating in the study is responsible for obtaining approval from Aziyo  for 
any consent documents prior to their submission to thei r IRB and prior to their use. Each 
Investigator participating in the study is also responsible for ensuring that a written ICF and 
written authorization for use of PHI are obtained from each patient that they enroll into the 
study at the time of that patient’s enrollment.  Documentation of the informed consent process 
must be completed by [CONTACT_820179] a copy of the signed ICF. No study -related activities may be performed on any patient and no data may be

 11 SAFETY  
11.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Reactions  
Adverse Reactions  involving a communicable disease and are deemed  related to use of ViBone , 
will be reported  to FDA’s MedWatch  program  and details of the event shall be documented on the 
applicable Serious Adverse Reaction form.2  Per FDA 21 CFR 1271.3 (y), an adverse reaction is  
defined as a noxious  and unintended response  to any HCT/P for which  there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the HCT/P caused the response . 
Per FDA [ADDRESS_1136852]/P (ViBone) must be investigated and reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days of initial 
receipt of the information.  Adverse reactions are further defined to include the following:  
A communicable disease that:  
1. Is fatal  (report if you suspect the death was an outcome of the adverse event);  
2. Is life threatening  (subject at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event, or use 
or continued use of the device or other medical product might have resulted in the death of the subject;  
3. Results in permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body 
structure ( Report  if the adverse event  resulted in a substantial  disruption  of a person's ability  
to conduct  normal  life functions , i.e., the adverse  event  resulted  in a significant , persistent  or 
permanent  change , impairment , damage or disruption in the subject 's body  function/ structure , 
physical  activities  and/or quality  of life); or 
4. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (report if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_820167]. Emergency department visits that do not 
result in admission should be evaluated for one of the other outcomes).  
If an adverse reaction involving a communicable disease that is believed to be related to the use of ViBone occurs, a Serious Adverse Reaction form shall be completed. In addition to 
completing the form, Aziyo must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware 
of the event. All fields are required in order to provide Aziyo personnel with the required 
information to evaluate the reaction and complete the required MedWatch report for submission 
to FDA  per the Sponsor’s Medical Device Reporting SOP.  
 
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
As this study is designed to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients who undergo

During  your spi[INVESTIGATOR_820175], your doctor  will use ViBone , a human  tissue allograft  that 
is intended to support  bone repair . ViBone  is used in fusion  surgery  to stop motion  between  
two or more  vertebral  bodies . ViBone  and other  bone allografts  may stimulate  new bone 
formation  and may provide a foundation or scaffold  on which  your body  can grow  new bone.   
ViBone  is a human tissue  allograft  consisting  of viable  bone matrix  that is processed in a way 
that preserves  native  factors  that support  bone  repair . ViBone  is regulated by [CONTACT_820191] a Human Cellular  and Tissue Based Product  (HCT/P) per [ADDRESS_1136859] and how many  people  will be in the study ?   
Your  involvement  in this study  will last for approximately  twelve  months . You will have at least  
two routine follow -up evaluations , one at 6 months and another at 12 months  after your 
surgical procedure. Up to 20 U.S. clinical sites will be participating  in the study  and 
approximately  200 patients  are expected to be enrolled.

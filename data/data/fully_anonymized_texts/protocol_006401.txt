IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018   General Information  
 
This protocol describes a clinical trial comparing damage control laparotomy (DCL) to 
definitive laparotomy (DEF) in trauma patients undergoing emergent laparotomy. DCL was 
described in the 1980s and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_880947] a liberalization in the indications for use. In a DCL, the life -threatening 
injuries are addressed – bleeding is stopped, enteric spi[INVESTIGATOR_880948] – and the abdomen is 
left open with a temporary dressing. The patie nt is then transported to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) for resuscitation (with the abdomen still open). Once adequately resuscitated, the patient 
returns to the operating room (OR) for re -exploration of the abdomen, definitive repairs of 
injuries, and clo sure of the abdomen. A major hurdle to performing a clinical trial of DCL is 
surgeon equipoise. There are indications for DCL for which surgeons would not have the clinical 
equipoise to randomize a patient. Significant preliminary data has identified a gro up of patients 
for which there is equipoise to randomize. This proposed trial aims to compare outcomes of 
patients undergoing DCL versus DEF for which there is surgeon equipoise to randomize.  
 
Background Information  
 
Injury is the leading cause of death in  Americans aged 1 -45 years and 20 -40% of all 
trauma related deaths are due to truncal hemorrhage.1,[ADDRESS_1231352] 
common treatment for patients with life -threatening truncal hemorrhage and intra -abdominal 
injury, yet very little high -quality data exists to guide clinical decision -making during the 
procedure. In particular, there is controversy regarding the indications for DCL.  
A DCL is an abbreviated laparotomy in which hemorrhage is stopped, ongoing 
gastrointestinal contamination is con trolled, the abdomen is left open, and the patient is taken to 
the ICU for resuscitation. Once the patient’s body temperature has been normalized, 
hemodynamic status improved, and any coagulopathy corrected, the patient returns to the OR for 
definitive rep air of injured structures and closure of the abdomen. This is in contrast to a 
definitive laparotomy (DEF), in which all portions of the operation are completed and the 
abdomen is closed at the initial surgery.  
DCL was developed and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_880949] 1990s due to the high rate of mortality in 
massively transfused patients undergoing laparotomy for hemorrhage. The initial studies 
comparing DCL to DEF were retrospective, small in number, and suffered significa nt selection 
bias.3,4 The seminal paper by [CONTACT_880963], in which the term ‘damage control laparotomy’ was 
coined, focused on a cohort of patients with penetrating trauma who received a massive 
transfusion (>10 units red blood cells prior to end of primar y laparotomy). When including all 
patients, no mortality difference was seen between DEF (n=22, mortality 45%) and DCL (n=24, 
mortality 42%). It was only in a subgroup analysis of the “maximum injury subset” (arbitrarily 
defined as one or more major vascul ar injuries and two or more visceral injuries), that a 
significant mortality benefit between DEF (n=9, mortality 89%) and DCL (n=13, mortality 23%) 
was seen.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_880950], retrospective, and with very narrow 
inclusion c riteria, it provided actionable evidence that in select, severely injured patients, DCL 
improved outcomes. Because of this improvement in outcomes, the utilization of DCL rapi[INVESTIGATOR_880951] a wide variety of operative trauma settings, with rates approac hing 36% in

IRB NUMBER: HSC -GEN -16-0104  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018   experienced, Level 1 trauma centers.5,6,7 With more patients undergoing DCL, the associated 
risks and benefits became better understood.8 Potential benefits include decreased mortality and 
avoidance of hypothermia, acidosis, and c oagulopathy (the “lethal triad” in trauma surgery).  
Risks include high rates of incisional hernia, all forms of surgical site infections (SSI), 
enterocutaneous fistulas, pneumonia, sepsis, and organ failure.9,10,11,[ADDRESS_1231353] the clinical equipoise to randomize patients. That is, no 
surgeon would randomize a patient wi th a severe liver injury in which the only method of 
hemorrhage control was gauze packing of the liver – an act which necessitates leaving the 
abdomen open as the gauze must be removed once bleeding has stopped. If a patient develops 
such significant bowel  edema from resuscitation, the surgeon may not be able to physically close 
the incision or may do so with such tension that abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) 
results.  
Given this common operation (at our institution 1 trauma laparotomy is performed every  
36 hours), high rate of mortality (26% in all DCLs), high rate of morbidity, and a lack of quality 
evidence,  RCTs  to compare  DEF  and DCL  among  patients  undergoing  emergent  laparotomy  for 
trauma are  needed.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
 
Retrospective cohort study evaluating morbidity following DCL5 
 
In 2015, I presented a retrospective cohort study at the Southwestern Surgical Congress 
(currently in production by [CONTACT_880964]) which quantified the average 
treatment effect of DCL compared to DEF. In this study of bleeding patients un dergoing 
emergent laparotomy, DCL was associated with an 11% increase in enteric suture line failure, an 
11% increase in fascial dehiscence, and a 19% increase in surgical site infection compared to 
DEF. While the statistical model used in this project was  unique and the results interesting, the 
project was retrospective and suffered the same biases as the initial trials promoting the use of 
DCL.  
 
Prospective Quality Improvement (QI) Project  
 
In November 2013, I began a single -center QI project in which all emergent laparotomies 
were prospectively followed and outcomes recorded. Surgeons performing a DCL filled out a 
notecard in which they wrote the indication for DCL and perioperative data. Af ter one year of 
following emergent laparotomies, we began discussing the appropriateness of all laparotomies at 
faculty meetings. The aims of the QI project were: 1) to safely decrease the rate of DCL, 2) to  
6 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -GEN -16-0104  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018   identify indications for DCL in wh ich there was surgeon equipoise, and 3) to examine surgeon 
variability in the performance of DCL.  
In Table 1, the list of indications for all DCLs during the time period is detailed. The list 
and percentage of all DCLs deemed potentially unnecessary is als o listed. During the QI project, 
the necessary indications for DCL in which there was widespread agreement and no equipoise to 
potentially randomized patients include the following: non -absorbable gauze packing for 
hemorrhage control (only 7% potentially u nnecessary DCLs), hemodynamic instability defined 
as continuous vasopressor use or ongoing transfusions (0% potentially unnecessary DCLs), to 
expedite time to IR for hemorrhage control (0% potentially unnecessary DCLs), and ACS 
prophylaxis (0% potentially unnecessary DCLs).  
Beyond these four indications, significant surgeon variation in decision -making exists, 
indicating equipoise amongst the group. Surgeon equipoise exists for the following indications 
for DCL: second look (73% potentially unnecessary DCLs ), hemodynamic instability with a 
definition other than continuous vasopressor use or ongoing transfusion (33% potentially 
unnecessary DCLs), to expedite transfer to CT or the ICU (100% potentially unnecessary DCLs), 
and to plan an additional wash out of t he abdomen due to contamination (100% potentially 
unnecessary DCLs).

This variation in the utilization of DCL for specific indications was accompanied by a 
significant variation in surgeon -specific rates of DCL (Figure 1), which varied from 14 -44% and 
could not be accounted for by [CONTACT_880965].

We hypothesize that, among randomized patients, DCL results in increased mortality or 
major abdominal complications (MAC), defined as an organ/space SSI, enteric suture line 
failure, fascial dehiscence, or unplanned return to OR after fascial closure for a n abdominal 
complication, within [ADDRESS_1231355] are:  
 
Aim 1: To perform a single -center, randomized, controlled trial to compare  the 
effect of DCL to DEF on death or MACs within 30 days, additional 
clinical outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, and lengths of  stay. 
Aim 2: To compare resource utilization of DEF and DCL, comparing the direct 
costs of DCL and the direct costs of th e complications associated with 
DCL and  DEF.  
Aim 3: To measure long -term, patient -centered outcomes of the study patients, 
including health status data, incidence of post -traumatic stress disorder, 
and return to work.  
Aim 4: To assess feasibility and provi de estimates of effect size of  individual 
outcomes for the planning and execute a multicenter, RCT of DCL 
compared to  DEF.  
 
Primary outcome: death or MAC – a binary, composite variable defined as the 
development of an organ/space SSI, enteric suture line f ailure (aka anastomotic leak), fascial 
dehiscence, or an unplanned return to the OR for an abdominal complication – within 30 days.  
Secondary outcomes:

Setting  
This study will be conducted at the [LOCATION_007] Trauma Institute at Memorial Hermann  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -[LOCATION_007] Medical Center (MHH -TMC). It is one of two Level [ADDRESS_1231357] 
trauma center in the country, with over 6,000 trauma admissions per year. Approximately 220 
emergent trauma laparotomies are performed each year, of which 25 -35% are DCLs.  
 
Time Period  
IRB submission will occur in January 2016, with community consultation beginning 
shortly thereafter. Eligible patients will be enrolled starting on July 7, 2016. Enrolled subjects 
will be followed during their post -laparotomy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880952] 6 months following their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880953] -centered outcomes.  
 
 
Outcomes  
The primary outcome for this study will be a composite variable composed of the 
following death or major abdominal complications (MAC) within 30 days:  
 Deep or organ/space SSI, as defined by [CONTACT_880967]14 
9 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -GEN -16-0104  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018    Enteric suture  line failure  (enteric  anastomotic  leak)  – leakage  of enteric  contents  from 
gastrointestinal  anastomosis  
 Fascial dehiscence or evisceration – separation of closed fascia with or without protrusion 
of intestines (to be determined by [CONTACT_6222], blinded  surgeon)  
 Unplanned return to OR after fascial closure for intra -abdominal  complication  
We hypothesize that p atients randomized to DCL will have a higher rate of the primary 
outcome than those randomized to DEF.  
Secondary outcomes will include non -abdominal morbidities, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880954] (as patient is being discharged in order to die with comfort, this will be 
considered the same as an in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -/ICU -/ventilator -free days, total 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880955], and patient -centered outcomes.  
Non-abdominal complications will be identified based on standardized definitions used in 
the National Trauma Databank and include: acute kidney failure, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, pneumonia , and 
urinary tract infection.  
Per-patient cost information will be obtained from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880956].  
For patient -centered outcomes, the patients’ health state will be queried at discharge and 
[ADDRESS_1231358] Gamble and EuroQol -5D(5L).15,[ADDRESS_1231359] -Civilian [PCL -C] will also be administered 6 months after discharge. 
Additionally, time to return to work will also be obtained at the 6 month  interview.  
Overall safety data (compared to historical controls) will be assessed every [ADDRESS_1231360] (DSMB), which will be 
organized by [CONTACT_880968]. Curtis Wray. The DSMB will also in clude an 
anesthesiologist, another independent surgeon, a former trauma patient without a medical 
background who underwent emergent laparotomy, and an independent statistician.  
 
 
Study Population  
 
Screening  
Clinical research staff will be available on a 24 /[ADDRESS_1231361] patient observation and data collection will 
begin immediately upon the patient’s arrival to the ED and will continue until 1) it is determined 
that patient  does not meet all inclusion criteria, 2) the surgical procedure has been completed, or  
3) the patient  dies. 
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All patients presenting with trauma requiring emergent laparotomy will be screened for 
eligibility for the study. Emerge nt laparotomy is defined as: (1) time in ED ≤90 minutes and (2) 
admission to the OR directly from the ED or IR or prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_392092] (by[CONTACT_880969]). Patients meeting all inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 
study.

 Currently enrolled in another interventional  study  
 
Subjects sixteen years of age and older are considered as adult trauma subjects in a large 
percent of the trauma centers. Sixteen and seventeen year olds are able to drive in most states and 
are at high risk for motor vehicle accidents resulting in blunt o r penetrating injuries. Excluding 
this age group would significantly decrease the external validity of the proposed project.  
Additionally, it is difficult to differentiate a 16 or 17 year old from one who is 21 or older 
at the time care is initiated in the  ED until positive identification can be obtained. Children below 
the age of 15 or 50 kg body weight will be excluded from this trial. Children‘s intravascular 
volume is different than the adult‘s, requiring adjustments to the standard adult treatment 
protocols.  
 
Study Procedures  
Randomization  
Allocation will occur through sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes kept in the 
research assistants’ office and opened in the operating room. An independent statistician will 
determine the randomization sequence and  oversee the labeling of cards and envelopes. A 1:1 
allocation ratio using a permuted block design of 4 or 6 will be used to ensure equal number of 
patients in each group.  
Randomization will occur during the emergent trauma laparotomy. The research assista nt 
will query the attending trauma surgeon periodically throughout the procedure to determine their  Randomize  Surgeon has equipoise

randomized to DCL (control) or DEF (intervent ion). The research staff will open the opaque 
envelope to notify the attending surgeon which group to which the subject has been randomized.  
 
Data Collection  
All data will be collected by [CONTACT_880970] a standardized case report form 
and entered into a RedCap™ database. Each subject will be assigned a study -specific number. 
Data will be collected from the clinical pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880957], in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and the trauma registry. Data will be collected until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880958] 6 months later.  
Data collected will include: demographics, prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_880959], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880960], OR and post -operative care, discharge information,  follow up clinic 
visits, healthcare cost assessments, and the health status questionnaires completed at discharge 
and [ADDRESS_1231362] clinical practice will be 
collected. No study -specific laboratory tests will be ordered. No biologic specimens will be kept 
or used.  
 
Follow up  
No study -specific follow -up will be required. Six -month questionnaires will be 
performed by [CONTACT_25600]. $[ADDRESS_1231363] 
(DSMB), which will be organized by [CONTACT_880968]. Curtis Wray. The DSMB will 
also include an anesthesiologist, a former trauma patient without a medical background who 
underwent emergent laparotomy, and an independent  statistician. At the first meeting following 
50% recruitment, a formal Bayesian analysis will be presented to the DSMB to assess the 
probability of benefit or harm of DCL.  
One potential problem area is surgeon adherence to randomization. While the Divisio n of 
Acute Care Surgery has an excellent record of trauma surgeon buy in for randomized, controlled 
trials (Early Whole Blood trial, PROPPR, Irricept®), it remains a concern that surgeons will 
choose not to enroll potentially eligible patients or fail to i mplement the randomized treatment. 
To help mitigate surgeon deviation, preliminary work showing indications for which there is 
equipoise among practicing surgeons has been performed. Additionally, all emergent 
laparotomies will be evaluated the following d ay to assess eligibility. If not randomized, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_880961] -time surgeon feedback to improve future compliance. Protocol deviations of 
randomized patients will be documented and reported in publications. Patients will be analyzed 
on an intent -to-treat basis, so randomized patients will be statistically analyzed in the group to 
which they were randomized.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018   Statistics  
Sample  Size 
Over a 2 year period, we aim to enroll 56 
patients, 28 in each arm based upon: 1) preliminary 
data with a MAC rate of 55% in DCL patients and 18% 
in the DEF patients, 2) alpha=0.05, 3) power=0.80,  and 
4) dropout rate=10%.  
Approximately 55 -66 DCLs are performed per  
year, therefore over 2 years of patient enrollment, enrolling 56 patients meeting eligibility is 
realistic.  
 
Randomization  
Allocation will occur through sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes kept in the 
research assistants’ office and opened in the operating room. An independent statistician will 
determine the randomization sequence and oversee the labeling of cards and enve lopes. A 1:1 
allocation ratio using a permuted block design of 4 or 6 will be used to ensure equal number of 
patients in each group.  
Randomization will occur during the emergent trauma laparotomy. The research assistant 
will query the attending trauma surg eon periodically throughout the procedure to determine their 
equipoise between DCL and DEF. If the patient meets all eligibility criteria, that patient will be 
randomized to DCL (control) or DEF (intervention). The research staff will open the opaque 
envel ope to notify the attending surgeon which group to which the subject has been randomized.  
 
Data Analysis Plan  
The number of screened patients and reasons for exclusion will be reported. Protocol 
violations and reasons for those violations will be reported and detailed. Differences in primary 
and secondary outcomes across treatment groups will be compared on an intent -to-treat basis 
using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test, Pearson’s Chi -squared, and Fisher’s Exact test, for 
continuous, binary, and sparse binary out comes, respectively. Exploratory analyses will model 
outcomes via linear or logistic regression with treatment as the predictor, controlling for any 
covariates found to be imbalanced across treatment assignment. An independent statistician will 
provide all  data analyses and present them to the DSMB for review.  
Given the small sample size of the trial, we will augment the frequentist model described 
above with a Bayesian analysis to estimate the probability of treatment effects of DCL and 
DEF.17

Quality Control and Assurance  
Each item on the web forms will have validity checks performed to ensure that the data 
entered are accurate and that items are not skipped during entry by [CONTACT_86966]. Chec ks will be 
developed by [CONTACT_567088]. Depending on the question, any 
item found that does not meet the respective edit criteria will have an appropriate error message 
displayed when the user tries to save the data. Er rors will be classified as either “hard” errors 
meaning that a valid response is required before the data can be saved or as “soft” errors in which the 
entry operator can either correct the errors or override them to indicate that the data are correct 
although it does not meet the edit criteria. Examples of hard errors would be items such as identifiers 
and event dates. An example of a soft error would be values that are outside a pre -defined range.  
When the data record is saved, a form status field will be  updated to indicate the current status of the 
form. There are currently four status states that the form can have. These statuses are: the form is 
incomplete, the form is complete, the form was saved with errors, and the form is complete with 
errors. For the first status, the entry user will have the option to save a record as ―incomplete‖ for

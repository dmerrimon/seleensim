31.0 Background
1.1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are a disease of the 
aging
Approximately 20,000 and 10,000 people are diagnosed with AML and MDS each year. Over 
60% of AML and MDS cases are diagnosed in adults aged ≥60 years.1,2 For fit older patients 
with AML (i.e., without significant comorbidities or disabilities), the standard first-line treatment 
consists of intensive inpatient chemotherapy. Intensive chemotherapy provides the best chance 
for durable remission, but it is associated with a high treatment-related mortality (60-day 
mortality: 15-20%).3,4 Intensive therapy is utilized in <1% of older patients with AML seen in 
the community oncology setting due to the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].[ADDRESS_1234064] of observation, growth factors, transfusion, or 
chemotherapy in the outpatient setting. AML and MDS are generally incurable except with the 
use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for which many older adults are not candidates 
due to advanced age and comorbidities. In older patients with AML or high-risk MDS, outcomes 
are poor, with median overall survivals ranging from 6-12 months. 
1.2. Patients with hematologic malignancies receive more aggressive care at the end-of-life 
(EOL) compared to those with solid tumors. 
Previous studies have established quality indicators to guide optimal care at the end of life 
(EOL).12,13 These quality indicators include healthcare utilization [emergency department (ED) 
visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, life-sustaining treatments (LSTs), 
chemotherapy administration, and receipt of transfusion] at EOL, completion of Medical or 
Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST/POLST) forms, utilization of palliative 
care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249], and place of death. Compared to patients with solid tumors, patients 
with hematologic malignancies (including AML and MDS) are more likely to visit the ED, be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], be admitted to ICU, and to receive LSTs, transfusions, and chemotherapy at the 
EOL.14-[ADDRESS_1234065]/POLST forms in a timely fashion, 
less likely to receive palliative care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249], and more likely to die in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].14,16 Therefore, interventions are needed to improve EOL care for patients with 
hematologic malignancies.
1.3. Advance care planning (ACP) may improve EOL care for older patients with AML and 
MDS
Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults in understanding and sharing their 
personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding medical care. These decisions can then be 
recorded in MOLST/POLST forms to guide surrogate decisions makers if the patient loses 
decision-making capacity. Our preliminary data suggest that among adults aged ≥70 years with 
AML and MDS seen at the Wilmot Cancer Institute (WCI) and its affiliated community centers, 
most MOLST forms were completed late in the disease course; median times from MOLST 
completion to death were 18 days and 75 days, respectively, for AML and MDS. Approximately 
442% completed MOLST >[ADDRESS_1234066] 
[ADDRESS_1234067] >[ADDRESS_1234068]/POLST completion can therefore be expected to improve 
EOL care.
1.4. Evidence-based interventions can improve access to ACP but they are not tailored to older 
adults with AML and MDS.
The Serious Illness Care Program is an evidence-based intervention to enhance EOL 
conversations between physicians and patients with advanced cancer.[ADDRESS_1234069] 
ACP conversations. In a phase III randomized trial, compared to the control arm, more patients 
and physicians in the intervention arm had serious illness conversations (96% vs. 79%) and these 
conversations occurred 2.4 months earlier and were more comprehensive and patient-centered.17 
However, <10% of patients had hematologic malignancies.
1.5. Telehealth may improve access to ACP.
Telehealth refers to the practice of caring for patients remotely when the provider and patient are 
not physically present with each other. Telehealth allows for improved patient access, but its 
adoption has been slow due to barriers such as lack of insurance coverage and patient/provider 
unfamiliarity.[ADDRESS_1234070] been 
implemented, including insurance reimbursement and education/support to assist older adults 
and providers. Therefore, telehealth provides an attractive modality improve access to ACP 
among older adults with AML and MDS.
1.6. Overall goal
The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve ACP access, patient-reported outcomes, and 
EOL care in older patients with AML and MDS via a telehealth-delivered ACP intervention. The 
objective of this one-year project is to adapt and assess the feasibility and usability of a 
telehealth-delivered ACP intervention for older patients with AML and MDS. The optimization 
of the ACP intervention will be guided by [CONTACT_882341] 
(CeHRes) Roadmap that emphasizes structural stakeholder involvement.
52.0 Aim and Hypothesis
2.1. Primary Aim
To incorporate telehealth into an evidence-based ACP intervention that is adapted for older 
patients suffering from AML and MDS utilizing qualitative interviews with patients, their 
caregivers, and oncology and palliative care providers
Findings from Aim 1 will be used to inform Aim 2. Aim 2 will be done following completion of 
Aim 1.
2.2. Secondary Aim
To assess the feasibility and usability of the adapted telehealth-delivered ACP intervention in a 
single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 20 older patients with AML and MDS.
2.3. Hypothesis
The telehealth ACP intervention will be feasible and usable. 
2.3.1 Feasibility and usability metrics
The usability and feasibility of the adapted telehealth-delivered ACP intervention will be 
evaluated based on the following: 
a)Retention rate (percentage of patients who consented and completed the visit)
b)Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (total average of >5 will be considered usable)
63.0. Study Design and Population
3.1. Study Settings 
Wilmot Cancer Institute (WCI), University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center (URMC) and its 
affiliated centers.
3.2. Study Type
Aim 1: Qualitative study (phase 1)
Aim 2: Single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (phase 2)
3.3. Study Population
Aim 1: We will gather feedback from older patients with AML/MDS (N=5-10), caregivers 
(N=up to 2 caregivers per patient and therefore up to a total of 20 caregivers), oncology 
physicians (N=5-10), oncology APP and nurses (N=5-10), palliative care physicians (N=5-10), 
as well as palliative care APP and nurses (N=5-10). Therefore, the total number of participants 
will be between [ADDRESS_1234071] similar research.19,20 For patients, we will consent up to 15 patients to 
account for screen fail or withdrawal. 
Results from Aim 1 will be used to adapt the telehealth intervention for use in Aim 2. In other 
words, Aim 2 will occur after Aim 1 has been completed.
Aim 2: We will recruit 20 patients, their caregivers (up to 2 caregivers per patient), and oncology 
providers. We will consent up to 30 patients to account for screen fail or withdrawal.

≥60 years with AML/MDS in the past year. 
Exclusion criteria
None
3.8. Number of Subjects
Aim 1: We plan to enroll the following groups: older patients with AML/MDS (N=5-10), 
caregivers N=(up to 20), oncology (N=5-10) and palliative care physicians (N=5-10) as well as 
8oncology (N=5-10) and palliative care APPs and nurses (5-10). In prior qualitative studies of 
older patients, caregivers, and oncologists, we were able to successfully enroll similar numbers 
of participants in 3-6 months.20,21 In addition to enrolling at WCI, we will also be recruiting 
patients and oncologists from WCI-affiliated community practices (e.g., Interlakes Oncology, 
Dansville, Pluta, Olean, Wellsville), to obtain feedback from community oncology settings. 
Aim 2: We plan to enroll 20 patients total and their caregivers (up to 2 caregivers per patient if 
available) in 9 months. From 2012-2019, 4-7 oncologists saw >100 patients with AML or MDS 
aged ≥60 annually at WCI and its affiliated centers. In prior studies of similar populations, the 
recruitment rate was 65-75%.20,22 Therefore, recruiting 20 patients and their caregivers over 9 
months is feasible.
3.9. Gender of Subjects
The gender ratio of enrolled patients will be similar to that of the gender ratio of AML in older 
adults (approximately 1.2:1 to 1.5:1 male to female ratio).23,24
3.10. Age of Subjects
We will recruit patients with AML and MDS aged 60 and above (from date of consent, 
confirmed on electronic medical record). 
3.11. Racial and Ethnic Origin
The Caucasian to Non-Caucasian ratio of individuals with AML is 5:1. In [COMPANY_002]ster, [LOCATION_001], 
Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics make up approximately 65%, 30%, and 5% of the 
population (Race and Ethnicity in [COMPANY_002]ster, NY statistical atlas). We expect these to be similar 
in MDS although data were not available. As enrollment is limited to English-speaking patients, 
we predict a higher percentage of whites. The study does not restrict enrollment based on race or 
ethnicity. 
3.12. Vulnerable Subjects
Recruitment will exclude vulnerable populations such as fetuses, neonates, children, pregnant 
woman, prisoners, and institutionalized individuals. We will also exclude adults who are deemed 
to not have decisional capacity and those who lost their consent capacity during the study period, 
as per their treating oncologist.
94.0. Recruitment and Consent
Subjects will be enrolled at the URMC WCI, as well as WCI-affiliated sites, including Interlakes 
Oncology, Dansville, Pluta, Olean, and Wellsville. 
To ensure appropriate safety precautions when conducting in-person study procedures, the 
process for conducting in-person visits outlined in the Guidance for Human Subject Research 
will be followed.
4.[ADDRESS_1234072] the physician (or designee) and inform them of patient eligibility and ask 
permission to approach the patient.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_882335].  
For in-person consent with patients, below are the possible scenarios for obtaining consent.
1) Physician/Study Investigator makes the initial contact [CONTACT_24203], and 
patient signs consent with the physician on the same day: After confirming with the 
physician (or their designee) that a patient is a potential candidate for the study, the study 
staff will provide a consent form to the treating physician/study investigator so he/she can 
provide it to the patient during an in-person clinic visit. The physician/study investigator 
will go over every detail of the study during the clinic visit with patient. If agrees, the 
patient will sign the consent form with the physician/study investigator during the same 
in-person visit.
2) Study staff makes the initial contact [CONTACT_24203], and patient signs consent 
with the study staff on the same day: After confirming with the physician (or their 
designee) that a patient is a potential candidate for the study, the patient will be provided 
with an informed consent form by [CONTACT_24204]-person 
clinic visit. The study staff will introduce the study to the patients and go over every 
detail of the study. If agrees, the patient will sign the consent form with the study staff 
during the same in-person visit with the study staff.
For verbal consent with patients, below are the possible scenarios for obtaining consent. All 
study procedures can be conducted remotely therefore in-person visits are not necessary if 
patients are not returning for in-person visits or to minimize in-person contacts. 
1)Physician/Study  Investigator  makes  the initial  contact,  study  staff follows  up with the 
patient  on the phone,  and patient  provides  verbal  consent  on the phone:  After  
confirming  with the physician  (or their  designee)  that a patient  is a potential  
candidate  for the study,  the physician/study  investigator  will confirm  that the patient  
10is willing  to speak  with the study  staff about  the study.  The study  staff will then call 
the patient  via phone.  The study  coordinator  will use the verbal  consent  script  as a 
written  aid and will go over every  detail  of the study  with the patient  to recruit  them  
for the study.  Study  staff will sign and date it to confirm  that he/she followed  the 
script  and the patient  agrees  to participate  in the study.  An information  sheet  
summarizing  the study  and patient's involvement  will be mailed  /emailed to the 
patient  for their  records.
For caregivers of alive patients, we will obtain verbal consent. They will be provided with an 
information sheet. The patient will identify a caregiver and makes the initial contact. After 
confirming with the patient that a caregiver is willing to speak with the study coordinator 
about the study, the study staff then call the caregiver via phone. The study coordinator will 
use the verbal consent script as a written aid and will go over every detail of the study with 
the caregiver to recruit them for the study. Study staff will sign and date it to confirm that 
he/she followed the script and the caregiver agrees to participate in the study. An information 
sheet summarizing the study and caregiver’s involvement will be provided/mailed/emailed to 
the caregiver for their records.
For providers, we will discuss the study at research or staff meetings and solicit interest in 
participation. In addition, we will approach providers via email communications. An 
informational sheet will be emailed to the providers. We will obtain verbal consent if they 
agree to participate. 
4.1.1. Informed Consent
Informed consent will be obtained from the patient by [CONTACT_24207]. Consent documents will be signed by [CONTACT_24208][INVESTIGATOR_24187]. For verbal consent, documents will be 
maintained in the patient record with copi[INVESTIGATOR_24187]. Verbal consent 
documents with caregivers and oncology/palliative care providers will also be maintained 
in separate records with copi[INVESTIGATOR_882336].
Waiver of documentation of consent: 
We are requesting for waiver of documentation of consent as the research involves no 
more than minimal risk to the subjects (patients, caregivers, and oncology providers) and 
involves procedures for which written consent is normally not required outside the 
research context. The only record linking the subject and the research would be the 
consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach 
of confidentiality.
Alteration of HIPAA Authorization:
We are requesting an alteration of HIPAA authorization. We will provide an information 
sheet to patients, caregivers, and oncology providers who provided verbal consent. 
Verbal consent will allow for reduction of in-person visits, thus maximizing the safety of 
both patients and study staff. Nonetheless, when possible and if we are able to coordinate 
study and clinic visits, we will obtain written informed consent.
11The study cannot be conducted without the use of protected health information (PHI) as 
we have to link patient reported data with medical history collected on electronic medical 
record. We have adequate plans to protect the PHI from improper use and disclosure. We 
will destroy identifiers after completion of the study for [ADDRESS_1234073] Investigator Guidance policy will 
be used to ensure that ethical standards for human subjects are upheld. 
4.1.3. Participation
Regulations at the state, federal, and institutional level will be adhered to in regards to informed 
consent. Study participation is completely voluntary. After consenting, participants may 
withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, and they may do so without any 
repercussions. Participants may also be withdrawn by [CONTACT_882343]. All information regarding consent and withdrawal will be kept 
confidential. 
4.1.4. Duration
Aim 1: The qualitative section of this study involves interviewing consented patients and 
caregivers for 30-60 minutes. We will also interview oncology and palliative care providers. 
Study participants will be interviewed by [CONTACT_882344]-person (in a private space) or 
via phone/zoom. Interviews will be audio-recorded, uploaded to Box, and subsequently deleted 
from the audio-recorder. 
Aim 2: At baseline, study patients and consented caregivers will complete demographics and 
baseline measures. We will also collect demographic information from oncology providers. After 
the oncology providers undergo a skill-based training session of SICG (2-4 hours; duration to be 
determined based on feedback obtained from aim 1), a telehealth visit will be scheduled with the 
study participants, caregivers, and oncologist providers within 1-[ADDRESS_1234074]-intervention measures. Within 1-2 weeks 
after the telehealth visit, the study team will separately interview the patient, caregiver (if 
available), and oncology provider present at the telehealth visit via Zoom/phone or in-person. 
All audio-recordings will be uploaded to Box, transcribed by a professional transcription service, 
and subsequently deleted from the audio-recorder. After the study is completed, all participant 
data will be maintained for [ADDRESS_1234075]-protected database. 
125.0. Registration
For Aim 1 (qualitative), registration information for patients, caregivers, and providers will be 
collected and entered into REDCap.
For Aim 2, registration information for patients, caregivers, and oncology providers will be 
collected and entered into the OnCore Database:

In Aim 1, study patients will complete demographics and a 30-60 minutes interview. 
Patients and caregivers in Aim 2 will complete baseline assessments with the study 
coordinator and then schedule a telehealth visit.
146.0 Intervention
The original SICG intervention included clinical tools, training, and system changes (Table 1). 
The primary clinician tool was a structured communication guide called the Serious Illness 
Conversation Guide (SICG; https://www.ariadnelabs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/SI-
CG-2017-04-21_FINAL.pdf). Patient tools included a preconversation letter given to the patient 
at study enrollment, which introduced the SICG, and a “Family Guide,” outlining an approach 
for continuing the conversation with their family after the patient-clinician discussion. The 
clinician training included a 2.5-hour, skills-based training session on the SICG led by [CONTACT_882345]. System changes included the following systematic components: (1) clinicians were 
asked the “surprise question,” “would you be surprised if this patient died in the next year?”; (2) 
clinicians were sent email reminders and given the SICG by [CONTACT_882346]; (3) an accessible, structured, EMR documentation template mirroring the SICG 
was provided, and clinicians were trained on its use; and (4) in-person, email-based, or 
telephonic clinician coaching on the SICG was provided by [CONTACT_882347]. 
Table [ADDRESS_1234077] an in-person or zoom/phone interview for 30-[ADDRESS_1234078] and caregiver (if applicable) will complete demographics and 
baseline measures. Following this, a telehealth visit will be scheduled with their oncology 
provider within 1-[ADDRESS_1234079] access to an electronic 
device, the study team will provide them with a tablet that is preloaded with the zoom 
application and internet access (if needed). Instructions on how to use zoom on the tablet will be 
provided. The sole purpose of the tablet is to allow for a zoom visit to occur and no data will be 
obtained and stored. If the tablet is lost or broken, we will provide a replacement tablet (and the 
broken tablet will be collected). We will work with the University IT to restrict the use of the 
tablets to zoom only.
During the ACP visit, their oncology provider will discuss ACP and EOL care. This visit will be 
recorded. Prior to the visit, providers will be provided with a checklist of items to discuss and 
summary of aging-related vulnerabilities. After the visit, the study subject and caregiver (if 
applicable) will complete post-intervention measures. They will be asked to mail back the tablet 
or return the tablet in the next in-person visit.
Within 4 weeks (up to 12 weeks if needed) of the telehealth visit, we will conduct an interview 
with the patient and caregiver (if applicable) either in-person or via zoom/phone for 30-[ADDRESS_1234080] an interview with the oncology provider who enrolled the patient 
on the study. All parties present for the recorded visit, including: enrolled patients, any 
accompanying caregivers, family or friends, the oncologist, and any other physicians or health 
care providers not participating in the study will be fully aware that the conversation is being 
audio-recorded before any recording begins, in addition to the prior written consent of enrolled 
patients. Patients, caregivers, and oncology providers may receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_882337]. Participants will complete post-intervention measures within 4 weeks of the visit 
(up to 12 weeks if needed).
7.2. Assessments of the Participants 
Demographic, clinical, and cancer characteristics will be collected on paper or via RedCap. 
7.2.1. Demographics (Patient, Caregivers, and Providers)
Patient and caregiver’s age, race, ethnicity, gender, highest level of education achieved, 
employment status, and marital status. Caregiver’s relationship to the patient will also be 
inquired. This will only be collected at baseline.
17Provider’s age, race, ethnicity gender, years in practice since completion of training, and 
disciplines (e.g., oncology physician, palliative care physician, APP, nurse) will be 
collected.
7.2.2. Clinical and Cancer Characteristics (Patient)
ECOG performance status, comorbidity, medications, weight, height, BMI, diagnosis and 
date of diagnosis, prior hematologic malignancies, cytogenetic risk group, and treatment 
regimen will be abstracted from the medical records. This information will only be 
collected at baseline.
In addition, we will collect the following from the medical records. We have previously 
collected this information in a retrospective fashion and will use similar procedures to 
extract this information prospectively from the medical records.
Rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24194] (and timing relative to death) 
Rate of palliative care referral (and timing relative to diagnosis)
Rate of chemotherapy administration within the last 2 weeks of life
Completion of advance directives which include MOLST forms, living will, 
durable power of attorney for healthcare, and healthcare proxy forms. 
Documentation of ACP conversation in the electronic medical record will also be 
collected.
Do no resuscitation order (and timing related to diagnosis and death)
Percentage of patients who died from cancer with more than one emergency 
department visit in the last 30 days of life
Percentage of patients who died from cancer admitted to the ICU in the last 30 
days of life
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6924] 30 days of life (number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], reasons for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602])
Use of life-sustaining treatments (e.g., mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, 
tracheostomy, dialysis for acute kidney injury, percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy) in the last 30 days of life
Transfusion in the last 7 days of life
Place of death (home, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], facility, etc.)
Inpatient mortality rate
7.2.3. Measures 
Measures will be collected via in-person, or mailed to the participants. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Functional Status (Patient) – baseline only
Activities of daily living (ADL): ADLs are measures of self-care. ADL 
independence will be assessed using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities 
of Daily Living, commonly referred to as the Katz ADL. The Katz ADL is the 
most appropriate instrument to assess functional status as a measurement of the 
client’s ability to perform activities of daily living independently. Clinicians 
18typi[INVESTIGATOR_882338]. The Index ranks adequacy of performance in the six 
functions of bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. 
Clients are scored yes/no for independence in each of the six functions. A score of 
6 indicates full function, 4 indicates moderate impairment, and 2 or less indicates 
severe functional impairment.25
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL): Self-reported functional status 
will be assessed using the IADL subscale of the Multidimensional Functional 
Assessment Questionnaire: Older American Resources and Services (OARS). The 
IADL subscale consists of seven questions rated on a three-point Likert scale. It 
measures the degree to which an activity can be performed independently.26
Fall History: A self-reported history of falls in the past year will be recorded. A 
history of a recent fall has been demonstrated to be independently predictive of 
increased risk for chemotherapy toxicity in older cancer patients.27
[IP_ADDRESS]. Psychological Health (Patient and Caregiver) – baseline and post-
intervention 
General Anxiety Disorder-7: A 7-item screening tool for anxiety.28 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-2): A 9-item valid and reliable screening 
tool depression in the general population.29 
Distress: A self-reported tool to screen for symptoms of distress, using a 0-10 
rating scale.30
[IP_ADDRESS]. Social Support (Patient) – baseline only
OARS Medical Social Support: A 13-item questionnaire for patients regarding 
persons involved in medical social support as well as perception of overall 
support.31,32 
Patients also self-report their living situation and their main social support. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Nutritional status (Patient) – baseline only

218.0 Data Handling and Statistical Considerations
8.1. Data Handling
8.1.1. The same protocols and procedures for data quality and control that are readily 
used for the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base 
protocols currently being overseen by [CONTACT_24214] (which have accrued over 1,000 patients 
in the previous year) will be used for this study. Patients will fill out forms generated 
from RedCap and this information will be entered into RedCap (Section 9.5). Study 
personnel will perform BLESSED and the scores will be entered into RedCap.   
8.1.2. It is anticipated that allowing for the appropriate number of evaluable participants 
and by [CONTACT_24215]-report measures for completeness, we will have a full complement 
of data. Every effort will be made to encourage and facilitate participants’ completion of 
all questionnaires and all items on the questionnaires for each study assessment.  In the 
event that missing data occur, every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_24216].  The 
reasons for missing data will be documented. Missing questionnaire items will be treated 
in accordance with the documented scoring procedures. Although it is very unlikely that 
missing values will not occur randomly, we will confirm their randomness.  Multiple 
imputation45 will be applied to (1) give more accurate statistical tests and standard errors 
for key treatment effect parameters and to (2) give some indication of the sensitivity of 
the analyses to missing data.  The causes and pattern of the missing data will be 
examined and taken into consideration in the design of future studies.
8.1.2. For audio-recordings, these will be uploaded to Box within a week of the 
interview/clinic visits and deleted from the digital audio recorder (Sony). The recordings 
will be transcribed by a professional transcription service, and the transcripts will be used 
for data analysis. 
8.1.4. Data collected (both assessments and transcripts) will only be accessed by [CONTACT_14504]: 1) The research team and 2) The treating physician and their designee. 
8.2. Data Analysis and Sample Size:
8.2.1. Analysis Plan for Aim [ADDRESS_1234082] similar research (i.e., the point at which no new data emerge).19,20 All interviews 
will be conducted and audio-recorded by [CONTACT_882349] a 
professional transcription service. Two trained personnel (“coders”) will extract and 
highlight themes from the transcripts. We will analyze the qualitative data using 
grounded theory and constant comparative methods, with coding to structure data into 
categories and create groups according to the broader issues or themes.[ADDRESS_1234083] completion, potential solutions and ideas, experience 
22with telehealth interventions, added values of the intervention, support and concerns for 
the proposed intervention, components of the intervention that are important to them, and 
their opi[INVESTIGATOR_592422] (e.g., delivery, format). We will keep an audit trail 
to establish trustworthiness. We will critically examine the data collection and analysis 
process, discuss emerging codes, and reach consensus on principal themes. These themes 
will be used to adapt the telehealth-delivered ACP intervention.
8.2.2. Analysis Plan for Aim 2
Quantitative analyses: We anticipate that our proposed sample size will be sufficient 
based on prior research22 and also published guidance on usability study.47,48 We will 
employ descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Feasibility will be defined based on 
the retention rate (percentage of patients consented to the study ultimately completing all 
study components); >80% will be considered feasible. Recruitment rate (percentage of 
patients who are approached and agree to enroll) will also be described. Usability will be 
defined based on the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_1962]; total 
average of >5 will be considered usable.49,50 We anticipate that about 20% of the 
participants will withdraw before post-intervention assessment due to death.[ADDRESS_1234084] 16 patients to be evaluable. When we estimate 
retention rate and usability, a 95% CI will span approximately +/- 25%. For example, if 
we observe 12/16 (75%) patients complete the tasks, the CI will be 51-90%. 
For other measures, these are being collected in preparation for a larger clinical trial in 
the future. As exploratory analyses, paired t-tests or McNemar’s test will be used to 
evaluate change in measures from baseline to post-intervention. 
Qualitative analyses will be per Aim 1. All audio-recorded interviews and clinic visits 
will audio-recorded by [CONTACT_882349] a professional 
transcription service. The themes will focus on participant experience during the 
telehealth ACP visit and feedback which will be used to further optimize the study 
procedures and intervention.
For audio-recorded clinic encounters, we will assess EOL care concerns brought up by 
[CONTACT_88122]. We will assess how the physician addresses these concerns. 
Quantitative analysis of the communication processes, including number of questions 
asked and topi[INVESTIGATOR_882339]. We have previously used the same study 
procedures and coders will undergo extensive training and supervision by [CONTACT_83671].

9.2. All hardcopy research records will be stored onsite in the URMC, in locked research files at 
the WCI.  The Cancer Center is secured with electronic key cards. Offices within the Cancer 
Center are again secured by [CONTACT_24217]. Electronic research 
records are stored on the URMC’s password secured and firewall protected networks. These are 
the same methods of security used for patient medical records. For audio-recordings, these will 
be uploaded to Box within a week of the interview and deleted from the audio recorder. All study 
26data will be kept for a period of [ADDRESS_1234085] hoc analyses as appropriate. Data 
will not be used for future studies without prior consent of the patient.  The patient’s individual 
research record will not be shared with their treating physician, unless they provide consent or 
the patient’s treating physician is a study physician, in which case they will have access to study 
data as a study co-investigator. Overall study results will be presented to participants, faculty and 
staff at the URMC after completion of the study. Study results will be presented at professional 
meetings and published.
9.4. The study coordinator will assign a numerical study ID to each participant once they have 
signed the consent form (chronologically based on the data they signed consent i.e., 001, 002, 
003…). All study forms and questionnaires will use this number and the participant’s first, 
middle, and last initials as identifiers, to ensure data integrity.  Other identifying information will 
not exist on these forms. A complete list of study participants with study ID, name, and contact 
[CONTACT_24218]. This linkage information will only be accessible to the 
study coordinator, study investigators, and the individuals responsible for maintaining the 
database.  
9.5. Additionally, data on the socio-demographics, clinical, and cancer and treatment 
characteristics will be collected and managed by [CONTACT_24219].[ADDRESS_1234086] and manage this 
information. 
9.5a. URMC provides the following information on the REDCap program: “Vanderbilt 
University, in collaboration with a consortium of institutional partners, has developed a 
software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of 
research and clinical trial data, called REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). The 
REDCap system is a secure, web-based application that is flexible enough to be used for a 
variety of types of research. It provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data and real 
time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of data entry. 
REDCap offers easy data manipulation with audit trails and functionality for reporting, 
monitoring and querying patient records, as well as an automated export mechanism to 
common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). Through the REDCap 
Consortium, Vanderbilt has disseminated REDCap for use around the world. Currently, 
over 240 academic and non-profit consortium partners on six continents with over 26,000 
research end-users use REDCap.53 
9.5b. According to the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), REDCap is 
supported with the following means. “The CTSI Informatics Core, a unit of the SMD 
Academic Information Technology (AIT) Group, will serve as a central facilitator for data 
processing and management.  REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-
specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_882350] 
27the research team, with planning assistance from the AIT-CTSI Informatics Core. The 
iterative development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection strategy 
for individual studies.”46 
9.5c. The CTSI states that regarding security, “REDCap servers are housed in a local data 
center at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster and all web-based information transmission is 
encrypted. REDCap was developed in a manner consistent with HIPAA security 
requirements and is recommended to University of [COMPANY_002]ster researchers by [CONTACT_24221].53 
10.0 Risks/Benefits
10.1. Risks
There is potential loss of confidentially associated with participation in the proposed study. In 
terms of loss of confidentiality, quantitative data from participants will need to be stored. Though 
rigorous and well-tested data safety and security guidelines will be observed, there is still a 
chance that confidentiality could be breached and sensitive medical information could become 
known to persons outside the research team.
10.2. Benefits
There are no anticipated benefits to the participants.
10.3 Payments and Costs
Patients and caregivers participating will be paid $[ADDRESS_1234087]-intervention assessment. Oncology 
providers will not be reimbursed for their participation.
10.4 Funding Source
The study is funded by [CONTACT_882351].

Specific Aims  
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and although much is understood about mechanisms of inflammation in allergic 
asthma, less is known about mechanisms of irritant -induced asthma (IA) (5, 7) . Understanding the underlying similarities 
and differences in mechanisms of these two types of asthma will help focus current treatments and lead to development of 
new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We have a longstanding NYU/Be llevue Asthma registry (NYUBAR), with a large population (N = 900) of 
asthma cases and controls, a program that has been housed at the CTSI (formerly GCRC). The destruction of the World 
Trade Center (WTC) resulted in massive dust, gas and fume exposures to  local residents, workers and cleanup workers 
and individuals involved in rescue and recovery and adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_779058] 7 years after 9/11 (1-4). Many responders, as well as those exposed as residents or local workers, have developed IA, 
asthma that arise s after a lag from an environmental exposure (1, 5, 6) . The WTC Environmental Health Center (WTC 
EHC) is one of the three [LOCATION_001] City (NYC) WTC Centers of Excellence and the only one that  focuses on treatment 
and monitoring of local workers and residents. As such, it has a large population of individuals with irritant -induced 
asthma. We now propose to use participants from the NYUBAR and the WTC EHC to expand our knowledge of irritant 
and allergic asthma. Non -invasive studies allow for the assessment of airway inflammation, a non -specific response to 
environmental exposure and injury. Recent technologies also allow for assessment of microRNA (miRNA), small RNAs 
that regulate gene expression  at the post -transcriptional level and thus serve as a pathway to regulation of inflammation. 
We will test the hypothesis that airway inflammation in irritant and allergic asthma may be similar, but result 
from divergent miRNA regulatory pathways expressed  in sputum  cells.  These studies will provide preliminary data 
for future studies that will help identify biological pathways to categorize these asthma phenotypes and target future 
treatment interventions. We propose the following aims:  
 
Specific Aim 1 : To test the hypothe sis that irritant –induced asthma is characterized by [CONTACT_779112] a manner similar to that described for allergic asthma.  
SA1.a  We will identify and phenotype individuals with WTC dust cloud -exposed irritant -induced asthma (IA), ind ividuals 
with allergic asthma (AA) and healthy unexposed individuals (Controls) . 
SA1.b  We will measure biomarkers of inflammation using noninvasive techniques for exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) and 8 -
isoprostane from exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in WTC irri tant-induced asthma (IA), individuals with allergic asthma 
(AA) and in healthy unexposed individuals (Controls).  
SA1.c  We will measure inflammatory cells in induced sputum from individuals with IA, AA and Controls.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : To test the hypothesis that the miRNA expression in airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_779059], AA 
and Control individuals.  
SA2.a.  We will isolate RNA from epi[INVESTIGATOR_779060] -induced asthma (IA), individuals with 
allergic asthma (AA) and healthy unexposed individuals (Controls).  
SA2.b.  We will identify the mRNA targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs by [CONTACT_779113].

[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  2  
Specific Aim 3 : To test the hypothesis that levels of RNA of targets in human sputum cells will differ before and after the 
administration of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatics (both IA, AA). The importa nce of this hypothesis in the 
characterization of irritant induced and allergic asthma is to further characterize the regulatory pathways expressed in 
sputum cells by [CONTACT_779114].  
 
SA3.a. We will isolate RNA targets in discrete sputum cells from induced sputum in IA and AA individuals and compare 
levels before and after administration of inhaled corticosteroids.  
 
 
I. Background and Significance  
The destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) resulted in massive dust, gas and fume exposures to local residents, 
workers and cleanup workers as well as to individuals involved in rescue and recovery. Local residents and workers were 
caught in the massi ve dust cloud as the buildings collapsed and a major proportion of individuals returned to work or their 
homes one week after the event when many office buildings and residences were only incompletely cleaned. Responders, 
local workers, and residents had p otential for ongoing dust and fume exposure as indoor and outdoor WTC dust was 
recirculated and the fires burned for four months. Adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_779061] 7 years after 9/11 by [CONTACT_3433] e Centers of Excellence in [LOCATION_001] (1, 3, 8) . Data from 
firefighters who worked at the site demonstrate persistent respi[INVESTIGATOR_779062] -year 
post 9/11 suggesting that they initially developed reactive airways disease (3). Data from subseq uent studies of 
occupationally -exposed individuals, as well as those exposed as residents or local workers, suggest that many have also 
developed irritant -induced asthma, a form of asthma that can arise after a lag from an environmental exposure (1, 5, 6) .  
Why study irritant -induced asthma (IA)  
Asthma, a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes, is characterized by a variable degree of airflow obstruction, 
airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation which results in symptoms of cough, shortne ss of breath, wheezing 
and chest tightness (9). Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with some patients having a clear allergic component, whereas 
others non -allergic asthma, some of which arises after irritant exposure (dust, gas, vapors or fumes). In the WTC 
population there is a high prevalence of ast hma-like symptoms that developed after 9/[ADDRESS_1070991] hyperresponsiveness consistent with irritant -induced asthma (1, 10) . The underlying pathology and inflammatory 
response in irritant -induced is unclear and may differ from classic allergic asthma. Little is known about mechanism s of 
irritant -induced asthma.  
Why study non -invasive markers of inflammation  
There are ongoing efforts to define biomarkers to characterize airway inflammation in asthma. Presently the “gold 
standard” to measure airway inflammation and biomarkers of inflammation in humans involves direct airway sampling by 
[CONTACT_139621] (11). The invasive nature of bronchoscopy makes it impractical and thus there is much interest in 
implementation of noninvasive methods. Approaches using exhaled nitric ox ide (ENO), exhaled breath condensate (EBC) 
and induced sputum (IS) as surrogates of the lung have many advantages including sampling simplicity, subject comfort, 
analytical ease and safety for longitudinal studies. Few studies have been performed on non -invasive markers of irritant -
induced asthma. A recent report demonstrated a similar inflammatory cell profile of increased eosinophils and neutrophils 
in induced sputum in individuals with acute irritant -induced asthma from accidental inhalational injury com pared to 
individuals with allergic occupational asthma (12).  
Exhaled NO increases in individuals with asthma, decreases with inhaled corticosteroid treatment and asthma control and 
correlates with eosinophil count in induced sputum and bronchoscopic sampling of airway inflammatory cells (13-19). 
ENO has been suggested as a more sensitive and reliable screening tool for the diagnosis of asth ma than spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (11, 
20). Whether ENO levels in irritant -induced asthma are also elevated has not been studied therefore making this 
noninvasive biomarker an ideal start in characterizing the inflammatory response in this type of asthma.  
Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is collec ted by [CONTACT_779115] a cold condensing tube. Levels of 
select markers in the condensed phase breakdown products reflect changes in the composition of the airway lining fluid. 
Biomarkers from EBC have been used to study asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and lung cancer (11, 21 -
26). The application of EBC in human exposure studies is sparse. Markers of inflammation and oxidative stress that have 
    Kazeros , PI 
[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  3 been identified in EBC include isoprostanes and pH (11)(27, 28) . The measurement of EBC components (pH, and 8 -
isoprostane) may help characterize injury in response to inhalational exposure from WTC fumes and dust.  
Induced sputum (IS) can be collected after inhalation of hypertonic saline. Measuremen ts of IS, including cell counts, 
cytokines and chemokines have been used to assess lung inflammation extensively in individuals with asthma and COPD 
(11, 29, 30) . Measurement of eosinophils in IS has been proposed as a diagnostic tool  in occupational asthma (31, 32) (33-
36). IS contains exfoliated airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_779063] a direct measure of the lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]. A simple inexpensive and effective method to limit the cellular hetero geneity of IS by [CONTACT_779116][INVESTIGATOR_54056] a sample has been described by [CONTACT_62236] (37, 38) . Only one study has examined the ability 
to both isolate and analyze microRNA from sput um in patients with lung cancer suggesting a need for further 
investigation of other lung diseases, particularly asthma (38).  
Why study microRNA and mRNA  
Studies suggest that the end result of airway injury, whether due to an allergic or irritant process is similar, and is 
characterized by [CONTACT_779117] “remodeling.” We and others have described tha t epi[INVESTIGATOR_779064] (39-
41).The biologic pathways that produce airway inflammation, although mediated by [CONTACT_282973][INVESTIGATOR_1663], may differ 
between the irritant and allerg ic asthma phenotypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non -protein -coding 
RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate the expression of hundreds of target genes, thereby [CONTACT_231241] a wide range of 
biological functions including cellular proliferation,  differentiation and apoptosis (42, 43) . MiRNAsdownregulate gene 
expression by [CONTACT_779118]. Identification of aberrant expression of miRNA may 
serve as valuable diagnostic or prognostic disease markers (42). Most studies to date have linked miRNAs to cancer 
because of their potential to fu nction as tumor suppressors or oncogenes (44). Airway biopsies in individuals who smoke 
demonstrate miRNAs that are differentially expressed and inversely correlated with their predicted mRNA targets when 
compared to never sm okers suggesting that miRNAs may be contributing to smoking -induced mRNA expression changes 
in airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (45). A recent study failed demonstrate a difference in miRNA expression from bronchial 
biopsies in mild asthmatics com pared to those of healthy individuals but the possibility exists that differences may have 
been masked by [CONTACT_779119] (46). We propose to examine miRNA 
expression in epi[INVESTIGATOR_779065] -directed lung 
inflammation.  
Our studies of irritant -induced asthma and allergic asthma using non -invasive methods (ENO, EBC and IS) and miRNA 
expression will characterize similarities and differences in these asthma phenotyp es that can lead to improved biologic 
understanding of disease and potential targets for treatment interventions.  
Preliminary data  
WTC and asthma cohorts  
The WTC EHC is a program developed for the evaluation, treatment and monitoring of individuals with p resumed WTC 
illness. Initiated as an unfunded community collaboration, it eventually received funding from the American Red Cross, 
and subsequently from the City of [LOCATION_001] and most recently, federal funding from the National Institute of 
Occupational Saf ety and Health (NIOSH). The program targets local workers, residents and clean -up workers and as such, 
is the only one in NYC with this population. We have recently described the respi[INVESTIGATOR_779066]. 1 (1). Although most of the WTC EHC population had normal lung 
function, clear evidence of airway obstruction was noted in others (6 %), and some had reduced lung volume (20%). 
These findings suggest that exposures to WTC dust, fumes and gasses resulted in hete rogeneous patterns of injury. To 
date, there are over 3,[ADDRESS_1070992] hyperresponsiveness has been well -described in the fi refighter population involved in WTC 
rescue and response (3, 4, 47)  To date, our WTC EHC data suggest that respi[INVESTIGATOR_779067] 5 years after the event (1, 2) . Our preliminary data show that among individuals in our WTC clinic with persistent 
lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_779068] 9/11 and had normal spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (n=103), 50% demonstrate a positive 
methacholine challenge test. Individuals who were caught in the WTC dust clouds created as the towers collapsed on 9/[ADDRESS_1070993] (odds ratio = 4.1; p<0.006). These data suggest persistent irritant -
induced asthma in a large population of symptomatic WTC EHC patients.  
Non-invasive biomarkers in the WTC -exposed population  
    Kazeros , PI 
[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  4 An early case -report of a firefighter with seve re lung disease showed a remarkable eosinophilic pneumonia (48). An 
analysis of IS performed on firefighters 10 months after their WTC exposure showed an increase in inflammatory cells 
consisting of neutrophils and eosinophils (33). Few other studies of biomarkers have been performed in the WTC 
population. Our initial studies suggest that there is an increase in peripheral blood eosinophils in our patients who have 
persistent symptoms of wheeze (submitted  as an abstract to American Thoracic Society). These data suggest that our 
patients with irritant -induced asthma may have an inflammatory response characterized by [CONTACT_779120].  
Isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_779069]. We have ample experience isolating bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_779070]. Fluorescence -activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of these cells confirms 
our ability to separate human bronchial epit helial cells and to confirm their purity. We have experience with induced 
sputum and subsequent cell isolation , as described in our recent publication (Bleck et al., 2015)  
Microarray  
We propose microarray analysis of miRNA. We have previously published mi croarray analysis of alveolar macrophages 
obtained from smokers and nonsmokers (49) as well as those obtained from small airways (50). We have previously 
published microarray analysis demonstrating upregulation of MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK) apoptotic cell removal 
receptor in smokers and confirmed upregulation with RT -PCR (49).  
 
Research Design and Methods  
Specific Aim 1 : To test the hypothesis that irritant –induced asthma is characterized by [CONTACT_779112] a manner similar to that described for allergic asthma.  
SA1.a We will identify and phenotype individuals with WTC dust cloud -exposed irritant -induced asthma (IA), individuals 
with allergic asthma (AA) and healthy unexposed individuals (Controls) (N= 90). 
We will study two asthma phenotypes and a control population. Our asthma phenotypes and control population will be 
defined in the following manner:  
IA: Patients will be recruited from the WTC EHC (N = 30) and will have WTC dust cloud exposure , New symptoms after 
9/11, and symptoms of wheeze and shortness of breath > 2x / week) in the 4 weeks before inclusion (persistent 
symptoms).  
AA: These patients will be recruited from the NYUBAR (N = 30) and advertising and will have asthma as defined by [CONTACT_779121] (51), persistent symptoms, and absence of WTC dust exposure.  
Control : These patients will be recruited from the NYUBAR (N = 30) and advertising and wil l have no respi[INVESTIGATOR_779071], no 
asthma diagnosis, no WTC dust exposure. Additional appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria will be developed for 
each group including tobacco use, other lung disease, timing of inhaled corticosteroids etc.  
 
The study will entail two to three visits. On visit 1 (V1) all individuals will sign informed consent to participate in the 
study under an NYU IRB approved protocol. A questionnaire will be completed with standardized questions that include 
information on WTC exposures, demographics, presence and severity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], tobacco history and past 
medical history. Individuals will undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_779072]. Individuals will undergo methacholine 
challenge test (visit 1a) if they h ave normal spi[INVESTIGATOR_779073]. On visit 2, individuals will 
return to undergo ENO, EBC and spi[INVESTIGATOR_779074]. Blood will 
be obtained for CBC with differential cell count, an d assessment of total IgE and allergen -specific IgE. Blood will also be 
stored for future analysis of inflammatory markers. Based on our experience , we have had individuals unable to produce 
enough sputum and thus yield too small a number of cells . These i ndividuals are excluded from data analysis. In addition, 
we also have subjects who are able to produce sputum and return for repeat sputum testing.  
  
SA1.b We will measure biomarkers of inflammation using noninvasive techniques for exhaled nitric oxide (EN O) and 8 -
isoprostane from exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in WTC IA, AA and controls.  
We will use the handheld NIOX MINO® to measure ENO (Aerocrine, Sweden) (17, 18, 20, 52) . The NIOX MINO® 
fulfills the ATS recommendations and provides reliable readings and is portable and we have experience with it (53). 
Most healthy individuals have ENO levels in the range of 5 -35 ppb (some variation with age, gender, race/ethnicity) (54). 
Individuals with asthma have ENO levels that can range from 25 -80 ppb and even higher (18, 61, 62) . 
EBC wil l be collected using a commercially manufactured condenser R tube® (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_113175], Inc., 
Charlottesville, VA) for this study because of its transportability and price. Again, we have experience with this 
technique. Measurements will be made accordin g to published methods (28). Samples will be transported immediately 
    Kazeros , PI 
[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  5 and frozen ( -70˚ C) to improve stability. Our initial studies will focus on measurements of 8 -isoprostane, a reliable 
biomarker of oxidative stress (24, 64) . 8-isoprostane will be measured by [CONTACT_779122]. We will also 
measure pH of EBC (28, 67) . EBC pH is reduced in individuals with asthma and COPD. Changes in pH may be used as 
diagnostic and monitoring modalities in inflammatory airway diseases (68). We will measure pH in degassed samples as 
described (69). Samples will also be stored for future studies of inflammatory mediators including c ytokines/chemokine 
studies.  
SA1.c We will measure inflammatory cells in induced sputum from individuals with IA, AA and Controls.  
Increased numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils have been identified in IS in allergic asthma and occupational asthma 
and h ave been used to monitor asthma disease activity (31, 33, 34, 36, 70) .  We propose to perform sputum induction, 
collection and processing according to established protocols on each individual (71, 72) . IS will be collected after 
inhalation of hypertonic saline (3%, every 2minute intervals for up to 20minutes) with repeated monitoring of FEV 1 as a 
safety measure. Sputum will be processed immediately to ob tain total and cell differential cell counts (73). Our initial 
evaluationinclude d analysis of cell counts, with measurements of eosinophils and neutrophils  (Bleck et al., 2015) . We 
consider significant sputum eosinophilia when sputum eosinophils are > 2% and significant sputum neutrophilia when 
sputum neutrophils are > 60%, cut off values, that have been described in the literature (12). We will also examine cell 
counts as continuous variables.  
Specific Aim 2 : To test the hypothesis that the miRNA expression in airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_779059], AA 
and Control individuals .  
SA2.a. We will isolate RNA from epi[INVESTIGATOR_779075], AA 
and Controls.  
The use of sputum for molecular genetic analyses is limited by [CONTACT_779123] 1% of bronchial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_447959] 95% macrophages and neutrophils (74).  Enrichment of bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_779076] (MACS) or fluorescent cell sorting techniques. We will perform positive selection of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_779077]. Human 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_779078]326 (human epi[INVESTIGATOR_779079], HEA, or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_660075] (EpCAM) using the magnetic bead CD326 (EpCAM) Tumo r Cell Enrichment and 
Detection Kit (Miltenyi Biotech). To confirm purity of our isolation for selected samples, epi[INVESTIGATOR_779080] l 
be demonstrated by [CONTACT_779124] -cytokeratin staining. Cells will immediately be placed in RNAprotect C ell Reagent 
(QIAGEN) and RNA isolated and fractionated into low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) 
using the miRNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). RNA will be quantified and quality assessed. We will collaborate with the NYU 
Cancer Institute (CI)  Genomics Services. We will have access to high -throughput genomic and computational 
methodologies specifically for microRNA. We will use the GeneChip ® miRNA Array. Briefly, LMW RNA will be 
labeled with a FlashTag labeling kit (Genisphere, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples will be 
incorporated into a hybridization mix and applied to an affymetrix chip and scanned. Computational analysis with 
techniques such as principal component analysis will be performed with analytic services provid ed through the NYU CI 
Genomics core facility. Data will be log transformed and only miRNA replicates that are detected at levels of [ADDRESS_1070994] miRNA bind to target -3’UTR and function as translational repressors most often by [CONTACT_779125]. Each miRNA may regulate up to 200 target genes (42). We therefore propose to correlate patterns of miRNA 
changes in our defined populations, with mRNA expression arrays. HMW RNA from isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_779081] -U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Images will be analyzed in the core facility and data will 
be normalized as follows: (1) per array, by [CONTACT_779126] 50th percentile of all measurements; and (2) per 
gene, by [CONTACT_779127] a data set. We will 
determine whether up or down -regulated mRNAs are potential targets for previously identified miRNAs.  
 
Specific Aim 3 : To test the hypothesis that levels of RNA of targets in human sputum cells will differ before and after the 
administration of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatics (both IA, AA). The rationale for this aim of the study is to 
    Kazeros , PI 
[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  6 investigate which markers are steroid sensitive and which a re steroid resistant which wou ld provide information for 
therapeutic targeting  in asthma.  
 
 
SA3.a.  We will isolate RNA targets in discrete sputum cells from induced sputum in IA and AA individuals and compare 
levels before and after administration of inhaled corticosteroids.  
 
In this second phase of the study, (Phase II) we will enroll AA or IA individ uals who have fit enrollment criteria for the 
phase I part of the study and participated in phase I of the study and were able to provide us with an acceptable sputum 
sample. These participants will be recontact[CONTACT_779128] -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
We will obtain a repeat sputum sample as baseline for the Phase II study. An inhaled corticosteroid (Fluticasone HFA 220 
mcg, 1 puff twice daily) and large volume spacer will be provided. Inhalation technique and a daily d iary will be 
reviewed. Subjects will be instructed to use Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] [ADDRESS_1070995] their use in a 
written diary A repeat sputum sample will be obtained after 2 weeks of Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_779082].  
 
Sputum samples wil l be processed for discrete cells and RNA levels (mRNA, miRNA) will be analyzed to understand the 
effect of ICS use on RNA expression in discrete sputum cell populations.  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
We were able to develop basic techniques and measurement from 10 patients in each group as initially proposed in the 
previous version of this protocol. We now propose to increase our enrollment from 30 to 50 subjects in each group based 
on the recruitment and enrollment data of about 30% of screen failures (33 subjects screen failed out of 108 total). In 
addition, there have been subjects who have not been able to produce sputum or provide adequate number of sputum cells 
for analysis ([ADDRESS_1070996] adequate sputum samples). This represents about 60% success rate for 
sample quality. Therefore, we will need to increase our enrollment numbers to achieve an n=30 per group.  
Power Analysis : Based on a similar rate of screen failures and inade quate samples, the analysis is now based on 
50patients in each gro up. Our group sample sizes of 50 and 50  achieve 90% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_1070997] deviati ons are 1.0 and 1.0, with a 
significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1070998]. Mengling Liu, our 
biostatistician for our statistical analysis.  
 
For ENO and EBC analyses, we will express data as means + SD for norm ally distributed variables. For variables that are 
not normally distributed we will use medians and the interquartile range. We will use statistical analysis including 
unpaired t tests, Kruskal -Wallis test, and regression coefficients as appropriate. P val ues of < 0.[ADDRESS_1070999] people are willing and anxious to participate in any study that might help characterize their 
symptoms.  
We plan to also submit an ad vertisement to the IRB for approval and to use research match (researchmatch.org) a national 
registry which is a secure, web -based approach as a recruitment method, and will post the advertisement.  
We have chosen to use individuals with WTC dust cloud expo sure as our model of initial high dose exposure to enhance 
our ability to identify patients with irritant asthma. We suspect that other more prolonged exposures also induce irritant 
asthma, but our previous studies and those of other investigators suggest that this exposure provides the highest risk.   
We have proposed a positive selection strategy for isolation of bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_779083]. The possibility exists 
that this technique may provide too low a yield of cells. Should that be the case, we  can use a negative selection strategy 
using anti -CD14 and anti -CD16 antibody beads to specifically deplete macrophages and neutrophils respectively (37). We 
may also need to obtain duplicate sputum samples from patients, i.e. have patients return for a second sputum induction.  
Our initial analyses will be between our healthy controls and asthma in general (AI and AA) and subsequently between 
each type of asthma (AI and AA) to optimize our ability to detect differences in sputum markers and miRNA. The

for our studies. Because of the high price of each of these chips, and the cost of core analysis time, we initially propose t o 
use [ADDRESS_1071001] potential to provide information 
that could help targ et specific interventions for asthma of different phenotypes  as we proposed in phase II of the study . As 
such, they fit the mandate of the CTS I grants.

7. Vulnerable Subjects: No vulnerable subjects will be part of this study.  
 
III. Methods and Procedures  
 
1. Methods and Procedures:  
We will use the handheld NI OX MINO® to measure ENO (Aerocrine, Sweden) (17, 18, 20, 52) . The NIOX MI NO® 
fulfills the ATS recommendations and provides reliable readings and is portable and we have experience with it (53). 
Most healthy individuals have ENO levels in the range of 5 -35 ppb (some variation with age, gender, race/ethnicity) (54). 
Individuals with asthma have ENO levels that can range from 25 -80 ppb and even higher (18, 61, 62) . 
 
We pro pose to perform sputum  induction, collection and processing according to established protocols on each individual 
(71, 72) . IS will be collected after inhalation of hypertonic saline (3%, every 4 minute intervals for up to 12 minutes) with 
repeated monitoring of FEV 1 as a safety measure. Sputum will be processed immediately to obtain t otal and cell 
differential cell counts (73). Our initial evaluations will include analysis of cell counts, with measurements of eosinophils 
and neutrophils. We consider significant sputum eosinophilia when sputum eosinophils are > 2% and significant sputum 
neutrophilia when sputum neutrophils are > 60%, cut off values, that have been described in the literature (12). We will 
also examine cell counts as continuous variables.  
 
The use of sputum for molecular genetic an alyses is limited by [CONTACT_779123] 1% of bronchial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_447959] 95% macrophages and neutrophils (74).  Enrichment of bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_779076] (MACS). We will perform positive selection of discrete sputum cell populations 
including epi[INVESTIGATOR_779087] w cytometry. Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_779088]326 (human epi[INVESTIGATOR_779079], HEA, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_779089] (EpCAM) using the magnetic bead CD326 (EpCAM) Tumor Cell Enrichment and Detection Kit  
(Miltenyi Biotech). To confirm purity of our isolation for selected samples, epi[INVESTIGATOR_779090] -cytokeratin staining. Cells will immediately be placed in RNAprotect Cell Reagent 
(QIAGEN) and RNA isolat ed and fractionated into low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) 
using the miRNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). RNA will be quantified and quality assessed. We will collaborate with the NYU 
Cancer Institute (CI) Genomics Services. We will have ac cess to high -throughput genomic and computational 
methodologies specifically for microRNA. We will use the GeneChip ® miRNA Array. Briefly, LMW RNA will be 
labeled with a FlashTag labeling kit (Genisphere, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sam ples will be 
incorporated into a hybridization mix and applied to an affymetrix chip and scanned. Computational analysis with 
techniques such as principal component analysis will be performed with analytic services provided through the NYU CI 
Genomics core  facility. Data will be log transformed and only miRNA replicates that are detected at levels of [ADDRESS_1071004] people. We will gently brush the inside of the 
lateral wall of each nostril with a small, delicate, sterile brush. Th is procedure takes about 5 seconds for each 
nostril.  
 
    Kazeros , PI 
[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  9 We also propose to correlate patterns of miRNA changes in our defined populations, with mRNA expression arrays. 
HMW RNA from isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_779091] -U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. 
Images will be analyzed in the core facility and data will be normalized as follows: (1) per array, by [CONTACT_779130] 50th percentile of all measurements; and (2) per gene, by [CONTACT_779131] a data set. We will determine whether up or down -regulated mRNAs are potential targets 
for previously identified miRNAs.  
 
Phase II  
Only subjects with Irritant asthma or Allergic asthma who have successfull y completed the first phase of the study and 
have signed consent to be re -contact[CONTACT_779132] (Phase II). Phase II will involve 
two visits over a [ADDRESS_1071005] obtain sputum sample s for a baseline analysis of cells. 
Study subjects will be provided with an inhaled corticosteroid, Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_96701] 220 mcg, 2 puffs twice a day 
(Treatment), or no treatment (No treatment). Fluticasone HFA will be provided by [CONTACT_779133]. Treatment cases will be instructed to self administer the medication with a large volume 
spacer that will be provided to them. Inhaler teaching will be performed by [CONTACT_779134] t 
the subject is provided the inhaler. Treatment Cases and No treatment controls will be provided a diary to record 
fluticasone inhaler. Treatment cases and No treatment controls will be allowed to use their usual rescue bronchodilator 
(albuterol) on an as  needed basis. Treatment Cases and No treatment controls will return after 2 weeks for a repeat sputum 
induction.  
 
2. Data Analysis and Data Monitoring:  
We will start with 10 patients in each group to develop the basic techniques and measurements. Our gro up sample sizes of 
10 and 10 achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 1.[ADDRESS_1071006] deviations are 1.0 and 1.0, with a significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1071007]. Mengling Liu, our biostatistician and the NYU CI 
Genomics core for our statistical analysis. We put in a small number of patients as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_779092] a subsequent appropriate power analysis.  
For ENO and EBC analyses, we will express data as means + SD for normally distributed variables. For variables that are 
not normally distributed we will use medians and the interquartile rang e. We will use statistical analysis including 
unpaired t tests, Kruskal -Wallis test, and regression coefficients as appropriate. P values of < 0.[ADDRESS_1071008] of inhaled corticosteroids on newly identified 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_779093] (gene expression array) will also be examined. This is an exploratory goal and will be performed after 
cell stabilization and short -term culture cells to insure appropriate RNA quality .  
Sample size and power :  Group sample sizes of 15 an d 15 achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 1.3SD against the 
null hypothesis that both group means are equal with a significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1071009] assuming equal variance.  
 
 
3: Data Storage and Confidentiality:  
Care will be taken to ensure confidentiality. Research records will be held in locked cabinets or secure storage rooms. All 
transmission of data to the coordinating center for analysis will be by [CONTACT_757307].  
Sample specimens will be stored for up to 10 years for future use or until the end of the study.  Participants will be able to 
decide if they want any of their specimens stored for research done at a later time.  
 
IV. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
    Kazeros , PI 
[CONTACT_11711] 17 , 2016  10 1. Risk: Minimal Risk  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], ENO, IOS and EBC . 
Participation in these studies will pose minimal risk of physical or psychological harm.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], impedance 
oscillometry, ENO and exhaled breath condensate collection are minimally invasive.   
 
Methacholine testing:  MCT has been performed with no serious side effects. Participants may develop transient side 
effects such as cough, mild dyspnea, and chest tightness although many experience no symptoms. Inhaled methacholine 
can cause bronchoconstriction and safety of ea ch subject is considered prior to testing. A physician and the medical 
director of the pulmonary lab are trained to treat acute bronchospasm, including appropriate use of resuscitation 
equipment, and a physician is present during the procedure. Our pulmona ry function lab in Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779094]. If bronchospasm occurs appropriate medications will be 
administered as per the lab protocol (oxygen, nebulizers, subcutaneous epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) . If a participant in the study develops 
an acute asthma epi[INVESTIGATOR_779095], the procedure will be stopped and albuter ol will be 
administered to improve breathing. The bronchodilator will be provided by a physician involved in the study and the 
participant will be monitored until their breathing has returned to its baseline.   
For all women of childbearing ability, a preg nancy test will be performed before the methacholine challenge 
study. Pregnant subjects will be excluded from the study.  
 
Induced sputum:  Sputum induction involves inhalation of hypertonic saline aerosol, a stimulus known to cause 
bronchoconstriction in as thmatic subjects. To ensure participant safety during sputum induction we will follow the 
following protocol: procedure will be performed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779096], 
administration of a bronchodilator can be given to inhi bit hypertonic saline -induced bronchoconstriction, we will limit the 
sputum induction to 20 minutes and monitor the participant’s symptoms closely with repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_779097] [ADDRESS_1071010].  
 
Nasal brushing: Nasal brushing . We do not anticipate any untoward risk of performing this procedure in normal 
individuals of in those with asthma. This procedure is not usually painful but some people experience a moment of 
discomfort for about 5 seconds during the brushing. There may be minor irritation such as reflex tearing from your eyes, 
or sneezing. There may be a rare chance that there is a small amount of bleeding as if you had a scrape. These possible 
discomforts res olve on their own.  
 
Administration of inhaled corticosteroid –We are providing high dose inhaled corticosteroid ( Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_96701] 
220 mcg ) for a short (2 week) period of time. This medication poses no more than minimal risk to research subjects and 
the risk is minimized by [CONTACT_779135] a large volume spacer. This is an approved treatment for 
asthma. The most common symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_779136]: upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776] ( 25-29%), hoarseness or dysphonia (1 -4%), inflammation of throat, nose or sinuses (1 -12%),  oral candidiasis 
(2%) , nausea and vomiting (1%), other gastrointestinal symptoms (1 -2%), and muscle or bone pain (3%). Subjects will be 
instructed to on avoidance o f oral candidiasis by [CONTACT_779137].  
 
 
2. Protection against Risks:  
All participants will be provided with a contact [CONTACT_779138]. This person will be available on a [ADDRESS_1071011] 
basis through the [LOCATION_001] University/Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779098].  
 
3: Potential Benefit to the Subjects:  
 
The subject will be informed that the proposed research will be of no immediate benefit to him/her but may help advance 
our knowledge of irritant and allergic asthma and help others in the future.

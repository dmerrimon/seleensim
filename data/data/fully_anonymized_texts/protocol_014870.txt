Page 4 Study Design:  This is a Phase 1, open -label, multiple -center st udy in 
pediatric patients from 38 weeks gestation  to < 18 years of 
age.  Patients from 5 age cohorts (12 evaluable patients per 
age cohort) will receive a single dose of edoxaban.  Each age 
cohort will be divided into a low - and high -dose group 
(6 patients per dose group).  Order of enrollment will be from 
the oldest age cohor t to the youngest age cohort.  Within 
each age cohort, enrollment will first start in the lower dose 
group (to achieve exposures comparable to a 30 mg adult 
dose).  After evaluation of PK and safety data from at least 
half the patients in the lower dose gr oup, enrollment may 
then start in the higher dose group (to achieve exposures 
comparable to a 60 mg adult dose).  If the observed 
exposures are higher than expected in the lower dose group 
and exceed the projected 60 mg adult exposure , then a lower 
dose ma y be investigated in the proposed “h igh-dose”  group.  
Enrollment in the next younger age cohorts will begin when 
at least 50% of patients have completed the study in the older 
age cohort.   Enrollment in the younger age cohorts will start 
only after PK and safety data have been evaluated from 
at least 6 patients (3 low -dose and 3 high -dose) in the older 
age cohort.   Pharmacokinetic and safety data will be 
reviewed by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (see 
Section  11.9) who will approve the start of the next  younger 
age cohort.  However, enrollment initiation of Cohort [ADDRESS_554598] 50% 
of patients in the preceding older dose group.

In Cohort 1, the oldest age grou p (12 to < 18 years), doses 
have been selected on the basis of modeling of adult data to 
target comparable exposures to 30 mg (low -dose) and 60  mg 
(high -dose).  In this cohort, fixed dosing will be used.  In  
Cohorts 2, 3, 4, and 5, the younger age  groups  (38 weeks 
gestation to < 12 years) , appropriated  doses will be selected 
to elicit target exposures comparable to those achieved from 
adult doses of 30 mg (low -dose) or 60 mg (high -dose).  
Patients in Cohort  1 will receive multiples of edoxaban 
tablets of 30  mg strength.  Patients in Cohorts 2, 3, 4, and 5  
will receive the edoxaban g ranule for oral suspension .  The 
dose that each dose group receives will be determined by 
[CONTACT_437658].

The first patient is expected to be enrolled in June 2014.  
Study Sites and Location:  Multiple sites in North America, Europe, and other regions  
Planned Sample Size:  A total of 60 patients will be enrolled to obtain 12  evaluable 
patients in each age cohort (6 patients in each dose group).  
Patient Eligibility Criteria:  Male and female pediatric patients who may require  or are 
currently on anticoagulant  therapy may be enrolled.   
These may include:  
 Patients who have a recently acquired or 
Investigator determined ongoing ris k of 
thromboembolic events (e.g., patients with 
thrombophilia, congenital heart disease, presence 
of a central venous catheter and prior venous 
thromboembolic event [VTE]).  
 Patients who are completing their 
standard -of-care anticoagulant therapy. Edoxaban 
can be initiated 12 hours after cessation of 
enoxaparin, dabigatran, or api[INVESTIGATOR_437635] 
(A-U136, A -U151, and A -E152) and 24 hours 
after cessation of rivaroxaban therapy (A -U151). 
Note: that the dose of edoxaban should be at the 
time of the next scheduled standard -of-care 
anticoagulant administration:

Page 9 Dosage Form, Dose, and 
Route of Administration:  Edoxaban tablets (30 mg) or edoxaban granules for oral 
suspension (60 mg reconstituted with 8  mL water to provide 
a 6 mg/mL suspension for oral administration).  In each age 
cohort, patients will receive appropriated  single oral dose 
selected to target exposures comparable to adult doses of 
30 mg (low -dose) or 60 mg (high -dose).   If the observed 
exposure from the 30 mg dose in adolescents is higher than 
predicted and  is comparable to the 60 mg adult dose 
exposures, then, the next cohort will receive a lower dose, 
instead of a higher dose.  To allow for this flexibility, 
patients in the 12 to <  [ADDRESS_554609] the assigned 
dosing form (tablet or suspension formulation ), the patient 
will not be enrolled and will be replaced.  
Patients will be administere d edoxaban in the morning with

 Cohorts 1a/1b: 120 mL water;  
 Cohorts  2a/2b: 60 mL water;  
 Cohorts 3a/3b: 40 mL water;  
 Cohorts  4a/4b: 10 mL water;  
 Cohorts  5a/5b:  [ADDRESS_554610] 4 hours before 
dosing and for an additional 2 hours after dosing .  If this is 
not feasible because of the patient’s age or other needs, 
(unflavored) milk, or an equivalent substitute liquid (but not 
fruit juices), will  be allowed until 1 hour before and starting 
at 1 hour postdose.   During this period, the total volume of 
liquids should not exceed 240 mL, excluding the volume of 
water utilized for dosing.

1.1. Data Summary  
A brief summary of relevant information from nonclinical and clinical studies included in the 
edoxaban (DU -176, free base of DU -176b) Investigator’s Brochure is included below.  Detailed 
information can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure.[ADDRESS_554619]  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Name  
[CONTACT_437702] (DU -176b): N-(5-Chloropyridin -2-yl)-N’-[(1S,2R,4S)-4-(N,N-
dimethylcarbamoyl) -2-(5-methyl -4,5,6,7 -tetrahydro [1,3] thiazolo[5,4 -c]pyridine -2-
carboxamido)cyclohexyl]  oxamide  mono(4 -methylbenzenesulfonate) monohydrate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Description  
Edoxaban is a potent and direct inhibitor of activated factor X (FXa)  that pr olongs  clotting time 
of plasma.  Edoxaban has been approved in the [LOCATION_002] and European Union for adults as a 
clinically useful anticoagulant .  In rat thrombosis models, this compound prevents thrombus 
formation and suppresses the hypercoagulable state.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Intended Use Under Investigation  
Efficacy will not be studied in the protocol.  The goal of this study is to identify pediatric doses 
that provide comparable exposure to adult efficacious doses to guide dose selection for Phase 3 
studies in pediatrics.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Studies  
Pharmacology  
Pharmacological studies demonstrate that edoxaban is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
activated FXa in vitro.  The in vitro anticoagulant effect of edoxaban is consistent with in  vivo 
data.  Edoxaban does not impair plat elet aggregation induced by [CONTACT_437663], U46619 (a 
thromboxane A2 agonist), or adenosine diphosphate in human platelet -rich plasma.  
The anticoagulant properties of edoxaban in vivo have been established in several rat thrombosis 
models: venous thrombus, disse minated intravascular coagulation, arterial -venous shunt, and 
venous stasis.  The minimal effective single oral doses in the in  vivo models were 0.1 to 
2.5 mg/kg in rats yielding plasma edoxaban concentrations of about 5 to 170 ng/mL.  Plasma 
concentration s were generally proportional to the administered doses.  
There were no major safety pharmacology concerns with edoxaban.  
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion  
In vitro protein binding of 14C-edoxaban was assessed in human plasma obtained from  healthy 
volunteers (N = 3/concentration).  At concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5  µg/mL, 54.3%, 54.4%, and 
56.6%  of 14C-edoxaban , respectively, were bound  to plasma protein . 
Protocol DU176b -A-U157  
Version 7.0, 16  Sep 2019 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 23 In vitro distribution of 14C-edoxaban was assessed in human blood cells from plasma o f healthy 
volunteers ( N = 3/concentration).  At concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5  µg/mL of 14C-edoxaban, 
45.7%, 45.9, and 47.4%, respectively, were distributed into the blood cells.  
In human liver microsomes, 6 edoxaban metabolites were identified :  D21 -1402 , D21 -3231, 
D103 -2684, D21 -2393, D21 -2135, and a hydroxylated metabolite at the N, N-dimethylcarbamoyl 
group of edoxaban .  Cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 3A4 was the major enzyme involved in the 
formation of D21 -1402, D103 -2684, and M-3a.  D21 -3231 and D21 -2393 wer e formed 
independent of the reduced form of nicotinamide -adenine dinucleotide phosphate , indicating that 
they were not metabolized via CYP450 isozymes, but rather by a hydrolysis reaction.  D21 -2135 
was considered a minor metabolite in this testing system.  
The enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of edoxaban to D21 -2393 w ere characterized using 
pooled human liver microsomes, cytosolic, and recombinant human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1).  
The results demonstrated that edoxaban is metabolized to D21 -2393 in the li ver by [CONTACT_437664]1.  
The P -glycoprotein (P -gp)-mediated transcellular transport of edoxaban and inhibitory effects of 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] P -gp inhibitors on the vectorial transport of edoxaban were investigated using Caco -2 cell 
monolayers.  The results indicated that e doxaban is a substrate of the efflux transporter, P -gp.  
The uptake of 14C-edoxaban to S2 cells expressing transporter genes comprising human organic 
anion transporters (OAT) 1, OAT3, and human organic cation transporters (OCT) [ADDRESS_554620] the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
edoxaban for various pediatric age groups.  However, the ontogeny of all the enzymes and 
transporters is not very well characterized.  The kidneys are not fully mature a t birth.  The 
glomerular filtration rate in neonates is 4 mL/1.[ADDRESS_554621] year.  The glomerular filtration rate continues to increase and overshoot adult 
levels until prepubescent age, resulting in h igher renal clearance in children compared to adults.  
The tubular function also matures slowly and reaches adult levels by 1 year of age.2 
CYP3A4 has very low expression before birth, but increases rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], achieving 60% of adult 
levels between the ages of [ADDRESS_554622] both developmental 
differences as well as differences in expression and function in various organs.  
Edoxaban absorption is likely to be affected by [CONTACT_437665].  In neonates and at birth, the 
gastric pH values are close to neutral; within first [ADDRESS_554623] the absorption of drug.5 
The PK of edoxaban were investigated in rats and cynomolgus monkeys by [CONTACT_437666] 3 and 1 mg/kg of 14C-edoxaban (as edoxaban) to rats 
and monkeys, respectively.  Wide -spread distribution of radioactivity follow ing oral

Page 24 administration of 14C-edoxaban occurred in the rat (albino) with the highest concentrations found 
in the gastrointestinal and bladder contents, followed by [CONTACT_10521], preputial gland, liver, 
intestine, Harderian gland, pi[INVESTIGATOR_304], and nasal cavity.  In a tissue distribution study in 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_14922], binding of edoxaban -related material occurred in ocular tissue and pi[INVESTIGATOR_437637].  This suggests that edoxaban can bind to melanin.  In the monkey (pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194]), residual 
radioactivity at 336  hours was noted in the eyeball and skin, and trace amounts were present in 
the liver and kidney.  
Following oral administration of edoxaban, parent compound edoxaban was the predominant 
form found in monkey and rat plasma.  D21 -3231 was the major metabolite found  in rat plasma.  
Part of the D21 -3231 found in the plasma may be from hydrolysis of edoxaban after sample 
collection, as edoxaban is unstable in rat plasma.  The assessment of metabolites in the urine and 
feces of rats and monkeys administered 14C-edoxaban  by [CONTACT_5019] -pressure liquid chromatography 
radio -chromatograms, and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC -MS/MS) 
assays showed that edoxaban was excreted largely unchanged.  Edoxaban and its metabolites do 
not undergo conjugation prior to el imination.  A plasma metabolite (D21 -2393) found in humans 
was not detected radiometrically in rats and monkeys but trace amounts could be detected in 
excreta by [CONTACT_29864] -MS/MS.  Because D21 -[ADDRESS_554624] been conducted in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys with edoxaban dosing up to 52 weeks.  The data from these studies are 
described in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.[ADDRESS_554625] level (NOAEL) was estimated to be 5  mg/kg/day for 
males and females.  
Edoxaban did not show genotoxic potential in bacterial reverse mutagenic ass ays, but 
chromosomal (numerical) aberrations were noted in other in vitro studies after exposure to very 
high concentrations (at which the drug precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263]) of edoxaban.  Edoxaban did not show any 
genotoxic potential in bone marrow micronucleus tests in r ats and cynomolgus monkeys, liver 
micronucleus test in rats, and unscheduled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis in rat liver.  
Since there was no damage to chromosomes or DNA in these in vivo studies, edoxaban is not 
considered to have genotoxic risk.  
In a rat fertility and early embryonic development study, there were no effects on male or female 
reproduction or early embryonic development at edoxaban doses up to 1 ,000 mg/kg/day.  In an 
embryo -fetal development study in rats given 30, 100, and 300  mg/kg /day, vaginal hemorrhage 
in dams and increased post -implantation loss occurred at 300  mg/kg/day.  The NOAEL was 
estimated to be 100  mg/kg/day.

Page 25 In an embryo -fetal development study in rabbits given 60, 200, and 600 mg/kg/day, maternal 
toxicity (vaginal hemo rrhage, abortion, and death) and fetotoxicity (post -implantation loss and 
decreased fetal weight) occurred at 200 and 600 mg/kg/day.  There were also increases in absent 
or small gall bladder of the fetuses at  200 mg/kg/day and an increase in 13th full r ibs and 27th 
presacral vertebra at 600  mg/kg/day.  The NOAEL was estimated to be 60  mg/kg/day for dams, 
embryos, and fetuses.  
In the pre - and post -natal development study in rats  given 3, 10 , and 30 mg/kg/day , maternal 
toxicity (vaginal hemorrhage) and lower avoidance response rate in learning tests in the female 
offspring were observed on the first day of examination at 30  mg/kg/day, but not the second day 
of examination or in males .  The NOAEL was estimated to be 30  mg/kg/day for general toxicity 
in da ms and 10 mg/kg/day for reproduction in dams and the development of next generation.  
Photosafety and eye function studies were performed because edoxaban distributed to ocular and 
skin tissues and bound to melanin in pi[INVESTIGATOR_14922], as well as showed some absorption for light 
wavelengths greater than [ADDRESS_554626] in Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL/IU) and in an in vitro 
phototoxicity test in BALB/3T3 cells.  Edoxaban did not show  any phototoxic potential in either 
study.  In a [ADDRESS_554627] in male and female cynomolgus monkeys given 
150 mg/kg/day, edoxaban did not affect any eye function parameter.  
To assess the toxicity of the human -specific metabolite D21 -2393, a 14 -day repeated oral dose 
toxicity study in rats and in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were performed.  In the 14 -day 
oral dose toxicity study, male and female rats were given D21 -2393 at doses of 200, 600, and 
2,000 mg/kg/day and there was no treatm ent-related toxicity.  The NOAEL was estimated to be 
2,000 mg/kg/day for rats.  D21 -[ADDRESS_554628].  D21 -2393 induced numerical chromosomal aberrations in CHL/IU cells at 
high concentrations  (1,250 μg/mL or higher) but did not show any such aberrations in human 
lymphocytes.  Therefore, the observed polyploid induction in CHL/IU cells was not considered 
to be clinically relevant.  In addition, D21 -2393 did not show any genotoxic potential in t he bone 
marrow of rats given either a single dose or repeated doses up to 2 ,000 mg/kg/day in the 14 -day 
repeated oral dose toxicity study.  Based on these results, D21 -2393 is not considered to pose any 
genotoxic risk to humans.  In a juvenile toxicity stu dy in rats, e doxaban tosylate hydrate did not 
show any effects on  postnatal development and growth, organ development, skeletal 
development, or sexual maturation  at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  
An ex vivo study (TMCP -Peds -001) evaluated the concentration -coag ulation response 
relationship for edoxaban in neonatal (cord blood) and adult blood samples, using rivaroxaban as 
a positive control for establishing experimental conditions.  The range of edoxaban 
concentrations tested in this study was 12.5 to 500 ng/mL,  which spans the therapeutic range of 
edoxaban.  Edoxaban induced dose -dependent inhibition of all coagulation parameters 
(prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] , anti -FXa, Intrinsic factor 
X, and thrombin generation [TG]) ( Table  1.1).

1. Due to [ADDRESS_554629] blood.  The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of edoxaban in plasma from ex  vivo-treated 
cord blood were not significantly different from that in plasma from ex  vivo-treated adult blood 
for any parameter (see  Table  1.1).  Differences fell within ±  10% for aPTT, Intrinsic FX, and 
2 out of the 5 TG parameters and ± 23% of the remaining endpoints (PT and 3 TG parameters).  
Thus, anticoagulant effects of edoxaban are found to be similar between adult plasma and cord 
blood.  These results concurred with previously published findings with rivaroxaban.[ADDRESS_554630] blood.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Experience  
Edoxaban is currently marketed in Japan (since 22  April  2011) for prevention of venous 
thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients with lower extremity orthopedic surgery (total hip 
replacement, total knee replacement, and hip fracture surgery).  It was furthe r investigated 
worldwide in two Phase 3 clinical trials for reduction of stroke and systemic embolic events in 
patients with non -valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of acute VTE and prevention of 
recurrence in patients with symptomatic deep vein  thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.   
Edoxaban has recently been approved in the [LOCATION_002], European Union, and Japan for stroke 
and systemic embolism prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF), and for treatment of VTE.  In the 
European Union, edoxaban is also approved for the prevention VTE.  It is also approved in Japan 
for VTE prophylaxis following orthopedic surgery.  
In the Phase 3 trial in AF patients, DU176b -C-U301 ( ENGAGE  AF-TIMI 48), a total of 
21,105  patients  were randomized in the study.  Of th ese, 14,069  were randomized to edoxaban 
(7,034 to 30 mg once daily [qd] edoxaban; 7 ,035 to 60 mg qd edoxaban).  In the Phase 3 study in 
VTE patients, DU176b -D-U305 (Hokusai VTE), a total of 8 ,292 patients  were randomized in the 
study.  A total of 4 ,143 patients  were assigned to 60 mg qd edoxaban arm and 4 ,118 patients  
treated with edoxaban co mpleted the study  (8,250 patients completed the study ).  
Approximately, [ADDRESS_554631] been exposed to edoxaban in 45  completed Phase 1 
studies, as of 30 June 2012.  In healthy male patients , edoxaban was well tolerated with no 
evidence of major bleeding or clinically relevant liver function abnormality at repeated do ses up

Page 27 to 120 mg qd and 60 mg twice daily (bid) for [ADDRESS_554632] of edoxaban, minor, transient bleeding events were 
observed.  
In healthy adults, a 60  mg oral dose of edoxaban results in  peak concentrations of 
309 ± 97 ng/mL.  Peak concentrations are achieved within 1 to 2 hours ( Study A -U151 and 
Study A -U147).  The apparent terminal elimination half -life following oral administration is 
about 10 to 14 hours.  Following intravenous admini stration, the mean terminal elimination 
half-life was about 7 hours (Study A -U139).  The total clearance (arithmetic mean ± standard 
deviation [SD]) of edoxaban is estimated to be 21.8  ± 3.03 L/h with a steady -state volume of 
distribution of 107  ± 19.9 L ( Study  A-U139).  The absolute bioavailability of edoxaban is 
estimated to be about 62% (Study A -U139).  The PK profile of edoxaban is similar for single and 
multiple dosing.  Steady -state is achieved within 3 days of dosing, with minimal accumulation 
upon q d dosing (less than 2 -fold).  The mean accumulation ratio at steady -state for C max is 1.07 
and for area under the concentration -time curve over the dosing interval (AUC tau) (over 
24 hours), is 1.14 (Study A -U151).  At steady -state, a 60  mg dose results in peak concentrations 
of 303  ± 88 ng/mL at median (range) time to maximum concentration values of 1.5  hour 
(0.5, 4.00 hour).  The steady -state exposure (AUC tau) is 1 ,990 ± 403 ng.h/mL, with trough 
concentrations of 15.5  ± 3.98 ng/mL (Study A -U151).  
Edoxaban is the active moiety and is the predominant circulating drug -related moiety.  In healthy 
adults, edoxaban undergoes both Phase 1 and 2 metabolism.  Phase 1 metabolism is 
predominantly mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and CES1.  Metabolism by [CONTACT_63447]1 results in the formatio n 
of a human -specific metabolite D21 -2393, which accounts for less than 10% of total edoxaban 
exposure in healthy adults.  Phase 2 metabolism is mediated by [CONTACT_12075] (Study PRT019).  
Seven metabolites have been identified.  Three of the metabolites (D21 -2393, D21 -2135, and 
D21-1402) are pharmacologically active with anticoagulant activity (BG11 -H0026 -R01).  
However, due to low abundance (< 10% for D21 -2393 and < 5% for D21 -2135 and D21 -1402, 
each), the metabolites are not expected to contribute signi ficantly to overall pharmacological 
activity of edoxaban in adults.  
Edoxaban is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine and through biliary secretion; with 
metabolism contributing to a lesser extent towards total clearance of edoxaban.  In healthy 
voluntee rs, edoxaban is the predominant excreted component in urine, accounting for 24% of the 
administered dose.  In feces, it accounts for 49% of administered dose (Study PRT019).  In 
healthy volunteers, renal and nonrenal clearances contribute equally (approxim ately 50% each) 
to the total clearance of edoxaban.  The human -specific metabolite, D21 -2393, is not detected in 
urine and only about 2% is detected in feces ( A-U139  and PRT019 ). 
In drug interaction studies with P -gp inhibitors (erythromycin, ketoconazole,  cyclosporine, and 
verapamil), exposure of edoxaban increased, but the increase was generally less than 2 -fold. 
Other drug interaction studies with inhibitors of P -gp and/or other CYPs (quinidine, amiodarone, 
and dronedarone) also resulted in less than 2 -fold increase in edoxaban exposure.  
When edoxaban is dosed with a high -fat meal, there is no change in total exposure, but peak 
exposure increases by [CONTACT_2902] 40%.

Page 28 Concomitant administration of anti -platelet drugs (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [100 and 325 mg qd × 5 days] and 
naproxen [500 mg bid × 2 days]) was assessed by [CONTACT_437667].  
Edoxaban exposure was either not affected or minimally affected by [CONTACT_437668][INVESTIGATOR_437638].  In all 3 studies, bleeding times increased after administration of edoxa ban, but to a 
lesser extent than those observed with either of the anti -platelet agents alone.  Administration of 
edoxaban in combination with the anti -platelet agents resulted in longer bleeding times than 
observed for any of the drugs alone.  The inter -study comparisons of edoxaban coadministered 
with either 100 or 325  mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437639] -term studies.  Patients who received edoxaban and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 325 mg had more 
bleeding adverse ev ents (AEs) than those treated with edoxaban alone or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_264086].  
However, the data are limited and until there is further experience, the dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437640] 100 mg in the absence of a compelling 
indication  (e.g., acute myocardial infarction to reduce the risk of bleeding).  
Switching to edoxaban from other drugs has been studied in healthy adults.  Edoxaban can be 
initiated 12 hours after cessation of enoxaparin, dabigatran, or api[INVESTIGATOR_437635] (A -U136, 
A-U151, and A -E152) and 24 hours after cessation of warfarin or rivaroxaban therapy (C -U122 
and A -U151).  
The PD responses, specifically activated aPTT, PT, and anti -FXa activity, closely parallel the 
time course of plasma edoxaban concentrations.  On the basis  of these biomarkers and others 
measuring thrombin generation, the onset of action for the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban is 
observed immediately after the first dose and maximum activity corresponds with maximum 
concentration (C max). 
Clinical (90 mg) a nd supra -therapeutic (180 mg) doses of edoxaban had no effect upon QT cI 
interval in the thorough QT c study, which was confirmed to have adequate sensitivity based on 
the QT cI effect of the positive control (moxifloxacin 400 mg).  Moreover, QT cF and QT cB 
methods yielded the same conclusion.  Systemic exposure (as defined by C max and area under the 
concentration -time curve [AUC] parameters) to edoxaban and its metabolite D21 -2393 from the 
90 mg edoxaban dose was consistent with results from previous studies.  
Beriplex P/N, a 4 -factor prothrombin complex concentrate has been evaluated as a potential 
reversal agent in a study  in healthy volunteers .  In this study, bleeding duration (BD) 
prolongation after a punch biopsy was the primary end point.  Beriplex P/N do se­dependently 
reversed the effects of edoxaban on BD.  Complete reversal was observed following 50  IU/kg 
dose, partial reversal was observed following 25 IU/kg and no reversal was observed following 
10 IU/kg.   This treatment, however, has not been tested in patient populations with bleeding.  
Details of these and additional clinical studies are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.1 
1.2. Study Rationale  
Edoxaban is an orally active, selective, reversible FXa inhibitor that is being developed as an 
anticoagulant for the treatment of venous thromboembol ism including deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, and prevention of recurrent VTE.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study (C -U305) 
was completed in 2012.  This is the first stu dy in pediatric patients, ages 38 weeks gestation  to 
< 18 years, in which, the PK/PD p rofile of edoxaban will be evaluated following a single -dose 
administration of oral edoxaban.  The goal of this study is to identify pediatric doses that provide 
Protocol DU176b -A-U157  
Version 7.0, [ADDRESS_554633] effective in pediatric populations.  This study is designed to 
safely evalu ate exposures of a low - and high -dose in each pediatric cohort, in order to guide 
dosing in a Phase 3 study in pediatrics.  The ex  vivo study (TMCP -Peds -001) showed the 
anticoagulant effects of edoxaban are found to be similar between adult plasma and cord  blood.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a difference in the baseline activity of various biomarkers, the potency of drug effects 
was similar between adults and cord blood.  The current study is targeting to have similar  plasma 
exposure as in the adult Phase 3 VTE study with low (30 mg) and high exposure (60 mg).  For 
the younger age groups, it is planned to adjust the dose based on anticipated ontogeny 
differences and available data in the older pediatric age cohorts.  The starting dose for 
adolescents low -dose group was selected  on the basis of population PK modeling (PopPK) and 
simulations ( Figure  1.1).  The PopPK model was based on adult data (median age [range] 33 
[18 to 85] y ears; median body weight [range] 75.8 [42 to 165  kg]).  The basic structural model 
was a [ADDRESS_554634] -order absorption and lag time.  The simulation dataset 
consisted of 12  typi[INVESTIGATOR_437641] 12 to 18 years.  Body weight and heigh t estimates 
were from the 2000 CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Growth charts.7 
Creatinine clearance values were calculated using the Schwartz equation.8  A total of 
1,200 individuals were simulated.  A s imulated 30  mg dose appears to provide similar or slightly 
lower mean exposure in the adolescent population.

As described in [LOCATION_002] regulations, this study is considered to fall into Title  21 Code of 
Federal Regulation (CFR) Part  50.53 as “Research involving greater than minimal risk and no 
prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge 
about the subject's disorder or condition .” 
The goal of this study is to identify pediatric doses that provide comparable exposure to adult 
efficacio us doses in order to guide dose selection for Phase 3 studies in pediatrics.  
In pediatric patients  the proportion of children developi[INVESTIGATOR_437642] 3% in 
neonates to 8% in o lder children and as high as 21 % in children reported with a first idiopathic 
VTE.  The results of meta -analyses indicate that 11% of children with nonidiopathic thrombosis 
overall develop a second VTE.11  Hence, this study offers a platform by [CONTACT_437669] -idiopathic thrombosis or those with potential recurrence may be identified 
for future therapeutic care.   
In U157 study, the risk is considered as  minimal for patients  who already took anticoagulant  
therapy due to their health conditions.  U157 is a single dose study with a sequential enrolment 
(from older to younger) and with two tested doses (“low” dose to achieve exposures comparable 
to a 30 mg a dult dose and “high” dose to achieve exposures comparable to a 60 mg adult dose).  
U157 patients  are NOT healthy children; their health conditions already exposed them to 
procedures necessary to address their health problems related to thromboembolism.  In patients  
with no history of thromboembolic events, the risk is considered as a minor increase over 
minimal risk.  U157 risk was estimated based on experience with similar treatments and 
procedures in the pediatric population12 and from the well -known edoxaban effects in adults 
(Hokusai VTE Study).   U157 is a dose finding study with safety as a secondary objective .  The 
benefit to participate in U157 can be considered as direct for patients  with health conditions 
exposing them to occurrence and/or recurrence of a thromboembolic event.  
U157 study also presents a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or 
alleviation of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children with thromboembolic 
disease.  The data derived from this study could potentially ben efit pediatric patients when the 
study data is disclosed and becomes publically available or if it should lead to a possible update 
of the edoxaban label.   In addition, doses derived from this study will be implemented in Phase 3 
studies; in particular, patients  with diagnosed VTE or cardiac diseases that may predispose them 
to venous or arterial thromboembolism.  
The research will be conducted in accordance with sound ethical principles, and adequate 
provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the chil dren and the permission of their parents or 
legal guardians . 
The safety monitoring practices employed by [CONTACT_3181] (i.e., physical examinations, vital 
signs, AEs, and clinical laboratory assessments)  in addition to periodic data review by a Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  are considered adequate to protect the patients’ safety.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure1 for the summary of clinical experience including side 
effects associated with edoxaban treatment.

The study population will include p atients 38 weeks gestation  to < 18 years of age of both sexes , 
who may require , or are currently on  anticoagulant  therapy.   
These may include : 
 Patients who have a recently acquired or Investigator determined ongoing risk of 
thromboembolic events (e.g., patients with thrombophilia, congenital heart disease, 
presence of a central venous catheter and prior venous thromboembolic event [VTE]).  
 Patients who are completing their standard -of-care anticoagulant  therapy. Note : that 
the dose of edoxaban  should be at the time of the next scheduled standar d-of-care 
anticoagulant administration:  
 At least [ADDRESS_554635] dose of  unfractionated heparin . 
 At least [ADDRESS_554636] dose of bid  low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ). 
 At least  [ADDRESS_554637] dose of qd LMWH  and synthetic pentasaccharide  (SP) 
Xa inhibitors . 
 For patients who were on a prior vitamin K antagonist  (e.g., warfarin [C -U122] 
and any other anticoagulants)  therapy, international normalization ratio (INR) 
value should be  2.5 prior to edoxaban dosing.   If the patient’s INR is > 2. 5, the 
patient’s INR should be monitored until it is  2.5. 
 Patients who are currently treated for VTE with at least [ADDRESS_554638] -of-care anticoagulant therapy for edoxaban administration.  
The dose of edoxaban should be:  
 At least [ADDRESS_554639] dose of bid LMWH, with a restart of LMWH 24 hours 
after edoxaban dose . 
 At least [ADDRESS_554640] dose of qd LMWH, with a restart of LMWH 24  hours 
after edoxaban dose . 
 Patients with cardiac conditions  who may require anticoagulant  therapy . 
 Patients with sickle cell disease  who may require anticoagulant  therapy.    
For any condition, anticoagulant treatment interruption or discontinuation should not take place 
if the patient is at increased risk and shou ld be appropriate as per standard care of practices.  
The following dosage forms will be provided for this study:  
 Edoxaban 30  mg oral tablets  for patients 12 and < 18 years of age . 
 Edoxaban granules for oral suspension (60 mg reconstituted with 8-mL water)  to 
provide a 6 mg/mL suspension for oral administration  for patients <  12 years of age . 
In each age cohort, appropriated  doses will be selected to achieve exposures comparable to adult 
doses of 30 mg (low -dose) or 60 mg (high -dose).  If the observed exposure from the 30  mg dose 
in adolescents is higher than predicted and  is comparable to the 60  mg adult dose exposures, 
then, the next cohort will receive a lower dose, instead of a higher dose.  To allow for this

1.6.1.  Patient Confidentiality  
The Investigator and the Sponsor will preserve the confidentiality of all patients taking part i n 
the study, in accordance with GCP and local regulations.  
The Investigator must ensure that the patient’s anonymity is maintained.  On the Case Report 
Form (CRF) or other documents submitted to Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.  (DSI), patients should be 
identified by a unique patient identifier as designated by [CONTACT_1034].  Documents that are not for 
submission to DSI (e.g., signed Informed Consent Forms [ICF]) should be kept in strict 
confidence by [CONTACT_737].  
In compliance with federal regulations/ICH GCP Guid elines , it is required that the Investigator 
and institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), 
and the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) direct access 
to review the patient’s  original medical records for verification of study -related procedures and 
data.  The Investigator is obligated to inform the patient that his/her study -related records will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_31714] -named  representatives without violating the confidentiality of the patient.  
1.6.2.  Informed Consent Procedure  
Before a patient’s participation in the study, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain freely 
given consent and assent (generally, this age averages  at 7 years of age), in writing, from the 
patient or legally acceptable representative  after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific 
screening procedures or any st udy drugs are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is 
an individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 34 prospective patient, to the patient’s participation in the clinical study.   The written ICF should be  
prepared in the local language(s) of the potential patient population.  
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirements, and should adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The consent form and any revision(s) should be 
approved by [CONTACT_437670].  
The patient’s written informed consent should be obtained prior to his/her participat ion in the 
study, and should be documented in the patient’s medical records, as required by 21  CFR Part 
312.62.  The ICF should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_76409] a legally acceptable 
representative , and by [CONTACT_437671] (not 
necessarily the Investigator).  The original signed ICF should be retained in accordance with 
institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the patient or 
legal representative.  The date and ti me (if applicable) that informed consent was given should be 
recorded on the CRF.  
If the patient or legally acceptable representative  cannot read, then according to ICH GCP 
Guideline, Section 4.8.9, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed 
consent discussion.  This witness should sign the ICF after the patient or the legally acceptable 
representative has orally consented to the patient’s participation and, if possible, signed the ICF.  
By [CONTACT_12568], the witness attests that th e information in the ICF and any other written 
information was adequately explained to and apparently understood by [CONTACT_437672].  
Suggested model text for the ICF for the study and any applicable subparts (genomic, PK, etc .) 
and assent forms for pediatric patients (if applicable) are provided in the Sponsor ICF template 
for the Investigator to prepare the documents to be  used at his or her site.  Updates to applicable 
forms will be communicated via letter from the Clinical Study Manager.  
According to 21 CRF 50.55 subpart b it states, “In determining whether children are capable of 
providing assent, the IRB must take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of 
the children involved.  This judgment may be made for all children involved in clinical 
investigations under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate.”  In 
21 CRF 50.55 su bpart g it states, “When the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also 
determine whether and how assent must be documented.”  For this study, the IRB will determine 
the age that is appropriate for the assent.  Generally, this age averages at 7 y ears of age.  The IRB 
will also determine the verbiage that may be added, as well as ensure the document is written at a 
level understandable to the population who will be signing the assent.  The IRB may also require 
separate assent forms based on the age  groups (i .e., separate assent forms for patients 7 to 
12 years and for patients 1 3 to 17 years) to ensure the assents maintain their “maturit y levels and 
understandability.”

3.1. Overall Plan  
3.1.1.  Study Type  
This is a Phase 1, open -label, single -dose, non -randomized, multiple -center PK and PD study in 
pediatric patients.  The study will include 5 pediatric age cohorts with evaluation of 2 different 
doses within each age cohort (low - and high -dose).  
Age cohorts and dose groups:  
 12 to < 18 years of age on the day of dosing (12 evaluable total patients)  
 Cohort 1a: Low -dose group (6 patients)  
 Cohort 1b: High -dose group (6 patients)  
 6 to < 12 years of age on the day of dosing (12 evaluable total patients)  
 Cohort 2a: Low -dose group (6 patients)  
 Cohort 2b: High -dose group (6  patients)  
 2 to < 6 years of age on the day of dosing (12 evaluable total patients)  
 Cohort 3a: Low -dose group (6 patients)  
 Cohort 3b: High -dose group (6  patients)  
 6 months  to < 2 years of  age on the day of dosing (12 evaluable total patients)  
 Cohort 4a: Low -dose group (6 patients)  
 Cohort 4b: High -dose group (6  patients)  
 38 weeks gestation  to < 6 months of age on the day of dosing (12 evaluable total 
patients)  
 Cohort 5a: Low -dose group (6 p atients)  
 Cohort 5b: High -dose group (6  patients)  
A total of 60 patients will be enrolled such that 12  evaluable patients will be in each age cohort 
and 6 patients will be within each dose group.  Dropouts or patients  with unusable data (for 
reasons other t han AEs) may be replaced.

equivalent substitute liquid (but not frui t juices), will be allowed until [ADDRESS_554644] start in the lower dose group  (to achieve exposures comparable 
to a 30  mg adult dose) .  After evaluation of PK and safety data  from at least half the patients in 
the lower dose group, enrollment may then start in the higher dose group  (to achieve exposures 
comparable to a 60 mg adult dose) .  If the observed exposures are higher than expected in the 
lower dose group and exceed the  projected 60  mg adult exposure , then a lower dose may be  
investigated in the proposed “h igh-dose”  group.  Enrollment in the next younger age cohorts will 
begin when at least 50% of patient s have completed the study in the older age cohort .  
Enrollment in the younger age cohorts will start only after PK and safety data have been 
evaluated from at  least 6 patients (3 low -dose and 3 high -dose) in the older age cohort.   
Pharmacokinetic and safety data will be reviewed by a DSMB (see Section  11.9) who will 
approve the start of the next younger age cohort.  However, enrollment initiation of Cohort [ADDRESS_554645] 50% of patients in the preceding 
older dose group.  
In Cohort 1, the oldest age group  (12 to < 18 years), doses have been selected on the basis of 
modeling of adult data to target comparable exposures to 30 mg (low -dose) and 60  mg 
(high -dose).  In this cohort, fixed dosing will be used.  In  Cohorts 2, 3, 4, and 5, the younger age  
groups  (38 weeks gestation  to < 12 years) , appropriated  doses will be selected to elicit target 
exposures comparable to those achieved from adu lt doses of 30  mg (low-dose) or 60 mg 
(high -dose).  Patients in Cohort  1 will receive multiples of edoxaban tablets of 30 mg strength.  
Patients in Cohorts 2, 3, 4, and 5  will receive the edoxaban g ranule for oral suspension .  The 
dose that each dose group receives will be d etermined by [CONTACT_437673].  
Study duration will be approximately 4 weeks for each patient, which will include a screening 
period (within 21  days of dosing), a treatment period,  and a follow -up visit conducted within 
[ADDRESS_554646] of predose proce dures 
occurring on Day  -1 or 1, dosing on Day 1, and postdose procedur es occurring postdose on

Check -out procedures will be performed after the last PK/PD blood samples are collected  (Day 2 
or Day 3).  
An attempt will be made to have a balanced distribution of ages in each age cohort and dose 
group to provide maximum information regarding PK/PD and safety/tolerability.   
In each age cohort, appropriated  doses will be selected to target exposures comparable to adult 
doses of 30 mg (low -dose) or 60 mg (high -dose).  This will be done on an ongoing basis, 
whereby [CONTACT_437674] -time data from completed patients will be analyzed on an 
ongoing basis and used to predict the doses required to obtain targeted exposures in upcoming 
age cohorts and dose groups .  Additionally, this ongoing PK analysis will be used to refine and 
optimize the PK blood sampling scheme (number of samples and timing) in upcoming age 
cohorts and dose groups.  
Refer to the Schedule of Events (Appendix  17.7) and study procedures (Section 6). 
3.1.3.  Study Endpoints  
The PK endpoints will include modeled PK parameters such as apparent systemic clearance 
(CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F), and area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) for edoxaban and metabolites, and metabolite/parent ratios for AUC.  
The PD endpoints will include observed, change -from -baseline, and percent -change -from -
baseline PT, aPTT, and anti -FXa.  
Safety assessments will include: AEs, physical examinatio n findings, vital signs, standard 
hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis laborator y tests.  Note: urinalysis will be 
performed with plastic bags with a sticky strip from neonates and infants with diapers.  
Palatability of the liquid formulation will  be assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores.  
3.1.4.  Duration of the Study  
The first patient is expected to be enrolled in June 2014.  
3.1.5.  Duration of Patient Participation  
Approximately 4 weeks for each patient, which will include a screening period (within 21  days

4.2.1.  Reasons for Wi thdrawal/Early Discontinuation  
Any patient who discontinues from the study treatment for any reason will have their study 
treatment discontinuation recorded.   A patient  will be considered to have completed the study if 
they provide the last scheduled PK sa mple.  
Patients may be withdrawn from the study after signing informed consent for the following 
reasons:  
 AE. 
 Physician decision . 
 Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_716]:

 Legal guardian.  
 Protocol violation . 
 Death . 
 Pregnancy . 
 Termination of  all or part of the study by [CONTACT_1034] . 
 Other . 
If a patient withdraws from the study, the Investigator will complete and report the observations 
as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal including the date of treatment and the 
reason for wit hdrawal.  
If the patient is withdrawn due to an AE, the Investigator will follow the patient until the AE has 
resolved or stabilized.  
All patients who are withdrawn from the study should complete protocol -specified withdrawal 
procedures (Section 4.2.2 ). 
4.2.2.  Withdrawal Procedures  
While patients are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for  any reason without penalty.  Every effort will be made to determine 
why any patient withdraws from the study prematurely.  This information should be recorded.  
All patients who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE must be followed until the event 
is resolved or deemed stable.  If a patient withdraws prematurely after dosing, all data normally 
collected prior to study discharge should be collected at the time of premature discontinuation, or 
at the scheduled end -of-study visit.  A genuine effort must  be made to determine the reason(s) 
why a patient fails to return for the necessary visits.  If the patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a 
registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_27470].  
4.2.3.  Patient Re placement  
Dropouts (for reasons other than AEs) may be replaced, if deemed necessary, upon written 
approval by [CONTACT_1034].  A replacement patient will be within the same age cohort range and 
will receive the same dose and formulation of IP as the patient being replaced.  Any 
replacements will be made only after receiving the Sponsor’s written prior authorization.  
4.2.4.  Patient Re -screening  
Re-screening of patients that fail to meet the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria is allowed if the 
reason for failure to meet  the criteria has resolved and is no longer considered a risk to the 
patient  (e.g., temporal laboratory deviations meeting exclusion criteria, treatment with 
contraindicated medications, non -chronic diagnoses) . Re-screening of patients for this reason 
will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis and is dependent upon approval from the Medpace and 
Daiichi Sankyo Medical Monitors.  However, if a patient is screened but cannot dose for

Page 46 personal/logistic reasons within 21 days of screening , they will need to be re -screened .  The 
exception is, patients that were previously on warfarin therapy and need to be within the 
acceptable range of INR values .  This will not be considered rescreening, and only INR values 
will be monitored at subsequent testing to ensure that pr ior to edoxaban dosing, the patient meets 
inclusion with INR  2.5. 
Protocol DU176b -A-U157  
Version 7.0, [ADDRESS_554666] ensure that the IP will be used only in accordance with the protocol.  
According to ICH GCP 1.33, an IP is a pharmaceu tical form of an active ingredient or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study.  This includes products with marketing 
authorizations when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the 
approved form or when u sed for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further 
information about an approved use.  
The IP for this study is edoxaban (DU -176b) in any of the following formulations:  
 Edoxaban 30  mg oral tablets . 
 Edoxaban granules for oral suspension (60 mg re constituted  with water  to provide a 
6 mg/mL suspension for oral administration) . 
Edoxaban doses will be appropriated  to achieve exposures comparable to adult doses of 30 mg 
(low-dose) and 60 mg (high -dose).  Patients in the 12 to < 18 years of age cohort will receive 
multiples of edoxaban tablets of 30 mg s trength .  Patients <  [ADDRESS_554667] age cohort  (to 
achieve exposures comparable to a 30 mg adult dose) .  After evaluation of PK and safety data 
from at least half the patients in the lower dose group, enrollment will start in the higher dose 
group  (to achieve exposures comparable to a 60 mg adult dose) .  If the observed exposures are 
higher than expected in the lower dose gro up and exceed the projected 60 mg adult exposure 
then a lower dose may be inv estigated in the proposed “h igh-dose”  group.   Enrollment in the 
next younger age cohorts will begin when PK and safety data from at least 50% (N  = 6) of 
patient s in the preceding older dose group have been reviewed.  Pharmacokinetic and safety data 
will be reviewed by a DSMB (see Section  11.9) who will approve the start of the next younger 
age cohort.  However, enrollment initiation of Cohort [ADDRESS_554668] 50% of patients in the preced ing older dose group.  An attempt will be 
made to enroll patient s spanning the entire age range for each age cohort.  
5.1.2.  Method of Assessing Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance.  The single dose of IP 
should be administered under the supervision of clinical study personnel.  For patients receiving 
the tablet formulation, a mouth and hand check of all patients should be carried out to ensure that 
all tablets have been swallowed, if applicable.  For patients  receiving the liquid oral suspension 
the clinic personnel will check and record whether any of the liquid is spit out or lost to drooling.

6.3. Treatment Period  
6.3.1.  Check -in and Treatment  
The following procedure s apply to check -in and treatment, as appropriate.   
Patients will be asked to fast for  at least  4 hours before dosing  and for an additional  2 hours after 
dosing .  If this is not feasible because of the patient’s age or other needs, (unflavored) milk, or an  
equivalent substitute liquid (but not fruit juices), will be allowed until 1 hour before  dosing  and 
starting at 1 hour postdose.   During this period, the total volume of liquids should not exceed 
240 mL, excluding the volume of water utilized for dosing.  
6.3.2.  Check -in (Day -1/1 Predose)  
Check -in is scheduled for Day -1; however, check -in may also occur on Day 1 prior to dosing at 
the clinic’s discretion.   Patients may be confined from time of check -in until after the last 
assessment is made on Day 2  (or Day 3 f or patients enrolled prior to Version  5.0 of the protocol ); 
however,  overnight stays are not required.  
The following activities and/or assessments will be performed at/during check -in: 
 Reassessment of eligibility . 
 Medical and surgical history, including medication history . 
 Physical examination, including height, weight, and BMI (derived) . 
 Pregnancy test based on local practice (for post -menarchal females) .

9.1. Adverse Events  
All clinical AEs occurring after the patient (or parent/guardian) signs the ICF and through the 
follow -up visit (up to [ADDRESS_554691] dose) , whether observed by [CONTACT_437690]’s parent/ guardian, will be recorded on the AE CRF page.  
Medical conditions (including laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that were 
diagnosed or known to exist prior to informed consent will be recorded as part of medical 
history.  All SAEs are to be reported according to the procedures in Section 9.[ADDRESS_554692] be reported as the SAE (diagnosis or 
symptom requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  A procedure is not an AE or SAE, but the reason for the 
procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre -planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or 
treatments requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_437650] -existing conditions which do not worsen in severity 
should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  9.3.2  for definitions).  For deaths, the un derlying or 
immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  In addition, any serious, 
untoward event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the Investigator assesses 
as related to study drug should also be reported and manage d as an SAE.  
Each day the Investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by [CONTACT_25040].  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_102] (or 
parent/guardian) or by [CONTACT_31597].  Patients should be questioned 
in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  All laboratory 
values must be appraised by [CONTACT_350071].  All abnormal laboratory 
values considered clini cally significant by [CONTACT_437691], and if serious, reported as an SAE following the procedures in Section 9.4. 
The Investigator should follow patients with AEs until the event has resolved or the condition 
has stabilized.  In case of unresolved AEs including significant abnormal laboratory values at the 
end of study assessment, these events will be followed up until resolution or until they become 
clinically not relevant.

9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical pro duct and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
Protocol DU176b -A-U157  
Version 7.0, 16  Sep 2019 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 63 sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product (ICH E2A Guideline.  Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
It is the responsibility of Investigators, based on their knowledge and experience, to determine 
those circumstances or abnormal lab findings which should be considered AEs.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers  to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A Guideline.  Clinical 
Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standar ds for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result i n death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467].  Examples 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, or development of drug 
depend ency or drug abuse.  
Note:  
 A procedure is not an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or 
SAE.  
 Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or treatment requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643] -existing conditions which do not worsen in se verity are not 
SAEs.  
9.3.3.  Adverse Event Severity  
The following definitions should be used to assess intensity of AEs:  
 Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated, i .e., does not interfere with 
patient’s usual function.  
 Moderate: Discomfort enough t o cause interference with usual activity.  
Protocol DU176b -A-U157  
Version 7.0, 16  Sep 2019 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 64  Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity, i .e., interferes 
significantly with patient’s usual function.  
9.3.4.  Causality Assessment  
The Investigator should assess causal relationship between an AE and the IP on the basis or 
his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions.  The causality assessment should be 
made based on the available information and can be updated as new information becomes 
available.  
 1 = Related:  
 The AE follows a reason able temporal sequence from study drug administration 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other factors 
(e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications).  
 The AE follows a reasonable temporal se quence from study drug administration 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its chemical group or  is 
predicted by [CONTACT_25046].  
 2 = Not Related:  
 The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study product administration 
or can be rea sonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other factors (e .g., 
disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications).  
9.3.5.  Action Taken Regarding the Study Product  
 1 = Dose Not Changed: No change in study drug dosage was made.  
 2 = Dr ug Withdrawn: The study product was permanently stopped.  
 3 = Dose Reduced: The dosage of study product was reduced.  
 4 = Drug Interrupted: The study product was temporarily stopped.  
 5 = Dose Increased: The dosage of study product was increased.  
9.3.6.  Adverse Even t Outcome  
 1 = Recovered/Resolved  
 The patient fully recovered from the AE with no residual effect observed.  
 2 = Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
 The residual effects of the AE are still present and observable.  
 Include sequelae/residual effects.  
 3 = Not Reco vered/Not Resolved  
 The AE itself is still present and observable.  
 4 = Fatal  
 5 = Unknown

Page 66 9.4.3.  Notifying Regulatory Authorities, Investigators, and IRB/IEC  
Daiichi Sankyo and/or Medpace  will inform Investigators, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory authorities 
of any Suspected Unexpected SAE Reactions (S [LOCATION_003]Rs) occurring in other clinics or other 
Daiichi Sankyo studies of the IP, as appropriate per local reporting requirements.  
In the [LOCATION_002], upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that occurred with the 
IP, unless delegated to the Spon sor, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to inform the IRB per 
Sponsor’s instruction.  
In the European Economic Area states, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to all 
IECs.  
The Reference Safety Information for the study is found in Sect ion 6.11 of the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
9.5. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Studies  
Daiichi Sankyo must be notified of any patient who becomes pregnant while receiving the IP or 
during the follow -up period.  
Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all p regnancies must be followed to conclusion to 
determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety and public health 
concerns.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator, or designee, to report any pregnancy in a 
female patient us ing the Exposure In Utero (EIU) Reporting form.  Please make sure the patient 
does not receive any study drug after learning of the pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_437692] a pregnancy.  The Investigator s hould make 
every effort to follow the patient until completion of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i .e., post -partum 
complications, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including 
that in an aborted fetus), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs 
outlined in Section 9.4. 
9.6. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood samples for the following hematology tests will be taken at screening  (if not performed 
within 2 weeks prior to screening)  and at the fi nal follow -up visit  (or early termination).  Blood 
samples for the following serum chemistry tests will be taken at screening (if not performed 
within 2 weeks prior to screening)  for all cohorts,  and at the final follow -up visit (or early 
termination)  for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3. Cohorts [ADDRESS_554693] serum chemistry performed at 
the final follow -up (or early termination) visit.  (See Appendix  Section  17.7). 
 Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count (with indices), 
reticulocyte count, white blood cell (WBC) count (with di fferential), and platelet 
count  
 Serum chemistry: sodium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, chloride, calcium , 
AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, 
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, uric acid, creatine kinase, total  
cholesterol, and triglycerides

RBC, WBC, bilirubin, and urobilinogen at screening and check -in. Microscopic analysis is 
required if dipstick is positive for blood, RB C, or WBC.  
At screening only, blood will be collected for hematology and s erum chemistry (if not performed 
within 2 weeks prior to screening ) to include blood volume for HIV and hepatitis B and C 
testing.  A pregnancy test (based on local practice)  will be performed at screening and at 
check -in (Day -1/1 predose) for all female patients who have had menarche.  At screening, urine 
samples will also be used to check for the presence of the following controlled substances: 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, phencyclidine, 
cotinine  levels (no n-exclusionary) , and alcohol.  
Coagulation tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) will be collected in citrated blood collection tubes during 
screening and at the follow -up visit.  Blood samples will be treated for PT, INR, and aPTT 
estimation as per the SOPs of the loc al or central laboratory.  
The blood volume for all scheduled clinical laboratory assessments will not exceed the 
guidelines for pediatrics research for each age cohort.[ADDRESS_554694] not exceed 1% of total 
blood volume at any time, 3% during 4 weeks.   
9.7. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) will be monitored at screening, at 
check -in (Day -1/Day 1 predose), Day  1 (and Day 3 for patients enrolled prior to Version 5.0 of 
the protocol ) postdose , and at the final follow -up visit (or early termination).  Heart rate and 
blood pressure will be measured after an at least [ADDRESS_554695] in a  sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
The position in which the vital signs are measured will be recorded in the patients’ CRF.  
9.8. Electrocardiograms  
Not applicable.  
9.9. Physical Findings  
A complete physical examination will be performed on each patient at screening, at  check -in 
(Day -1/Day 1 predose),  on Day 3 (for patients enrolled prior to Version 5.0 of the protocol ), and 
during the follow -up visit. 
Body height and weight will be measured for all patients during the physical examinations to 
determine BMI.

Formulation Palatability  
Patients receiving the edoxaban granule for oral suspension formulation who are 
developmentally capable of providing an accurate response will be asked to rate several aspects 
of palatability (including bitterness, sweetness, overall taste, and a roma) using [ADDRESS_554696] liked the 
flavor, etc.  
VAS and text responses will be measured and/or reco rded on the CRF.  Refer to Appendix  17.[ADDRESS_554697] 1 postdose PK measurement with known collection times and date/time of dose 
administration and who do not have any clinically significant events or protocol deviations that 
may have com promised the integrity of the PK results.  
11.1.2.  Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set  
The PD analysis set will comprise all patients who receive edoxaban as per protocol and have at 
least 1 postdose PD measurement with known collection time and date/time of dose 
administ ration and who do not have any clinically significant events or protocol deviations that 
may have compromised the integrity of the PD results.  
11.1.3.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will include all patients who received edoxaban.  
11.2. General Statistical Considerations  
Complete details of the planned statistical analyses will be included in a separate Statistical 
Analysis Plan .  The analyses for this study will be considered descriptive and exploratory.  No 
visit windows will be used for analysis.  
In gener al, all data will be summarized by [CONTACT_437693], and all evaluable data will 
be included in the analyses.  For qualitative variables, the population size (N for sample size and 
n for available data) and the percentage/incidence (of available d ata) for each class of the 
variable will be presented.  Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, 
including the population size (N for sample size and n for available data), mean, SD, coefficient

11.5.1.  Pharmacokinetic  Analyses  
Plasma c oncentration -time data for edoxaban and metabolites (if data are available ) will be listed 
by [CONTACT_4676], age cohort and/or dose group, and measurement time interval, and will be plotted and 
summarized using descriptive statistics, as appropriate.  
Plasma concentration -time data for edoxaban and metabolites will be analyzed using 
model -based approaches such as nonlinear mixed effects modeling, where data from other 
studies may be pooled with pediatric data , and PK parameters will be calc ulated .  The goal of 
this approach will be to estimate PK parameters such as CL/F and V/F in pediatric patients.  
Derived PK parameters such as AUC and metabolite -to-parent ratios (if data permit) for AUC 
will also be estimated.  Estimated PK parameters wi ll be assessed for age dependencies using 
graphical and/or modeling methods.  Estimated PK parameters will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_437661]/or dose group using descriptive statistics.  
An exploratory analysis of variance model will be applied to n atural log -transformed CL/F, V/F, 
and AUC with age cohort, dose, and age cohort by [CONTACT_437694].  Appropriate 
adjustments on parameters, e .g., dose -normalization on AUC, or body weight -normalization on 
CL/F and V/F, mig ht also be explo red.  The least -squares mean differences between age cohorts 
with age cohort of 12  to < 18 years as the reference and the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals ( CIs) will be exponentiated to obtain point estimates of ratios of geometric means and 
the corr esponding 95% CIs by [CONTACT_189564]/or overall (as appropriate).  
11.5.2.  Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
For PD biomarkers (PT, aPTT, and anti -FXa), observed, change -from -baseline, and percent -
change -from -baseline data will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], age cohort and/or dose gr oup, and 
measurement time interval, and will be plotted and summarized using descriptive statistics, as 
appropriate.  
The PK/PD relationships will be examined graphically to assess age dependencies.  Additional 
PK/PD modeling may be conducted, if necessary,  to understand age dependencies.  
11.6. Safety Analyses  
All analyses involving safety data (physical examination, vital signs, AEs, clinical laboratory 
tests [hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis]) will be based on the safety analysis set.  
11.6.1.  Adverse Event An alyses  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
coding dictionary (latest version).  All AEs, including SAEs, will be mapped to system organ 
class and preferred term and will be listed in the data listing .  A TEAE is defined as an AE that 
emerges during treatment, having been absent pretreatment, or worsening relative to the 
pretreatment state.  The number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs will be tabulated for 
the safety analysis set by [CONTACT_437695] a breakdown by 
[CONTACT_2715], and further by [CONTACT_437696], and by [CONTACT_926].  Listings of death 
events, SAEs, and AEs that lead to discontinuation of a patient will be presented.  
Protocol DU176b -A-U157  
Version 7.0, [ADDRESS_554698] -baseline assessment will be summarized for the 
safety analysis set by [CONTACT_2715].  Patients with abnor mal values will be noted in the data listings.  
11.6.3.  Vital Sign Analyses  
Vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics for baseline, each study evaluation, 
and change from baseline to each evaluation.  Listings of all vital sign data will be provid ed. 
11.6.4.  Physical Finding Analyses  
Results of physical examinations conducted throughout the study will be presented in listings.  
Patients with clinically significant abnormal findings will be noted in the data listings.  
11.7. Other Analyses  
11.7.1.  Palatability Analyses  
The VAS scores for palatability will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_437661]/or dose group 
using descriptive statistics, if data permit.  
11.8. Interim Analyses  
Emerging PK concentration -time data from completing patients will be analyzed using 
model -based appro aches on an ongoing basis and used to predict and optimize the doses required 
to obtain targeted exposures in upcoming age cohorts and dose groups.  Additionally, this 
ongoing PK analysis will be used to refine and optimize the PK blood sampling scheme (nu mber 
of samples and timing) in upcoming age cohorts and dose groups.  
11.9. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent DSMB  consisting of a panel of clinicians or therapeutic area experts will be 
convened to provide independent review to assure that patient safety and integrity of the trial are 
being upheld. Responsibilities of the DSMB are set forth in the DSMB Charter.  
11.10.  Sample Size Determination  
A total of 60 patients will be enrolled, 12 evaluable  per age cohort.  Based on the assumptions of 
the inter -patie nt CV of 10.8% and 29.3% for CL/F and V/F respectively10, and the ratio of a 
younger age cohort to the reference age cohort (12  to < 18 years) to be  1, a sample size of 
12 evaluable  per age cohort would provide >  95% power to assess that the 95% CI for cohort to 
reference cohort ratio is contained within the 60 % to 140% range for CL/F.  This sample size 
would provide  about 76% power for the assessment on V/F.   If emerging data suggest that the 
variability is much larger than anticipated, sample size may be increased.

A blood volume not to exceed the guidelines for pediatrics research for each age cohort9 will be 
taken from specified patients at the times detailed in Section  Section  8. Blood loss must not 
exceed 1% of total blood volume at any time, 3%  during 4 weeks.  Blood sampling from patients 
for bioanalytical assessment will use the local methods appropriate for the patient’s age to 
minimize associated blood volume, invasiveness, and pain .  
 If 1.0 to 2.0 mL of blood, in accordance to volume guidanc e described above, can be 
collected for the specified time points, the following procedures can be applied:  
blood samples will be collected into pre-chilled 2 mL polyethylene Vacutainer tubes 
containing lithium heparin  as anticoagulant for the preparation  of plasma.  
 For Cohorts [ADDRESS_554709]-addition of any solution to the blood collection tube (which may affect 
the volume of harvested plasma).  Recommended devices, and collection proced ures, 
are described in lab manual.  
The tube containing blood for plasma preparation will be gently inverted multiple times ( 8) to 
ensure thorough mixing of anticoagulant (lithium heparin) and blood, then placed in a cool box 
containing ice/water mixture .  The samples should be centrifuged within 45  minutes of 
collection, at approximately 1 ,500 g for approximately 10 minutes.  Immediately following 
centrifugation, the separated plasma should be pi[INVESTIGATOR_311070]  (be careful not to touch the bottom layer),

 If more than approximately 0.3 mL of plasma is harvested, the plasma will be divided 
approximately equally into  2 polypropylene cryogenic sample storage vials 
(designated Aliquot 1 and 2) with screw -cap. The sample storage vial volume should 
not exceed 2.0 mL.  Each storage vial should contain more than 100 µL of plasma.  
 For Cohorts 1 to 3,  if less than approximately 0.3 mL of plasma is harvested, then the 
plasma will be transferred into 1 polypropylene cryo genic sample storage vial

Blood samples (volumes not to exceed the guidelines for pediatrics research for each age 
cohort9) will be collected in sodium citrated blood collection tubes from specified patients at the 
times detailed in Section  8.  Blood loss must not exceed 1% of total blood volume at any time, 
3% during 4 weeks. Blood sampling from patients for PD assessment will use the  local methods 
appropriate for the patient’s age to minimize associated blood volume, invasiveness, and pain.   
For any blood draw, an adequate volume of waste will need to be drawn to clear all tubing of 
tissue debris or possible contaminants (i.e., hepari n) as this may impact analyses. All waste may 
be returned to the patient per local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310]. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for 
additional details.  
Immediately after the collection, the samples will be mixed by [CONTACT_5237] 8 or more  times 
and subsequently within 30 minute s of collection centrifuged at 1 ,500  g for 15  minutes.  
Samples will then be kept on ice, and the resulting platelet poor plasma (being careful not to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_437656])  will then be divided into 3  aliquots (if possible) and transferred to 
clean screw -topped suitably labeled transfer tubes (cryo vials) as follows:  
Aliquots 1 and 2: approximately 0. 35 mL per tube  
Aliquot 3: Remainder  of the plasma sample into the third tube  
Note – the volumes and the aliquoting scheme might need to be adjusted for each age cohort .

Rifamin is a P -gp inducer that has been shown to lower the edoxaban exposure. The example 
medications listed below (but not limited to) have not been tested with edoxaban but are also 
P-gp inducers. These should be avoided during the study as their use may lead to a lower 
exposure of edoxaban than predicted for clinical efficacy.

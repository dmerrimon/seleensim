ACR -US-MCU-[ADDRESS_7321] results can be measured on the basis of color 
changes. Other methods of urinalysis include  light microscopy  (1). 
An Albumin -Creatinine  Ratio (ACR) urine test strip is a basic  diagnostic  tool used to determine 
pathologi cal changes in a patient’s urine  in standard  urinalysis . A standard ACR urine test strip usually 
contains two different chemical pads or  reagents  which  react  (change color) when immersed in, and then 
removed from, a  urine sample . The test can often be read after [ADDRESS_7322] chronic 
kidney diseases.  A properly -functioning kidney will permit extremely small amounts of Albumin to  
pass into urine, and thus even a minute presence – defined as a quantity greater than 30 mg/L – is a sign 
of a diseased or distressed kidney.  Creatinine is a by[CONTACT_8096] a constant rate; its level in urine is  an indication of urine concentration.  The Albumin -to-
Creatinine Ratio measurement is a widespread and effective screen for the early stages of CKD1, in most 
instances appearing before the reduction in the esti mated glomerular filtration rate (or eGFR, wh ich 
requires a blood test).  
ACR urine test strips can be used in many areas of the healthcare chain including screening for routine 
examinations, treatment monitoring, self -monitoring by [CONTACT_8097]/or general preventive medicine. 
The ACR urine test is an  effective measurement to identify patients with early stages of Chronic Kidney 
Disease (CKD), when patients are often asymptomatic, which can reduce the risks of cardiovascular 
disease, End -Stage Renal Failure (ESRF), and death that are the hallmarks of a  malfunctioning kidney. 
According to the Henry Ford Health System , only 5% of the general Medicare population undergoes a

ACR -US-MCU-[ADDRESS_7323] 02, 2020                                          6 
 screening urinalysis, while only 2% of high -risk subjects screened through a National Kid ney 
Foundation initiative self -reported a his tory of kidney disease.2 
Healthy.io has developed the ACR | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System  (ACR | U.S.). The ACR | U.S. is a 
semi -quantitative, prescription -based, in vitro diagnostic (IVD) home use device f or the measurement  of 
the ratio between albumi n to creatinine in a urine sample using a single -wrapped ACR urine reagent 
strip (microalbumin/creatinine).   
Automatic analysis of urine test strips using automated urine test strip analyzers is a well -establi shed 
practice in modern day urinalysis. It gua rantees rapid, standardized measurement and immediate reliable 
documentation of the result. Most of these urine analyzers are based on the technology of reflectance 
photometry while additional technologies such  as microscopy or flow cytometry exist (perfor med 
directly on the urine specimen).  
The basic elements of the reflectance photometry are based on the analysis of the intensity and color of 
light reflected from the reagent areas on a urinalysis test strip. M ost of the automated urine analyzers are 
speci fically intended for lab environments and are operated by [CONTACT_8098]. In recent years, 
following the tremendous development in communication media (especially with mobile media) there is 
a shift from "i n-clinic" testing to the home -use self -testing . This trend enables manufacturers to develop 
cost effective, reliable, easy -to-use, self -monitoring test methods, including urinalysis methods.  
Healthy.io Ltd. employs computer vision technology to turn smart phones into clinical -grade diagnostic 
devices.  Previously, the company developed a smartphone application containing image recognition 
software that enables users to remotely and independently perform a urinalysis test, the DIP | U.S. 
(510(k) clearance num ber: K173327)3. The DIP | U.S. device is a pre scription, home -use device 
intended for the analysis of six urine analytes. The company also developed a point of care, prescription -
only, professional -use smartphone application to test for microalbuminuria, the ACR | LAB device 
(510(k) clearance number: K182384)4. Building off this experience, Healthy.io developed the ACR | 
U.S. to test for the Albumin -Creatinine Ratio. Further details on the device components and 
functionality are describe d in the device description section below.

 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
1.2. Gene ral 
The ACR | U.S. is a prescription, in -vitro diagnostic, home -use device for the semi -quantitative 
measurement of the Albumin -Creatinine Ratio. The device comprises a kit with a urine rece ptacle, an 
ACR urine test strip, an absorbing pad, a Color -Board a nd a user manual. The device also consists of an 
easy-to-use smartphone application and image recognition algorithm.  
The ACR | U.S., while also a photometric based device, employs a computer  vision technique,  executed 
on various hardware platforms, in an u ncontrolled lighting environment, used by [CONTACT_8099]. The 
test has no pre -calibration step. The calibration and test are executed simultaneously during each test 
individually. This is  executed via a Color -Board, which is part of the user kit. Perfor ming test 
calibration eliminates lighting variances & camera disruptions and delivers a semi -quantitative 
measurement.  
The kit consists of five elements, which have been designed for easy us age in a home setting;  
1. Urine receptacle  
2. ACR urine test strip  
3. Abso rbing pad  
4. Color -Board  
5. User manual  
 
1.3. System  components  
• Urine receptacle  
The urine receptacle is comprised of a plastic cup which holds the subject's urine. It is designed to hold a 
sufficient amount of urine and allow for easy immersion of the test strip.

•                   Absorbing pad  
A single pi[INVESTIGATOR_8069]. It is designated to assist in absorbing remaining liquids 
from the strip after it has b een immersed in the urine sample.  
 
• Color -Board  
A cardboard -based, high -quality printed Color -Board facilitates the image recognition process. Its main 
functions are:  
o Proper positioning of the urine strip in the frame.  
o Neutralization of the surrounding lig hting and/or camera interruptions.  
o Providing a reference color spectrum for the strip reagent colors based on a data algorithm.

 • Smartphone app  
The smartphone application (supported by [CONTACT_8100] 11 device running iOS 13 and Google Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] 3a 
running OS 10) is designed to enable the following:  
o Device interface instructions for the user to ensure proper performance of the urinalysis test, 
avoiding key human errors. These include interactive video texts and sound instruction t o guide the 
users through the testing procedure.  
o The software includes an augmented reality layer on the smartphone camera which guides users 
while taking the scan. This is a real -time analysis of the scan, which finds and centers the Color -Board 
within t he camera frame. The software will also analyze the scan and evaluate if  it meets the system  
boundary conditions for urinalysis measurement. If not, the software will instruct the user to take 
another scan which can be analyzed.  
o Presentation of urinalysis measurement result to a clinician  for viewing and interpretation.  
• Software  
The ACR | U.S. smartphone algorithm is a cloud -based, image -processing system . Both albumin and 
creatinine analytes are analyzed based on a separate, unique set of eight target col ors and a set of 
calculations whic h are completely independent from each other.  Once these two measurements are 
taken, the algorithm on the cloud will use these two numbers to calculate the subsequent Albumin -
Creatinine Ratio, which is measured in units o f mg/g or mg/mmol.  
1.4. Intended Use  
The ACR | U.S. Urine Analysis Test System  is an in -vitro diagnostic, home -use device for the semi -
quantitative measurement of the Albumin -Creatinine Ratio (ACR). The device consists of a smartphone 
application, proprietary Color -Board and an ACR reagent str ip. The device is available for prescription -
use only. Results are intended to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation as an aid in the 
assessment of kidney function.

No. of strip lots  [ADDRESS_7333] results are compared to the results obtained by [CONTACT_8109]. The method comparison and usability studies provide data on 
the accuracy and usability of the device, including the lay  user's ability t o understand and implement the 
user manual instructions and evaluate the ease of use of the device under actual use conditions (home 
environment). Moreover, the study provides valuable data originating from unhealthy subjects using 
mostly their real urine samples and  can strengthen the results of the bench analytical tests. The urine 
samples should be sourced from pathological subjects simulating the "realistic clinical environment" or 
from healthy subjects, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8075].  
         
The ACR | U.S. method comparison study should include similar elements and be designed similarly to 
previously tested urinalysis analyzers. The study design is meant to demonstrate that the ACR | U.S. 
may be easily  used by a lay person and the results are in agreement with another legally marketed urine 
analyzer device.  
 
4. OBJECTIVES  
The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy and usability performance of ACR | U.S. in the hands of 
the potential lay user.  
4.1. Primar y Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the % exact match (agreement) and the % ±1 block 
match (agreement) of ACR | U.S. (tested by [CONTACT_8094]) compared to the URiSCAN Optima Urine 
Analyzer (the comparator device, tested by a healt hcare professional), for each tested conce ntration 
(block) .

ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7335] 02, 2020                                           17 
 5.3. Exclu sion criteria  
● Subject has dementia.  
● Subject has severe mental disorders.  
● Subject cannot collect urine in a receptacle.  
● Subject is visually impaired (cannot read the user manual).  
● Any additional reason the study physician believes disqualifies the subject from participating in the 
study.  
6. STUDY DESIGN   
The Method Comparison Test is a clinical study using actual human urine samples that will be 
collected in a lab -based hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8076].  These include urine samples from diseased 
subjects (e.g. patient s with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension), as well as from 
patients who are undergoing routine physical examinations.  
6.1. Framework:  
● At least 250 patients will be recruited to participate  
● Up to 15% of the samples may be spi[INVESTIGATOR_8077]  
● Multiple sites  
● 2 mobile phones: iPhone 11 and Google Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] 3a (per subject)  
● 3 strip lots which will  be used interchangeably throughout the experiment  
 
6.2. Population:  The study is a compar ative, controlled  trial of subjects who will be recruited from a 
research clinic. The study population will consist of patients with a medical history of diabetes Type I, 
Type II, Hypertension, kidney disease and other ailments that represent the target po pulation for urin e 
testing or healthy patients. The intention is to recruit subjects with ailments that will cover all test 
analytes and all concentrations of these analytes. In the case that analytes  and concentrations will not be 
covered by [CONTACT_8111], the study w ill be supplemented with spi[INVESTIGATOR_8078]. However, the number of spi[INVESTIGATOR_8079] 15% of the total 
samples (all bins combined). Lay users will test their own urine with both s martphones and ad ditionally 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7336] another spi[INVESTIGATOR_8080], that will be provided by [CONTACT_8112].  
6.3. Testing Methods:  Subjects will be recruited for the clinical trials based on their ability to 
provi de a urine sample  and comfortably complete tasks using a smartphone. Each urine sample should 
be tested by a lay user on the ACR | U.S. app, and then transferred to a professional user to conduct the 
test on the Optima  device. The professional user wil l be blinded to t he results of the lay user until after 
they have completed the test using the Optima device.  
6.4.      Timing:  Collection of a urine sample is performed by [CONTACT_8113]. 
Within 15 minutes from the time of patient ’s test, testing on the  comparator analyzer should be done.  
This is to best simulate the real -case usage of the ACR | U.S. test. The specimen should not be 
centrifuged or refrigerated in between tests.  
6.5. Analyzers:  Each urine sample will be tested using the i Phone 11 and Google Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] 3a devices 
running the ACR | U.S. application . Each test will be compared to the URiSCAN Optima Analyzer, the 
comparator device.  
6.6. Reagent Strips:  To control for bias among the test strips, three lots of reagent strips will be used  
durin g the study. To enable an equal and unbiased distribution of the lots, one lot will be randomly 
selected by [CONTACT_8114]. Separate strips will be used in each test: 
with the ACR | U.S. and the Optima analyzer . 
6.7. Requir ements : The Method Comparison Study must be conducted in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), according to 21 CFR Part 50, 54, 56, 812, ISO14155 -1/2 and relevant local and 
national regulations (IRB or Helsinki EC approved). The Method Compar ison S tudy shall comply with 
CLSI EP09c: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guidelines – 
Third Edition . Since the ACR | U.S. is classified as a urinalysis analyzer intended for lay users to test 
their urine in a home envi ronmen t, the design of the device clinical comparative study should include 
parameters from both lab urinalysis analyzers and urine strip method comparison studies. The study 
design is mainly based on the above -mentioned method comparison studies in sectio n 3.2 when used by 
a lay user and FDA recognized consensus standards CLSI EP09c and for usability testing of medical 
devices - ANSI/AAMI/IEC [ZIP_CODE] -1:2015 Medical devices – Part 1: Application of usability engineering

 7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1. Study Procedures  
The study consists of 5 stages, including the familiarization period and the screening, pre -study and 
testing, performed on the same day:  
● Familiarization Period.  
● Screening.  
● Pre-study.  
● Quality Control.  
● Testing.  
● Post-Testing.  
 
•              Stage I – Familiarization Period  
Evaluating an analytical method requires sufficient time for the operators to become familiar with the 
device operation and the study protocol, and the standard therefore recommends a study familiarization 
period. During t he familiarization period, the operators of the test and comparative method will become 
familiar with all aspects of set -up, operation, maintenance, quality control, and troubleshooting of both 
methods. This period will precede the study evalua tion process  and will coincide with the manufacturer's 
training performed during the Site Initiation Visit (SIV). During the SIV and familiarization period, 
routine laboratory quality control procedures will be run and up to [ADDRESS_7338] results from the subjects participating in 
the simulation study during the SIV a nd familiari zation period will not be included in the final study 
results or the study statistical analyses.  
● Stage II – Screening  
Potential candidates will receive complete information describing the study and their role and 
will be encouraged to ask any q uestions reg arding the study. The risks and requirements of this 
clinical research trial will be explained to each potential subject. Those volunteering to take part 
will read and sign the Informed Consent Form for participation in the clinical trial befor e any 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7339] 02, 2020                                           20 
 study -related procedures are performed. The Informed consent signing will be in front of a 
study personnel, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8081], 
informed consents, and results once a day.  
Upon obtaining the signe d informed c onsent, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to verify 
the subjects' eligibility.  
● Stage III – Pre-study  
Subjects who were found eligible to participate in the study and signed informed consent will be enrolled 
into the study and assigned a su bject ID number, which will be used along with their initials for study 
record identification . 
Designated eSource forms will be completed with the subject's general details, including demographics, 
medical history, diagnosis and concomit ant medications.  
● Stage IV – Quality Control  
Before each testing day, Quality Control will be performed using the YD Diagnostics - supplied Level [ADDRESS_7340].  
2. The professional user will open the ACR | U.S. application on either the iPhone 11 or Google 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] 3a device.  
3. Following the in -app instructions, the professional user will rem ove one strip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_8082] 1 control solution on the strip . The ACR | U. S. application will guide the user to scan the 
strip, uploading the data to the backend server for analysis.       
4. The professional user will then remove another strip, pi [INVESTIGATOR_8083] 1 Control solution on the 
strip and scan it using the Optima  device.  
5. The professional user will repeat steps 2 -4, substituting the Level 1 Control solution with Level 
2 Control solution , and between the smartphone devices . 
6. The Quality Cont rol will be considered as passing if the ACR | U.S. and the Optima  reports  the 
acceptable range as determined by [CONTACT_3455].  
7. If the Quality Control test for either phone fails, the error will be identified, and the Quality 
Control procedure will be c onducted again.  
 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7341] 02, 2020                                           21 
 ● Stage V – Testing  
1)    The subject will perform the usability study tasks in a simulated home environment, e.g. in a 
dedicated and isolated room in the clinic simulating a home, where internet connection is available, and 
a restroom is near by. The clinic will be set up so tha t the self -testing will allow the subject to perform 
the urinalysis test without outside influence and to simulate the home -use testing of the device.  
2)    The subject will be placed in the private room, with restroom acc essibility and internet 
connectivity, to perform the urinalysis test and complete the task list found below. No training, 
assistance, feedback, or supplemental instructional materials, other than those described, will be 
provided to participants. The healt hcare profession al or other site staff will not be allowed to intervene 
or answer questions from the subjects during testing, although a [ADDRESS_7342].   
3)    The room will be prepared with a desk and chair. The ACR | U.S., in its original packaging will 
be placed on the desk. The device packaging contains the kit components and the user manual. An  in-
app instruct ional guide containing the information most critical to safety and effectiveness is also 
provided in the form of a readable and understandable, visual, and textual guide on the device App. The 
patient labeling will be in the format intended  for distributio n to allow for a realistic evaluation of the 
labeling effectiveness.  
4)         The subjects will be asked to follow the device user manual and/or the in -app instructional 
guide and perform the following tasks:  
● Access the ACR | U.S. App on t he smartphone. ( iPhone 11 or the Google Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] 3a)  
● Provide a urine sample in the urine receptacle (to the level marked on the cup) that is included in 
the ACR | U.S. kit.  
● Immerse the urine strip (provided in the ACR | U.S. kit) in the collected urine specim en for one 
second.  
● Place the urine strip on the designated area on the Color -Board and wait at least 75 seconds, but 
not more than 180 seconds.  
● Scan the urine strip and Color -Board with the smartphone App.  
● Send the test results to the study clinician using  the smartphone App.  
● Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire following completion of the tasks.  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7343] 02, 2020                                           22 
 5)    Subjects will be observed as they complete the tasks by a research staff member. The research 
staff observer will complete a dedicated post -test questionnaire.  
6)     Upon completion of the usability study tasks, the subject will provide the urine sample in the 
device kit urine receptacle to the research staff for further testing. The research staff will perform the 
urine analysis test using the compa rator device, the  URiSCAN Optima  device . The research staff 
performing the urine analysis test with the Optima will  be blinded to the results of the ACR | U.S. test, 
until the test with the comparator device is completed.  
7)  Only after the urine has been te sted with the Optima , can the subject begin the test with a second 
kit on the second smart phone  device , provided by [CONTACT_8115].   A new  ID number will be 
given to the second  kit, therefore the lab operator will consider this as new urine and will be kept 
blinded to the urine results.  
8)    The results of the ACR | U.S. and the comparator device (the Optima ) will be used for study 
purposes only and not for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes of patient management. In the case that 
urina lysis results are required for patient management, urine specimens from the subject will be sent 
independently to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic laboratory for analysis and only the results of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic 
urine analysis will be used for patient care and manag ement . The patient will provide only one urine 
sample for use in both the study and any subsequent clinical urinalysis testing.   
 
● Stage VI – Post-test procedures  
Statistical analyses comparing the results from the ACR | U.S. and the Optima will be performed us ing 
an appropriate statistical program and methodology.  
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eSource and all 
source documents that support the data collected from each patient, as well as all study docum ents as 
specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential, Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study 
documents as specified by [CONTACT_8116](s). The investigator/institution will take 
measures to prevent accidental or pre mature destruction of these documents.

8. SUBJECT COMPLETION / WITHDRAWAL  
8.1. Accuracy Evaluation  
The ACR | U.S. test results will be compared to the Optima test results. The data will be graphically 
presented to com pare the percent exact match (agreement) and the percent ±1 block match (agreement) 
between the ACR | U.S. (tested by [CONTACT_8094]) and th e comparator device (tested by a healthcare 
professional) , for the different tested concentrations (blocks).  
 
8.2. Usabilit y Evaluation  
The usability of the ACR | U.S. will be determined by [CONTACT_8117], including operating the ACR | U.S. with minimal attempts to ask for 
assistance. Measurable usability c riteria for specific, critical steps, such as time -to-completion, number 
of requests for assistance, numerical ratings, etc., will be eval uated by [CONTACT_8118].  
The device usability information will be compared to id entified device risks. Device and user related 
hazards were identified and documented in the ACR | U.S. Risk Analysis file. These specific  device and 
user related risks will be evaluated in the usability study, according to the following steps:  
(1) Identify de vice and user related hazards (Risk Analysis)  
(2) Identify critical steps to be completed (Task List)  

ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7345] 02, 2020                                           24 
 (3) Compare device’s use with identified ris ks (Observer Evaluation and User Questionnaire)  
(4) Apply Criteria - percentage of permissible failures (refer to section 11.6.4)  
(5) Link assessment to the overall risk analysis (study conclusions)  
The following measurable usability criteria for specific, critica l steps, based on observer evaluation or 
user questionnaire responses, will be assessed through analysis of the data:  
(1) Time -to-completion of task;  
(2) Number of requests for assistance;  
(3) Numerical ratings describing the participants’ level of success in completing tasks will be 
collected through user posttest questionnaire responses;  
Qualitative information regarding specific u ser errors and inefficiencies will be collected through 
observe r evaluation and user posttest questionnaire responses.  
 
In addition, key system  errors will be evaluated in some subjects. Examples of key errors may include 
the following:  
1. Interruption during  the test by [CONTACT_8119].  
2. Interruption during the te st by [CONTACT_8120].  
3. No Internet connection  
The subject will be required to continue device operation according to the user manual.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7346] COMPLETION / WITHDRAWAL  
9.1. Completion  
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if the urine sample has been tested.  
A subject will be considered to have passed the usability test if he/she was able to scan the Color -Board 
successfully. In addition, in case  a subject failed in hi s/her first try but identified the problem alone and 
requested a second kit, and then completed the test, the subject will be considered to have passed the 
usability test.  
 
9.2. Withdrawal from the study  
A subject will be withdrawn from  the study for any of t he following reasons:  
1. Patient has identified that he/she cannot provide a sufficient urine sample.  
2. Withdrawal of consent.  
3. Patient is not compliant with requirements of the study, including inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
4. The study  is prematurely stopped  or halted (e.g. clinical halt).  
5. The investigator believes that for safety reasons (e.g. an adverse event) it is in the best interest of 
the patient to stop the test.  
 
When a patient withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal will be  documented in 
the CRF.  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7347] 02, 2020                                           26 
 10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Study Design and Objectives  
o The study is designed as a comparative, controlled, multi -centered  trial to evaluate the accuracy 
and usability performance of ACR | U.S. in the hands of a potential lay user.   
 
10.2. Study Endpoints  
● Primary  Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is to calculate the exact % match (agreement) and the % ±1 block 
match (agreement) of the ACR | U.S. (tested by [CONTACT_8094]) compared to the URiSCAN Optima device 
(tested by a healthcare professional), ), for the tested  concentrations (blocks).  
● Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the ACR | U.S. usability, by [CONTACT_8110] (home environment).  
 
10.3. Sample Si ze Estimation  
Sample size estimation was determined according to previous method comparison studies performed 
using other urine analyzers with similar Indications for Use (see table 1.0 , Performance testing clinical 
evaluation) and based on the EP9 -A2 stan dard.  
Furtherm ore, based on our experience in a previous, similar study, at least 250 subjects should represent 
a sufficient sample size to cover all concentrations and determine the agreement between the ACR | U.S. 
and the URiSCAN Optima.  
 
10.4. Subject Trackin g 
During the s ubject recruitment, tracking will be performed to evaluate if the data collected covers the 
entire range of concentrations measured by [CONTACT_8121]. If the data is insufficient, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8084]. The number of spi[INVESTIGATOR_8079] 15% of the 
total number of samples (all blocks combined).       
 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7348] 02, 2020                                           27 
 10.5. Data Analysis Sets  
● Efficacy Analysis Set  
The Efficacy analysis set will consist of all subjects without major protocol deviations. Protocol 
deviations will be  defined and classified as minor or major.    
● Statistical Analysis of Analysis Sets  
The Efficacy analysis set will serve as the main analysis set for the method comparison and usability 
assessments.  
 
10.6. Statistical Analysis  
● General Consideration s 
Statistical analyses will be performed using an appropriate statistical program and methodology.  
Baseline demographic and safety analyses will be performed on all enrolled subjects.  
● Demographic and Other Baseline Variables  
Demographic and baseline condi tion related characteristics will be tabulated. Continuous variables will 
be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum, and categorical 
variables by a count and percentage.  
● Disposition of Subjects  
The number and percent of subje cts who fail to complete the study and the number and percent of 
subjects who fail to complete the study because of Adverse Events will be presented.  
● Efficacy Analysis  
The % exact match (agreement) of the ACR | U.S. compared to the comparator device, for the same 
Albumin -Creatinine Ratio concentration (block) will be calculated. The % ±1 block match (agreement) 
of the ACR | U.S. compared to the compar ator device, for the same Albumin -Creatinine Ratio 
concentration (block) will also be calculated.  
● Usab ility Analysis  
The usability of the ACR | U.S. will be determined by [CONTACT_8122] -related tasks, including accessing the ACR | U.S. App, providing a urine 
sample in the urine receptacle, di ppi[INVESTIGATOR_8085], positioning the strip on 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7349] and taking a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8086], with minimal attempts to ask for 
assistance.  
Measurable usability criteria for specific, critical steps, such as time -to-completion, number of requests 
for assistance, numerical ratings, etc., will be evaluated by [CONTACT_8123]. Descriptive statistics will be provided for usability criteria.  
● Adverse Event  
In general, there are no ant icipa ted adverse events in this study; however, if any adverse events do occur 
they will be recorded and presented in tables.  
 
RISK / BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
10.7. Risks  
The risks to patients resulting from potential device hazards have been analyzed using the Risk 
Manageme nt Standard - ISO [ZIP_CODE]. The different types of hazards were identified and evaluated using 
risk assessment numerical parameters. Applicable controls for the risks were analyzed. After the 
implementation of appropriate risk control measures, the le vel of r isk was re -evaluated and found to be 
acceptable. The risks associated with the device are minimal if any. Below is a summary of the risks to 
the subject and the applicable control measures.  
Risk: Urine receptacle material may cause irritation if it  comes i n contact [CONTACT_8124].  
Mitigation: The urine receptacle  is manufactured from a combination of FDA food grade approved 
materials: Polypropylene and Thermo Plastic Elastomer (TPE) in over -molding / core injection process. 
The receptacle was also su bjected to biocompatibility testing in a certified lab according to the ISO 
[ADDRESS_7350] .  
Risk: The urine receptacle is not comfortable for collecting urine or for immersing the urine strip.  
Mitigation: The urine receptacle has been designed taking into  conside ration human factors analysis. 
The design is such that the urine will flow into the cup and avoid splashing. The cup is designed so that 
the user can immerse the urine strip easily in one quick insertion.  
Risk: The Color -Board gets wet and damaged   
Mitiga tion: The Color -Board is manufactured from sturdy carton material and  is designed for one -time 
use.  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7351] 02, 2020                                           29 
 Risk: The user places the urine strip in the wrong position on the Color -Board pad.  
Mitigation: The device App will instruct the subject to reposition the  urine strip.   
 
These risks following the mitigation are considered minimal, if not negligible.  
  
10.8. Benefits  
There are no immediate benefits to the subject from their participation in the study. The results of the 
study may provide valuable information and data towards their eventual benefit from the device as a 
new, home -use urine analyzer  device.  
 
11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies is 
crucial for the protection of patie nts, investigators and the sponsor, and are mandated by [CONTACT_8125].  
11.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event Defini tions and Classifications  
● Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient. An adverse even t does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational produc t, whether or not it is related to the investigational 
product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonizatio n [ICH])  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, or abnorm al results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
● Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse ev ent as defined by [CONTACT_8126]:  
● Results in death  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7352] 02, 2020                                           30 
 ● Is life -threateni ng 
● Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
● Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate  in situations other than those listed above. For example, important medical events may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8087]. Any adverse 
event is considered a serious adverse event if it is associated wit h clinical signs or symptoms judged by 
[CONTACT_8127] a significant clinical impact.  
● Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event  
An unlisted advers e event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. In vestigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or the package 
insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product) (IC H) 
● Associated with the Use of the Device  
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the device if the attribution is possible, 
probable, or very likely by [CONTACT_8128].  
Relationship to Investigational Device  
For all adverse events, the relationship to the study device and / or procedure will be determined by [CONTACT_1275], using the following terms:  
● Probably related:  
Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study device delivery / retrieval, and  cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_8129]’s clinical data or the surgical procedure applied.  
● Possibly related:   
Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study device delivery / retrieval but could have been 
produced by [CONTACT_8130]’s clinical state  or by [CONTACT_8131].  
● Probably not related:    
Temporal association is such that the study device is not likely to have had any reasonable association 
with the observed event.  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7353] 02, 2020                                           31 
 ● Not related:     
No relationship to stu dy device activation is perceived.  
11.2. Procedures  
All Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be reported from the time a signed and dated informed consent form is obtained 
until completion of the last study -related procedure. Events meeting the definition of s erious adverse 
events must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form, including serious adverse events 
spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days after the patient has completed the study 
(including post -study follow up).  
All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be repor ted as serious adverse events, 
regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. All adverse events, regardless of 
seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study treatme nt, must be recorded using medical 
terminology in the source docu ment and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when 
signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and 
head congestion should  be reported as "Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]"). Investigators mus t record in the 
CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_8088]. All measures 
required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source docume nt and reported according 
to sponsor instructions.  
The sponsor a ssumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory 
authorities. The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report these events to the appropriate 
Indep endent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) that  approved the protocol, unless 
otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  
Serious Adverse Events  
All serious adverse events occurring during clinical studies must be reported to the ap propriate sponsor 
contact [CONTACT_8132] [ADDRESS_7354] be signed by a member of the i nvestigational staff. The initial report of a 
serious adverse eve nt may be made by [CONTACT_6972] (fax), e -mail or telephone. It is preferable that serious 
adverse events are reported via fax or e -mail. Subsequent to a telephone report of a serious adverse 
even t, a Serious Adverse Event Form must be completed by [CONTACT_8133].  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7355] not been 
resolved upon discon tinuation of the patient's participation in the study, must be fo llowed until any of 
the following occurs:  
● The event resolves  
● The event stabilizes  
● The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value is available  
● The event can be attributed to agents other t hat the study treatment or to factors unrelated to the 
study cond uct 
● When it becomes unlikely any additional information can be obtained (i.e. patient or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstrat ion of due 
diligence with follow -up efforts)  
The cause of death in a clinical study, whether or not the event is expected or associated with the 
investigational agent, is considered a serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or 
prolongat ion of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that occurs during th e course of a patient's participation in a clinical 
study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272]:  
● Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], i.e. before enrollment into the study and which ar e not related to the 
disease itself  
● Social re asons in absence of an adverse event  
● Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7356] th e capacity to provide informed consent are allowed to enroll in the study. As 
part of the screening of patients for entry into the study, the investigator will assess each patient's ability 
to provide informed consent for participa tion in the study.  
The pr otocol includes strict requirements to ensure adequate protection of all patients participating in the 
study, including:  
● Patients will be carefully screened using medical history before enrollment. Those who are 
judged to be at a h igh risk for adverse even ts will be excluded.  
● Patients may withdraw their consent at any time without having to give a reason.  
● Patients are fully informed as to the risks of study participation and will be provided with any 
new information about the study  testing that might becom e available during their participation in the 
study.  
● Informed consent is obtained from patients without undue enticement. Patients will not be 
coerced in any way to participate in this study. Excessive financial compensation will n ot be offered to 
patients  or to investigators.  
 
12.2. Regulatory Ethics Compliance  
● Investigators Responsibilities  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accordance with the 
protocol, current ICH guidelines on Good Cl inical Practice (GCP), an d applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and 
reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with thi s standard 
provides publi c assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study subjects are protected, 
consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical study 
data are credible.  
ACR -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7357] 02, 2020                                           34

● Deviations from or changes to the protocol to eliminate immed iate hazards to the patients  
● Report of death of pati ents under investigator's care  
● Notification if new investigator is responsible for the study at the site  
● Any other requirements of the IEC/IRB  
For protocol amendments that increase patient risk, the amen dments and applicable informed consent 
form revisions  must be submitted promptly to the IEC/IRB for review and approval before 
implementation of the change(s)  
At least once a year the IEC/IRB will be asked to review and re -approve this clinical study. This  request 
and approval should be documented in writing . 
At the end of the study, the investigator (or sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/IRB about the 
study completion.  
● Informed Consent  
Each patient must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the study has 
been fully  explained.  
The consent form must be signed before performance of any study -related activity. The consent form 
used must be approved by [CONTACT_8135]/IRB. The informed con sent should 
be in accordance with principles set forth in  the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP 
guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor policy.  
Before entry into the study, the investigator or an authorized member of the inve stigational staff must 
explain to potential patients the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of 
the study, and any discomfort it may entail. Patients will be informed that their participation is voluntary 
and that they may  withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will b e informed that choosing not 
to participate will not affect the care they patient will receive for the treatment for his/her disease. 
Patients will be told that alternative treatments are available i f they refuse to take part and that such 
refusal will not  prejudice future treatment. Finally, they will be told that the investigator will maintain a 
patient identification register for the purposes of long -term follow up if needed and that their records 
may be accessed by [CONTACT_8136] t he confidentiality of the patient, to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) or regulations. By [CONTACT_8137] -US-MCU -[ADDRESS_7359] 02, 2020                                           36

needed.  
The patient will be given sufficient time to read the informed consent form and the opportunity to ask 
questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be appropriately 
recorded by [CONTACT_8140], patient's signature [CONTACT_8153]. After having obtained the 
consent, a copy of the informed cons ent form must be given to the patient.  
If the patient or legally acceptable representative is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should 
be present for the entire informed consent process (which includes reading and explaining all written 
explana tions) and should personally date and sign the inform con sent form after the oral consent of the 
patient or legally acceptable representative is obtained.

 ● Other documentation required by [CONTACT_427]  
● Patient Identification Register and Patient Screening Log  
The investigator agrees to complete a patient identification register to permit easy identification of each 
patient  during and after the study.  
The patient identification register will be treated as confidential. To ensure patient confidentiality, no 
copy will be made. All reports and communications relating to the study will identify patients by [CONTACT_8145].  
The investigator will also complete a patient -screening log, which reports all patients who were seen to 
determine eligibility  for inclusion in the study.  
● eSource Completion  
All data relating to the study will be recorded in electronic sourc e documents. Data will be entered into 
eSource in English. The eSource are to be completed at the time of the patient's visit, so that they always 
reflect the latest observations on the patients participating in the study.  
The investigator must verify that  all data entries in the eSource are accurate and correct.  
● Record Retention  
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/ins titution will maintain all eSource and all

 General Statistical Co nsiderations:    
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the numbers, means, standard 
deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  Comparisons will be made 
between response rates for patients with infection due to ciprofloxacin- susceptible and ciprofloxacin -non-susceptible isolates.  
Exploratory analyses may also be performed.  Listings of individual patient’s data will be produced.  
 
Efficacy Analyses:    
The study  is designed to determine the clinical and microbiologic response of patie nts with a uUTI, due to ciprofloxacin-
sensitive and ciprofloxacin- non-susceptible isolates, treated with ciprofloxacin  for the outcome measure of overall response 
(combined clinical  and microbiologic response ) at Day 12 (+/- 1 day) .  
A patient will be defined as a responder if the following criteria are met:  
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic  active against the urinary tract patho gen is given for other reasons, then the patient will be 
considered indeterminate, and analyzed as a non -responder for uUTI  
• The patient has r esolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI symptoms  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) demonstrates  <103 CFU/mL  of the baseline uropathogen   
 
All other patients will be considered non -responders. If data are unavailable to determine if the patient is a responder or 
non-responder, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response.  
 
The number and percentage of responders , non- responders  and indeterminates will be determined. Descriptive statistics, 
including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, 
minimums, a nd maximums for continuous variables will be provided. In addition to the randomized m -MITT population, 
additional analyses will be performed in the subset of patients with ciprofloxacin -susceptible organisms at baseline  and in

 those with ciprofloxacin -non-susceptible organisms at baseline . Exploratory analyses may also be performed. Listings of 
individual patient’s data will be produced. A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to the 
database lock . 
 
The number and percentage  of patients with a microbiologic success at the Day 12 (+/ -1 day ) visit will be determined. The 
validity of the urine dipstick as a screening tool to identify patients with a positive urine culture will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_357781] a positive nitrite test and a positive test for pyuria on dipstick/urinalysis, who 
have ≥ 105 CFU/ml of a uropathogen isolated from urine culture.  Safety analyses will be conducted in all patients who receive 
any amount of ciprofloxacin .  Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs .

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Indication  
Ciprofloxacin is being studied for the treatment of the following indications: 
 
- Uncomplicated urinary tract infections  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_446417] 50 years has  
resulted in the development of microbial resistance to these agents among clinically  important bacteria. This resistance commonly 
takes the form of ß -lactamase production , development of porins  or alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs). Such 
mechanisms have red uced the clinical  utility of frequently prescribed ß- lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanate  (a ß-
lactamase inhibitor), and cephalosporins. For Escherichia coli , ampi[INVESTIGATOR_104514] ≥50% in high- risk populations, and 
resist ance to third generation cephalosporins is now being seen in certain areas.  Furthermore, th e prevalence of infections caused by 
[CONTACT_89927] -spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has been increasing worldwide. An analysis of data reported 
from 2011 to 2014 to the National Healthcare Safety Network performed by [CONTACT_104545] 2016 reveale d 
that the proportion of E.  coli resistant to extended -spectrum cephalosporins causing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired infection was 13.4% nationally, 
with rates as high as 24% reported in some Northeastern, Southern and Western states.  The same analysis also demonstrated that over 
a third of E.  coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to fluoro quinolones. Data reported by [CONTACT_357782] R esistance 
Surveillance Network (EARS -NET) in Europe demonstrate that the prevalence of fluoro quinolone resistant E.  coli and E.  coli resistant 
to third -generation cephalosporins is > 25% and E.  coli resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycos ides and 
fluoro quinolones has increased to >10% in some southern and eastern European countries. Oral antibiotic treatment options are 
extremely limited for patients with these infections, resulting in lengthy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357774], even for those with uncomplicated infections. The currently available oral antibiotics with activity against ESB L

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March [ADDRESS_446418] rising ra tes of 
resistance and are associated with inferior efficacy  [Munoz -Davila 2014; Schito 2009] . Resistance to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole 
is uniformly above 20% in the US. Increasing prevalence of resistance to fluoro quinolones and their propensity to cause collateral 
damage resulted in relegation of fluoro quinolones to second- line therapy by [CONTACT_357783] (IDSA) for 
UTI [Gupta 2011] .  Even with these limitations, almost two -thirds of patients with a uUTI receive therapy with a fluoroquinolone 
antibiotic.  Furthermore, there is a percentage of uUTI patients treated with a fluoroquinolone who respond to therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_357775]. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, including PK/PD 
relationships (i.e., concentration and duration of drug at the site of infection) and host fact ors.  The proportion of patients with 
infection due to fluoroquinolone resistant pathogens who have clinical or bacteriological response to fluoroquinolone therapy  has not 
been well studied, and most studies which have evaluated this issue have done so as part of a secondary analysis of a UTI treatment 
trial. 
 
1.2.2  Dose Rationale  
Ciprofloxacin  
The recommended dose  of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI is  250 mg twice daily by [CONTACT_5555] 3 days, per the 
Ciprofloxacin USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_357776] .  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Objective s 
The primary objective of this study is t o evaluate the clinical and microbiologic response of patients with a uUTI treated with 
ciprofloxacin.     
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of specific t ests found on the urine dipstick as a screening tool to 
identify symptomatic patients with a positive urine culture , defined as growth of ≥105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen at baseline.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This prospective , Phase 4 , open label, multi -center study docum ents the clinical and microbiologic response of adult women patients 
with uUTI treated empi[INVESTIGATOR_357777].   Since UTIs in males are classified as complicated, males will not be included in 
this study. Approximately 250 adult women with uUTI wi ll receive oral ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 3 days.  
The primary outcome measure for efficacy evaluation will be the overall response on Day 12 (+/ - 1 day).  For the primary efficacy 
evaluation, these percentages will be based on a microbiologic -modified intent to treat population (m -MITT). The m -MITT population 
will be comprised of all patients who received at least one dose of ciprofloxacin  and had ≥105 CFU/mL  of a baseline pathogen isolated 
from a urine culture specimen taken at baseline , prior to initiation of ciprofloxacin therapy.  
 
See Appendix 1, Schedule of Activities Table.

all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and who agree to participate in the study, w ill be treated for their uUTI with 
ciprofloxacin .   
The ciprofloxacin , or a pharmacy prescription for ciprofloxacin, will be provi ded to the patient by [CONTACT_357784].   
Patients will be asked to take one 250 mg tablet or capsule twice daily ( day 1 to 3 + 1 day)  for 3 days .  In the event a patient’s first 
dose is taken in the PM on Day 1, the patient will be expected to take  an AM dose on Day 4 to complete the 6 doses of ciprofloxacin, 
and the EOT visit will occur on day 4 instead of day 3.

 7.2 Efficacy 
7.2.1  Overall Response  
Overall  Response is assessed  on Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) TOC  using the definitions listed below: 
 
A patient will be defined as a responder if the following criteria are met (programmatically, based on the data on the CRF) : 
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic  active against the urinary tract pathogen is given for other reasons, then the patient will be considered 
indeterminate, and analyzed as a non- responder for uUTI  
• The patient has resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI symptoms  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 (+/- 1 day) demonstrates < 103 CFU /mL of the baseline uropatho gen 
All other patients will be considered non -responders . If data are unavailable to determine if the patient is a responder or non-
responder, the patient will be considered as having an indeterminate response.  
 
7.2.2  Microbiologic  
Microbiologic Response is assessed on Day 3 or 4 (+1 day) EOT and Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) TOC using the definitions  listed below:

 Microbiological response  Definition  
Eradication  A urine culture taken at baseline and compared with the culture from the EOT 
visit or TOC visit showed that the urine culture obtained at the relevant visit 
demonstrated <103 CFU/mL of the original uropathogen.  
Persistence  A uropathogen present at baseline  grew at ≥103 CFU/m L at the time -point of 
analysis, i.e. EOT  or TOC.  
Indeterminate  Patient was lost to follow -up or an assessment was not undertaken such that no 
urine culture was obtained (or culture results could not be interpreted for any 
reason) at either the EOT or the  TOC visit .

 For SAEs, the reporting period to Iterum Therapeutics  begins from the time that the patient signed informed consent , which may be 
prior to the patient’s participation in the study, i.e., prior to undergoing any study -related procedure through the TOC .   Any SAE 
occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship to investigational product i s suspected

event is captured in the s tudy endpoint, as defined below ; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.   
An event would be considered as adequately captured in the study endpoint if it is accurately and fully represented by a prot ocol-
defined reason for clinical failure (other than mortality) or relapse.  Such an event should not be reported as an adverse event unless it 
is a serious adverse event as defined in this protocol.   
Events represented by [CONTACT_357787]:  
• Symptoms of uUTI have not resolved from Baseline to such an extent that new antibiotics are not needed for the infection under 
study  
• Development of new uUTI symptoms not present at Baseline  
• Follow up urine cultures do not reveal eradication of causative uropathogen   
 
Except for circumstances as defined above, examples of AEs include but are not limited to:

Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surger y, should not be reported as an AE.  However, the 
medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be repor ted as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be 
recorded as treatment of the AE.  
8.7 Severity Assessment 
The Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
• MILD :  Does not interfere with the patient's usual function. 
• MODERATE :  Interferes to some extent with the patient's usual function.  
• SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with the patient's usual function.   
 
Note the di stinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  
For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as  serio us 
unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.  
 
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non- serious); the Investigator must record the 
causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility 
that th e cipro floxacin  caused or contributed to an AE.  If the Investigator does not know whether or not ciprofloxacin  caused the event, 
then the event will be handled as “related to ciprofloxacin ” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_104536]  (see Section  8.12 
on Reporting Requirements ).  If the Investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to ciprofloxacin ", this should be 
clearly documented on study records.  Specifically, the Investigator will choose whether the AE is unrelated, unlikely related, possibly 
related or probably related to ciprofloxacin . 
   Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March [ADDRESS_446436] this causal 
relationship in the source docume nts and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.  
The Investigator will assess causal ity of the event in relation to ciprofloxacin  based on the following defined criteria:  
• UNRELATE D: No relationship between the event and medicinal product  
• UNLIKELY:  Event with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible); Disease or other drugs 
provide plausible explanations  
• POSSIBLY : Event with reasonable time rela tionship to drug intake; Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]; 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear  
• PROBABLY:  Event with reasonable time relationship to drug intake; Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs; Response 
to withdrawal clinically reasonable; Re -challenge not required  
 
8.9 Exposure during Pregnancy  
Ciprofloxacin is Pregnancy Category C , indicating that there are no adequate and well -controlled studies of ciprofloxacin in pregnant 
women. C iprofloxacin should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to both fetus and 
mother. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by [CONTACT_357788] –the Teratogen 
Information System– concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk, but the data 
are insufficient to state that there is no risk.   
 
If any study patient becomes  or is found to be pregnant during the study , patient’s treatment with  ciprofloxacin , the investigator must 
complete a Med Watch  Form FDA 3500 and submit it by [CONTACT_357789] .   The decision to continue ciprofloxacin, stop 
ciprofloxacin , or switch to an alternative agent will be left to the discretion of the Investigator .

 Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Pregnancy  reports with an unknown outcome.  The 
investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then not ify Iterum  
of the outcome.   
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e.,  spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
 aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonata l death]), Iterum  Therapeutics will 
submit the Med  Watch Form FDA 3500 to the FDA and to the manufacturer of ciprofloxacin.  
 
8.10 Discontinuation from Ciprofloxacin Due to AEs (See also Patient Withdrawal, Section  6.4) 
Discontinuation from ciprofloxacin  due to an AE should be distinguished from discontinuation due to insufficient response, according 
to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page.   
When a patient discontinues ciprofloxacin  due to an SAE, the SAE must be repor ted in accordance with the reporting requirements 
defined below.

immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event  information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information 
(follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of Preg nancy cases.   
In the rare instance that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study 
patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the event within 24 hour s after learning of it and document the 
time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAEs and  pregnancies , the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Iterum Therapeutics in accordance 
with the timeframes for reporting specified abov e.  In addition, an Investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_357791] -up information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured on the 
Med Watch Form FDA 3500.  In general, thi s information may include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], laboratory test and X -ray results .  
Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the ca se of a 
patient death, a summary of avail able autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible by [CONTACT_357789] .  The 
information should be reported on a  Med Watch Form FDA 3500 and sent  to Iterum Therapeutics.  
8.12.2  Non-SAE Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the A E page(s) of the CRF.  Please note that while all AEs are reported on the AE page of the CRF, there 
is an additional form used for collection of SAE information, as described in Section  8.12.1, which is not the same as the AE C RF.  
Whe n the same data are collected, the two forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should 
be used on both forms.  Serious a dverse events  should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the 
form for collection of SAE information.  The information on the AE CRF and the SAE form must be the same and will be reconciled 
at defined periods throughout the study to ensure that they do.

 8.12.3  Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
Adverse event reporting, including reporting of suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with 
applicable local regulations.  Death and life -threatening Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are subject to

 4. Micro -MITT (mMITT) : All MITT patients with a positive study entry  urine culture defined as ≥105 CFU/mL of a 
uropathogen and no more than 2 species of microorganisms identified in the study entry urine culture, regardless of colony 
count.  
5. Clinically evaluable:  
1)  Clinically evaluable (CE) at the EOT and TOC visits popu lation:  
a) Received a minimum number of days of ciprofloxacin  (to be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP])  
b) Had no important protocol deviations that would affect the assessment of efficacy  (to be defined in the SAP)  
c) Had an  outcome assessment of cl inical cure or failure (and not indeterminate) at the EOT,  or TOC visits ( i.e., within the 
protocol allowed visit window), respectively.   
d) Had not received prior antibiotic before the initiation of study therapy for this infection unless the recovered path ogen 
demonstrates resistance to initial antibiotic and clinical symptoms persist  
e) Did not receive any antibiotic therapy with potential activity against any of the baseline uropathogens collected at 
screening between the time of the baseline culture and the EOT or TOC culture, respectively.  This excludes the protocol 
defined study therapy and patients who were considered clinical failures and required additional antibiotic therapy.  
Patients with a coinfection with a gram -positive uropathogen resistant to c iprofloxacin are allowed to receive agents with 
narrow spectrum gram -positive coverage ( i.e., such as linezolid or vancomycin)

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March [ADDRESS_446441] deviations, 
medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  Comparisons will be made between response rates for 
patients with infection due to ciprofloxacin- susceptible and ciprofloxacin -non-susceptible isolates.  Exploratory analyses may also be 
performed.  Listings of individual patient’s data will be produced. A comprehensive Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized 
prior to final database lock . 
 
9.4 Patient Characteristics  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, discontinuations from the ciprofloxacin  and withdrawal from the study will be summarized.  
Demographics (age, race, sex), medical  and surgi cal history , baseline assessment of the symptoms of uUTI , microbiological 
assessment of the urine , and ciprofloxacin  administration will also be summarized.     
 
9.5 Efficacy Analysis  
9.5.1  Analysis of Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome is overall  response (clinical plus microbiologic) at the Day 12 (+/ - 1 day) visit in the m -MITT population. The 
number a nd percentage of responders, non- responders  and indeterminates  will be determined.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Additional Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Outcome  
In addit ion to the overall response rate, response rates for patients infected by [CONTACT_357792]- susceptible organism 
will be evaluated.   
 
   Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March [ADDRESS_446442] a positive baseline urine culture for >100,000 CFU/mL of a uropathogen will be  
evaluated .  
 
9.5.3  Analysis of Additional Efficacy Outcome M easures 
The number and percentage of subjects tre ated with ciprofloxacin with an overall response of responder, non- responder, and 
indeterminate (by [CONTACT_357793]) at the TOC visit will be  
presented for the m -MITT and ME -TOC popul ations.   
Investigator determined clinical response (clinical cure, failure and indeterminate) at the Day 3  or 4 (+ 1 day)  (EOT ) and TOC Visits 
will be presented for the m -MITT, CE, and ME populations.  The number and percentage of subjects with a microbiologic response 
of eradication, persistence, persistence with in creasing MIC, and indeterminate (by [CONTACT_357794]) will be presented for the following time points and analysis populations:  
• Day 3  or 4 (+ 1 day)  (EOT)  in the m -MITT and ME- EOT populations  
• Day 12 in the m -MITT  and ME -Day12  populations  
Overall response and microbiologic eradication at the EOT and TOC visits by [CONTACT_115943] (key  pathogens) will be summarized 
in the m -MITT and ME populations.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs.  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety population.   
Summary tables of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be provided.  A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in 
frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of ciprofloxacin .  The  incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_357795].  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT-004-401   Amendment 02: 27March [ADDRESS_446443] dose of c iprofloxacin  (AEs are recorded from 
the time of informed consent)  will be provided in a listing.  
9.7 Handling of Missing Data  
Details of the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  For the primary and secondary efficacy analyses, if any  data 
field needed to determine overall response (primary) and microbiological response (secondary) is  missing at the Day 12 (primary) 
visit, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response. By [CONTACT_108], patients with an indeterminate response are included 
in the denominator in the m -MITT population and thus, are analyzed in the same manner as non- responders  and persistence.   
Additional sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be detailed in the SAP.  By [CONTACT_108], patients with missing data are 
excluded from the CE  populations .

11.1 Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refe r to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, 
depending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Iterum  
and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Iterum  or appropriate regulatory 
authorities, without written permission from Iterum . 
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms.  The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_357796].  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs and 
source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician' s patient chart.  In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must 
match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at 
the Investigator’s site as  well as at Iterum  and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will 
stand as the source document. 
11.[ADDRESS_446446] Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Iterum , the Investigator agree s to keep records, including the 
identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] ), all original signed 
informed consent forms , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and 
adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone call reports).  The records should be 
retained by [CONTACT_357797], local regulations, or as specified in the C linical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.

 If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (e.g., retirement, 
relocation), Iterum  should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Iterum , such as 
another Investigator, another institution, or to Iterum .  The Investigator must obtain Iterum 's written permission before disposing of 
any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
[ADDRESS_446447] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent 
forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., recruitme nt advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to Iterum  or its agent  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be  initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Iterum  in writing 
immediately after the implementation.  
12.[ADDRESS_446448] of the Study

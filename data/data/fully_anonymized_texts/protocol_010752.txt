SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis being tested.  
 
One of the  goals of this  proposal is to investigate if co-administration of rhIGF -1 with 
physiologic estradiol replacement to adolescent girls w ith AN will increase BMD more than 
estrogen monotherapy, and bone mass will approach that se en in healthy adolescent girls.  
An additiona l aim  for the prospective study is to determine whether co -administration of rhIGF -1 
with estradiol to mimic the normal pubertal milieu:  
A) Stimulates bone formation through an IGF -[ADDRESS_521973]   
B) Increases bone density to a greater extent than estrogen monotherapy  
C) Improves bone mass accrual to approach that in healthy controls  
 
Further more we will inves tigate if  co-administration of r hIGF -1 with physiological  
estradiol replacement will improve  bone microarchitecture and bone strength in  girls with AN.  
In a cross -sectional study of adolescent girls with AN and healthy adolescent girls, we will 
determine w hether:  
A) Cortical and trabecular bone density and microarchitecture at the ultradistal radius (non -
weight bearing bone) and tibia (wei ght bearing bone) as assessed by [CONTACT_84888] -pQCT, and bone 
strength, as assessed by [CONTACT_414179] (FEA), are abnormal in AN compared to 
controls, and are associated positively with nutritional and hormonal predictors of bone mass, 
including BMI, body fat , fat-free mass, estradiol and IGF -1 levels  
 
In a prospective study of adolescent girls with AN we will determine whethe r: 
B)  Co -administration of rhIGF -1 with transdermal estrogen improves cortical and trabecular 
bone microarchitectural parameters (asses sed by [CONTACT_84895]) and bone strength (assessed by 
[CONTACT_414180]) more than estrogen alone to approach that in normal adolescent girls.  Girls with AN 
receiving estradiol alone will have an increase in bone microarchitecture and strength versus 
baseline, but will not norm alize compared to healthy controls  
C) Changes in IGF -1 levels are associated positively with changes in measures of bone  density, 
microarchitecture and strength . 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     4  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important  for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the third most common chronic illness am ong adolescent girls 
(1), with a prevalence of 0.2 -1.0% in Western societies (2, 3) .  The prevalence rate of AN is 
269.[ADDRESS_521974] 50 years (1). Primarily psychiatric in origin , AN results in numerous medical 
complications, which lead to increased morbidity and mortality in this young population.  
Although the endocrine and metabolic disturbances of AN typi[INVESTIGATOR_414146], 
low bone mineral density (BMD) is a frequ ent and persistent co -morbid complication of AN.  
There are no effective approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_414147].   
 Why is the low bone mass characteristic of AN of critical health importance?   (i) The 
prevalence, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_414148] d evelopment, and severity of low bone mass in adolescents and young 
women with AN have associated morbidity, (ii) low BMD acquired during  adolescence may 
impose life -long increased fracture risk,  (iii) despi[INVESTIGATOR_414149], 
treatment strategies in this population do not exist, and (iv) AN represents a unique model in 
which to investigate the profound consequenc e of nutritional deprivation and pubertal disruption 
on bone mass acquisition. The majority of adolescent girls with AN have low BMD of early 
onset involving both trabecular and cortical bone (4-6), and clinical fra ctures occur even in this 
young age group;  lumbar BMD is reduced >2 SD in adolescent AN girls, often after only one 
year of illness (5). A study in 170 adolescents 10 -17 years old with AN found that 44% of girls 
with ≥ six months of amenorrhea had low lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_414150] (7).  Unfortunate ly, the time 
to recovery in adolescents with AN is long (8), and  therefore, severe bone mass deficits are 
common.  We have shown that adolescents with AN have a marked reduction in bone mass 
compared to bone age -matched controls using height -adjusted BMD calculations to eliminate 
potential bone size confou nders (9).  A population -based long -term fracture risk cohort study 
from the Mayo Clinic found that  the cumulative incidence of any fracture 40 years after the 
diagnosis of AN is 57% (10).  Low bone density in AN is a consequence of several hormonal 
alterations including hypogonadism, low IGF -1 levels, h igh levels of cortisol and alterations in 
certain hormones such as ghrelin, leptin and PYY that are altered in conditions of low energy 
availability.  
 Why is this young population at such high risk for severe and permanent osteopenia and 
skeletal fragility ?  The onset of AN most frequently occurs during adolescence, a period of 
maximal bone accretion, with > 90% of bone mass accrued by 18 year s of age (11). Because 
adolescence is a critical time for attainment of peak skel etal mass, reduction of BMD during this 
crucial period may lead to long -term morbidity. Indeed, we found that in con trast to normal 
adolescents who demonstrate marked bone accretion during puberty, adolescents with AN do not 
increase their bone mass (12).  Therefore, bone ma ss remains low in these girls during a critical 
period in normal bone development.  We have previously shown that adults with onset of AN 
during adolescence have lower spi[INVESTIGATOR_414151] -onset AN, despi[INVESTIGATOR_414152] (13).  Furthermore, low bone mass in adolescents with AN may be 
permanent d espi[INVESTIGATOR_414153] (14).  Approximately half of young women with AN have persistent 
osteopenia, even after >10 years (15-17). Therefore, there may be a narrow “window -in-time” 
during adol escence in which maximal accrual of bone mass occurs and during which treatment 
paradigms to maximize bone accrual m ust be implemented.  
 The overall significance of this problem:  A large number of adolescent girls suffer from 
anorexia nervosa resulting in major deficits in bone mass and increased skeletal fragility, which 
may be permanent. Our proposed study will 1) tes t the efficacy of replacing a deficiency of an 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     5  endogenous bone anabolic hormone, IGF -1, with estradiol as a unique therapy for the low bone 
formation state in adolescents with AN and 2) enable an understanding of the effects of this 
disease and its treatme nt by [CONTACT_414181] -specific changes in bone density, 
but microarchitecture and strength at weight bearing and non -weight b earing sites.    
 Given the increasing prevalence of AN, its profound consequences on bone health, and lack of 
optima l treatment interventions, these studies will provide critical data needed to identify optimal 
treatment strategies for this severe co -morbi d disease using state - of- the- art endpoints of BMD, 
bone microarchitecture and strength. Although both low IGF -[ADDRESS_521975] (HR -pQCT) 
(described below) will improve our un derstanding of the relationship between IGF -1, gonadal 
steroids and bone quality and will aid in the development of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_414154].  
 Furthermore, in recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the bone fat 
connection. In the marrow, osteocytes and adipocytes arise from a common progenitor. Recent 
studies hav e shown an increase in bone marrow fat in adults with anorexia nervosa which is also 
correlated inversely with bone mineral density. We will  assess the effect of estrogen (bone anti 
resorptive hormone) and IGF -1 (bone anabolic hormone) on marrow fat in gir ls with AN and in 
comparison with healthy controls who receive no intervention. Also bone marrow fat and 
preadipocyte factor, Pref -1, decrea se after recovery from anorexia nervosa. We will determine 
associations of changes in bone mass following therapy wi th changes in marrow fat and Pref -1 
levels over the same duration. This will help us delineate the physiological connection between 
bone mar row fat and bone mineral density and structure in AN.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly describe study design an d anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief su mmary of the

Minneapolis, MN) and indirect calorimetry (metabolic cart) to determine re spi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] 
(RQ) and resting  energy expenditure. (All subjects consent to the metabolic cart, although it 
is treated as optional during the study. A food diary log may be provided at the screening 
visit or baseline visit. Although all subjects conse nt to the food diary log, its compl etion is 
treated as optional during the study. ) 
(e) EDI2:Eating Disorders Inventory -2 questionnaire, which has been validated in adolescent 
patients with eating disorders (25) and includes assessment of body image. This is a 91 -item, 
11 scale, six -point forced -choice self -report inventory assessing behavioral and psychological 
traits common in AN. (This can be completed at the screen visit)

(r) Study Drug Reminders: We will set up medication reminders on phone calendars for those 
who consent to the optional reminders. Subjects may decrease or turn off reminders at any 
time. All patient information will remain confid ential, and no identifiers will be used. 
Additionally, all subjects will receive paper medication calendars to keep track of each dose 
taken and to return to study staff at each visit.  
(s) Two subtests, Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning, from the Weschler Abbrev iated Scale of 
Intelligence (WASI),  a Color -Word Interference Test subtest from the Delis Kaplan 
Executive Functioning Scale (DKEFS), and the [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). 
(All subjects consent to the cognitive assessments, with the intention tha t they  will be 
completed to the ext ent that time, subject schedule, and circumstances allow during the study 
visit.)  
All blood samples will be drawn fasting or at least two hours after food.  Subjects who are unable 
to fast overnight will have the option to  complete the metabolic test while fasting for two hours.  
 
 
Combined Screening and Baseline Visit  
For subjects who live or attend school far from [LOCATION_011], we may offer to combine the first two 
visits, the screen and baseline. Because these visits occur wit hin [ADDRESS_521981] difficulty with the time and expense necessary to come to [LOCATION_011] twice within this 
period. In the case of the combined visit, subjects will be phone -screened by a study co -
investigator prior to scheduling the v isit to make sure that inclusion cr iteria are met and 
exclusion criteria ruled out.  Some information regarding exclusion criteria that we will not be 
able to gather prior to the combined visit would be bone age < 14 years, hematocrit<30% and an 
abnormal T SH level. Subjects with any history  of thyroid disorder will not be eligible for the 
combined visit. To ensure that bone age of subjects completing the combined visit is mature 
enough to continue study participation, we will restrict the combined visit to subjects who are of 
a chronological  age of 16 years or older at the time of the visit, making it very likely that the 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     9  bone age is > [ADDRESS_521982] and hand at the combined visi t indicates a bone age of <14 years . Study drug will be 
started only after inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed at the combined visit.  
 
Subjects will complete all screening and baseline procedures at this visit. The subject will be 
consented an d a complete medical history and ph ysical exam will be performed before 
continuing with further study procedures. If subject is found to have any health concern or is 
found to meet any exclusion criterion during the history and physical, further study comp onents 
will be canceled. Following this portion of the visit, the subject will complete the rest of the 
study procedures occurring at the screening and baseline visit, including:  
(c) History and physical exam including Tanner stage, height and weight.  
(d) Blood l aboratory tests for glucose, TSH, L H, FSH, potassium and hematocrit, IGF -1, urine or

 No treatment thus far has been successful in increasing bone density in adolescent girls 
with anore xia nervosa. Weight gain is associa ted with some increase in bone density, but is 
difficult to attain (occurs in only 50%) and sustain.  There are currently no FDA -approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_414158] -induced bone loss.  
Alternate strategies to address lo w bone density in AN : (1) Recovery of weight and menses:  
Although weight and menses recovery is associated with some increase in BMD, this increase is 
not sufficient to cause bone accrual to normalize, and BMD remains lower than in controls (54). 
Additionally, recovery can be hard to attain and sustain. (2) Calcium and vitamin D 
supplementation: Many studies have now shown that calcium and vitamin D supplementation is 
not sufficient to increase BMD in AN. BMD remains  low in these girls despi[INVESTIGATOR_414159] D intake than in controls (9, 12, 54) . (3) Bisphosphonates : Given their very long 
half life, bisphosphonates are typi[INVESTIGATOR_414160] r eproductive age. In 
addition, data indicate that alendronate use is ineffective in increasing BMD at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_414161] (55). (4) PTH : Teriparatide increases BMD in post -menopausal women (56), however, 
PTH is not recommended in young people at  this time given reports of osteosa rcoma with PTH 
use in animal models (57, 58) . 
Alternate strategies to assess bone microarchitecture  and strength : MRI of the peripheral 
skeleton has lower  resolution, longer scan t ime and increased susceptibility to  image post -
processing. QCT could also be used to assess trabecular bone structure and density of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].

pQCT low radiatio n and technique precision makes it the optimal choice. We have compared 
bone structure as assessed by [CONTACT_84888] -pQCT in girls with AN and healthy adolescent girls. Finally, 
we have demonstrated our ability to perform FEA from assessments of bone structure in a 
population of women with AN, and have  shown that bone strength is associated strongly with 
bone trabecular volume (59). FEA is easily derived using HR -pQCT data (28, 60 -63).

Risks from medications:  
RhIGF -I administration in the  dose being used in this study is a ssociated with few side 
effects. This medication is approved by [CONTACT_414190] -I 
deficiency at a dose of 40 -80 mcg/kg sc twice daily (up to 120 mcg/kg sc twice daily).  As per 
the package ins ert for rhIGF -I for this indication : mild or moderate hypoglycemia (very rarely 
severe), thought to be related to the drug's insulin -like activities, may occur in up to 42% of 
patients on this medication during the course of therapy. More severe hypoglycem ia is rare. The 
peak hypoglycemic e ffect of IGF-I occurs [ADDRESS_521987] not observed hypoglycemia in su bjects in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_414163]-I shots. Our subjects were instructed to take rhIGF -I within half an hour of a meal and 
these recommendations will hold in the proposed study, in which the doses we will use will be 
much lower than those used in prima ry IGF -I deficiency. We will also a ssess fasting glucose 
levels at all study visits. The safety and efficacy of rhIGF -I has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_414191] a study in adult women with AN (64, 65) , in which 30 ad ult women with AN received 30 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     12  mcg/kg of rhIGF -I sc twice daily. RhIGF -I was well tolerated in this study (65). Other 
occasionally reported side effects of rhIGF -1 include bruising and redness at the injection site, 
lymphoid hypertrophy and snoring, lipohypertrophy, chronic middle ear effusions, raised 
intracranial pressure (headaches, visi on changes, vomiting), slipped capi [INVESTIGATOR_414164], and arthralgias. Rotating 
injection sites will be advised and a close watch on other clinical features implemented. Also, as 
the drug is a pharmaceutical protein, a nti-IGF-1 antibody formation can occur. 14 of 23 subjects 
treated for 2 years with the drug in one study experi enced some degree of anti -IGF-1 antibody 
formation, though no clinical consequences (allergic reaction or loss  of efficacy) were observed 
(from p ackage insert). However, as with any exogenously administered protein, local or systemic 
allergic reactions may occur. Parents and subjects will be informed that such reactions are 
possible and that if an allergic reactio n occurs, treatment should be inter rrupted and prompt 
medical attention sought. Because we will be giving a smaller dose of rhIGF -1 (30 mcg/kg sc 
twice  daily),  we expect to see fewer side effects than indicated in the package insert. These risks 
of side ef fects are justified in light of the  anticipated benefit of improved bone density and 
lowered immediate and lifetime fracture risk with treatment during this critical period of bone 
mass accrual.  The rhIGF -1 dose will be increased or decreased by [CONTACT_8622]  25% to maintain IGF -1 
levels in the upp er half of the normal range.  We will titrate the dose using a maximum of two 
dose increments. Thus the maximum dose will be 46.88 mcg/kg twice daily.  
Estrogen administration in the doses being administered is associated with minimal possible 
side effects.  Occasional side effects may occur, the most comm on of which are mild headaches, 
and very rarely some irritation or redness at the application site for transdermal estrogen. 
Adverse reactions that have been reported with estrogen therapy include abnormal b leeding 
patterns, changes in nature and quantity of vaginal discharge, tenderness and enlargement of 
breasts, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, gallbladder disease, rashes, intolerance to 
contact [CONTACT_13276], migrain es, dizziness, depression, abnormal  movements, and changes in weight. 
These adverse effects are, however, rare, and seen more commonly with the estrogen taken 
orally rather than transdermally. More serious side effects include hypertension, lipid and 
clotting disorders. These are more commo nly seen in older women and in women with a family 
history of clotting disorders. Continuous estrogen administration without cyclic progesterone can 
predispose the uterus to cancer. Because we will be administering proges terone for ten days 
every month, th is should not be a concern.   We will monitor the subject s’ blood pressure at each 
visit and will also determine through careful questioning and examination the appearance of any 
side-effect at each visit.  Estrogen admin istration in pregnancy may be terat ogenic. We will thus 
perform a pregnancy test prior to administering estrogen.  
We will not enroll subjects with the following absolute  contraindications to estrogen therapy:  
• Known or suspected pregnancy  
• Undiagnosed abnorm al uterine bleeding  
• History of clot ting disorders such as thrombophlebitis and thromboembolic disorders  
• Known or suspected cancer of the breasts, uterus or ovaries.  
 
Relative contraindications such as migraines and smoking history will be decided on a case  by 
[CONTACT_414192] -effects of the medication.  
Subsequent management will be decided based on the severity of the side -effect.  
Use of replacement or higher dose s of estrogen before epi[INVESTIGATOR_414165].  To avoid

Oral progesterone  has been associated with clotting abnormalities, dizziness, nausea, 
abdominal pain, fatigue, headaches, insomnia, nervousness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_414166].  Rare cases  of breast cancer have been reported in women taking combined estrogen 
and progesterone.  Rare instances of abnormal liver function have also been reported.  The doses 
of progesterone that will be given are small and are less likely to cause these side eff ects. 
Particularly micronized progesterone (Prometrium) is associated with few adverse effects.  
Oral calcium  can cause constipation and a metallic taste in the mouth.  
Vitamin D  in the doses being administered does not cau se any side effects.  
Physician Avai lability :  A physician will be available by [CONTACT_414193] a subject may have. All efforts will be made 
to protect the confidentiality of study sub jects who will be referred to by [CONTACT_414194]. 
 
Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for 
removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack  of 
improvement and/or unacceptable  adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
Subjects will be instructed to call us if they develop any side -effects from the study 
medication s, or if symptoms of hypogl ycemia are experienced. They  will be advised to take [ADDRESS_521989], will be notified.   
If subjects are uncomfortable with any portion of any study visit, this portion will be 
discontinued or not performed.  
Discontinuation  criteria for subjects:  
1. Pregnancy (f or any subject)  
2. Identification o f characteristics meeting criteria for exclusion (for any subject)  
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devi ces/procedures being studied and/or  administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
Complications of surgical and non -surgical procedures:  There is a risk of superficial 
bruising and discomfort at the venepuncture site. Rarely, fainting (from a vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) or a 
treatable infection may occur. An intravenous catheter will be in place  for frequent sampling 
overnight at  baseline and at the end of the study. This may cause discomfort for the duration of

Risks from medications:  
RhIGF -I administration in the dose being used in this study is associated with few side effects. 
This medication is approved by [CONTACT_414195] I GF-I deficiency at a 
dose of 40 -80 mcg/kg sc twice daily (up to 120 mcg/kg sc twice daily).  As per the package 
insert for rhIGF -I for this indication: mild or moderate hypoglycemia (very rarely severe), 
thought to be rel ated to the drug's insulin -like act ivities, may occur in up to 42% of patients on 
this medication during the course of therapy. More severe hypoglycemia is rare. The peak 
hypoglycemic effect of IGF-I occurs [ADDRESS_521992] not observed hypoglycemia in subjects in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_414163] -I shots. Our subjects were instructed to take rhIGF -I within half a n hour of a meal and

EXPECTED BENEF ITS 
Describe both the expected bene fits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects , for example, “It is hoped that th e 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or s ociety, e.g., through increased kno wledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
 
There are no direct known benefits to study volunteers from the study. However, there is the 
prospect of direct benefit to study volunt eers as they may have improved bone  density and bone 
microarchitecture after study treatment. This research may lead to an improved understanding of the 
disordered bone metabolism in teenage girls with AN and whether administration of IGF -1, a key bone 
anabolic factor, with low -dose estroge n therapy, is effective in increasing peak bone mass in this 
population  compared with estrogen alone .  The potential benefits are thought to warrant the risks 
described above.

Explain in  detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_94878].  Include any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment  of women 
and minorities.
 
1) Subjects will be recruited from a large population of patients with AN from the following 
locations:  
[CONTACT_414206] and Kamryn Eddy Ph.D  have organized a group of over 30 AN health care 
providers in New England (The New Engla nd Eating Disorders Research Collaborative). This 
group includes the directors of 15 major eating disorders with in - and out -patient services 
throughout New England and representatives from many major colleges and Univers ity health 
services.  The group mee ts quarterly for two hour sessions to discuss recruitment strategies for 
MGH AN studies, review MGH research findings and discuss published data from other groups. 
This group represents a concerted and collaborative effor t to recruit subjects with AN to th e 
MGH studies and funnels patients into these studies from all over the New England area.  It has 
been developed into an effective recruitment tool. The group includes:

operating eating disorders clinic in New England.  The Eating Disorders Unit in the 
[LOCATION_005] General H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_414171].  
Since its inception in 1981, the Clinic has evaluated more tha n 4000 patients with AN and/or 
bulimia nervosa.  Over [ADDRESS_521997] participated in studies of low 
bone density, obsessive compulsive symptomatology, childhood sexual trauma, and 
pharmacological  treatment.  
(iii)  The Harris Center, pre viously the Harvard Eating Disorders Center, in which Kamryn 
Eddy, Ph.D is involved , brings together many of the eating disorders programs at Harvard 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], including Deaconess Waltham Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  It also hosts annual dinners and sends out 
biannual news letters that inform clinicians and families of eating disordered patients about new 
research opportunities.  T he Harris Center is a national non -profit organization whose goal is to 
promote the healthy development of wome n and others at risk through resear ch, training, 
outreach and prevention.  The Harris Center web -site is a frequently hit ED site, and details 
about the study will be available on that site.  The Harris Center networks regularly with major 
treatment center s for eating disorders in Connectic ut, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, 
and Maine and with the 250 college health centers in the Greater [LOCATION_011] area;   
(iv)   Walden Behavioral Care.  The Neuroendocrine Unit is invited to give monthly 
educational talks to patients and provide information ab out ongoing studies at the inpatient, 
partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414172].  The service admits about 280 in - and 
outpatients with eating disorders each year  
(v)   The [LOCATION_005] Eating Disorders Association, w hich runs support groups for women 
and teenagers with eating disorders throughout eastern [LOCATION_005];

[LOCATION_005] Institute of Technology, [LOCATION_011] University, [LOCATION_011] Colle ge, Brandeis University, 
Emerson Co llege, and Wellesley College  
(vii)   Facebook Advertisements. We also plan to use Facebook advertising to reach potentially 
interested subjects living in the [LOCATION_011] area. Women ages 18 -45 living in New England will see 
advertis ements for this research study in t he “News Feed” section of their Facebook and be 
directed to an IRB approved RedCap prescreen survey. These advertisements will in no way be 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_521998] no 
link to any specific personal, profile or browsing history information. Examples of these 
advertisements are attached to this study protocol in Insigh t. A general Facebook page has also  
been created for this study (a Facebook requirement) and includes only basic contact [CONTACT_414197]. A copy of this page is also attached to this study protocol in Insight.  
(viii) Hasbro Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414173]. We work with [CONTACT_414210] il 
Donaldson and her team of providers to recruit subjects from Hasbro. This recruitment site will 
also function as an offsite clinic for follow up visits to provide Hasbro patients the opportunity to 
participate in the s tudy with greater convenience. Subj ects who are interested in the study can 
complete the eligibility portion of the screening visit at Hasbro and come to MGH for the 
consent process and baseline, [ADDRESS_521999] ices.  Recruitment will occur through collaboration with 
physicians and caregivers at the above centers, and advertisement (i.e. posters, newsletters, and 
papers) in the community.  
All subjects 18 years and older, and gua rdians of subjects younger than 18 years will sign an 
approved consent form, and all subjects 14 -17 years old will sign their assent in this PHRC -
approved Consent Form detailing study procedures.  The consent and assent forms will be read 
to subjects and t heir guardians and signed in the pr esence of the study investigator. Minor 
subjects who turn 18 years of age during the course of the study will be asked to sign the 
approved consent form as an adult.  In cases where the parents live out of state and find it 
difficult or inconvenient to com e to [LOCATION_011], we will ask the IRB for an exception to the protocol 
such that the study can be explained to parents and subjects over the phone and consent forms 
mailed/faxed to the parents/subjects to sign and send back to  us.  We will conduct the consent 
interview by [CONTACT_414198].  PHRC policy on 
Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English will be 
followed. Potential subjects will be g iven a written translation in a lan guage understandable to 
them of the “short form” of the consent form or of the entire English version of the consent form 
approved by [CONTACT_414199].  
Psychologist co -investigators who obtain consent from subjects, if they are a lso treating 
psychologists, will no t recruit their own patients for the study.    
 
2) Subjects will also be recruited by [CONTACT_2329] a REDCap survey, where all email 
correspondence will be done using encryption, as per institutional policy. Subjects can express 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_522000] information and filling out eligibility criteria by 
[CONTACT_414200].  
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participation, it is often the case th at extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out -of-pocket expenses related to 
study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such 
expenses when fundin g is available
 
AN subjects will re ceive $90 for completing each outpatient visit, except for the 
screening visit . AN subjects  will also receive $50 each for completing the optional Baseline 
and 12 Month MRI, as well as reimbursement up to $25 per visit fo r parking and/or 
transportation cos ts to MGH. Healthy subjects will receive $100 for completing the study 
visit, as well as reimbursement up to $25 for parking and/or transportation costs to MGH. 
AN subjects can receive up to $910 for completing this study  and its MRI sub -study, and 
healthy  subjects can receive up to $100.

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of co nsent 
(i.e., how long subjects will  be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subje cts are to be enrolled from among t he 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
Parent /guardian  consent and child assent will be obtained after describing the purpose of 
the study and its requirements to the sub jects and their parents /guardians , and prior to performing 
any procedures.  Per institutional guidelines, those study volunteers who are 14 -17 years will 
document their written assent on the same PHRC approved consent form as their 
parents /guardians . The permission of one parent /guardian  will be sufficient to document on the 
consent form.  The consent form will be signed in the presence of a licensed physician  or 
psychologist  investigator or study nurse practitioner. Psychologists obtaining consent will ho ld a 
PhD or PsyD degree, be license d to practice psychology in [LOCATION_005], and be listed as co-
investigators on study staff. When consent is being obtained by a nurse practitioner or clinical 
psychologist, an optional consultation with a licensed physic ian investigator must be offered to  
all potential subjects before they sign the consent form. This offer, and its acceptance or refusal 
by [CONTACT_11275], must be documented in the research record. Any issues or problems with 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     20  the consent process mus t be reported to the PHRC as they o ccur, as “Other Event,” not logged 
and held for continuing review.  Subjects will have up to 6 weeks to consider participation. Minor 
subjects who turn 18 years of age during  the course of the study will be asked to sign t he 
approved consent form as an adul t.   
In cases where the parents live out of state and find it difficult or inconvenient to come to 
[LOCATION_011], we will ask the IRB for an exception to the protocol such that the study can be explained 
to parents and subjects over the phone and consent forms ma iled/faxed to the parents/subjects to 
sign and send back to us.   The consent interview will be conducted by [CONTACT_414201].

Describe the plan to be followed by [CONTACT_079]/study staff for review of adverse 
events experienced by [CONTACT_17847]/her care, and when applicab le, for review of sponsor 
safety re ports and DSMB reports.  Describe the plan for reporting adverse events to the sponsor 
and the Partners’ IRB and, when applicable, for submitting sponsor safety reports and DSMB 
reports to the Partners’ IRBs.  When the in vestigator is also the sponsor of t he IND/IDE, include 
the plan for reporting of adverse events to the FDA and, when applicable, to investigators at 
other sites.   
 
NOTE: In addition to the adverse event reporting requirements of the sponsor, the principal  
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_414176] 10 days per PHRC guidelines. These 
events will be promptly related to the IRB and FDA by [CONTACT_144224]. Mild and moderate 
adverse events will be reported to the Partners IRB per guidelines. All adverse events will also be 
reviewed every six months during the DSMB meetings.  
 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Describe the plan to be followed by t he principal investigator/study sta ff to monitor and assure 
the validity and integrity of the data and adherence to the IRB -approved protocol.  Specify who 
will be responsible for monitoring, and the planned frequency of monitoring.  For example, 
specify w ho will review the accuracy and com pleteness of case report form entries, source 
documents, and informed consent.   
 
NOTE: Regardless of monitoring plans by [CONTACT_17846], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_414177] s tudy is conducted at his/her invest igative site in 
accordance with the IRB -approved protocol, and applicable regulations and requirements of the 
IRB.
 
Specimens:  Blood specimens and all other testing will be obtained from subjects for research 
purposes onl y. From the study visits, most bloo d samples will be frozen and stored in freezers in the 
Neuroendocrine Unit of [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. These freezers are accessible to no one but 
the Neuroendocrine staff. Some blood samples will be sent to the ch emistry laboratories of MGH for 
analysis, and left over samples will be disposed of as per institutional guidelines.  
The privacy of subjects and confidentiality of data obtained from subjects will be maintained strictly. 
In any reports or publications resu lting from the study, the privacy a nd anonymity of individuals in the 
report will be protected. The subject's name [CONTACT_414204]. Subjects will be assigned a code, whi ch will be 
used in all data used fo r analysis.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     22  Adverse Events:  Serious Related Adverse Events will be reported within 10 days per 
PHRC guidelines.  These events will be promptly related to the IRB and FDA by [CONTACT_60821]. Mild and moderate adverse events will be reported to the Part ners IRB per 
guidelines. All adverse events will also be reviewed every six months during the DSMB 
meetings.  
Data Quality Control:   All data will be recorded on specified Case Report Forms.  
Completed forms will be sent t o [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39202] d retained at the remote site.  
As forms are received at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they will be logged into a forms 
calendar, which contains all subjects’ code numbers and dates of each follow -up visit. In our 
exper ience, this has facilitated an easy , accurate, and global check of each subject's status, as 
well as providing recruitment and drop -out information . After each form is logged, it will be 
carefully checked for legibility and completeness and for ambiguity.  Data from the forms, 
including lab oratory results, will be entered into an electronic database.  Forms that have missing 
or inconsistent data will also be entered into the database, except that a missing value indicator 
will take the place of the missing or inconsistent information. A miss ing information form will 
be filled out to indicate the items that are missing.  
Forms that are complete will be filed in a dedicated locked filing cabinet organized by 
[CONTACT_235199]. Forms that have missing data wil l be kept separately for ease of no tifying 
coordinators.  
Accuracy  of data entry will be checked using different methods at the beginning of the 
study and later when site monitoring has started.  At the start of the study, before the first site 
monitoring d ata is returned, the coordinator wi ll check [ADDRESS_522004] the case records each month.  If the error rate of data entry is worse than 2.5% overall or 
appears in crucial variables we will consider that a “data entry problem” exists and initiate 
whatever correc tive action is necessary. One corrective action would be to initiate double entry 
of all data.

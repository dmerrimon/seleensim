OBJECTIVES : 
Is there  an identifiable  difference  in the number  of insertions  and redirections  of the needle  for a 
lumbar  neuraxial  procedure  when  the VerTouch  device  is used,  instead  of palpation  (current  
gold standard)  or ultrasound  guidance  (US),  for the identificati on of the procedural  insertion  
site?   
 
Null Hypothesis:  
There  is no difference  in the number  of insertions  and redirections  of the needle  for a lumbar  
neuraxial  procedure  when  the VerTouch  device  is used.   
 
 
BACKGROUND : 
Literature:   
Neuraxial  procedures  are performed  across  a myriad  of clinical  scenarios.  From  spi[INVESTIGATOR_897529]-
sia for caesarian  sections,  to epi[INVESTIGATOR_897530],  to lum-
bar punctures  and lumbar  drain  placements  for the diagnosis  and mana gement  of neurologic  
illness,  accessing  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_897531].  Anesthesiologists,  neurologists,  neurosurgeons,  emergency  physicians,  and other  
providers  learn  and perform  neuraxial  access  with meticulous  precision  and attention  to detail  to 
avoid  damaging  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102].  The best-in-breed  methods  for ensuring  safety  continue  to rely 
on provider  experience  and palpation  (using  the fingers)  of the back  and surrounding  land-
marks.  Some  practitioners  use ultrasound,  which  is bulky,  costly,  and requires  yet additional  
training.  As such,  the safety  of these  procedures  has plateaued.  They  are not unsafe  by [CONTACT_148457]  – the rates  of complications  can be as low as in the single  digits  of percentage  when  per-
formed by [CONTACT_897543].  A new device  (the VerTouch),  holds  promise  to reduce  the 
complication  rate for the first time in years,  as well as allow  providers  with significantly  less train-
ing to achieve  the same,  low complication  rate. 
 
VerTouch  incorporates  tactile  sensing—a form of electronic  palpation —to detect  spi[INVESTIGATOR_897532]-
marks,  analogous  to those  sensed  during  manual  palpation.  This technology  is most  prevalent  
in robotics,  but has recently  been  applied  as a clinical -imaging  tool in breast,  prostate,  and other  
soft-tissue  applications.  The device  comprises  an array  of pressure  sensors—also known  as 
force -sensing  resistors —which,  when  pressed  against  the back,  measure  the distribution  of me-
chanical  stress  across  the compressed  tissue.  These  data are processed  and communicated  to 
the device’s  display  as a full-color,  2D pressure  map of patient  anatomy.  Regional  differences  in 
elasticity/hardness  are observed  as gradations  between  deep  blue (for areas  of low firmness)  to 
red (for areas  of higher  firmness,  e.g. bone).  
 
In this project  we aim to compare  the VerTouch  device  to palpation  and US techniques  used  to 
identifying  the anatomic  landmarks  and optimal  location  for neuraxial  access.  In a previous  fea-
sibility  study  completed  here at Northwestern  University  (NU)  in Prentice  Women’s  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
(stu#:  00207454),  the researchers  showed  that when  VerTouch  was used  to mark  a site prior to 
the neuraxial  procedure,  and the site marked  was eventually  used  for the procedure,  the suc-
cess rate of the procedure  with minimal  needle  manipulation  was greater  than historical  data for 
the gold standard  palpation  technique.  Additionally,  the provider  confidence  in the information  
provided  by [CONTACT_897544] 95% (abstract  and/or  submitted  manuscript  for this 
study  can be provided  on request).  The proposed  RCT herein  will be a prospective  comparison

SIGNIFICANCE:  
Thousands  of neuraxial  procedures  are completed  daily with over 12,000  done  at Prentice  
Women’s  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_897533].  These  procedures  are not without  difficulty  and complication.  The 
gold standard  of palpation  and blind  advancement  of the needle  toward  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_897534]-
ter insertion  to avoid  the bones  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_897535].  These  insertions  and 
redirections  are not only time consumin g while  the patient  is in an uncommon  position,  but they 
also cause  discomfort  and possibly  lasting  pain days  after the procedure.  In addition  to the pa-
tient dynamics,  when  anatomical  or positioning  issues  result  in difficult  neuraxial  procedures  the 
commo n teaching  is to attempt  US guided  access.  Unfortunately,  not many  proceduralist  are 
trained  in this modality  and the additional  materials  needed  to perform  the procedure  with US 
take time to gather  and further  prolong  the procedure.  Additionally,  though  the cost of US tech-
nology  is getting  more  reasonable,  it is still rather  expensive  and a barrier  to utilization  by [CONTACT_897545].  Often,  after many  attempts,  the proceduralist  accepts  
failure  of the procedure  and refers  the patient  to the interventional  radiology  (IR) or pain medi-
cine specialist  for completion  of the procedure  using  radiation  to visualize  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Note,  this is 
not an option  for pregnant  women  who are not eligible  for radiation  due to fetal concerns.  
 
The VerTouch  offers  a non-invasive,  untethered,  and non-radiation  producing  device  that allows  
for the visualization  of the underlying  structures  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_897536]-
ment  for neuraxial  procedures.  The output  on the screen  can also be visualized  by [CONTACT_897546]-
ers or senior  proceduralist  for assistance  with best course  of action  for the procedure.  The de-
vice does  not cause  discomfort  to the patient  and does  not require  any additional  materials  to be 
functional.   
 
This study  has the potential  to show  that the VerTouch  is more  effective  than palpation  and as 
effective  as US at defining  the location  for neuraxial  procedure  initiation  and eventual  success.  If 
the VerTouch  device  is capable  of improving  the consistency  of success  of neuraxial  proce-
dures,  while  minimizing  need  for costly  and cumbersome  US technology  and decreasing  referral  
to radiation  requiring  procedures,  the benefit  to patients  and proceduralists  would  be exponen-
tial. 
 
STUDY  ENDPOINTS:  The primary  endpoint  is the combined  total number  of insertions  or 
redirection  of the needle  being  used  for the procedure.  
The endpoint  is when  all the subjects  for each  arm have  been  recruited  and completed  study  
procedures.  
 
STUDY  INTERVENTION(S)   / INVESTIGATIONAL  AGENT(S):  
We will use the VerTouch  device  which  we have  shown  to be a non-significant  risk device  (IDE).  
It is comprised  of a non-invasive  pressure  sensor  that is gently  pushed  against  the back,  with a 
screen  that reads  out the pressure  being  applied  across  the device. Areas  of higher  pressure  
are suggestive  of bony  areas,  whereas  areas  of lower  pressure  are more  likely  tissue.  The ap-
plication  of the device  to the body  is less obtrusive  than ultrasound,  which  is commonly  used,  
because  this device  does  not use any gel or other  medium.  
 
The device  will be stored  in a locked  space  only accessible  to the proceduralist  or research  per-
sonnel  authorized  to prepare  the device  for use. The device  is self-contained  and powered  by 
[CONTACT_897547].  The device  will only be at the bedside  for those  subjects  that

 Version  Date:  1.1 03/26/2021  Page  4 of 9 
HRP -593 / v05202020  have  been  recruited  to participate.  In order  to maintain  blinding,  even  if the device  is not used  
for the recruited  patient  it will be at the bedside  to ensure  the observers  are not un-blinded.   
 
PROCEDURES  INVOLVED:  
 
The study  participants  will be recruited  in two parallel  cohorts  – pregnant  patients  and non-preg-
nant patients.  Pregnant  patients  tend to be healthy  and without  comorbidities,  and the providers  
(anesthesiologists)  that perform  the neuraxial  procedure  tend to have  significant  experience.  
Non-pregnant  patients  tend to require  neuraxial  access  for diagnostic  or therapeutic  purposes  
(i.e. not for the relief  of labor  pains),  and therefore  have  comorbidities.  Additionally,  these  pro-
viders  (ER, neurology,  etc.) tend to do far less of these  procedures.  Together,  these  two tracks  
provide  the breadth  of neuraxial  access  and therefore  maximally  determine  early  feasibility  of 
this device.   
 
For both pregnant  and non-pregnant  patients,  the study  procedure  is the same.  Eligible  patients  
will be identified  by [CONTACT_897548],  as follows:  
 
Labor  & Delivery : Patients  will be identified  in communication  with the OB anesthesia  team  that 
maintains  an “electronic  tracking  board”  in the interdisciplinary  workroom  in Prentice.  Only pa-
tients  early  in labor,  who are in relatively  low amounts  of pain and distress,  will be approached  
by [CONTACT_897549].  If the patient  agrees  to participate  in the 
study  she will be randomized  that time to one of the three  arms  (palpation,  US, or VerTouch).   
 
Lumbar  Puncture : Patients  scheduled  to undergo  diagnostic  or therapeutic  lumbar  puncture  
will be identified  by [CONTACT_897550].  If a patient  is determined  to be eligi-
ble for the study  by [CONTACT_897551].  The study  team  will arrange  to be present  for 
the procedure  at the scheduled  appointment  time.  The proceduralist  or study  team  member  will 
consent  the patient,  and if the patient  agrees  to participate  in the study  he/she  will be random-
ized that time to one of the three  arms  (palpation,  US, or VerTouch).  
 
Randomization:

Participants  will be randomized  to treatment  groups  based  on a random  computer -generated  
schedule  (https://www.randomizer.org ). Proceduralists  will not be blinded  to randomization,  
however  blinded  research  personnel  will observe  the procedure  after site determination  and col-
lect all outcome  measures  in this study.  
 
For groups  1-3, on request  of neuraxial  procedure  the research  nurse  and proceduralist  willh 
proceed  to the patient’s  room  with all normal  supplies  in addition  to the VerTouch  and US ma-
chine  designated  for this study.  The research  nurse  will then un-blind  to proceduralist  to the pa-
tient’s  group  and site identification  will proceed.  Regardless  of the group,  the proceduralist  will 
make  a mark  at the site identified  for the procedure  using  a chlorhexidine  safe surgical  marking  
pen. After  completion  of marking,  the research  nurse  will notify  the observer  that they may enter  
the room  to observe  the procedure  and collect  the relevant  data.  Observers  will be limited  to 
3observers,  and additionally  inter-observer  variability  will be minimized  using  video  corrobora-
tion of at least  [ADDRESS_1258090]  will be un-blinded.  
He/she  will proceed  to mark  the patient  with the appropriate  modality  determined  by [CONTACT_897552].  After  marking,  the proceduralist  will allow  the research  observer  to enter  the room  to 
observe  the procedure  and collect  the relevant  data.  Observers  will be limited  to [ADDRESS_1258091]  procedures  for neuraxial  procedures  will be followed  (standard  practice)  after site

SHARING  RESULTS  WITH  PARTICIPANTS  
Results  will not be shared  with participants.  
 
STUDY  TIMELINES  
The individual  will participate  in the study  for the duration  of the procedure,  which  is usually  ap-
proximately  half an hour.  It will take approximately  one year to enroll  all participants,  and ap-
proximately  [ADDRESS_1258093]  a plastic  allergy,  or are un-
able to consent.   
 
Other  special  populations  (individuals  who are not yet adults,  prisoners,  vulnerable  populations)  
will also be excluded.  
 
If it is impossible  to take a photograph  that does  not include  identifying  marks  on the back  (i.e. a 
birthmark  or tattoo)  the patient  will be excluded  from the video  portion  of the study  
 
 
VULNERABLE  POPULATIONS  
Pregnant  women  will be included  in the study  because  they make  up the primary  population  that 
will benefit  from the success  of this device.  As otherwise  young  and healthy  females,  they also 
represent  a group  that, if a serious  adverse  effect  of neuraxial  access  were  to occur,  could  re-
sult in significantly  lifelong  morbidity.  
 
The device  has been  tested  on cadavers,  [ADDRESS_1258094]  from the success  of the 
device.  If this device  were  to be successful  in identifying  the optimum  needle  placement  for epi-
dural  placement  in pregnant  women,  this could  one day significantly  reduce  the discomfort  and 
possible  side effects  of neuraxial  procedures  in pregnant  women.  Notably,  a relatively  large  per-
centage  (up to 5%) of women  will experience  a significant  headache  after neuraxial  access  due 
to “blind” needle  guidance.  This can be debilitating,  especially  in the setting  of labor  and birth.  
This non-invasive,  inexpensive  device  holds  promise  to one day reduce  this morbidity  and 
therefore  significantly  improve  the experience  of these  women  during  the birth of their child.

COMPENSATION  FOR  PARTICIPATION  IN RESEARCH  ACTIVITIES  
There  will be no compensation  for participation.  
 
WITHDRAWAL  OF PARTICIPANTS  
Patients  can withdraw  from the study  at any time and their data will be deleted,  and in no way 
will this impact  their care since  the study  explicitly  does  not affect  the standard  of care.  The 
study  team  will notify  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_897541] a subject withdraws  from the study.  
 
RISKS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
No significant  risk to the patient  exists  with the utilization  of the VerTouch  device.  The materials  
on the device  that come  in contact  [CONTACT_897554].  The device  is non-invasive  and does  not generate  radi-
ation  or any other  emission  that would  affect  he patients  skin or underlying  tissues.  
 
POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
While  there  is no direct  benefit  to participants,  we do hope  that this will benefit  pregnant  and 
non-pregnant  patients  in the future  who are undergoing  neuraxial  procedures.  Our previous  fea-
sibility  study  did suggest  that the use of the VerTouch  may repres ent an improvement  on the 
current  gold standard  of palpation.

Based on the feasibility study data collected and published earlier this year at our institution the 
incidence of first insertion success when utilizing the VerTouch device is 90.1%. Using historical 
data from studies comparing Ultrasound to Palpation the first insertion success rates are 62.9 
and 43.6%, respectively. When utilizing the anticipated incidence of first insertion success for 
the VerTouch device and Ultrasound to complete a sample size calculation, given Type 1 and 
Type 2 error are 0.05 and 80% , respectively, each group must contain 38 patients. Therefore, 
when including the control "palpation" group, the total population needs to be 114 patients. We 
plan to recruit 120 patients, 40 in each group, to ensure appropriate sample size and allow un-
known possible exclusions of recruited patients."  
 
All photographs  will be maximally  zoomed  in. If it is impossible  to take a video  that does  not in-
clude  identifying  marks  on the back  (i.e. a birthmark  or tattoo)  no image  will be taken.  Data  will 
be stored  in REDcap  using  NM password  protected  computers  for data entry.  
Data  in REDcap  is backed  up nightly  using  NM servers  which  are only accessible  to the NM IT 
administrator.  Data  in REDcap  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]/videos  will be destroyed  5 years  after the comple-
tion of the study.

PROVISIONS  TO PROTECT  THE PRIVACY  INTERESTS  OF PARTICIPANTS  
Patients  in this study,  whether  undergoing  neuraxial  access  for a disease -state  or for the treat-
ment  of labor  pains,  will certainly  be under  some  amount  of stress.  Having  a needle  placed  into 
one’s  back,  as is the case  for neuraxial  procedures,  can be stress provoking.  Extra  care will be 
taken  to approach  them  during  a quiet  moment  when  the clinical  team  has finished  their evalua-
tion.  It will be emphasized  that in no way will this impact  their care,  and in fact can help future  
patients  undergo  these  proced ures more  quickly  and safely  to minimize  their stress.

to contemplate  their participation  up until 10 minutes  prior to the time of their neuraxial  proce-
dure (if any less than 10 minutes  were  available  for application  of the VerTouch  device  prior to 
the clinical  procedure,  this would  risk rushing  the clinical  procedure).  REDcap  electronic  consent

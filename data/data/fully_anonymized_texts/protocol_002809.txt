Description :  
This is a Phase II single-arm, open-label, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy for subjects with unresectable 
Stage III and Stage IV melanoma.  Previous cytokine therapy is permitted.  Subjects must have 
mea
surable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).  Subjects who 
are not candidates for curative intent treatments are eligible for this study.   
Treatment on study will be administered in 4-week cycles.  Paclitaxel will be administered 
intravenously at a starting dose of 80mg/m2 weekly for [ADDRESS_875088] stage of a 2-stage Simon Minimax design.  If there are 3 responses, 39 
additional subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2.  The minimum number of responses required to move 
to the second stage, > 3, were noted after the first 9 patients on treatment, and the study then 
proceeded towards the goal of accruing 60 total patients. Subjects are permitted to receive supportive 
care throughout the study including transfusion of blood and blood products, treatment with 
antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents, analgesics, erythropoietin, filgramostim 
(Neupogen), or bisphosphonates, when appropriate.  Subjects should continue treatment on study 
until objective disease progression is documented according to RECIST or withdrawal from the 
study for other reasons.  Subjects discontinuing treatment with paclitaxel prior to disease 
progression should continue treatment with pazopanib.  Subjects discontinuing both agents prior 
to PD will be followed for tumor assessment until PD, or until the initiation of a subsequent anti-
cancer therapy in the absence of documented PD, or until death, whichever occurs first.  Subjects

Version [ADDRESS_875089] study treatment. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (6- month 
P
FS) in this patient population. The secondary objectives are to evaluate 1- and 2- year survival , 
the objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response (DR) , 
incidence and severity of adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other safety 
parameters. Safety and efficacy assessments will be regularly performed on all subjects. 
Exploratory objectives are to observe angiogenic marker modulation by [CONTACT_159411], 
and when possible, to identify intra-tumoral biomarkers that correlate with or are predictive of 
clinical response/benefit to pazopanib and to identify gene and/or protein expression in tumor 
tissue that may be associated with clinical outcomes or response to therapy.  Other exploratory 
objectives, when possible, will correlate PD effects (increased diastolic blood pressure), plasma 
pr
oteins (serum VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor 2, serum HIF and serum TSP1) to tumor biopsy 
expression levels and clinical outcome.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Rationale  
Metastatic melanoma (MM) is a devastating and incurable disease lacking effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_652081], which include palliative chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the 
majority of patients succumb to their disease within 6 to 9 months of diagnosis [Homsi, 2005] .  
Because of the lack of treatment capable of prolonging the survival for patients with MM, many 
patients are treated with experimental therapy on clinical trials or with supportive care. 
 
Chemotherapy options for MM currently include dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide, platinum-
based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and taxanes. However, only DTIC is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use in palliative treatment for MM, based on studies performed in the 
1970s [Eggermont, 2004].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a response rate in MM of 13%–20% [Jelic, 2002], no 
sig
nificant benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival has been demonstrated 
with DTIC treatment. Temozolomide is an oral therapy related to DTIC that crosses the blood–
brain barrier. This property may be of benefit, given the high rate of brain metastases seen in 
melanoma [Middleton, 2000]. Temozolomide has not been approved by [CONTACT_652099], but has become the most common chemotherapy option for palliation in this 
disease. Taxanes, such as paclitaxel, which have been associated with a response rate in MM 
similar to that of DTIC, are another treatment option that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1622] 
[Gogas et al. 2004]. 
 
Combination regimens, including cisplatin, vinblastine, and DTIC (Dartmouth regimen or CVD), 
are associated with a higher response rate and increased toxicity compared with single-agent 
chemotherapy, but also lack a benefit in PFS and overall survival [Legha , 1989; Danson, 2005; 
F
laherty ,  2006].  The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin has moderate activity against 
malig
nant melanoma, with expected reversible hematologic toxicities.   Although not 
prospectively compared with single agents, this combination may be a treatment option for some 
patients [Hodi et al. 2002]. Use of combination chemotherapy remains a treatment option that 
some oncologists continue to use, owing to anecdotal reports of long-term responses. An 
immunotherapeutic treatment, high-dose interleukin-2, is the only other approved treatment for 
MM. This highly toxic treatment requires regular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51531] a specialized intensive care 
unit. This treatment is associated with a response rate of 10%–20% and long-term disease-free 
surviva
l (DFS) of 5% [Atkins, 2000]. However, it is also associated with a treatment morbidity 
ra
te of > 45% and a mortality rate of 2% [Atkins, 1999]. Combinations of chemotherapy and 
im
munotherapy, referred to as bio-chemotherapy, are an alternative treatment for highly selected 
patients, although a large Phase III study showed higher toxicity and efficacy similar to that of 
single-agent chemotherapy [Atkins, 2006]. 
 
As 
the result of the rapid rate of progressive disease seen in patients with MM and the lack of 
proven therapi[INVESTIGATOR_652082], MM is a disease for which a first-line 
experimental approach is reasonable (NCI website, 
http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/pdq/treatment/melanoma/HealthProfessional/page9 .

 Angiogenesis plays a role in melanoma progression and metastasis. [Mahabeleshwar, 2007].  A 
phase II study of axitinib, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-1, 2, and 3, in 
metastatic melanoma demonstrated an ORR of 19% in 32 patients Median overall survival was 
6.8 months with a median progression free survival of 2.3 months [Fruehauf, 2008].  A recent 
study of carboplatin + paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with sorafenib biologic therapy 
resulted in progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.8 months (historical controls have PFS of 2−4 
months) in a 100-patient, single-arm, Phase II study [Flaherty, 2006].  Bevacizumab, in 
combi
nation chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_652083], has also demonstrated antitumor in metastatic 
melanoma.  In a Phase II study evaluating carboplatin, weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab, nine 
(17%) patients achieved partial remission, and another 30 (57%) achieved stable disease for at 
least 8 weeks. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 6 months and 
12 months, respectively [Perez, 2009].    
Pazopanib is a small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-1,2,3, PDGFR-B and c-KIT. [Harris, 2008] 
In vitro and in vivo, pazopanib has demonstrated antiangiogenic activity as well as inhibition of 
xenograft tumor growth.  Established as tolerable, a randomized phase III trial to evaluate PFS in 
advanced RCC for pazopanib 800mg daily compared with placebo was initiated given a partial 
response (PR) rate at week 12 of 27% in a randomized discontinuation phase II trial of pazopanib 
in metastatic RCC. [Hutson, 2008] In melanoma, a single agent phase II study with pazopanib is 
planned. In light of the relevance of angiogenesis in melanoma and possible additive or 
synergistic benefit of other antiangiogenesis agents in combination with chemotherapy, a Phase 
II study of pazopanib in combination with chemotherapy in advanced stage melanoma is 
warranted. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) in 
subjects with unresectable Stage III and Stage IV melanoma.  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate 1- and 2- year survival, objective response rate (ORR), 
clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response (DR) , incidence and severity of adverse events 
(AE), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other safety parameters.  Safety and efficacy 
assessments will be regularly performed on all subjects.  
Exploratory objectives are to observe angiogenic marker modulation by [CONTACT_159411], 
and when possible, to identify intra-tumoral biomarkers that correlate with or are predictive of 
clinical response/benefit to pazopanib and to identify gene and/or protein expression in tumor 
tissue that may be associated with clinical outcomes or response to therapy.  Other exploratory 
objectives, when possible, will correlate PD effects (increased diastolic blood pressure), plasma 
pr
oteins (serum VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor 2, serum HIF and serum TSP1) to tumor biopsy 
expression levels and clinical outcome.

Approximately [ADDRESS_875098] stage of a 2-stage Simon Minimax design [Simon, 1989].  If there are 3 responses, 39 
additional subjects will be enrolled in this study.   
The study includes a Screening/Baseline Period, a Treatment Period and a post-treatment 
Follow-Up Period for progression-free survival and survival. After signing the informed consent, 
candidate subjects will be screened against all the eligibility criteria.  
All subjects will receive paclitaxel IV at 80mg/m2 and pazopanib 800mg oral daily dosing.  
Subjects are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion of 
blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents, 
analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. Study treatment will continue 
until a subject dies, or experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdraws 
consent for study participation. Dose interruptions or reductions may be required following 
potential drug-related toxicities. After discontinuation of study treatment, subjects will be 
followed until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow up or until [ADDRESS_875099].

1.1. Background 
1.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_652084] 5% of all cancers in the [LOCATION_002], with 62,480 new 
cases and 8,420 deaths expected to occur in 2008 with an increasing death rate since 1990.  A 
619%
 increased incidence of melanoma has been reported between 1950 and 2000, with a 165% 
increased mortality rate. Melanoma affects younger patients and is the second leading cause of 
lost productive years. It is the most common cancer in women 20 to 29 years of age. There is a 
slightly higher incidence in men than women, with 34,950 cases in men (5%) and 27,530 (4%) in 
women [SEER database, 2009] 
1.1.2. Current Treatment Options for Advanced Melanoma 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemotherapy 
The prognosis for patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma classified as Stage III and IV 
according to the Staging System of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) [See 
Section 11.1, Appendix 1], is poor with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10 percent [Jamal 
2008 ].  Chemotherapy options for MM currently include dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide, 
platinum-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and taxanes. However, only DTIC is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for use in palliative treatment for MM, based on studies performed 
in the 1970s [Eggermont, 2004]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a response rate in MM of 13%–20% [Jelic, 2002), no

melanoma [Middleton, 2000]. Temozolomide has not been approved by [CONTACT_652099], but has become the most common chemotherapy option for palliation in this 
disease. Taxanes, such as paclitaxel, which have been associated with a response rate in MM

Although not prospectively compared with single agents, this combination may be a treatment 
option for some patients [Hodi, 2002]. Use of combination chemotherapy remains a treatment

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Immunotherapy 
An immunotherapeutic treatment, high-dose interleukin-2, is the only other approved treatment 
for MM. This highly toxic treatment requires regular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51531] a specialized intensive 
care unit. This treatment is associated with a response rate of 10%–20% and long-term disease-
fr
ee survival (DFS) of 5% [Atkins, 2000]. However, it is also associated with a treatment 
morbidi
ty rate of > 45% and a mortality rate of 2% [Atkins, 1999]. Combinations of 
c
hemotherapy and immunotherapy, referred to as bio-chemotherapy, are an alternative treatment 
for highly selected patients, although a large Phase III study showed higher toxicity and efficacy 
similar to that of single-agent chemotherapy [Atkins, 2006]. 
 
As 
the result of the rapid rate of progressive disease seen in patients with MM and the lack of 
proven therapi[INVESTIGATOR_652082], MM is a disease for which a first-line 
experimental approach is reasonable [NCI website,

[IP_ADDRESS]. Anti-angiogenesis Therapy 
Axitinib, a potent oral VEGFR 1,2, and 3 inhibitor demonstrated single-agent activity with an 
ORR of 19% in a study of [ADDRESS_875100] or second line therapy.  
Additionally, an unplanned subset analysis demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with an 
increase in diastolic blood pressure during study therapy [Fruehauf, 2007].   
 
In a study of 32 patients with Stage IV MM who received either bevacizumab or bevacizumab 
plus low-dose interferon, one patient experienced a partial response and eight patients 
experienced prolonged disease stabilization (24–146 weeks) [Varker, 2007].  In a Phase II study 
evaluating carboplatin, weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab, nine (17%) patients achieved partial 
remission, and another 30 (57%) achieved stable disease for at least 8 weeks. Median 
progression-free survival and median overall survival were 6 months and 12 months, 
respectively [Perez, 2009].    
A recent study of carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with sorafenib biologic 
therapy resulted in progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.8 months (historical controls have PFS of 
2−4 months) in a 100-patient, single-arm, Phase II study [Flaherty, 2006]. This study has led to 
two ong
oing Phase III studies using the same regimen and has renewed interest in the carboplatin 
+ paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen in this disease setting [Rao, 2006; Hodi , 2002].

.1.3. Pazopanib: Preclinical and Clinical Experience 
Pazopanib is a potent, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of 
VEGFR-1, 
-2, -3, PDGFR-α and -β and c-kit, with half-maximal inhibition 
(IC50)
 values of 10, 30, 47, 71, 84 and 74 nM, respectively. It inhibits VEGF-
induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC) 
as well as in mouse lungs in a dose- dependent manner. Data from 
preclinical studies show pazopanib has significant growth inhibition of a

growth factor- ( bFGF-) and VEGF- induced angiogenesis in two mouse models of 
angiogenesis, viz., the Matrigel™  plug assay and the cornea micropocket model 
[[COMPANY_004] Pazopanib Investigator’s brochure version 7.0 ].  
 
GlaxoSmithKline initiated the clinical development of pazopanib in December 
2002. As of April, 2007, five Phase I, one Phase I/II, six Phase II, and one Phase III 
clinical studies had been initiated to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, 
clinical benefit, and efficacy of pazopanib alone or in combination with other compounds in 
patients with various types of cancer including renal cell carcinoma, ovarian, breast, 
multiple myeloma, and soft tissue sarcoma.

As of [ADDRESS_875102] received pazopanib 
as monotherapy or in combination out of approximately 7000 subjects enrolled 
in 
pazopanib oncology clinical studies. Data collected to date show that oral 
pazopanib 
is absorbed after administration and that pazopanib administration 
at 800 mg daily is associated with a reasonable safety profile and encouraging 
efficacy in various oncology settings.  
In VEG105192 a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of 
pazopanib 
monotherapy in subjects with advanced RCC), the median time on 
treatment was approximately twice that on placebo (7.4 months versus 3.8 
months) [Sternberg, 2010]. The overall frequency of AEs reported during the 
study 
was higher in the pazopanib arm (92%) compared with placebo (74%). Most 
common AEs reported in >20% subjects in the pazopanib arm (as of 23 May 2008 ) 
were 
diarrhea (52%), hypertension (40%), hair color change (depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]; 
38%), nausea (26%), anorexia (22%), and vomiting (21%).  These AEs were all 
reported at a higher incidence than in the placebo arm. Most of these events 
were Grade 1 or 2 using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0. More Grade 3 AEs were reported in 
the pazopanib arm (33%) compared with the placebo arm (14%). The frequency of 
Grade 4 AE and Grade 5 event was similar between the pazopanib and placebo 
arms: Grade 4 in 7% and 6% respectively; Grade 5 in 4% and 3% respectively. At 
the 
time of the final overall survival (OS) analysis, a subsequent review of 
safety data did not reveal any changes to the previously observed safety 
profile; no new safety signals were detected. [Sternberg, 2013] 
 
Based 
on the analysis of the safety data integrated across the 3 RCC studies 
VEG102616, (a Phase II study of pazopanib monotherapy in subjects with 
advanced RCC), VEG105192, and VEG107769 (a single arm Phase III extension 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 14 - 
 study of pazopanib monotherapy in subjects with advanced RCC) as of 09 January 
2009 
(N=593), the most common AEs and SAEs were similar to those observed in 
the pazopanib arm of VEG105192.  
 
Study VEG108844 was a randomized, open-label, parallel group Phase III non-
inferiority study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pazopanib compared 
with 
sunitinib in subjects with advanced RCC who had not received prior 
systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic RCC. Approximately 876 eligible 
subjects (approximately 438 per treatment arm) were planned to be enrolled 
over 
the course of the study. However, due to higher than expected withdrawal 
rates and discordance rates between Independent Review Committee (IRC) and 
investigator assessments of progression, the protocol was amended to increase 
the 
number of subjects to approximately 1100 total by [CONTACT_652100]108844 and VEG113078 (a substudy of VEG108844). VEG113078 was 
conducted in China, Korea, and Taiwan; enrolled the same subject population as 
VEG108844; and is almost identical in study design and conduct to allow 
integration of efficacy and safety data. 
 
A total of 1102 subjects were included in the safety population (pazopanib 554 
subjects; 
sunitinib 548 subjects). The median time on treatment was 8 months 
for pazopanib and 7.6 months for sunitinib. The overall frequency of AEs 
reported during the study was similar for each treatment group; 552 subjects 
(>99%) had AEs in the pazopanib arm and 544 subjects (>99%) had AEs in the 
sunitinib arm. However, differential safety profiles were observed between the 
treatment arms, with a statistically significant difference in frequencies 
(unadjusted for multiplicity) for many AEs. The most common AEs (>35% in 
either treatment arm) were diarrhea (63% in pazopanib arm, 57% in sunitinib 
arm), fatigue (55% in pazopanib arm, 63% in sunitinib arm), hypertension (46% 
in pazopanib arm, 41% in sunitinib arm), nausea (45% in pazopanib arm, 46% in 
sunitinib arm), decreased appetite (37% in pazopanib arm, 37% in sunitinib 
arm), dysgeusia (26% in pazopanib arm, 36% in sunitinib arm), and palmar-
plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome (or hand-foot syndrome [HFS]) (29% 
in 
pazopanib arm, 50% in sunitinib arm). Of these AEs, fatigue, HFS, and 
dysgeusia occurred more frequently in the sunitinib arm compared with the 
pazopanib arm based on 95% confidence interval (CI; unadjusted for 
multiplicity) for relative risk excluding 1. The proportion of subjects with 
diarrhea and hypertension was higher in pazopanib compared with sunitinib, but 
the 
95% CI did not exclude a relative risk of 1. The proportion of subjects 
with maximum Grade 3 and 4 AEs was similar between the treatment arms, with no 
difference 
in the relative risk. Grade 3 AEs of increased ALT, increased 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and headache occurred more frequently in the 
pazopanib arm compared with the sunitinib arm. Grade 3 AEs of fatigue,

Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 15 - 
 decreased appetite, HFS, neutropenia, mucosal inflammation, thrombocytopenia, 
leukopenia, decreased platelet count, anemia, and decreased neutrophil count 
occurred more frequently in the sunitinib arm compared with the pazopanib arm. 
Grade 5 AEs were reported in 13 (2%) subjects in the pazopanib arm
 and 19 (3%) 
subjects in the sunitinib arm.
 
 
 
In VEG110727 (a randomized placebo-controlled Phase III study of pazopanib 
monotherapy 
in subjects with STS), the median time on pazopanib was 19.[ADDRESS_875103] common AEs 
(≥20%) reported in the pazopanib arm (as of 23 May 2011) were fatigue (65%), 
diarrhea (59%), nausea (56%), weight decreased (51%), hypertension (42%), 
decreased appetite (40%), hair color changes (39%), vomiting (33%), tumor pain 
(30%), 
dysguesia (28%), headache (23%), musculoskeletal pain (23%), myalgia 
(23%), 
gastrointestinal (GI) pain (23%), and dyspnea (20%). Twenty-eight 
percent of subjects on placebo and 63% of subjects on
 pazopanib experienced an 
AE 
of maximum Grade 3 or higher. The proportion of subjects who experienced 
maximum Grade 4 and Grade 5 AEs was similar in both
 treatment arms. 
 
An 
analysis of integrated safety data from VEG110727 and VEG20002 (a single 
arm Phase II study of pazopanib monotherapy in subjects with STS) showed a 
safety 
profile similar to that observed in the pazopanib arm of VEG110727 
alone. Increased rates of myocardial dysfunction, venous thrombo-embolic 
events, and pneumothorax were newly observed in the STS studies as compared to 
RCC. 
 
Rare 
but severe AEs previously described for VEGFR inhibitors, such as 
cardiac/cerebral ischemia, hemorrhage, and bowel perforation, were observed 
with pazopanib treatment. 
 
The most common SAEs occurring in subjects enrolled in all pazopanib oncology 
studies regardless of treatment assignment include diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, dyspnea,hypertension (including 1 SAE of hypertensive crisis), 
pyrexia, anemia, dehydration, fatigue, pneumonia, pleural effusion, 
neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, increased ALT, and nausea.  
 
In study VEG105192 in subjects with RCC, the most common chemistry 
abnormalities, occurring almost twice as frequently on pazopanib compared with
 
placebo included ALT (53% versus 22%), AST (52% versus 19%) and bilirubin 
elevations (36% versus 10%), hypophosphatemia (34% versus 11%), hypomagnesemia 
(26% versus 14%), hypoglycemia (17% versus 3%) and hypokalemia (9% versus 2%). 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version [ADDRESS_875104] of these were Grade 1/2. The most common Grade 3/[ADDRESS_875105] elevations.  Although leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia 
were more common on pazopanib than placebo, Grade 3/[ADDRESS_875106] 18 
weeks of treatment. As of 09 January 2009, the transaminase elevations were 
reversible 
in 96 (91%) of 106 subjects with elevated ALT ≥3×ULN; 7 of the 
remaining 10 subjects had limited or no follow-up to determine recovery and 3 
died 
of cancer progression with no follow-up ALT data.It was noted early in 
development 
that some of the subjects with elevated hepatic enzymes remained 
on study drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_153066] (“adaptation”). Most subjects 
with transaminase elevations in whom dosing was interrupted could be 
successfully re-challenged. 
 
In Study VEG108844 in subjects with RCC, the worst-case toxicity grade changes 
from baseline for hematologic toxicity were higher in the sunitinib arm 
compared 
with the pazopanib arm and for chemistry worst-case toxicity grade 
changes were 
similar between the pazopanib and sunitinib arms. See the 
investigator brochure for details.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Preliminary Efficacy Summary 
Pazopanib 800mg once daily has shown efficacy and/or encouraging efficacy 
signals in the following settings:
 
 Re nal Cell Carcinoma : In Study VEG102616, the primary analysis of the 
primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), revealed a large and 
highly 
statistically significant improvement in PFS in the pazopanib-
treated subjects compared to placebo- treated subjects (HR 0.46, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.34 to 0.62, p<0.0000001). The median PFS in 
the pazopanib arm was more than double that in the placebo arm: 9.2 
months (95% CI, 7.4, 12.9) versus 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8, 4.2), 
respectively. The response rate (RR), defined as the percentage of 
subjects who achieved either a confirmed complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) criteria was significantly higher for the pazopanib arm 
compared with the placebo arm by [CONTACT_107406] (IRC) 
assessment (30% vs. 3%, p<0.001). In the pazopanib arm, the median 
duration of response was 58.7 weeks (95% CI, 52.1 to 68.1 weeks) and the 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 17 - 
 median time to response was 11.9 weeks (95% CI, 9.4 to 12.3 weeks) by 
[CONTACT_581981] [Sternberg, 2010]. The median overall survival (OS) at 
final analysis was 22.9 months in the pazopanib arm and 20.5 months in 
the placebo arm. The final OS was not statistically different between 
the pazopanib arm and the placebo arm in (HR = 0.91, stratified log-rank 
p-value, 0.224). Of note, 54% of subjects in the placebo arm received 
pazopanib, 
many starting early in the study, and an additional 12% 
received other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. . 
 Soft Tissue Sarcoma: In the VEG110727 Study, a statistically significant 
improvement 
in PFS was observed in the pazopanib arm compared with the 
placebo arm.  The median PFS in the placebo arm was 7.0 weeks (95% CI: 
4.4, 8.1) and in the pazopanib arm was 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 17.9, 21.3), 
with a corresponding HR of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.48, p<0.001) as 
assessed by [CONTACT_171311].  The median OS at final 
analysis was 10.7 months in the placebo arm (95% CI:  9.0, 13.1) and 
12.6 months (95% CI: 10.9, 14.9) in the pazopanib arm; HR = 0.87 (97.57% 
CI: 0.67, 1.13, p=0.256).  In the VEG20002 Study, the rate of PFS at 12 
weeks, 
based on investigator assessment, was 18 of 41 subjects (43.9%) 
for leiomyosarcoma; 18 of 37 subjects (48.6%) for synovial sarcoma; 5 of 
19 (26.3%) for adipocytic sarcoma; and 16 of 41 subjects (39.0%) for 
other types of sarcoma 
 
 Ovarian cancer: 11 of 36 subjects (31%) experienced a cancer antigen- 125 
(CA-125) response to pazopanib, with a median time to CA-[ADDRESS_875107] dose, the 
biochemical 
response was 28% (10 subjects). Overall response rate based 
on modified Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria (incorporating 
CA-125, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and 
clinical 
assessment) was 18% in subjects with measurable disease at 
baseline, and was 21% in subjects without measurable disease at 
baseline. Median PFS was 84 days. 
 
 A dvanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma: Rate of PFS at 12 weeks, based on 
investigator assessment, was 18 of 41 subjects (43.9%) for 
leiomyosarcoma; 18 of 37 subjects (48.6%) for synovial sarcoma; and 16 
of 41 subjects (39.0%) for other types of sarcoma [Sleijfer, 2008]. 
 
 E arly-stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): 30 of 35 subjects (86%) 
experienced a reduction in tumor volume after short-term use of 
pazopanib 
median duration of 16 days) as assessed by [CONTACT_5019]-resolution

Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 18 - 
 computed tomography (HRCT) after preoperative pazopanib treatment 
[Altorki, 2008]. 
 
 E rbB2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer: A higher response rate 
(36.2% versus 22.2%) by [CONTACT_652101] 12 was observed in 
subjects on combination lapatinib 1000mg once daily + pazopanib 400mg 
once 
daily compared with lapatinib 1500mg once daily as a monotherapy, 
respectively (VEG20007, [Slamon, 2008c]).
 
 
 I nflammatory Breast Cancer:  Investigator-assessed best ORR was 
numerically 
higher for combination lapatinib 1500 mg once daily + 
pazopanib 800 mg once daily compared with lapatinib 1500 mg once daily 
as a monotherapy [45% (90% CI: 30.9, 59.3) vs. 29% (90% CI: 17.2, 
43.3)], and for combination lapatinib 1000 mg once daily + pazopanib 400 
mg once daily compared with lapatinib 1500 mg once daily as a 
monotherapy [58% (90% CI: 43.3, 71.5) vs. 47% (90% CI: 32.8, 62.1)].  
However, no increase in PFS was observed compared to lapatinib alone 
 
 C ervical cancer:  There was a 34% reduction in risk for progression for 
subjects receiving pazopanib relative to lapatinib (hazard ratio: 0.66; 
90% 
CI: 0.48, 0.91). The median time to investigator-assessed PFS was 
17.1 
weeks in the lapatinib group and 18.1 weeks in the pazopanib (one-
sided p=0.013)

1.1.5. Preliminary Safety and Efficacy Summary- Pazopanib and Paclitaxel 
Two dose-escalation phase I studies of pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel in subjects with 
advanced cancer have been completed.[Suttle, 2007; Tan, 2008] The first trial divided subject s 
into two groups, one receiving paclitaxel in combination with pazopanib, and the other receiving 
paclitaxel and carboplatin in combination with pazopanib.[Suttle, 2007] Paclitaxel administered 
D1, 8, 15 on a 28 day cycle was escalated (15-80mg/m2) with pazopanib daily starting on day 2, 
escalated from 400-800mg. The other group escalated every 3 week paclitaxel (80-225mg/m2) 
with 
carboplatin AUC 6 and pazopanib 800mg. Preliminary data on 9 subjects in the paclitaxel 
and pazopanib group yielded: grade 1/[ADDRESS_875108] with grade 3 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 20 - 
 diarrhea. The pazopanib 800mg daily and paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly dose level was expanded 
given one DLT of an abscess. Six (83%) subjects demonstrated SD as the best response. 
Concomitant treatment with pazopanib increased paclitaxel AUC and Cmax (20-35%). The most 
tolerable regimen has not yet been identified.  
 
A second trial evaluated safety and toxicity, PK and efficacy in 25 subjects with dose escalations 
of both weekly paclitaxel (D1, 8, and 15 on a 28 day cycle) from 15-80mg/m2 and pazopanib 
daily for 28 days from 400-800mg.[Tan, 2008] The optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) was 
defined as pazopanib 800mg daily and paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly. Subjects received a median 
of 2.5 cycles, range of 1-8. Tumor types included: breast, colon, non-small cell lung, and 
esophageal cancer. One DLT was seen at the OTR, a grade [ADDRESS_875109] adverse events 
were grade 1/2 and included: gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/constipation), 
systemic symptoms (fatigue/anorexia), as well as rash, alopecia, visual disturbance, and liver test 
elevations. Twelve of [ADDRESS_875110] elevation; 10 subje cts had dose interruptions (7) or reductions (3) of pazopanib, and 11 
subjects had interruptions/delays (11) or reductions (5) of paclitaxel.  Three subjects were 
withdrawn due to an adverse event. Again, increased AUC and Cmax of paclitaxel were 
observed with pazopanib. Of the sixteen subjects treated at the OTR, 5 (31%) evidenced a PR 
and 10 (63%) evidence SD for greater than 8 weeks. 
1.2. Rationale  
No therapy to date has improved overall survival in melanoma.  New treatment modalities are 
critically important for this disease, which is the 6th leading cause of cancer in men and the 7th in 
women.  Melanoma is a highly vascular tumor and VEGF has previously been implicated in the 
e
volution of its pathogenesis, being directly associated with the transition from radial/horizontal 
to vertical growth phase. The expression of VEGF in MM is associated with a worse overall 
prognosis [Birck, 1999; Gorski, 2003; Lacal, 2000; Marcoval, 1997; Salven, 1997; Simonetti, 
2002; S
traume, 2001; Ugurel, 2001; Vlaykova, 1999].   
 
A phase II study of axitinib, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-1, 2, and 3, 
in metastatic melanoma demonstrated an ORR of 19% in 32 patients Median overall survival 
wa
s 6.8 months with a median progression free survival of 2.3 months [Fruehauf, 2008].  A 
recent study of carboplatin + paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with sorafenib biologic therapy 
resulted in progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.8 months (historical controls have PFS of 2−4 
months) in a 100-patient, single-arm, Phase II study [Flaherty, 2006].  Bevacizumab, in 
c
ombination chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_652083], has also demonstrated antitumor in metastatic 
melanoma.  In a Phase II study evaluating carboplatin, weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab, nine 
(17%) patients achieved partial remission, and another 30 (57%) achieved stable disease for at 
least 8 weeks. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 6 months and 
12 months, respectively [Perez, 2009].    
Pazopanib is a small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-1,2,3, PDGFR-B and c-KIT. [Harris, 2008] 
I
n vitro and in vivo, pazopanib has demonstrated antiangiogenic activity as well as inhibition of 
xenograft tumor growth.  Established as tolerable, a randomized phase III trial to evaluate PFS in 
advanced RCC for pazopanib 800mg daily compared with placebo was initiated given a partial 
response (PR) rate at week 12 of 27% in a randomized discontinuation phase II trial of pazopanib 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 21 - 
 in metastatic RCC. [Hutson, 2008] In melanoma, a single agent phase II study with pazopanib is 
planned. In light of the relevance of angiogenesis in melanoma and possible additive or 
synergistic benefit of other antiangiogenesis agents in combination with chemotherapy, a Phase 
II study of pazopanib in combination with chemotherapy in advanced stage melanoma is 
warranted. 
2. OBJECTIVES 
2.1. Primary 
 To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) for subjects with unresectable 
Stage III and Stage IV melanoma.  
2.2. Secondary 
The secondary objectives are: 
 To evaluate 1- and 2-year survival, objective response rate, clinical benefit rate 
(SD+PR+CR), and duration of response of subjects treated with pazopanib and 
paclitaxel. 
 To assess safety of the combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel in this patient 
population.   
2.3. Exploratory Objectives  
 To obse rve angiogenic marker modulation by [CONTACT_159411]. 
 To identify intra-tumoral biomarkers that correlate with or are predictive of clinical 
response/benefit to pazopanib and to identify gene and/or protein expression in tumor 
tissue that may be associated with clinical outcomes or response to therapy.   
 To correlate PD effects (increased diastolic blood pressure), plasma proteins (serum 
VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor 2, serum HIF and serum TSP1) to tumor biopsy 
expression levels and clinical outcome.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1. Study Design 
This is a Phase II single-arm, open-label, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy for subjects with unresectable 
Stage III and Stage IV melanoma.  Previous cytokine therapy and immunotherapy is permitted.  
Subjects must have measurable disease per RECIST.  Subjects who are not candidates for 
c
urative intent treatments are eligible for this study. 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version [ADDRESS_875111] stage of a 2-stage Simon Minimax design.  If there are [ADDRESS_875112] all 
the eligibility criteria. During the Screening/Baseline Period, a subject will be evaluated for 
study eligibility per protocol as defined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria [See Section 4.2 and 
S
ection 4.3]. Eligible subjects must complete all the required baseline safety assessments and 
disea
se assessments prior to enrollment and the first dose of study treatment [See Table 6 and 
S
ection 6.1 for Screening/Baseline assessments].  
The
 study consists of a Screening/Baseline Period, Treatment Period and a post-treatment 
Follow-Up Period.  
All subjects will be enrolled to receive pazopanib 800mg daily dosing in combination with 
paclitaxel. Subjects are permitted to receive full supportive care during the study, including 
transfusion of blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrhea l 
agents, analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. 
Study treatment will continue until subjects experience disease progression, death, unacceptable 
toxicity, or withdrawal of consent for any other reasons. During the Treatment Period, safety and 
disease assessments will be performed regularly according to schedules displayed in the Time 
and Events Table, Table 6.  
S
ubjects who progress following study treatment may continue to receive medical treatment 
according to the local standard of care as per the investigator’s discretion and at the subject’s 
wish.  
 
Subjects who withdraw from study treatment due to unacceptable toxicity will continue to have 
regular disease assessments until disease progression or initiation of another anti-cancer 
treatment(s) [See Table 6  for assessments during disease progression follow-up (FU)].  
All 
study subjects will be followed until death due to any cause, withdrawal of consent, or until [ADDRESS_875113].

3.2.1. Dose Rationale for Pazopanib 
Animal models (mice with human tumor xenografts and the Matrigel plug model of 
angiogenesis) using an osmotic pump to maintain a steady-state plasma concentration of 
pazopanib suggest that a concentration of >40 micromolar (μM) (>17,500ng/mL) was  required 
for optimal in vivo  activity. These results were further supported by [CONTACT_652102]-stimulated receptor phosphorylation in mouse lungs also required similar 
plasma pazopanib concentrations for reproducible activity. The activity of pazopanib against 
human and mouse VEGFR-2 kinase is similar (IC [ADDRESS_875114] human and mouse 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 23 - 
 VEGFR-2, respectively); therefore, similar effective concentrations are expected in humans.  In 
vitro  and in vivo  results, taken together, suggest that steady-state plasma pazopanib 
concentrations of at least 17,500 – 22,000ng/mL (40 to 50μM) were required to optimally inhibit 
VEG
FR-[ADDRESS_875115] relationship was demonstrated between the 
plasma pazopanib concentration 24 hours after administration (C24) on Day 22 and the 
probability of an increase in blood pressure.  The C24 at which there was a 50% probability of an 
in increase in blood pressure requiring a modification of antihypertensive therapy or a 15mmHg 
increase in mean MAP was approximately 21,000ng/mL.  Preliminary DCE-MRI data indicate 
that doses of 800mg once daily and 300mg twice daily demonstrated effects consistent with a 
decrease in tumor perfusion. Mean (%CV) pazopanib C24 values were 24,800ng/mL (42.0) and 
30,900ng/mL (31.5) in the 800mg once daily and 300mg twice daily dose groups, respectively. 
These results suggest that plasma pazopanib concentrations greater than 20,000ng/mL (46µM) 
maintained over the entire dosing interval are associated with biologic activity associated with 
VEGFR inhibition in cancer patients. 
Evidence of clinical activity after pazopanib treatment with 800mg OD has been observed in 
patients with metastatic RCC in study VEG102616. Pazopanib doses ranging from 50mg thre e 
time weekly to 2000mg once daily (QD) were evaluated in the Phase I dose-escalation study 
VEG10003.  Pazopanib 800mg QD dosing was relatively well tolerated and C24 concentrations 
were maintained above 40 μM in over 85% of patients who were treated at this dose in study 
VEG10003. No consistent increase in exposure was observed when the dose was increased from 
800mg QD up to 2000mg QD and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established in this 
stud
y. Thus, a dose of pazopanib of 800mg QD was selected as the dose to be tested in this trial.

Version [ADDRESS_875139], pazopanib monohydrochloride salt (coded as GW786034B) tablets 
are provided as 200mg and 400mg tablets, which contain pazopanib monohydrochloride salt 
equivalent to 200mg and 400mg of the free base, respectively. 
[ADDRESS_875140] will receive 800mg (2 X 400mg tablets) of study medication administered 
once daily by [CONTACT_1966]. The 200mg tablets of study medication are provided to subjects who need 
dose adjustments during the study [s e e Section 5.3.1  for instructions on dose modification.] 
S
tudy medication should be taken without food at least one hour before or at least two hours 
after a meal. The time of day for administration of study medication should be relatively 
constant. If a subject misses a dose, the subject should take the dose as soon as possible, but not 
less than [ADDRESS_875141] period.  The starting dose will be 80mg/m2 weekly.  All 
patients should receive pretreatment for paclitaxel infusions, with oral or IV corticosteroids, 
diphenhydramine or equivalent histamine H1 antagonists, and cimetidine or equivalent histamine 
H2 antagonists, according to standard of care.  The weekly paclitaxel dose may be reduced to 
65mg/m2 for individual infusions or future cycles based on tolerability; guidelines for re-
escalation to 80mg/m2 upon recovery of toxicity are provided.  Paclitaxel may be discontinued at 
the discretion of the investigator due to achievement of maximum benefit or tolerability.   
The ideal duration of treatment cycles in this study is [ADDRESS_875142] from paclitaxel

5.3. Dose Modifications for Toxicity 
5.3.1. Pazopanib Dose Modifications 
Dose interruptions or reductions may be required following potential drug-related toxicities. 
Hypertension, proteinuria, hepatotoxicity, bleeding events, vascular thrombosis, 
thrombocytopenia/neutropenia, and other adverse events have been reported in response to 
treatment with pazopanib. 
 
At e
ach visit during the Treatment Period, subjects should first be evaluated for the occurrence of 
AEs and laboratory abnormalities. Specific recommendations for management of these possible 
AEs along with guidelines for dose delay/modification or discontinuation of study treatment are 
provided in Table 2 . Dose-adjustments are to be exercised whenever clinically indicated. If dose 
reduction is necessary, two dose reductions are permitted in a stepwise fashion (initially to 
600mg and subsequently to 400mg if necessary) to achieve resolution of toxicity to grade 1 or 
baseline. If the toxicity does not recur or worsen, the dose can then be increased step-wise back 
to 600mg and 800mg after monitoring for 10-14 days at each step if toxicity does not recur or 
worsen. 
Interruptions for more than 14 days due to toxicity or to reasons other than toxicity (unplanned 
travel or vacation, or lack of transportation to the site), should be avoided.

In the event of treatment emergent hepatotoxicity, potential contributing factors such as 
concomitant medications, viral hepatitis, choledocholithiasis, and hepatic metastases should be 
investigated. Concomitant medications known to be hepatotoxic which may be contributing to 
liver dysfunction should be discontinued or replaced with alternative medications to allow for 
recovery of liver function. As generally understood, ALT >3x ULN and concomitant bilirubin

To avoid any delay in the treatment of easily manageable conditions such as electrolyte disorders 
and to quickly recognize possible serious conditions such as cardiac dysfunction, [COMPANY_001] 
recommends the following steps when caring for subjects with fatigue and asthenia.  Subjects 
complaining of grade 2, 3, or 4 fatigue and/or asthenia should be investigated as appropriate 
including at a minimum the items outlined below. 
 S ubjects with grade 3 or more fatigue and/or asthenia should be seen immediately. 
 A workup should include a detailed history and physical examination, measurement of 
serum electrolytes, liver function tests, an electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, thyroid 
function tests, and an early morning cortisol.   
 Elec trolyte abnormalities should be corrected and adrenal insufficiency or 
hypothyroidism should be treated with replacement therapy.  
 An ACTH stimulation test should be performed if the cortisol concentration is 
<10mcg/dL (280nmol/L).  
 If the subject's history or physical examination point towards symptoms or signs of 
congestive heart failure, the appropriate investigations should be performed including 
an echocardiogram.

Abdominal pain 
Abdominal pain is not an uncommon symptom with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
receptor antagonists, of which pazopanib is one.  Bowel perforations have been reported in 
clinical trials of pazopanib and with other agents in this class.  Bowel perforations have been 
associated in some patients with tumor in the bowel wall, or diverticulitis, while in others there 
has been no clear explanation. 
Although bowel perforation is a rare event, investigators and study staff at the site are advised to 
be vigilant of this potential complication in subjects receiving pazopanib.

In vitro  data indicate that pazopanib is a potential inhibitor for CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4.  Pregnane X receptor 
transient transfection assay data suggested some potential for human CYP3A4 induction at high 
concentrations.  However, definitive information on the metabolism and drug interaction profile 
of pazopanib in humans is not available.   
Certain medications should be used with CAUTION  due to the potential for alterations in the 
pharmacologic effects or increased adverse events secondary to the inhibition of multiple CYP 
enzymes by [CONTACT_107395].  These medications include (but are not limited to ): 
 Antidepressants: amitriptyline, buproprion, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine. 
 3-hydroxy-3 -methylglutaryl (HMG) co-reductase inhibitors: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, 
lovastatin, simvastatin. 
 Oral hypoglycemics:  pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], rosiglitazone; see below for specific recommendations 
on other oral hypoglycemics.  
 Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]:  alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, flurazepam. 
 Calcium channel blockers:  diltiazem, felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
nitrendipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], verapamil, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nisoldipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; see below for specific 
recommendations for verapamil and diltiazem . 
 Angiotensin II blockers: losartan, irbesartan. 
 Beta-blockers:  carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol. 
 Anticonvulsants: phenobarbital, phenytoin, primadone, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 Miscellaneous:  aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], codeine, methadone, mifepristone, haloperidol, estrogens and 
progestins (including oral contraceptives). 
 
Specific recommendations regarding oral hypoglycemics: 
Co-
administration of pazopanib with some oral hypoglycemics, including glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], glyburid e 
(glibenclamide), glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956], nateglinide, repaglinide, gliclazide, acetohexamide, carbutamide, 
glibornuride, glymidine, metahexamide, and tolazamide, may result in an increase in plasma 
concentrations of the oral hypoglycemic agent.  This increase may result in hypoglycemia.  
Therefore, the dose of the oral hypoglycemic agent should be reduced by 50% when pazopanib 
administration starts.  The blood glucose should be monitored closely, and the subject should be 
instructed to measure their blood glucose if they experience symptoms of hypoglycemia and 
inform the ir physician if their blood glucose concentration is low.  After at least 14 days of 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
   
Version 30 Jan, 2014 - 40 - 
 pazopanib administration, the dose of the oral hypoglycemic agent may be increased as 
necessary to maintain adequate blood glucose control. 
Specific recommendation regarding non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers 
(verapamil and diltiazem): 
Co-administration of pazopanib with calcium channel blockers may result in increased plasma 
concentrations of the calcium channel blocker.  Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, 
verapamil and diltiazem, have potential depressive effects on cardiac conduction and 
contractility. When pazopanib therapy is initiated, the administration of an anti-hypertensive or 
anti-anginal agent other than verapamil and diltiazem is recommended in the setting of a 
prolonged PR interval (greater than 200msec), sinus bradycardia (less than 60 beats per minute), 
or second or third degree heart block, unless the subject has a permanent pacemake r. 
P
otential Impact of Other Medications on Pazopanib 
Results from in vitro  studies suggest that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human liver 
microsomes is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C8. Furthermore, pazopanib has been demonstrated to interact with p-glycoprotein in vitro . 
Therefore, substances that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter the pharmacologic effects of 
pazopanib and should be used with caution. These medications include (but are not limited to):  
Inhibitors of CYP3A4:  
 Antib iotics:   clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin. 
 HIV:   anti-retrovirals (delaviridine), protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, 
nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]). 
 Antifungals:   itraconzaole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole. 
 Antid epressants:  nefazodone, fluvoxamine. 
 Calc ium channel blockers:   diltiazem, verapamil  
 G I:   cimetidine, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]. 
 M iscellaneous:   Grapefruit or its juice.  
In
ducers of CYP3A4 : 
 Glucocorticoids:   dexamethasone. 
 Antic onvulsants:   phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 HIV:   efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].

steroids or EIAC s 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Measurability of Tumor Lesions at Baseline 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All 
identified tumor lesions are to be classified as measurable or non-measurable per 
RECIST criteria.  
Measurable lesions:  lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
with the longest diameter 20mm using conventional techniques, or 10mm with spi[INVESTIGATOR_89391]. 
Non-measurable  lesions:  all other lesions, including lesions too small to be considered 
measurable (longest diameter 20mm using conventional techniques or 10mm with 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_25457]), and the following lesions and disease sites: bone lesions, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, and cystic lesions.  
Measurable disease: subjects presenting with at least one measurable lesion at baseline 
are identified as having measurable disease. Only subjects with baseline measurable 
disease are eligible for the study. If the measurable disease  is restricted to a solitary 
lesion, its neoplastic nature must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology evaluation. 
Subjects presenting with the following baseline conditions must be excluded from the 
study: 1) positive head CT or MRI scan for CNS metastasis (except as noted in Table 7 ); 
2) all measurable lesions are within previously irradiated areas.  
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 50 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 [IP_ADDRESS]. Determination of Target and non-Target Lesions 
At baseline, all the lesions must also be categorized as “Target” or “non-Target” lesions 
using the following RECIST guideline. 
Target lesions:  all measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions,  and measured and recorded at baseline.   
Ta
rget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_13458]). Lesions that are present within a previously irradiated area 
cannot be selected as target lesions.  
Non-target lesions:  all other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-
target lesions, and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are 
not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout subsequent 
assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Response Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_47334]. During Treatment Assessments, any new 
lesion(s) must be recorded in the CRF.  If the lesion(s) noted at baseline is not evaluated 
at the subsequent Treatment Assessment, this will be noted as 'not done' (ND) in the 
CRF. 
Response criteria for target and non-target lesion(s) are presented in Ta ble 8 .

Progressive disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as a reference the sm allest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions  
Stable disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum

Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as 
having "symptomatic deterioration". Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 52 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue on radiographic evaluation. When the evaluation of CR depends on this 
determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the CR status. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Evaluation of Disease Progression  
During the course of the study, the investigator will assess a subject’s disease status 
based on the radiological assessment (as below) and clinical assessment, and will make 
clinical decisions on the subject’s care based on medical judgment. Disease assessments 
by [CONTACT_652114]. 
The
 primary method for assessing disease progression will be based on radiologic 
assessments using the methods described in Section 6.2.3 . The primary method for 
assessing disease progression will be based on radiologic assessments using the methods 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Every effort should be made to have a radiological 
assessment to objectively confirm progression in subjects who experience progression 
based only on the subject’s overall deterioration of health status. However it is 
anticipated that some subjects will have symptomatic progression that cannot be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_347035]. If a subject experiences symptomatic progression at 
a certain time point that meets all of the following three criteria with proper 
documentation, the subject is considered to have progressive disease. Thus, symptomatic 
progression is defined as meeting all three criteria: (1) ECOG performance status of at 
least 3, (2) subject is unable to have follow-up radiologic assessment due to performance 
status decline, and (3) symptomatic decline deemed to be related to metastatic disease 
(not toxicity from therapy or concurrent illness.)   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Survival Assessment 
All subjects should be followed up to two years from date of enrollment or until death 
whichever occurs first, if possible. The date of death and cause of death should be 
evaluated and documented in the appropriate CRF.  
6.3. 
Safety 
A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the incidence and severity 
of adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other safety parameters. 
6.3.1. Physical Examination  
Physical examination is assessed at Screening/Baseline, pre-dose on Day 1, and every 4 
we
eks thereafter until discontinuation of study treatment. Physical examination includes 
height (baseline only), body weight and evaluation of the subject’s medical conditions . 
Any new or worsening of medical conditions from the baseline condition (pre-dose on 
Day 1) should be recorded in the AE or SAE CRF .  
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 53 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 6.3.2. Vital Signs and Blood Pressure Monitoring 
Vital signs, including heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure should be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline, pre-dose on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of every combination cycle 
until discontinuation of study treatment.  
As hypertension is a common drug-related AE observed from other pazopanib studies, 
blood pressure monitoring is mandatory. The following instructions should be followed 
for cuff measurement of blood pressure:  
Sitting blood pressure should be measured after the subject has been sitting quietly for at 
least [ADDRESS_875196]’s blood pressure is within the well-controlled range; or if the 
subject needs medical attention. Refer to Section 5.3.1 for the algorithm of dose 
modi
fication of study medication in event hypertension occurs; refer to Section 11.5, 
A
ppendix 5 for recommendations for management of hypertension during the study 
tre
atment.  
6.3.3. ECOG PS  
ECOG PS is assessed at Screening/Baseline, pre-dose on Day 1 and every 4 weeks 
thereafter until discontinuation of study treatment. If subjects discontinue study treatment 
without disease progression (e.g., withdrawal study treatment due to unacceptable 
toxicity), continue the assessments of ECOG PS every 8 weeks in accordance with the 
disease assessments until subjects experience disease progression.  
6.3.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Hematology should be performed at Screening/Baseline and prior to each paclitaxel 
infusion 
on Day(s) 1, 8, 15 of each cycle.  If subjects discontinue paclitaxel study 
treatment and continue on pazopanib monotherapy, hematology should be performed 
every 4 weeks. 
Clinical chemistry, liver function tests (ALT and AST) and coagulation should be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and every [ADDRESS_875197] 2 cycles, then every 4 
thereafter until discontinuation of study treatment. 
C
oagulation tests should be performed at Screening/Baseline and every 4 weeks 
thereafter until discontinuation of study treatment.  
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 54 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 Amylase and lipase tests should be performed at Screening/Baseline and every [ADDRESS_875198] dose until discontinuation of study treatment. 
Urinalysis by [CONTACT_39701]:creatinine ratio should be performed at Screening/Baseline 
and every 4 weeks thereafter until discontinuation of study treatment.  Refer to Section 
11.6, Appendix 6 for reference for UPC calculation. 
The 
thyroid function tests should be performed at Screening/Baseline and every [ADDRESS_875199] dose until discontinuation of study treatment. Serum thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH), total serum T4, and triiodothyronine ( T3)  resin uptake will 
be assessed.

6.3.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
There is no preclinical or clinical evidence of an effect on QTc with either pazopanib or 
lapatinib. However, 12-lead ECG will be obtained at Screening/Baseline, Week [ADDRESS_875201] should be in the 
semi-recumbent or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]; the same position must be used for all subsequent 
ECG tests.   
All ECGs must include QTc measurements either manually or machine calculated using 
Bazett’s formula, and recorded in the CRF. The Bazett’s formula is: 
QTcB = QT / RR1/2  
At Screening/Baseline, if QTc interval is > [ADDRESS_875202] will be excluded from the 
study.  
If a QTc ≥ 440 msec is noted on a scheduled or unscheduled ECG, then 2 additional 
ECGs should be obtained within 5 minutes to confirm the abnormality.  The average QTc 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 55 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 will be determined from the 3 ECG tracings by [CONTACT_652115].  If the average QTc is less < [ADDRESS_875203] may 
continue therapy.  If the average QTc is ≥ [ADDRESS_875204] should be treated appropriately for QTc prolongation and monitored until 
resolution is documented by a repeat ECG with QTc intervals returning to < [ADDRESS_875205] 
A screening serum -HCG pregnancy test is mandatory for all women of child-bearing 
potential and should be done within [ADDRESS_875206] the following safety assessments upon discontinuation of study 
treatment: physical examination and vital signs, ECOG PS, LFTs, clinical chemistry and, 
hematology and coagulation tests, urinalysis, thyroid function tests (the above 
assessments can be omitted if the last assessments are performed within 6 weeks of the 
previous assessments), and ECG (this assessment can be omitted if the last assessments 
are performed within 12 weeks of the previous assessments). The date and reason for 
discontinuation of study treatment must be recorded clearly in the Study Treatment 
Discontinuation CRF .

.3.8. Adverse Events 
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an AE 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product.   
Examples of an AE include : 
 Ex acerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 56 - 
Version 18 Aug 10  Ne w conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product 
administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the 
study. 
 S igns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
 S igns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not 
be reported as an AE/SAE). 
 “ Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will 
not be reported as an AE or SAE.  However the signs and symptoms and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill 
the definition of an AE or SAE. 
Examples of an AE does not include  a/an: 
 Medic al or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy). Note, the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms 
of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition. 
For [COMPANY_001] clinical studies, AEs may include pre- or post-treatment events that occur as 
a result of protocol-mandated procedures (i.e., invasive procedures, modification of 
subject ’s previous therapeutic regimen). 
6.3.
8.2. Definition of a SAE 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a. Results in death 
b. I s life-threatening 
NOTE:  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256357]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or out-subject setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 57 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. R esults in disability/incapacity, or 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652092].  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
g. All grade 4 laboratory abnormalities 
6.3.9. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments as AEs and SAEs 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., ECGs) that are judged by [CONTACT_652116].  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that 
are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following 
the start of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs.  However, clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the 
disease being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_652117]’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not 
worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
The 
investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant. 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 58 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 6.3.10. Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not 
Qualifying as SAEs 
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (e.g., disease 
progression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  Progression of the subject's 
neoplasia will be recorded in the clinical assessments in the CRF .  Death due to 
progressive disease is to be recorded on the 'Record of Death' CRF page and not as an 
SAE.  However, if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than that which 
would normally be expected for the subject, or if the investigator considers that there was 
a causal relationship between study treatment (pazopanib) or protocol design/procedures 
and the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.  Any new primary 
cancer must be reported as an SAE. 
6.3.11. Time Period, and Frequency of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
All SAEs that are identified from the time a subject consents to participate in the study 
until he or she has completed the study and that are assessed as related  to study 
participation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing 
therapy) or as related to a [COMPANY_001] concomitant medication must be reported promptly to 
[COMPANY_001].  Refer to Section 6.3.13, Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and 
Othe
r Events to [COMPANY_001], for guidance on reporting of SAEs.   
In addition, all AEs and SAEs will be collected and recorded from receipt of first dose of 
study drug until [ADDRESS_875207] elapsed following cessation of study drug, regardless of 
initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospic e. 
The
 investigator will monitor all AEs/SAEs that are ongoing after discontinuation of 
study drug until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the subject is lost to 
follow-up 
6
.3.12. Pregnancy 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Time period for collecting pregnancy information 
The time period for collecting pregnancy information is identical to the time period for 
collecting AEs, as stated in Section 6.3.11 “Time Period, Frequency, and Method of 
De
tecting AEs and SAEs”, from first dose of study treatment to [ADDRESS_875208] dose. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action to be taken if pregnancy occurs 
If a female subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, the study treatmen t 
must be immediately terminated. The investigator will collect pregnancy information 
record on the appropriate form and submit it to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_875209]'s pregnancy.  The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to 
[COMPANY_001].  Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the 
estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported. 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 - 59 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded 
as an AE or SAE [see Section 6.3.8, of the protocol for definitions of AEs/SAEs and a 
de
scription of follow-up]. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pregnancy and is considered 
reasonably related to the investigational product by [CONTACT_093], will be reported to 
[COMPANY_001] as described in Section 6.3.13 . While the investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action to be taken if pregnancy occurs in a female partner of a male 
study subject 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study and record the 
pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to [COMPANY_001] within 2 weeks 
of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  The partner will also be followed for the outcome 
of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to 
[COMPANY_001].  Generally, follow-up will be no longer than [ADDRESS_875210] be followed 
up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and 
child.  Pregnancy complications, and elective terminations for medical reasons must be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. 
An
y SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator’s 
attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_496449], must be promptly reported to [COMPANY_001]. 
6
.3.13. Prompt Reporting of SAEs to [COMPANY_001] 
SAEs will be reported promptly to [COMPANY_001] as described in the following table once the 
investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition for that event. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Timeframes for Submitting SAE Reports to [COMPANY_001] 
Any serious adverse events which occur during the clinical study or within [ADDRESS_875211] be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence

 - 60 - 
Version 18 Aug 10 Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a 
clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of 
each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), 
complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_230016] (fax: [PHONE_002]) within 24 hours to the oncology [COMPANY_001] DS&E department 
with the provided FAX cover sheets.  
The SAE report should comprise a full written summary, detailing relevant aspects of the 
adverse events in question. Where applicable, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652093]. Follow-up information should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_875212] be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] if and when they occur. Additionally, in order to fulfill international 
reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study participation (e.g., procedures, 
invasive tests, change from existing therapy) or are related to a concurrent medication 
will be collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participate in the 
study until he/she is discharged. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. AE and SAE Documentation and Follow-up Procedures 
The investigator will review and adhere to the following procedures: 
 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
 R ecording of AEs and SAEs 
 Evaluating of AEs and SAEs 
 C ompletion and Transmission of SAE Reports to [COMPANY_001]

The plasma samples will be “coded” with a study specific number that can only be traced 
or linked back to the subject by [CONTACT_132018].  Coded samples do not carry 
personal identifiers (such as name [CONTACT_78207]) therefore the true identify of 
the subject will remain unknown to anyone outside of the study investigator or site staff. 
Samples will be retained for a maximum of [ADDRESS_875214] completes the 
trial. 
Instructions on sample preparation, storage are provided in Section 11.7, Appendix 7. 
A
rchived Tumor Biomarkers 
Archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue from the time of original 
diagnosis (or from second surgery for metastatic disease) will be tested to determine 
intra-tumoral expression levels of relevant biomarkers (encoded in RNA or protein) in the 
angiogenesis pathway (e.g. VEGFR, c-kit) and potentially other biomarkers that are 
downstream or related to these pathways.  In addition, analyses of underlying genetic 
aberrations (mutations, amplifications, and deletions) will be performed in DNA isolated 
from the tumor tissue. Biomarkers will be analyzed using appropriate technologies such 
as immunohistochemistry and transcriptional profiling. 
Preferably a tumor block or a minimum of fifteen (20) slides of paraffin-embedded tissue 
from the tumor obtained at the initial diagnosis or recent biopsy or surgery (archived 
tumor tissue) should be sent for testing. Biomarker analyses will be carried out at the UCI 
Fruehauf laboratory. BRAF mutation status will be tested at an outside laboratory on 
tissue sections. 
Fresh Tumor Biomarkers  
To test the hypothesis that tissue levels of angiogenic markers are modulated by [CONTACT_652118], IHC assays for HIF, p53, TSP1, VEGF and vessel counts (CD31) on pre-
treatment tissue sections and on post-treatment biopsies from consented subjects with 
subcutaneous lesions when possible will be  performed. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded tumor tissue from the time of original diagnosis (or from second surgery for 
metastatic disease) may also be used to substitute the pre-treatment tissue samples.  
Analyses will be carried out at the UCI Fruehauf laboratory. Tumor biopsy specimens 
will be grown in co-culture with vascular endothelial cells and exposed to pazopanib 
alone and in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan and resveratrol to determine the 
effects of different tumor samples on endothelial cell response. Gene arrays will be 
performed on the tumor and endothelial cells to determine if a gene signature [CONTACT_652131].

8. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1. Hypotheses 
The goal of this single arm, open label, phase II study is to determine if paclitaxel and 
pazopanib demonstrate clinically significant activity as reflected by [CONTACT_652119], or alternatively, 
if the level of activity is clinically irrelevant.   Based on data from a meta-analysis of 
trials in stage IV melanoma [Korn , 2008], the sample size for this study is determined on 
the 
assumptions that the 6 month PFS of 30% or greater for subjects receiving 
pazopanib/paclitaxel in the first-line treatment setting will be of significant interest for 
further evaluation.  If the 6-month PFS probability is less than 15%, further evaluation of 
this combination in this patient population will not be of interest.  If [ADDRESS_875216] s 
survive and are free of disease progression beyond six months, this combination therapy 
will warrant further evaluation in this patient population.  This design has a significance 
level of 6% (probability of falsely declaring an agent with a 15% six-month PFS rate to 
warrant further study) and a power of 88% (correctly declaring an agent with a 30% six-
month PFS rate as warranting further study).   
8.2. Study Design Considerations 
8.2.1. Sample Size Assumptions 
A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled to obtain a minimum of 55 fully evaluable subj ects 
for a sufficient estimate of the 6-month PFS probability, the 6-month overall survival 
probability and toxicity rates to within +/-13% (95% confidence interval).  Assuming that 
at least 80% of [ADDRESS_875217] measurable disease, this would be sufficient to 
estimate the response probability to within +/- 15% (95% confidence interval).  Any 
toxicity occurring with at least 5% probability is likely to be seen at least once (94% 
probability).   
8.2.2. Analysis Populations 
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population will comprise all randomized subjects and will be 
used for the analysis of efficacy data. 
The Safety population will comprise all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of investigational product, and will be based on the actual treatment received if this 
differs from that to which the subject was randomized.  The safety population will be 
used for the analysis of safety data.

Version 18 Aug 10 8.2.3. Analysis Data Sets 
The primary data set for assessing efficacy will comprise the intent- to-treat population.  
The primary data set for assessing safety will comprise the safety population defined in 
Section 8.2.2 Analysis Populations.

.2.4. Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652094] a Simon 2-stage Minimax design is to minimize the 
number
 of subjects exposed to pazopanib when unfavorable results occur [Simon, 1989].  
For the Simon two-stage design, and with a Type I error rate (alpha) of 0.05, power of 
90%, a null proportion of 0.[ADDRESS_875218] stage is n1=[ADDRESS_875219] will be dependent on its efficacy and toxicity, 
the duration of follow-up will vary between subjects. Consequently, there will be no 
imputation for missing data. Where appropriate, available data will be summarized over 
specified intervals (e.g. from enrollment until withdrawal from the study) using suitable 
summary statistics.  
For the PFS endpoint, the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment will 
be
 used for those subjects who are alive and have not progressed at the time of analysis; 
such subjects will be considered censored in the analysis.   If a progression event occurs 
after an extensive lost- to-follow-up time (12 weeks or greater) the primary analysis wil l 
censor those subjects at the date of their last visit with an adequate assessment.

k.  
An adequate disease assessment comprises imaging assessment of the target tumor 
lesion(s) and non-target tumor lesion(s)/site(s) using CT and/or MRI  of the chest, 
abdomen and pelvis with a schedule of every [ADDRESS_875222] a bone scan to 
confirm a CR/PR. Subsequent bone scans will be performed as clinically indicated. 
New bone scan lesions that are equivocal will be considered as new malignant lesions if a 
confirmatory assessment using X-ray, CT or MRI is not available, and the subject will be 
determined as having progressive disease. 
If a bone assessment is missing at baseline, any new bone lesions identified after the first 
dose that is either consistent with or equivocal for tumor metastasis will be considered as 
new bone (malignant) lesions and the subject will be considered as having progressive 
disease.

Adverse Events 
AE rates and changes in laboratory results will be summarized in tabular form. 
AEs and toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-common 
toxicity criteria (NCI-CTC), Version 4.0. Summaries of the number of toxicity grades for 
both

subject and summarized at each scheduled assessment time. Change from baseline will be 
summarized and an analysis of central tendency (means, medians) will be presented. A 
categorical analysis for each QTc parameter will be performed to determine the number 
of subjects at each time point for the following categories: 
 QTc .  <400, 400 to <440 , 440 to 450, and >450  msec. 
 QTc  change from baseline. 30 to <60 msec. and ≥60 msec.,

5.3. Biomarker(s) Analyses 
The results of biomarker investigations will be reported separately from the main clinical 
study report.  All endpoints of interest from all comparisons will be descriptively and/or 
graphically summarized as appropriate to the data.  Relationships  between baseline 
patient characteristics, biomarkers and ou tcome variables will be explored with 
appropriate techniques.  
A preplanned analysis of hypertension (HTN) as a PD marker will also be carried out to 
determine if this is a surrogate of efficacy. BP will be determined at each clinic visit and 
any diastolic reading of >/= 90 or systolic reading >/= [ADDRESS_875227] deviation, minimum, and maximum observations.  The 
dichotomized variables were tabulated as high and low levels or positive and negative 
expression.  Changes over time in continuously distributed biomarker levels will be 
investigated with the sign’s test because of the heavy degree of skewness observed in 
some of the marginal distributions. Associations between interval quality data with 
ordinal data will be examined with Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Associations 
between dichotomized biomarkers among themselves and with ordinal subject 
characteristics such as tumor grade or performance status will be characterized with 
Kendall’s tau-b correlation. 
9. STUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1. Safety Data Review

11.1.  Appendix 1: American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) Classification of Melanoma 
The existence of an accurate staging system that groups patients of similar risk of disease 
progression/natural history is a necessary tool for the appropriate selection of optimal 
treatments. An accurate staging system is also required to appropriately test new 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_652095]. Based on data dealing with the natural history of melanoma 
generated over the past 3-4 years, the AJCC proposed the following revised TNM staging 
system for melanoma:  
Proposed TNM Classification for Clinical Staging of Malignant Melanoma   
 
Mets: metastases 
 
a - Micrometastases are diagnosed after elective or sentinel lymphadencectomy.

Clinical Staging for Cutaneous Melanoma   
 
a - Clinical staging  includes microstaging of the primary melanoma and 
clinical/radiologic evaluation for metastases; by [CONTACT_559], it should be used after 
complete excision of the primary melanoma with clinical assessment for regional and 
distant metastases.  
b - Pathologic staging  includes microstaging of the primary melanoma and pathologic

except for pathologic Stage 0 or Stage 1A patients, who do not need pathologic 
evaluation of their lymph nodes (Table was reproduced from "A New American Joint

11.5.  Appendix 5: Recommendations for Management of 
Hypertension 
The pathogenesis of hypertension induced by [CONTACT_652123]-
fa
ctorial. VEGF and VEGFR-2 are involved in the proper maintenance, differentiation, 
a
nd function of endothelial cells.   Arterial hypertension is characterized by [CONTACT_652124] (NO) biosynthesis, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), 
increased vasoconstriction, and microvascular rarefaction of arterioles and capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037].  
Microvasular rarefaction in hypertension is partly due to impaired angiogenesis. 
Hypertension observed with anti-angiogenic agents is thought to be due to decreased 
bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO, which is a potent vasodilator, as a result of 
reduced endothelium function by [CONTACT_14181]-angiogenesis.  
Con
trol of Hypertension Prior to Study Entry  
For subjects presenting with hypertension, their BP must be adequately controlled to < 
150/[ADDRESS_875234] dose of study medication. This can be achieved by 
[CONTACT_652125]-hypertensive medications or adding new one [See below for 
permitted anti-hypertensive medications and Section 6.3.2 for baseline BP assessment].  
Con
trol of Hypertension during Study Treatment 
In event hypertension is worsened or emerged during study treatment; the management of 
hypertension should include two parts: 1. Dose modification of study medication, 
including interruption, reduction, re-challenge, or discontinuation of study medication 
[See Section 5.3.1  for guidelines and algorithm]. 2. Management of hypertension with 
anti-hypertensive medications.  
The following antihypertensive medications are permitted  by [CONTACT_652126]:  
 Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers:  felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nitrendipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], amolodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nisoldipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 Angiotensin II blockers: losartan and irbesartan. 
 Beta-blockers:  carvedilol, metoprolol, propafenone, propranolol, and timolol.  
 Calcium channel blocker: diltiazem and verapamil. 
Based on consultation with experts in the field, we recommend the use of 
dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and ACE inhibitors as the first line and second 
line of therapy, respectively, for treatment-related hypertension. The use of non-
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are not encouraged.

Version 18 Aug 10 11.6.  Appendix 6: Procedures for Obtaining Urine 
Protein/Creatinine Rati o 
 
1. Obtain at least 4 mL of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24-hour 
urine) 
2. Determine protein concentration (mg/dL) 
3. Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL) 
4. Divide the value from Step 2 by [CONTACT_652128] 3 above: urine 
protein/creatinine ratio = protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine concentration 
(mg
/dL) 
 
The urine protein/creatinine ratio directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted 
in the urine per 24 hours (i.e., a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 1 should be equivalent to 
1 g of protein in a 24-hour urine collection). 
 
Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of 
urinalyses, not dipsticks. If protein and creatinine concentrations are not routinely 
reported at an institution, their measurements and reports may need to be requested.

Plasma samples for analysis of soluble proteins will be obtained at the time points 
designated in the protocol Table [ADDRESS_875235] 10.0 mL of blood into a sodium heparin tube (green top) at the designated 
times. 
3. Af ter collection, gently invert the tube (15 times) to completely mix blood and 
anticoagulant. 
4. Once the sample has been mixed, it should be placed immediately into an ice bath 
ensuring that the tube is immersed so that the temperature is kept at 2° C to 8°C 
during all processing steps. 
5. C entrifuge at 3500 rpm at 4 C for 10 minutes.  
6. Tr ansfer upper layer using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_173565] 4 Nalgene (2 brown capped, and 2 orange 
capped) cryovials; split approximately a quarter of the sample into each of the vials. 
7. S tore tubes at – 70°C to – 80°C. 
8. One  brown and one orange capped cryovial (primary sample, larger 3.6 mL tubes) 
should be shipped on the day of collection and one tube each (back-up sample, 
smaller 1.8 mL tubes) should be retained at the site in a –70°C or –80°C freezer.

11.8.  Appendix  8:  Fresh Tissue Samples : Procedures for 
Sampling, Handling, Storage, and Shipment  
After the patient grants informed consent for the biopsy, at least a 0.5-3 cm cube of tumor 
tissue from a superficial lesion should be obtained by a punch, core, or excisional biopsy.  
The 4 mm cube should be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within one hour and stored at 
-70C to -80C.  The sample analysis will not be anonymized and will be carried out 
spec
ifically for the purposes of evaluating correlation of DNA and RNA patterns with 
clinical response.  The samples will not be made available to anyone not associated with 
this study or external investigators.  All materials (DNA and RNA) will be destroyed 
immediately after analysis.  No genetic material will be stored.

ELISA.  VEGF and TSP1 production are measured using a human Quantikine ELISA 
kits (R&D system, Minneapolis MN) per manufacturer’s instructions. HIF1α and p53 
production are measured using DuoSet IC ELISA kits (R&D system, Minneapolis MN) 
per manufacturer’s instructions.  
IHC.  All sections are deparaffinized in xylene (Richard Allen, Kalamazoo MI) and 
rehydrated with increasing concentrations of water in Dehydrant (Richard Allen, 
Kalamazoo MI) and undergo target retrieval prior to staining.  CD31, CD105, and p53 
required a standard target retrieval solution (TRS) diluted from 10x (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652096]).  TSP1 and VEGF antigen retrieval is performed in a home-brew target retrieval 
solution, consisting of 1mM EDTA (Sigma, St. Louis MO) in double distilled water 
titrated to pH 8.0.  Melan-A required a high pH target retrieval solution (diluted from 
10x, DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]).  The appropriate target retrieval solution is preheated to 
95oC in a steamer and slides were incubated in 95oC TRS for 10-20 minutes.  Slides are 
removed from the steamer to cool in the target retrieval solution for an equal amount of 
time.  Slides are rinsed twice in double distilled water and incubated in wash buffer 
(diluted from 10X, DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]) for a minimum of 5 minutes prior to 
staining.  All IHC is performed using a DAKO Autostainer (Carpenteria CA).  
All other staining is performed using the two-step EnVision+ system (DAKO, 
Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]).  In this system, slides are blocked with hydrogen peroxide for 10 
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated with primary mouse 
antibody for an hour.  Primary antibody clones and dilutions are as follows: CD31 JC70a 
1:50 (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]), p53 DO-1 1:2000 (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]), TSP1 8A6B 
1:200 (Novocastra/Leica, Bannockburn IL), VEGF Ab-7 VG1 1:100 
(Neomarkers/Labvision, Fremont CA), HIF1α clone 56 1:50 (BD, San Jose CA), Melan-
A A103 1:50 (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]).  The secondary reagent is an HRP labeled 
polymer conjugated with goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies.  This labeled 
polymer-HRP is incubated for 30 minutes followed by [CONTACT_652129].  Results are compared to appropriate isotype (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]) or 
counterstain only controls.  Positive and negative cell line controls are used for each 
antibody.  Slides are counterstained with either methyl green (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]) or 
hematoxylin (DAKO, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_652097]).  Slides are dehydrated in increasing 
concentrations of Dehydrant, cleared in ClearRite (Richard Allen, Kalamazoo MI), and 
mounted with coverslips (Fisher, Houston TX) using Mounting Media (Richard Allen, 
Kalamazoo MI).

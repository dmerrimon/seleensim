Specific Aims  
Recent data project that a total of 710,[ADDRESS_1005511] been  conducted in 2010.  By 
2020, the frequency is predicted to more than double to over 1.5 million procedures. While arthroplasty is 
generally effective, approximately 25% of patients have unexplained disabling pain and impaired function a 
year or more after  surgery, representing a significant cost to society in terms of lost productivity and medical 
costs.  
Recently published evidence by [CONTACT_736055]. Pain catastrophizing identifies approximately 50% of patients who will have longer term disabling 
pain and impaired function (e.g., an estimated 89,000 patients in 2010). Pain catastrophizing is t he tendency to 
magnify pain sensations, ruminate upon them, and feel helpless when experiencing pain. It is also amenable to 
treatment via pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125].  
Pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735976] m usculoskeletal pain 
disorders, but have not been studied in a surgical population. Current practice guidelines for knee arthroplasty 
do not address the treatment of psychological distress, a major contributor to poor outcome. We propose to 
examine the effi cacy of a pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735977]. The proposed study will provide data that has strong potential to support 
a new treatment paradigm to improve upon curren t clinical practice.  
Our long -term goal is to improve the outcomes for individuals receiving knee arthroplasty.  In the current 
application, we propose a three -armed multicenter clinical trial; the “ Knee Arthroplasty Pain Copi[INVESTIGATOR_735978] (KASTpain) Study .” The study extends work our team began with our R -[ADDRESS_1005512] whether a pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735979] -operatively, relati ve to arthritis education or usual care.  
Specific Aim 1 . To assess the efficacy of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735980]. Our two primary hypotheses (to be tested in the clinical trial) are the following:  
 Hypothesis 1a.   Pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735981] .  
 Hypothesis 1b.   Pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735982] . 
We also will examine one secondary (hyp. 2) and one tertiary (hyp. 3) hypothesis . 
 Hypothesis 2.   Pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735983] -reported function, physical performance, pai n intensity, pain catastrophizing, and patient 
global ratings of improvement.  
 Hypothesis 3.  Pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735984] (i.e. patient time) 
costs relative to arthritis care education and usual care. When accounting for costs associated with pain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125], the intervention will be cost s aving or cost -effective relative to arthritis care 
education and usual care as measured by [CONTACT_736056] -adjusted life -year.  
Specific Aim 2. To determine if treatment benefits of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735985]:  
 Hypothesis 4.  Changes in pain catastrophizing  that occur over the course of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735986] -related improvements in pain and self -reported function during recovery.  
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Research Strategy  
 Significance: Specific Aim 1 
Knee arthroplasty surgery (TKA) is a common and generally effective procedure.[ADDRESS_1005513] data for TKA also are 
impressive. Mean procedural charges per patient in 2003, reported in 2005 dollars, were $38,000 per primary 
surgery and $48,000 per revision surgery.3 If these procedural charges data were extrapolated to the 2010 
volume data projections, procedural charges would total approximately $28 billion dollars annually.  
Serious early surgical complications such as venous thromboembolism or joint infection lead to poor outcome.  
However, the incidence of these adverse events is very low - on the order of 2% of all surgeries. Failure of the 
prosthesis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a late complication occurring several or more years following surgery and accounts for 
approximately 5% of poor outcomes.4 The great majority of “poor” outcomes following knee arthroplasty are 
attributed to disabling pain and impaired function not attributable to early complications or prosthetic loosening. 
Pain is the predominant complaint of patients seek ing total knee arthroplasty.5-[ADDRESS_1005514] consistently been on the order of 40% to 60% relative to 
baseline, from 6 months to 2 years postoperatively.8-16 However, some studies clearly elucidate the nu mber of 
patients who respond poorly to the surgery. For example, Puolakka and colleagues found that 36% of 433 
patients reported daily life disturbing pain and 27% had disturbed sleep four months or more after surgery.17,[ADDRESS_1005515] of patients report no functional problems following s urgery 20 and approximately 20% report 
dissatisfaction with their functional ability a year or more after surgery.21 Functional deficits following surgery 
are observed in a wide range of activities, with up to 40% of patients still requiring the use of an assistive 
device to ambulate.19 
The problem of disabling osteoarthritis (OA ) pain and reduced function is a large and as yet unsolved problem 
that has a dramatic impact on quality of life and productivity. For example, revision surgery rates are impacted 
by [CONTACT_736057]. Roberts and colleagues conducted a  survival analysis of 4400 
patients with knee arthroplasty and found that 15 years following surgery, a total of 239 knees required revision 
and up to 35% were for unexplained pain. Extrapolating to current estimates, as many as 35% of 55,[ADDRESS_1005516] effective , current 
clinical practice paradigms could be significantly improved.  
  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Significance: Specific Aim 2  
As Vlaeyen and Morley note, an important barrier to improving the effects of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735987] a “one size fits all” approach to applying the intervention.[ADDRESS_1005517] sizes of 0.5 or 
less; a substantial proportion of patients receiving pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735988].37,[ADDRESS_1005518] intentionally selected for treatment a sub -group of 
patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing, who we hypothesize will likely experience substantial benefits 
from pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735989].   
Testing for the presence of mediation (illustrated in Figure 1) will allow us to determine the extent to which pain 
catastrophizing28,29,39 mediates the relationship between pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735990]. The dashed 
line between pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735991] (either partial or 
complete) of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735992]. 
Understanding whether catastrophizing is a mediator for 
pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735993] a 
causative explanation for how pain copin g skills training 
effectively improves outcomes following knee 
arthroplasty. If our study finds that pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_48088] (CST) is effective and that pain catastrophizing 
explains these effects, the field of orthopaedic surgery 
could experience subs tantive changes in the way in 
which patients with knee arthroplasty are treated; to the 
benefit of many patients. Surgeons may begin to routinely 
screen for high pain catastrophizing and initiate pain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_735994].  
 Innovation: Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1005519] of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735995].  
There is strong evidence from multiple systematic reviews that pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_735996] s are effective for non -surgical patients with arthritis and other chronic conditions.34,41,42 
No studies were found that targeted patients und ergoing surgery for chronic pain. Our proposed intervention is 
innovative in that it specifically focuses on cognitions and copi[INVESTIGATOR_735997]. For example, the intervention accounts for  the unique needs, interests and 
Usual CarePain Copi[INVESTIGATOR_735998]:
[ADDRESS_1005520] make it uniquel y well suited to address pain catastrophizing. 
The training format for each of the skills has been specifically modified to include training experiences that (1) 
help patients identify and evaluate maladaptive thoughts related to pain and (2) provide a mea ns of teaching 
them to alter catastrophizing cognitions to more adaptive and realistic ones in order to reduce pain and 
improve function.   While newer technologies such as web -based delivery show promise, current trial evidence 
is lacking for these technol ogies in an older OA patient group with high catastrophizing. Furthermore, our 
elderly sample would likely have difficulty with these new technologies.  Research team members have 
successfully used similar interventions in numerous trials for patients treat ed medically for knee osteoarthritis, 
low back pain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828].44-[ADDRESS_1005521] analysis ([CONTACT_736088] 
[CONTACT_736058]) we will assess the cost effectiveness of the CST intervention. Our trial is innovative in that it will provide 
additional cost data for policy m akers to judge the credibility of the intervention.  
We have modified conventional copi[INVESTIGATOR_735999].  Innovative features of  the protocol include 
(1) a systematic approach to teaching patients how both the behavioral and cognitive pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736000] -related cognitions, and (2) a specific focus on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_736001] -related 
challenges associated with knee replacement surgery. Finally, studies of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736002]. Our s will be the first to include physical 
performance among our secondary measures to assess outcome, an innovative addition to outcome 
assessment.  
Innovation: Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1005522] to determine if pain catastrophizing plays a mediating role in the 
context of a perioperative pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736003]. By [CONTACT_736059] 
1, we will provide new insights into the temporal relationship of mediation effects of pain catastrophizing in 
patients receiving pain copin g skills training immediately prior to, immediately after and several months 
following surgery.  
 Approach: Specific Aim 1  
 Trial Design   
The investigative team reached consensus on the final trial design during the R34 planning process. The 
KASTpain study will be a multi -center phase III randomized three -arm controlled trial designed to determine if 
pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736004] a greater extent than 
either an attention control arthritis education inter vention or usual care.  
Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment and patients randomly assigned to either the copi[INVESTIGATOR_736005] (pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]). 
Patients randomly assigned to usual care will not be blinded but assessors will be blinded to group 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  assignment. The eligibility criteria are designed to select a study sample with a Pain Catastrophizing Scale 
score of 16 or higher and therefore at high risk for poor outcome.27-29,29,31 The primary outcome measure will be 
the WOMAC Pain scale, measured at 1 year following surgery. In addition, several secondary outcome 
measures also will be assessed (see Primary and Secondary Endpoints  below).  See Figure 2 below for a 
flow diagram of the planned trial.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________    Participants  
Patients will be recruited from orthopaedic surgery practices in four centers: (1) Virginia Commonwealth 
University Medical Center; (2) Duke University Medical Center; (3) Indiana University; and (4) Southern Illinois 
University. Investigators from each site along with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_736012] [ADDRESS_1005526] consented to participate (see support letters). Investigators at all sites have strong 
collaborative relationships with their orthopedic surgeon colleagues and, as part of our R34, have cemented 
these relationships over the last [ADDRESS_1005527] that they were trained and to attempt to enforce standardization in surgical procedures was, in our view, 
unrealistic. In lieu of cont rols for surgical approach we will: (1) randomly stratify by [CONTACT_553432], (2) collect 
data from each surgeon on: (a) type of implant (i.e., cruciate retaining, posterior stabilized, rotating platform, 
patellar resurfacing (yes or no for each); (b) surgical  approach (mid -vastus, sub vastus, medial parapetallar); 
and (c) use of cement (yes or no). These data will be collected for all patients and examined as potential 
covariates.  Because surgical approach will not be standardized, there is no concern for a l ack of equipoise 
among participating surgeons. Physical therapy for patients following TKR, in contrast, is generally similar 
across clinics in that the goal of physical therapy is to enhance functional status via range -of-motion and 
strengthening exercise  and gait and balance training. There is no evidence of a clear benefit of any single 
physical therapy approach at one year. 57 To account for the duration (dosage) of physical  therapy we will 
collect data on the total number of physical therapy visits for all patients and assess the impact of number of 
visits on outcome. Regarding medication use, we will track medication use in all three arms with a 
comprehensive medication lis t (see MOOP) to categorize the medication profile for each patient over the 
course of the study.  
Chart abstractors blinded to treatment assignment will indicate if the patient had one or more of the following 
post-surgical complications: implant infection  requiring surgery, implant failure requiring revision, implant 
loosening requiring revision, symptomatic DVT or PE, patellar dislocation or failure and knee fibrosis requiring 
manipulation. These complications typi[INVESTIGATOR_736013]. Randomization will likely control for these effects, but 
we also will statistically adjust for the impact of these complications on study findings, if necessary.  Overall, 
this pragmatic approach will, in our view enhance study generalizability.  
 Inclusion  criteria will be the following:  
 Adults 18 years of age or older and capable of providing informed consent.  
 Diagnosis of osteoarthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria of moderate to 
severe knee OA58 and function  limiting pain as determined by [CONTACT_13935]’ orthopaedic surgeons.  
 Scheduled for an elective unilateral total knee arthroplasty no sooner than 2 weeks or later than 8 
weeks from the time of recruitment.  
 Score of ≥ 16 on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and ≥ 5 on the WOMAC Pain scale.  
 Able to read and speak English.  
 Exclusion  criteria will be the following:  
 Scheduled for revision arthroplasty surgery.  
 Unable to or declines consent for study participation.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   Self-reported diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis (i .e. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic 
lupus erythematosis, ankylosing spondylitis).  
 Arthroplasty scheduled because of a fracture, malignancy or an infection.  
 Scheduled for bilateral arthroplasty surgery.  
 Scheduled for unicompartmental ar throplasty.  
 Self reported plan to undergo hip or knee arthroplasty within one year after current knee arthroplasty.  
 Presence of severe depression (20 or higher) using the PHQ -8 depression screener.59,60 
Although it is possible that depressive symptoms could interfere with treatment efficacy, it is also possible that 
those with depressive symptoms might benefit more from the treatment than those who are not depressed, 
given that the intervention teaches skills that can help in the treatment of depression.   By [CONTACT_736064], and including patients with other levels  of depressive 
symptoms, generalizability will be enhanced and we will be able to determine if the intervention is more or less 
effective among persons with depressive symptoms, relative to non -depressed persons.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 
112 knee arthroplasty  patients with high pain catastrophizing as defined in our trial, a total of 3 patients (2.7%) 
had PHQ scores of [ADDRESS_1005528] 30 orthopaedic surgeons participating in the study (see Table 5 below), this approach will c ontrol 
for temporal and clustering effects resulting from single surgeons having imbalances in the numbers of patients 
in each treatment group over time. Assignment to one of the 3 groups will be accomplished with a computer 
generated table of random numbe rs created by [CONTACT_736065] a secure website. After collecting baseline data, e ach site’s study coordinator will conduct 
treatment allocation by [CONTACT_736066], allowing the treating surgeon  and the follow -up data 
collectors  (site coordinators and research assistants)  to be blinded. We will instruct all surgeons of the 
importance of avoiding study contamination by [CONTACT_736067]. Surgeons also 
will be asked to report if they became aware of group assignment during the study. These data will be tracked 
and reported at the end of the study.  
All data collected a t each site will be obtained by [CONTACT_736068]. This will 
be accomplished by [CONTACT_736069]  a sec ure website and then 
providing patients with  treatment allocation information in random number matched pre-sealed opaque 
envelopes . Patients will be instructed to open envelopes once they return home and they will be asked not to 
mention their group assign ment to the data collectors. Information in the envelopes will inform patients about 
group assignment and will instruct  patients to contact [CONTACT_736070]. Because site PIs will not be collecting data from patients, we will optimize the 
likelihood of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_736014].

difficulty with mobility and travel.61,62  
The pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736016] R34 funding and is based on 
information gathered in previous studies of chr onic and arthritic pain by [CONTACT_736071], Jensen and others,45,54,55,63 -68 as 
well as our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].69 The intervention is designed to modify copi[INVESTIGATOR_736017] (please see t he clinician training manual and the corresponding patient manual in the MOOP).  
The final protocol was based upon an extensive review of the literature, intensive discussions among the 
investigators, input from international experts working in the field o f psychosocial interventions and pain 
catastrophizing, and our clinical experience working with OA patients who are high catastrophizers. There was 
consensus among all involved on three points: (1) that an overly narrow protocol, i.e. a simple attempt to u se 
cognitive restructuring to alter catastrophizing only was unlikely to work because it would not examine the 
broader context in which catastrophizing cognitions occur for these patients; (2) that the CST protocol should 
not be as broad in scope or as int ensive as comprehensive cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions 
for pain; and (3) that CST should be used since it is the only intervention to date that has been shown in 
controlled studies to reduce both pain catastrophizing and pain.   
The proto col to be tested is consistent with these three points.  First, it includes training not only in cognitive 
restructuring but also a variety of skills that provide patients with opportunities to observe the impact of copi[INVESTIGATOR_736018] -related cognitions.  Second, the CST protocol is neither as broad in 
scope nor is as intense as typi[INVESTIGATOR_736019].  Rather, each of the skills 
included in our CST protocol was chosen specifically because it provide s a potentially potent means of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_736020] -related thoughts.   We designed this CST protocol so that a 
key component of training for each of the skills is teaching patients how that they can use that skill t o identify 
and reduce their catastrophizing.   For example, patients will be trained in the copi[INVESTIGATOR_104285] “activity -rest cycling” 
and be taught how to monitor and change negative cognitions that arise as they apply this skill in daily pain -
related situation s. Application of this skill will help patients change from a cognition such as "I can't go for a 
walk around the neighborhood with my partner " to "I can go for walks if I break the walk up into periods of 
moderate activity followed by [CONTACT_736072]."    Another example; patients will be trained in the copi[INVESTIGATOR_736021].  For 
instance, prior to training in this skill a patient having a pain flare might t hink "I just can't relax when I am 
hurting" whereas after training they can learn to identify and then replace this thought with the thought "I have 
learned ways to relax and have used them during severe pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_81953]."   
Protocol Description:   Table [ADDRESS_1005530] protocol will: (1) 
provide a rationale for the copi[INVESTIGATOR_514738]; (2) train patients in cognitive restructuring as well as a 
variety of skills that provide patients with opportunit ies to observe the impact of copi[INVESTIGATOR_736022] -related cognitions; and (3) provide training in strategies for enhancing maintenance of 
gain following treatment.  Rationale:  To introduce the training, a simplified version of M elzack and Wall's gate 
control model of pain will be used to help patients understand that pain is a complex experience affected by 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  thoughts, feelings and behaviors.70  Pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736023] . Training in copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]:  Cognitive -restructuring will be used to help the patient 
recognize the relationships between thoughts, feelings and behavior.[ADDRESS_1005531] cycling, patients identify activities in which they overexert themselves (e.g., housework or 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), learn to break those up into periods of activity and rest (e.g., [ADDRESS_1005532]), and gradually increase their activity level as they decrease rest.  Patients will identify 
activities they enjoy such as reading, doing crafts and hobbies, or visiting friends and then set and record 
weekly activity goals. Pa tients also will be trained in three attention diversion methods: relaxation, imagery, and 
distraction.  Relaxation training, using a protocol and relaxation tape described by [CONTACT_736073],[ADDRESS_1005533] 
to relaxation.77  Patients will practice using pleasant imagery and changing from one image to another.  
Distraction techniques will include focusing on physical or auditory stimuli.77 Maintenance Enhancement:  Using 
relapse prevention methods, each patient will develop a writt en maintenance plan that includes the list of pain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_736024], potential high risk situations, early warning signs of setbacks, and plans 
about how the patient might apply these skills in dealing with future setbacks and challen ges.  
Table [ADDRESS_1005534] in making the argument that it is the content of the interventions and not the delivery of these 
interventions that we will be testing in the trial. The arthritis e ducation sessions will use a presentation and 
discussion format similar to that originally described by [CONTACT_736074].78-80 The clinician and 
patient manuals were developed as part of our R34 funding (see MOOP). Figures and discussion sessions will 
present information on the nature of arthritis, what to expect following knee arthroplasty,  treatment of 
osteoarthritis, the role of exercise, joint protection and making future treatment decisions.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  This general approach to an arthritis education comparison condition has been used successfully in many 
behavioral studies and in several trials conducted by [CONTACT_736075].44-50,55 Use of an education comparison 
condition enhances the scientific credibility of the study by [CONTACT_736076] "pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]" component of the 
experimental intervention effectively reduces pain and impro ves function over that seen in patients who receive 
a similar dose of time and attention from a health professional, but no specific pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110].  
  Usual Care  
Because the standard of care in joint arthroplasty includes no treatment directed toward poor pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], we 
have added a “usual care” group to determine real world effects of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. Patients in the usual care 
group will only receive care that they would have routinely received had they not been entered in the study.  
  Economic E valuation  
Four types of information will be collected throughout the study for use in the economic evaluation: (1) all -
cause medical resource use; (2) patient time; (3) health utilities; and (4) resources required to provide the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125], art hritis education and usual care. We will collect information on all -cause medical 
resource use including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department and urgent care visits, orthopedic -related 
procedures, medications for pain and/or inflammation, and outpatient visits, including sessions for physical and 
occupational therapy.  This information will be ascertained via patient self -report and supplemented with 
medical records abstraction.  To improve the accuracy of patient self -report, patient diaries will be desi gned to 
track medical resource use to record their estimates of time spent receiving the interventions, adhering to 
treatment recommendations (e.g. physical therapy), and employing copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110].[ADDRESS_1005535] -effectiveness analysis, we will measure health utilities using the 5 -level EQ -5D (5L EQ -5D).84 
According to the EuroQoL group, preference weights for the 5L EQ -5D should be available by [CONTACT_5638] 2012 
(EuroQol Group Executive Office - personal communication). Finally, we will prospectively collect information 
on time spent by [CONTACT_736077] s and nurse educators and other individuals involved with the delivery of 
the study interventions as a basis for estimating intervention costs.    
In accordance with recommendations for economic evaluation in health care, we will value costs from the 
socie tal perspective.[ADDRESS_1005536] medical costs. To 
assign costs for inpatient care, we will assign Medicare diagnosis -related groups (DRG) codes and 
corresponding reimbursement rates, adjusted for differences in length of stay reported for patients in the 
study.86,87 Medication costs will be based on the published average wholesale price (AWP) minus 16%.[ADDRESS_1005537] costs associated with patient time will be valued using the average hourly wage in the US ($20.90, 
May 2009).89 To estimate costs associated with the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736026], we will apply a 
costing tool that we designed specifically to estimate costs associated with patie nt-centered interventions 
(5R01NR011873 -02, manuscript in appendix  7). The tool applies scientifically -sound economic principles to 
assign costs to personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies, patient incentives and miscellaneous items.  
  Steps to Enhance Treatment Fidelity and Reduce Potential Biases  
Because multiple sites will participate and increase the risk of bias due to differing approaches in applying the 
interventions, the research team will take a number of steps to ensure that the treatment prot ocols for copi[INVESTIGATOR_736027]. First, all pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736028]. Second, all psychologists who participate in the study will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_736029]. Keefe and his team at Duke University.  Experienced nurse educators 
will all be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Riddle to provide the arthritis education. Third, all psychologists and nurse educators 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  will be provided with detailed treatment manuals (as developed in the MOOP), and the treatment strategies will 
be taught through didactic instruction, taped illustrations of techniques f rom model cases, and role -play of 
common scenarios. Fourth, we will institute several “best practices” to enhance and monitor treatment fidelity 
of the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736030]: (1) careful attention to th e 
treatment manuals; (2) intensive training onsite and at Duke University; (3) “real -life” enactment of treatment 
skills during training, and (4) on -line documentation of treatment delivery. Finally to provide supervision, all 
sessions for both groups will  be audiotaped. These tapes will be reviewed in supervision sessions on a regular 
basis to ensure that the treatment manuals are being followed. Supervisors will provide feedback based on the 
review of these tapes. Remedial training will be provided to tho se clinicians who deviate from established 
protocol.  
Treatment adherence, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_736031]. Adherence refers to the extent to which a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_736032] 
a protocol. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_736033] a manner that is 
skilled and sensitive to patients’ needs. Ratings of treatment adherence will be made by [CONTACT_6283]. Keefe and 
Jensen  (and by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Riddle for the arthritis education arm)  for a random selection of 10% of the sessions for 
each of the treatment conditions.90  Protocol adherence rating sheets developed for each session will be used 
with satisfactory adherence defined as 9 0% or more of the maximum possible score on the adherence rating 
scale.  Ratings of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]' competence will be made using a [ADDRESS_1005538] to study design, we will ensure the same treatment dose within and across treatment conditions 
(Pain C opi[INVESTIGATOR_736034]). We will monitor session attendance for copi[INVESTIGATOR_736035] a diary log with participant ID numbers and session dates to track 
percentage of attendance and to account for absent eeism and reasons for missed sessions. We will make 
every effort to deliver the full treatment, but we expect some variation in treatment delivery dose as well as 
treatment drop -out. Reasons for attrition will be assessed with an open -ended question for en rolled participants 
who withdraw.  Drop -out reasons will be categorized and then judged by [CONTACT_468565].  Comparisons 
between the treatment conditions in drop -out rates will be made, and these rates will be included as covariates 
in the planned analy ses if significant between -group differences emerge.  
Loss to follow -up is always a threat in longitudinal studies. The following strategies will be employed to 
minimize loss to follow -up: (1) we will use up to [ADDRESS_1005539] -
treatment assessments; (2) we will obtain alternative phone contact [CONTACT_90838]; (3) if we 
fail to contact a  participant during follow -up phone contacts, despi[INVESTIGATOR_736036], we will mail a 
reminder le tter; (4) participants will receive up to $150 remuneration for study participation and this 
remuneration will distributed throughout the study period to be commensurate with study demands; and (5) we 
inflated our sample size by 20% to account for possible  attrition.  
Additional retention strategies will be employed in the study to reduce loss to follow -up as much as possible. 
For example, study coordinators will personally meet each patient enrolled in the study to develop rapport with 
each patient. The stu dy website developed by [CONTACT_736078] -flag notices when patients miss their scheduled appointment dates by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_1005540] was a secondary analysis of a cohort study of 952 patients and 
was published in 2007.92 Our findings suggested that surrogate measures of general psychological distress 
(like the mental health score of the SF -36) did not provide adequate fidelity and that more precise measures of 
specific psychological states  and disorders were necessary.  
To test this hypothesis a second study was undertaken to determine if more specific measures of 
psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, self -efficacy, fear of movement, pain catastrophizing) predict 
pain and funct ional outcomes following knee arthroplasty.29 After adjusting for confounding factors, pain 
catastrophizing was the only consistently strong psychological predictor of poor WOMAC Pain outcome (Odds 
ratio  = 2.7, 95%CI=1.2, 6.1). We found that 60% of patients with high pain catastrophizing had  a poor 
outcome, (defined as a WOMAC Pain change score of <50% from baseline to [ADDRESS_1005541] surgery) as 
compared to 30% of patients with low catastrophizing who had poor outcome. Other studies have reported 
similarly strong findings indicating that pain catastrophizing predicts pain and function outcome following knee 
arthroplasty.27,28,30,31 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_736037] a quasi -experimental study of the efficacy of the proposed pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736038].69 We recruited 18 knee arthroplasty patients from two sites (Duke University and Virginia 
Commonwealth Unive rsity) to participate. All patients met the inclusion criteria as defined in our proposed trial 
and received the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736003]. WOMAC Pain and Disability scores and PCS scores 
were collected prior to surgery and 2 months followin g surgery. Data from patients receiving pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736039] a historical cohort of 45 patients who also received knee arthroplasty and had high 
pain catastrophizing (≥ 16 on PCS), but received no pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125]. ANCOVA  adjusting for baseline 
scores was used to compare the patients in the treatment group to the historical cohort. The Group (copi[INVESTIGATOR_736040]) X Time (pre -op vs follow -up) interaction was used to estimate the magnitude and 
significance o f the treatment effect.  
Patients in the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736041] a mean improvement in WOMAC Pain scores of 6.9 (sd 
= 4.7) points while patients in the historical cohort achieved a mean improvement of 2.6 (sd = 4.8) points. 
Differences among groups were highly significant with effect sizes ranging from .71 to .96. for WOMAC 
Disability, WOMAC Pain and Pain Catastrophizing.  
Respondent burden was assessed by [CONTACT_406348] a 16 -item questionnaire (2 items for 
each copi[INVESTIGATOR_104285]) t hat assessed the extent to which each skill was helpful and how frequently the skills were 
used. Patients rated each skill as being somewhat to extremely helpful and patients indicated they used each 
skill at least weekly to more than once per day. These d ata suggest that patients found the skills to be 
therapeutic and useful during their recovery.  
In summary, our preliminary work and the work of others27,28,31,[ADDRESS_1005542] that: (1) pain catastrophizing 
is a key psychological variable that advers ely impacts pain and functional outcomes in patients following knee 
arthroplasty; (2) our proposed intervention has strong potential for producing clinically important improvements 
in self -reported pain and functional status in patients who are at high ris k for poor outcome; and (3) the 
feasibility of the intervention is high and can be delivered efficiently in multiple sites.   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_736042] a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_736043] a well defined phy sical performance 
battery for patients following knee arthroplasty. Associations between self -report and performance measures 
are moderate, on the order of r = .5, suggesting they measure different patient attributes.93-[ADDRESS_1005543] a measure that is reliable and captures changes in 
distance walked and pain perceived throughout the recovery period.93,94,98. The Short Physical Performance 
Battery (SPPB) combines two simple balance tests a [ADDRESS_1005544] would be well tolerated. In addition, we were concerned about possible ceiling 
effects on the SPPB which can occur with high functi oning elderly persons.102 SPPB total scores range from 0 
to 12. The mean score on the SPPB summary scale for the patients was 8.5 (sd = 2.3) and ranged from [ADDRESS_1005545].  
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures and Endpoints   
Participants from all three arms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_736079], 
1 week prior, and 1 week after, 2  months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. The baseline assessment will 
include age, gender, comorbidity14,104, education and occupation, current medications, mental healthcare 
received and a variety of  pain and psychological characteristics including depression, anxiety, pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_276541]. 
Follow -up outcomes will include measures of pain, function, catastrophizing and depression. (see MOOP in 
appendix for a complete description).  
The primary outcome measu re and endpoint will be the WOMAC Pain scale measured [ADDRESS_1005546] been shown  to be reliable 
and valid for quantifying the extent of both pain and disability in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty.16,110,111 
Secondary outcome  measures will be the WOMAC Disability scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),112-114 a 
verbal pain rating scale,115,116 and a patient global rating of change scale measured on a numerical rating scale 
from -5 (vastly worse) to +5 (completely recovered) and measured [ADDRESS_1005547] 2 points between the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736044]. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_260962] a larger difference of 4.2 points (with an effect size of .74) between the copi[INVESTIGATOR_736045]. We will use a more conservative treatment 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  effect of [ADDRESS_1005548] 91% power to detect this difference, assuming that the common standard deviation is 
4.34 (based on p ilot work described earlier). This corresponds to an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_1005549] a 20% difference between groups in  the number of patients with a 50% or greater 
improvements in WOMAC pain relative to baseline scores. 9,10,[ADDRESS_1005550] will be equivalent to an odds 
ratio of 2.25 and is equivalent to a Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT) of 5 which is indicative of an effective 
intervention.131 The revised CONSORT statement endorses use of indexes such as number needed to treat.132  
Thus, the total required sample size is 321 (107 patients per arm) for the planned [ADDRESS_1005551] 5% attrition due to early drop -out resulting from cancelled surgery. Patients who undergo 
surgery and drop out due to lack of interest, unrelated medical illness or loss of follow -up also will be included 
in the intent to treat analysis. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 18 patients suggests this number will be on the order of 10%, 
although this estimate is likely to be low because the pi[INVESTIGATOR_736046] 2 months in duration. Our previous 
work with similar types of patients suggests that loss to follow -up will likely be closer to 20% one year following 
surgery.14,29 Therefore, 402 patients (134 patients per study arm) will need to be enrolled in the trial (321+64 
due to loss of follow -up+17 due to cancelled surgery). A total of 2,100 patients will need to be screened 
because our pi[INVESTIGATOR_736047] 19% of the screened sample will actually participate (ie. 
they will meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria AND provide consent for the study). Stratification by [CONTACT_736080] r. 
  Data Analysis  
Intention to treat (ITT) will be the primary approach for all analyses and, depending on the pattern of missing 
data (missing at random, completely at random or not missing at random), multiple imputation  using SAS 
StAT/MI methods will b e used to impute values for those lost to follow -up.[ADDRESS_1005552] of pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736048] (2 months, 6 months and 1 year) 
between the pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_736049], with adjustment for the other variables. 
Analyses of the secondary outcome variables will be conducted using a similar approach. For the analyses 
using dichotomous outcomes of ≥50% improvement at 6 months and 12 months, general ized linear models 
with logistic regression will be used to compare the proportion of patients with ≥50% improvement after 
adjustment for baseline data.  
Our study is powered to detect clinically important differences in WOMAC Pain scores among treatment 
groups. As an additional secondary analysis, we also will examine the effects of potential moderators. 
Moderators are baseline characteristics that predict treatment effects.134  Additional psychosocial issues may 
influence treatment effects in knee arthroplasty patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing. Potential

KASTpain study between patients randomized to copi[INVESTIGATOR_736051]. arthritis care (and vs. usual care).  
We will compare each component (medical costs and indirect costs) and estimate interven tion costs. All three 
components will comprise total costs which will also be compared. Total costs, from the societal perspective, 
will consist of direct medical costs, intervention -related costs and indirect costs. From the health care system 
(or payer) perspective, indirect costs will be excluded. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the 
impact of scaling up the intervention (i.e. more patients per session; fixed costs allocated over more patients) 
and methodological choices for cost assign ment.141,[ADDRESS_1005554] effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated as the difference in the mean cost per patient 
between study arms divided by [CONTACT_736081] -adjusted life -years (QALYS).  Mean costs 
will be estimated as described abov e. Quality -adjusted life -years will be estimated using utility estimates 
derived from the EQ -5D.  Because the interventions represent fixed -, one -time costs while the benefits of the 
interventions may last beyond the one year follow -up period in the KASTpa in study, we will conduct sensitivity 
analyses that extrapolate differences in utilities measured at the end of follow -up over 3, 5, and [ADDRESS_1005555] survival.  If we observe statistically significa nt 
differences in costs (not including intervention costs) between treatment arms at [ADDRESS_1005556] estimates over 3, 5, and 10 years, consistent with the time period for QALYs. We will 
evaluate uncertainty by [CONTACT_736082] 95% CIs for estimates of costs, QALYs and measures of cost -effectiveness 
(i.e. ICERs or net health benefits143) using nonparametric bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].141,142 
  Timetable and Milestone Plan  
The milestone plan is as follows:  
  Enrollment of the first subject : Prior to enrolling the first subject, all sites will be required to complete IRB 
approval procedures and interview, hire and train research staff including the clinical psychologists and nurse 
educators. All study staff will be required to complete traini ng in the study protocol as described in the MOOP 
and will also require time to develop working relationships with orthopaedic surgery staff in preparation for 
patient recruitment and retention. Clinical psychologist training will require travel to Duke Un iversity while the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_736052]. We expect to have all IRB, hiring and training procedures 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  completed and should be fully prepared to begin study recruitment within [ADDRESS_1005557] will be recruited by [CONTACT_37112] 1, 2012.  
  25%, 50%, 75% and 100% enrollment projections : We expect enrollment for these various thresholds to 
occur by [CONTACT_736083] 4 below . The recruitment period will require, at maximum, a 
total of 3 years.  
 
Table 4 Summary of Recruitment Goals  
 Completion of data collection time period:  We will complete data 
collection one year following recruitment of the final subject 
which will be October 1 of 2016.  
 
The flow of the study over the course of the 5 -year study period 
is summarized in figure 4 below.  
 
  Completion of primary and secondary data analyses:  We estimate that analyses of primary and secondary 
endpoints will be completed by [CONTACT_736084] 2017.  
  Completion of final study report:  We plan to complete the final study report at the end of the grant 
funding period during the month of April of 2017.  
We expect subject enrollment to require 36 months.  This estimate assumes that a total of 100 or 101 subjects 
will be enrolled at each site (n=4 sites). Our sa mple size estimations based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (see Sample 
Size Estimation Section above) indicated that we would need to screen a total of 2100 patients to successfully 
recruit the requisite number of 402 patients. Table 5 below indicates that approxima tely 1,768 patients undergo 
primary knee arthroplasty for OA at the four sites each year for a total of 5,305 patients in a 3 year period. We 
would need to screen approximately 40% of the total sample of patients from each site to meet our recruitment 
goals and we believe this to be realistic and feasible. Every attempt will be made to recruit the requisite 
number of patients from each site, so that each site is equally represented in the analysis. However, if one or 
more sites have difficulty meeting recru itment goals, the large number of total patients in the four sites should 
allow us the flexibility to recruit additional patients from sites that are seeing more patients. Because we have 
been working with the sites for two years as part of our R34 develop ment, we do not expect sites to drop out or 
to have problems with recruitment. However, we have recruited two additional sites (see letters attached) to 
participate should we need to recruit additional patients. The duration of the clinical trial is estima ted to be 5 
years (See Figure 4).

  Data Coordinating Center  
All data collection services will be coordinated 
through our Department of Biostatistics Data 
Management Group (DMG) , housed in the 
Department of Biostatistics at Virginia 
Commonwealth  University. This center 
provides state -of-the-art data collection, 
management, reporting, and analysis services to Virginia Commonwealth University’s clinical and translational 
researchers.  DMG  will provide secure data services for all aspects of data gat hering including web based data 
form development for data collection, reminders and completion reports for data collectors at each site and for 
the executive committee, electronic data acquisition, server storage repository, randomization procedures for 
each site, study staff entry of performance data and tracking of visit data (including no -shows and dropouts) for 
clinicians providing the interventions. The Biostatistician will work closely with the Director of the DMG  to 
assure a seamless, sound and secur e process of data collection, storage and analysis.  
The web and database servers will reside on centralized Virginia Commonwealth University servers behind the 
University’s firewall.  Web -accessible systems will be protected by [CONTACT_736085], and utilize 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for transport security.  Data storage will be centralized, with regular off -
site backups performed by [CONTACT_736086].  Only the investigators and other approved personnel will have 
access to study  data, at a level commensurate with their responsibilities.  Appropriate consideration will be 
given to subject’s identifiable information.  
In addition to the above safeguards, VCU employs a network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that analyzes 
data pack ets on the networks for known signatures of probes, intrusion attempts, IP spoofing and other 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_736053]. System event logs from network devices and host applications are reported to Cisco 
Security Monitoring, Analysis, and Response System (MARS ) to improve threat identification, mitigation 
responses, and compliance.  
Periodic and ad -hoc reporting will be utilized to show subject recruitment and retention data stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
Automated email agents will electronically notify site staff and in vestigators of upcoming and overdue subject 
follow -ups.  Upon request, the data manger will provide de -identified data in a form agreeable to the 
biostatistician.  In addition, the DMG  will provide timely troubleshooting assistance via phone and email and 
answer inquiries from research staff and investigators. The investigators will develop a User’s Guide to aid the 
study staff with data management tasks should the study be funded.  
 Approach: Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1005558] Pain Catastrophizing Scale, WOMAC Pain and Disability Scale and a verbal pain rating scale 
scores on all patients at six time points (4 to 6 weeks prior to surgery, 1 week prior to surgery, 1 week following 
surgery, 2 and 6 months following surgery and 1 year following surgery). Our ration ale is that we want to 
capture the short - and intermediate -term temporal progression of changes in catastrophizing prior to and 
following treatment to describe changes in mediation over time. The primary outcome measure will be the 
WOMAC Pain scale, collec ted at all assessment points. The independent variable will be treatment condition 
(Pain Copi[INVESTIGATOR_736054]). (Figure 1)

Why am I being asked to volunteer? 
 
You are being invited to participate in a research study being conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Rebecca Hamm and [CONTACT_88371], who are obstetricians at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]. You are being invited to participate
 because you 
delivered a baby [CONTACT_88359] a blood transfusion. This means receiving blood that was donated by [CONTACT_88360]. Your participation is voluntary which means you can choose whether or not you want to participate. If you choose not to participate, there will be no loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Before you can make your decision, you will need to know what the study is about, the poss ible risks 
and benefits of being in this study, and what you will have to do in this study. The research team is going to talk to you about the research study, and they will give you this consent form to read. You may also decide to discuss it with your family, friends, or family doctor. You may find some of the medical language difficult to understand. Please ask the study doctor and/or the research team about this form. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form.    What is the purpose of this research study?

   [ADDRESS_96458] anemia (low blood 
counts) after delivering a baby. Currently, many doctors give [ADDRESS_96459] that everyone will need 2. However, it may be better to only give 1 unit at a time to raise blood counts and relieve the symptoms of anemia, such as dizziness or feeling tired. The purpose of this study is to help us understand whether giving only 1 unit of blood at a time can reduce the total number of units of blood needed to raise low blood counts after delivery.  
The study will compare the effects of giving 1 unit or 2 units of blood at a time.   If 
you decide to participate, you will be in one of two groups – a group receiving [ADDRESS_96460] been recommended to receive a 
blood transfusion at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971].    How long will I be in the study? How many other people will be in the study?  
 
You will participate in the study from today until a postpartum visit that will be 
scheduled 4 to 9 weeks from now.  The study is expected to enroll 66 women 
and to take appr oximately 2 years.  All participants  will be from the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88353].  
 What am I being asked to do? 
 
You are being asked to come back for a visit at [ADDRESS_96461] any control over your group assignment.   
 The two groups are:  
 
1. Single -unit blood transfusion, or 1 unit at a time. This m eans your doctor 
will order 1 unit of blood and your nurse will give you that blood through your intravenous (IV) line.

transfusion,  you will be given additional units one at a time at the discretion of 
your provider.  
   What are the possible risks or discomforts?  
 
Blood transfusion presents a risk of allergic reaction and infection. The study 
itself will not increase the risk .  There will not be an increase in the number of 
exams or the number of blood draws if you participate in the study.    Questionnaires can sometimes make people feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. You may choose not to answer questions that make you uncomfortable.  
 There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality. However, all of our staff are well trained in protecting information about you and your baby [CONTACT_88361].  
 If you are randomized to the single- unit transfusion group, it is possible you will 
still need [ADDRESS_96463] blood products.  
 Currently, both methods of blood transfusion are used at Penn; however, the 
method your own doctor would use is a matter of choice because  there are no 
clear benefits to one method over another; physicians will use whichever method 
they prefer and feel is most appropriate for the patient.    What if new information becomes available about the study?  
 
During the course of this study, we may find more information that could be 
important to you.  This includes information that, once learned, might cause you to change your mind about being in the study.  We will notify you as soon as possible if such infor mation becomes available.  However, based upon the nature 
of this study, we do not anticipate that this will happen.

What are the possible benefits of the study?  
 
Receiving [ADDRESS_96464] if I do not participate?  
 
You may choose not to participate in this study without affecting your present or 
future care at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Your alternative to providing your consent is to not participate in this study . In that cas e you would 
still get a blood transfusion, with either 1 or 2 units being chosen at the discretion of your doctor. Bo th methods of blood transfusion being used in this study are 
also used routinely in clinical care.  
 Will I be paid for being in this study?  
 
You will be paid $25 at the time of your discharge from this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478] 
$[ADDRESS_96465] to pay for anything?  
 
You or  your insurance will have to pay for any routine medical care that you 
receive, including all costs related to your labor and delivery, postpartum care, 
and blood transfusion because you would receive this care regardless of 
participation in the study.  Y ou will not be billed anything extra for your 
participation in this study.  
  What happens if I am injured from being in the study?  
 
We will offer you the  care needed to treat injuries directly resulting from taking 
part in this research.  We may bill your insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate, for the costs of the care you get for the injury, but you may also be responsible for some of t hem.  
 There are no plans for the University of Pennsylvania to pay you or give you other compensation for the injury.  You do not give up your legal rights by [CONTACT_3368].    If you think you have been injured as a result of taking part in this research study, tell the person in charge of the research study as soon as possible.

 When is the study over?  Can I leave the study before it ends?  
 
This study is expected to end after all participants have been recruited and all information has been collected. The study is expected to take four years.  This 
study may also be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_29591], the University of Pennsylvania, or the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology without your consent because:  
• The Primary Investigator feels it is necessary for your health or safety.  Such an action would not require your consent, but you will be informed if such a decision is made and the reason for this decision.  
• You have not followed study instructions.  
• The study Principal Investigator, or the Department of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology has decided to stop the study.

 Electronic Medical Records and Research Results  
 What is an Electronic Medical Record?  
 
What is an Electronic Medical Record and/or a Clinical Trial Management  
System?  
 An Electronic Medical Record (EMR) is an electronic version of the record of your care within a health system. An EMR is simply a computerized version of a paper medical rec ord.  
 A clinical trial management system (CTMS) is used to register your information 
as a participant in a study and to allow for your research data to be 
entered/stored for the purposes of data analysis and any other required activity for the purpose of the conduct of the research.  
 If you are receiving care or have received care within the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) (outpatient or inpatient) and are

 1. Protocol Summary   Full Title:     Prostate Cancer Comparative Outcomes of New Conceptual Paradigms for Treatment  Short Title:    PC CONCEPT   Principal Investigators:  Jim C. Hu, MD MPH; Ronald C. Chen, MD MPH  Study Description:   This study will use a population-based cohort design to study men with newly diagnosed low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer at high-volume centers in Southern [LOCATION_004] (SCa) and [LOCATION_001] State (NYS). Complications of contemporary treatments for prostate cancer and quality of life outcomes, such as general health, urinary, sexual, and bowel function, cancer anxiety, and treatment regret will be compared and tracked over the course of this study.  Sample Size:  N= 3,657  Enrollment:  This study will enroll 2,378 subjects and screen up to 3,657 subjects.    Study Population:  Subjects will have pathologically-confirmed clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) low (T1-T2a, Gleason 6, Grade Group 1, PSA <10 ng/mL) or intermediate risk (T2b-T2c or, Gleason 7, Grade Group 2 or 3 or PSA 10-20 ng/mL) at one of the selected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174133]. Subjects must also have a diagnosis date during the 18-month recruitment window.  Enrollment Period:  18 months  Study Design:  Prospective, observational   Description of Sites   Patient enrollment at 15 sites within SCa and NYS, identified through National Cancer Institute-sponsored Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER)  Study Duration:  01Oct2020 - 30Nov2023  Participant Duration: 12 months   Primary Objectives: To measure the self-reported, overall and disease specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) prior to treatment, at 8 months, and 12 months following active surveillance (AS), SBRT, IMRT, PGA, and RP.

   To define and compare the rate of adverse events following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), partial gland ablation (PGA), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and radical prostatectomy (RP) among men recently diagnosed with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.  Primary Endpoints: Change from Baseline in Patient-Reported Quality of Life as Measured on EQ-5D-5L at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment  Change from Baseline in Patient-Reported Urinary, Sexual, and Bowel Function as Measured on EPIC-26 at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment  Change from Baseline in Ejaculatory Function as Measured on MSHQ-EjD at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment  Change from Baseline in Patient-Reported Anxiety as Measured on MAX-PC at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment  Assessment of Treatment Regret as Measured on Clark’s Prostate Cancer Health Worry at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment  Assessment of Adverse Events at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment by [CONTACT_3989] v5.0  Assessment of Cancer Recurrence at 8 Months & 12 Months following Treatment by [CONTACT_174140]    1. Study Objectives   To compare complications of contemporary treatments for prostate cancer and quality of life outcomes in men with newly diagnosed low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer through a prospective, population-based cohort study design.  1.1.

[ADDRESS_203356] enabled new treatment options, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and partial gland ablation (PGA). Although heavily marketed as more convenient with fewer side effects, there is an absence of high-level, comparative effective research (CER) to discern relative outcomes to traditional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174134] (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).  We will conduct a pragmatic, population-based cohort study of men with newly diagnosed low and intermediate risk prostate cancer in Southern [LOCATION_004] (SCa) and [LOCATION_001] State (NYS) Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER) regions to bridge the evidence gap concerning adverse events and patient reported outcomes. Our proposed study will inform multiple stakeholders, who contributed to our study design. This includes prostate cancer survivors, payers, medical device manufacturers, professional organizations, community and academic prostate cancer experts and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  3. Study Design and Methods  3.[ADDRESS_203357] rapid case ascertainment (within 3 weeks of diagnosis or sooner) at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174135]-sponsored Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER) Regions where PGA and SBRT are more likely to be offered. Cases will be identified through the SEER registries’ rapid case ascertainment system, and patients will be enrolled to the cohort study directly by [CONTACT_92142] (not through the individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]). At the time of rapid case ascertainment, the type of treatment a man receives is not yet known; therefore, we will enroll all patients diagnosed with low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.  3.2 Patient Questionnaires – Refer to Appendix A.  A.  Administration ▪ Timing and Frequency – Baseline questionnaires will be sent to eligible participants for study enrollment. Follow-up questionnaires at 8 months and 12 months will be sent to enrolled participants to ascertain treatment choice and obtain patient-reported outcomes following treatment.   ▪ Survey method Eligible participants will be mailed a survey packet consisting of a paper copy of the survey, an introductory letter and information sheet, and a postage paid return envelope. In the letter the participant will be informed that, if he wishes, he may also complete the survey online and will be given a code and link to the online survey. All materials will be provided in Spanish and English to those participants with Spanish surnames. Interviewers contact[CONTACT_174141].    A modified Dillman method will be used to increase response. This includes follow-up with telephone, mail, and offers of completion of the survey online or by [CONTACT_756]. 
 
[ADDRESS_203358] 5 calls will be made on different days, times of the day (including evenings), and on weekends to reach the person. Additional follow-up efforts will include sending reminder postcards, re-mailing of the survey packet, sending a reminder letter with the link to the online survey, or offering to do the interview over the telephone.  ▪ Person Identifiers Patient identifiers obtained at the time of rapid case ascertainment will be used to link to the completed registry abstract. The registry variables to be linked to the cases will include: patient demographic data (age, date of birth, race, socio-economic status, quintile of census block of residence, marital status, birthplace), tumor data (PSA, stage, histology, grade, clinical and pathologic Gleason score, extension), treatment data (surgical code, radiation (type), dates of treatments, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, PGA and AS). B. Study Instruments – Refer to Appendix A. 4. Study Enrollment  4.1 Study Population  Subjects with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation in this study.    4.2 Inclusion Criteria  To be included in the study, the participant will: (1) have pathologically-confirmed clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma with Grade Group 1-2 (Gleason score 6 & 7)72 at one of the selected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174133]; (2) have a diagnosis date during the 18 month recruitment window; (3) speak either English or Spanish and; 4) agree to participate by [CONTACT_174142].  4.3 Exclusion Criteria     Patients will be excluded if they: 1) have clinically metastatic disease or high-risk PCa (T3a-T4, Gleason Grade Group 4 or 5 or PSA >20 ng/mL; (2) do not speak English or Spanish; or (3) are unwilling or unable (low literacy, too ill, etc.) to give informed consent; or (4) are diagnosed with prostate cancer incidentally at the time of radical cysto-prostatectomy to treat bladder cancer.  4.[ADDRESS_203359] rapid case ascertainment (within usually 4 weeks of diagnosis or sooner) at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174136].  The SCa and NYS SEER registries are mandated by [CONTACT_174143], including sociodemographic information and tumor characteristics, such as final pathologic stage and histologic grade. Active and passive follow-up is also conducted to ascertain vital status and underlying cause of death.

 The Study Advisory Committee (SAC) is comprised of patient partners Fans for the Cure and Us TOO, a senior FDA officer, and a representative from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Patient partners will participate actively in research decision-making through monthly SAC meetings. Patient partners will co-lead to troubleshoot challenges that may arise in subject recruitment, review preliminary outcomes, troubleshoot research obstacles and participate in dissemination of study findings. Patient partners will resolve potentially confusing and/or missing survey responses.  6. Study Procedures  6.1 Schedule of Trial Events Data elements  Baseline  8

Data Reporting / Regulatory Considerations  The SCa and NYS SEER research teams will independently contact [CONTACT_4317], collect data and enter survey results in a unified study database maintained at USC. A Study ID will be created for each case and survey and registry data will be linked to it, and no personal identifiers (or registry IDs) will be included in the analytic dataset. Only staff directly involved with the study at each site will have access to the tracking systems.  In addition, a central database will be maintained at Weill Cornell to assess the overall progress of the project. Each site will maintain a local password-protected and secure linkage database containing participant protected health information and identifiers and the linkage to the Study ID number.  This database will only be accessible to researchers at the local site where the participant is followed.  Participants will return their questionnaires to the local investigators.  Accordingly, local study staff will go over each completed questionnaire and check all coding (although the questionnaire will be designed to be self-coded when possible). 
 
[ADDRESS_203360]/Ethics Committee Approval   As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, before study initiation.  Before initiation of the study at each study center, the protocol, the ICF, other written material given to the patients, and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the appropriate Ethics Committee. Written approval of the study and all relevant study information must be obtained before the study center can be initiated. Any necessary extensions or renewals of IEC/IRB approval must be obtained for changes to the study, such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other study documentation. The written approval of the IEC/IRB together with the approved ICF must be filed in the study files.  The Investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IRB any new information that may adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. The Investigator will submit written summaries of the study status to the IEC/IRB as required. On completion of the study, the IEC/IRB will be notified that the study has ended.   All agreed protocol amendments will be clearly recorded on a protocol amendment form and will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_86317]. All protocol amendments will be submitted to the relevant institutional IEC/IRB for approval before implementation, as required by [CONTACT_427]. The only exception will be when the amendment is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the trial participants. In this case, the necessary action will be taken first, with the relevant protocol amendment following shortly thereafter.  Once protocol amendments or consent form modifications are implemented at the lead site, Weill Cornell Medicine, updated documents will be provided to participating sites. Weill Cornell Medicine must approve all consent form changes prior to local IRB submission.  Relevant study documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities of the participating countries, according to local/national requirements, for review and approval before the beginning of the study. On completion of the study, the regulatory authorities will be notified that the study has ended.   7.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  The Investigators and all parties involved should conduct this study in adherence to the ethical principles based on the Declaration of Helsinki, GCP, ICH guidelines and the applicable national and local laws and regulatory requirements.   This study will be conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_174144], where the benefits of the study are in proportion to the risks.  7.[ADDRESS_203361]’s legally authorized representative prior to participating in the research study. Subjects who agree to participate will sign the approved informed consent form and will be provided a copy of the signed document.    The initial ICF, any subsequent revised written ICF and any written information provided to the subject must approved by [CONTACT_57425]. The ICF will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, 
 
[ADDRESS_203362] (FDAMA) and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), the Sponsor-Investigator of the trial is solely responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements for submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information posted will allow subjects to identify potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participation by [CONTACT_3379] a central contact [CONTACT_57426].  7.[ADDRESS_203363] medical records and other source documentation will be kept for the maximum time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution, or medical practice.    8. Statistical Considerations  The data structure for the patient reported outcomes is longitudinal, and data could be missing at certain time points (e.g. a patient provides data at 8 but not 12 months). We will use a general estimating equations approach using a Gaussian link-function and auto-regressive correlation. The covariates will adjust for adverse events (prostate cancer aggressiveness [low or intermediate risk], age [continuous], race [white, black, other], comorbidity score [Charlson Index]) plus baseline disease-specific HRQOL score; treatment group will be entered as four separate variables (e.g. PGA 1 or 0; RP 1 or 0; SBRT 1 or 0; IMRT 1 or 0) with AS as the reference group.   Because differences between groups will vary by [CONTACT_5586] (e.g. large decreases in urinary function in the surgery group at month 8, smaller by [CONTACT_24473] 12), we will include a time by [CONTACT_165572]. This model provides adjusted differences from AS over time for each treatment, along with a 95% CI and a p-value. From these estimates, it is straightforward to conduct pairwise comparisons (e.g. sexual function between PGA and surgery). As a sensitivity analysis, we will use propensity scores as the covariate as described above, again excluding patients at the extremes of the propensity distribution.   Adverse events will be treated as binary variables, defined as present or absent, with the severity being characterized by [CONTACT_174145]. Mild AEs (grade 1) will be excluded because it typi[INVESTIGATOR_174137]. However, inclusion of mild AEs will be considered in sensitivity analysis. Type and severity of AEs will be described separately by [CONTACT_3148].   The analysis will be by [CONTACT_174146]. The covariates will be age (continuous), BMI (using restricted cubic splines with knots at 30 and 35), comorbidity score (Charlson index), clinical stage (T1c or T2a, T2b, T2c, T3/4), NCCN risk group and pretreatment PSA (CI-5). Treatment group will be entered as 3 separate variables (i.e. PGA 1 or 0; SBRT 1 or 0; IMRT 1 or 0) with surgery as the reference group.  We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis using propensity methods – where propensity for treatment is derived from a multinomial logistic regression with the same covariates as above – and excluding any patient with >95% or <15% chance of receiving any of the treatments.  
 
[ADDRESS_203364] a rate of 10% in the IMRT and RP arms. The main HRQOL endpoint of interest is EPIC-26 sexual function. The estimated number of patients we will evaluate is as follows: AS 300; PGA: 280; SBRT: 288; IMRT: 316; RP: 333. This is based on the incidence of low and intermediate prostate cancer in the SCa and NYS SEER registries.

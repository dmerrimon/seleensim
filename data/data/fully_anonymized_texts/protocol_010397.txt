Version date: 6/03/[ADDRESS_637922] and evaluate a care quality improvement intervention featuring 
use of consensus decisional guidance for the medical management of diabetes (DM) patients 
with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia ( ADRD) in primary  care at NYU Langone Health. 
This quality improvement program will include provider (PCP) workflow enhancements supported 
by a panel manager  (PM) for workflow support,  electronic health record (EHR) decision support 
and feedback, and PCP collaborative learning.   
 It will test hypotheses about  whether
 care based on explicit standards for DM medical 
management for people with ADRD will: H1)  Improve  patient  symptoms and quality of life while 
maintaining expected clinical outcomes; H2) decrease patient and  caregiver  management burden 
and improve care quality based on patient/caregiver preferences; H3) (secondary)  decrease 
specialty, ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85284].   
In order to test and evaluate this program, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) and evaluate it using mixed methods (surveys and interviews) in [ADDRESS_637923] in the intervention (INT) and control (CON) group (1,000 total).  
 
If EQUIPED demonstrates that patients and family caregivers who receive this quality
 
improvement program achieve established goals for diabetic care in addition to fewer dementia-
related symptoms,  less caregiver burden and stress, and fewer DM -related adverse events, 
potentially avoidable and costly  utilization  may also decrease. This best practice approach could 
then be widely disseminated to other clinical  practices.

1) Implement and evaluate a pragmatic trial in a large healthcare system using cluster 
randomization, and the practice change framework, that will: manage people with co-
occurring DM and ADRD according to the guidelines developed to test our hypotheses 
and identify additional patients  with cognitive  impairment  and inappropriate  DM 
management.   
2) Test whether EQUIPED -ADRD will increase the proportion of intervention patients who 
are in desirable glycemic and blood pressure ranges compared to control  patients.  
3) Test whether the EQUIPED -ADRD intervention will improve dyad perception of care 
quality and reduce treatment burden.  
4) Test whether dementia symptoms will deteriorate less in intervention subjects compared to controls.

1.3 Background  
Over 11 million Americans ≥[ADDRESS_637926] Diabetes (DM)1, a prototypic chronic disease requiring 
self- management.2 While the linear increase in prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementia  (ADRD)  associated with increasing age is well known, diabetic patients of similar ages 
may have as much as a  two-fold risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_496252].3–6 Emerging 
evidence suggests pathophysiological  links between DM and both AD and microvascular 
dementia.7,8 DM management is complex and includes  management of co -existing risks, 
complications and relate d diseases (hypertension, cardiovascular  and microvascular disease). 
Cognitive impairment likely challenges diabetic self -management placing  responsibility and 
additional stress on family caregivers. Management complexity requires logistical skills, complex 
decision- making  and understanding of risks and disease  trajectories  so caregivers  must  be 
deeply  involved  in managing DM in dementia patients. Some patients with DM and ADRD are not 
diagnosed and/or recognized as cognitively impaired9 and their caregivers may be insufficiently 
involved, unrecognized or unsupported,  further  challenging DM management.  
 
Over and under treatment of DM and its medical complications in some ADRD patients,[ADDRESS_637927] 
and DM severity, race/ethnicity, health status, and life expectancy.[ADDRESS_637928],15 ADVANCE,16 and related studies provide substantial trial and observational 
evidence about  DM management in elders and DM’s relationship to dementia, but clinical 
uncertainty exists. This suggests  that health priorities and preferences of DM -ADRD patients and 
caregivers should help direct DM  management.  But the push towards value- based payment and 
the focus by [CONTACT_496268].  
 
The relationship between diabetes and dementia: Underlying the co- occurrence of DM and 
ADRD is  a 1.5- 2.[ADDRESS_637929] presents a significant challenge for clinicians, patients and CGs 
because these co- occurring diseases increase clinical uncertaint y, complicate management of 
both conditions, and too often lead to care burden and poor outcomes for patients and CGs, and 
confusion and frustration for  providers.  
 
Cognitive impairment may be undetected in DM: Cognitive impairment and dementia are 
frequently  undetected in DM, leading to poor quality of care for both conditions.21,[ADDRESS_637930] trouble with self -management, which could

lead to under - or over - treatment  of hyperglycemia, hypertension9 and poor adherence to diet and 
exercise.3 The American Diabetes  Association (ADA) and the American Geriatrics Association 
(AGS) Guidelines advocate screening for ADRD in DM.39–[ADDRESS_637931]. Soo Borson (a member of our study team). This has been cited in numerous  
studies  comparing  the feasibility and accuracy of several tests.[ADDRESS_637932] experience DM over -treatment and under -treatment: Diabetes care  
includes  management of hyperglycemia, blood pressure, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and monitoring for 
microvascular and  macro - vascular complications, using pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic 
(diet and exercise)  management.39,[ADDRESS_637933] and DM, ranging from over 50- 63% of high 
risk veterans  having HbA1c<7%.10 Hypertension in DM can be over - or under -treated; ACCORD 
and ADVANCE  provide evidence for moderate management of hypertension in DM.15,16,[ADDRESS_637934] (EQUIPED- ADRD) we aim  to target glycemic and 
blood pressure (BP) management based on ACCORD and ADVANCE evidence to decrease both 
over and under treatment. During the R21 phase of this study we developed consensus  decisional 
guidance related to glycemia (measured as “HbA1c”) and BP targets that also address  monitoring 
for risks of complications, any new cholesterol recommendations, and non- pharmacological DM  
management  with a goal of identifying safe, high quality management guidelines for DM -ADRD 
patients to be  implemented in the R33 phase. These guidelines address 1) screening for cognitive 
impairment in older  DM patients with out -of-desired range of HbA1c or BP but no ADRD 
diagnosis, 2) CG support, and 3)  treatment based on CG  preferences.  
 Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and cognition – a complex story: The relationship between 
cognition and hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia is complex. People with hyperglycemia perform 
more poorly on tests  of cognition,
49,[ADDRESS_637935]- MIND/MRI, more hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_496253]25 or MRI differences related to 
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] .[ADDRESS_637936] which is subsequently recognized.26 Although dementia severity is related 
to hypoglycemia, the role of glycemic control in causing or preventing hypoglycemia is less clear; 
thus, hypoglycemia is not an outcome in our study. However, utilization is a study outcome, so

we will observe and analyze hypoglycemia leading to clinic, ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399], adding to 
evidence about hypoglycemia’s relationship to DM management in ADRD.  
 
Family and friends provide 75% of daily care needs for patients with ADRD living in the 
community:[ADDRESS_637937] patients demonstrated 
increased supervision time.12 CG burden is known to be linked to patients’ behavioral problems, 
poor cognition, and increased dependency; a recent study demonstrates increased burden related to medications and medical care supervision.
58 CG stress is associated with poor 
outcomes for dementia CGs themselves, such as depressive symptoms often meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder
59 and ED visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].60 Decreasing CG stress 
improves outcomes for patients with AD61,62;CG burden and stress are important outcomes for 
our study . 
 
ADRD’s increase healthcare utilization and costs for DM patients: A comprehensive analysis of 
1999 Medicare claims data showed that all types of utilization and costs (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496254], physicians, nursing homes and home health), were increased for dementia patients.30 
For Medicare beneficiaries with a dementia diagnosis, DM was present in 21% versus 16% of 
non-dementia patients. The same analysis showed significantly different crude rates of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/1000 beneficiaries (OR 3.36 [2.44- 4.44]) for DM - ADRD vs. DM without ADRD. 
Data from 2007- 08, focusing on potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496255], showed 
that Medicare costs and utilization are higher and the main driver of increased costs is increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].

DM management in ADRD patients – summary of current evidence and gaps: Consensus on best 
management of DM in ADRD patients is lacking. High quality DM care in people ≥[ADDRESS_637939] 
guidelines.63  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_34280], research discussed above (mostly observational, some 
from trials) concerning DM -ADRD informs management approaches: moderate control of 
hyperglycemia and BP is appropriate, DM quality improvement is safe, feasible and may improve 
survival in older DM patients,64 hypoglycemia is a major risk, “self” -management must be handled 
by [CONTACT_220678], and CGs need support. However, available evidence has not led to consensus decisional 
management guidance for patients/CGs and providers (international efforts are beginning),35,[ADDRESS_637940] patients: The evidence reviewed above points to meaningful outcomes for 
the patient/CG dyad that high quality DM -ADRD care must achieve – CG support, decreased 
burden and attention to preferences; improved quality of life based on decreased symptoms and stable function for patients; and decreased healthcare utilization. Too often DM -ADRD patients 
are not represented in studies used for DM quality metrics and payers may not be aware of ADA 
and AGS positions. Our project will define high quality management and meaningful outcomes 
for this vulnerable, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_496256].

2. Study Design  
 
The design is a mixed methods evaluation of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 
clinical quality improvement program for patients with diabetes (DM) and Alzheimer ’s disease 
and Related Dementias (DM -ADRD).  The RCT will occur at NYU Langone  Health and affiliated 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4813]. We are using mixed methods (surveys and qualitative interviews) to better 
understand patient, caregiver (CG) and provider experiences and outcomes.  
 
3. Subject Population 
 
3.[ADDRESS_637941] NYU Langone Health primary care practices , 9 Intervention 
(INT)  clinics and 9 control (CON) clinics. We will enroll 1,000 patients (and their caregivers) ≥65 
with diabetes (DM) and Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia (ADRD) from these practices based on the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria below. As stated in inclusion and

3.3 Vulnerable Subjects  
 Patients with cognitive impairment and their caregivers are a vulnerable group; however, the 
procedures employed in this clinical trial are low risk and have been successfully employed 
without incident in a number of other studies by [CONTACT_496269]. The patient has the right to decline participation for any potential caregiver who assists them or direct the caregiver to withdraw participation at any time. See Section 5.[ADDRESS_637942] Participation   
 Participant dyads (patient and caregiver) will be in the study for a  maximum of 24 months 
(surveyed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months ). Only caregivers will complete surveys and 
interviews.  
 
4. Quality Improvement Program – Description of the QI intervention In this 
quality improvement program,  INT and CON clinics will be provided with quality improvement 
activities for patients with diabetes and ADRD.  
For both the INT and CON clinics: 
We will provide decisional guidance (the guideline); materials about community and NYU 
Langone Health resources for managing patients with DM -ADRD, particular ly caregiver support 
services; advice on referrals for both DM and cognitive specialty care; provider education, and 
basic feedback. We will try to identify a clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_496258].   
We w ill receive some workflow support for the quality improvement program. This will include 
Epic-based EHR enhancements such as guidance for MiniCogTM cognitive screening; provider 
scripts for decisional guidance discussions, especially for care de- escalation and cognitive 
screening results. Basic feedback and education will occur in both INT and CON clinics 
including yearly meetings with PCPs for education and feedback on DM and ADRD 
management.  
Preparation for the PCPs will occur either before or very soon after the quality improvement 
program begins. The research team will meet with clinic providers and staff at a monthly 
meeting. PCPs will receive a 30- 60 minutes in person training including introduction to the 
 
 
Study #: s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  
   
 Page 10 
Version date: 6/03/2020 
 
   
decisional guidance, introduction to clinical resources and possibly other educational materials, 
such as templates and scripts.  
Based on the guideline, providers will be encouraged to develop individualized management 
targets, particularly for HbA1c and BP, for each patient, and re- evaluate these targets over time. 
Providers will also be trained in cognitive screening with the MiniCogTM .  Clinic staff will be 
trained in minor workflow changes  related to the intervention.  
INT Clinic s: 
In the INT clinics we will introduce the panel manager (PM) to all clinic staff and develop 
processes for interaction.  The PM will work with INT clinic providers to individualize 
communication methods between the PCP and PM.  Each month INT clinic providers will get a 
list of eligible patients who have appointments with them in the coming month - those with 
diagnoses of DM -ADRD and those [ADDRESS_637943] -funded PM will deliver the 
intervention, fitting it as closely as possible into usual clinical workflow. The clinical team 
includes PCPs, occasional APNs and PAs (who function as PCPs), RN’s, MA’s, office staff, and 
clinic onsite administration. The PM will be part of the team; PMs providing chronic disease self -
management support (usually telephonic) are clinic team members in many healthcare systems.  
We will assign two PMs to [ADDRESS_637944] ≥65 years; and about an equal number with DM without ADRD who 
will screen positive for cognitive impairment, most of whom are ≥75 years and identified by [CONTACT_13505]1c/BP over or under treatment, or identified by [CONTACT_267814], which we will allow. With [ADDRESS_637945] an anticipated 300 dyads. PMs can engage about 33 patients/month, making initial 300 patient/CG contact [INVESTIGATOR_2993] 9 
months.  
The PM will clinically decide how/which patients to engage in what order. We think that 
engaging DM -ADRD patients/caregivers around their PCP visit makes the most sense for the 
dyad, the PCP and the PM and we have established that process.  However, as a clinician, the PM may identify other patients with significant needs and may engage them as soon as patient 
is identified (i.e. patient over 75 with poor BP control, social needs, and PCP suspects cognitive problem). For the INT clinics we think this approach will ensure 1) adequate time to engage all 
dyads with thorough evaluation for those who meet criteria for care quality improvement; 2) 
focused presence to engage and be known to the PCPs in that clinic; and 3) time needed to 
ensure initial follow -up of recommended actions to ensure that recommended car e processes 
are completed. Supporting activities will continue for each previously engaged clinic when 
moving onto the next clinic. We anticipate patient/caregiver loss over the 3 years of the study 
and the sample will be refreshed with patients with new diagnoses and who are new to the 
clinic. Although these patient/caregiver dyads will be followed for shorter durations, they will be 
enrolled as discussed in 4.2 and they will contribute information until the end of the study.

PM Qualifications and Training: The PM will be a licensed healthcare professional, either an RN 
or pharmacist.  She/he will meet all criteria needed for hiring and credentialing within the NYU 
Langone Health clinical enterprise.  Required qualifications:  RN or clinical pharmacist; 2 years’ 
experience in licensed role.  Preferred characteristics: Certified diabetes educator (CDE); 
geriatrics experience, Spanish fluency.  
Because we plan to hire two PMs, a combination CDE who is also an RN, and a clinical pharmacist would provide complementary expertise, although a second RN would also be acceptable. As noted below, we plan that the PM will work mainly with particular clinics to 
develop relationships with providers and clinic staff, but we also anticipate that they will work on 
relevant cases in any clinic where complementary expertise may be useful.  For example, if only 
one PM speaks Spanish, regardless of INT clinic, that PM would handle Spanish speaking dyads.   
We will train intervention PMs in DM and ADRD management for INT clinics.  Training will 
include one- on-one sessions with the mPI’s and co- I’s, suggested reading, shadowing relevant 
clinicians, such as social workers in the Alzheimer’s Disease Center and geriatrics clinic, and 
other relevant activities. We expect training will require one month’s duration with subsequent 
continuous learning activities that include continuing meetings with mPIs and co- I’s and travel to 
national conferences.  
PM Activities. The PM will reach out to eligible patients with diagnosed DM -ADRD (see section 
4.3) and ≥75 year -old patients with over - and under -treatment of HbA1c/BP for cognitive 
screening using IQ-CODE
 as defined in the Guideline. For those with a positive screen, in 
coordination with the PCP, the PM will facilitate further cognitive evaluat ion.  These patients will 
become part of the quality improvement intervention. The PM will begin telephonic assessment and DM management education of DM -ADRD patients around the time of the scheduled visit 
(either just before or just after). The PM will conduct a detailed psychosocial and needs 
assessment with each willing CG and assess the patient based on both a standardized 
assessment and clinical judgement. The PM will also engage those CGs who live far from the 
patient and who manage the patient remotely through paid home heath aids (HHA). The CG 
psychosocial assessment will focus on diabetic management support and family dementia CG support providing referrals as needed to well established [LOCATION_001] City programs. The PM will 
provide PCPs with evaluation data, DM -relevant care suggestions and facilitate PCP visits for 
care reassessment as clinically appropriate. The PM will assist the PCP and the dyad with developi[INVESTIGATOR_496259]- evaluating these targets over time. 
The PM w ill maintain dyad follow -ups and monitor patient -level data using EHR follow -up data 
as per usual clinical care, and an Epic -generated report for relevant issues.  The PM will also 
address dyad goals and treatment preferences and assist with communicating these with the 
PCP. A key part of PM activity will be determining with each PCP their preferred method of 
communication (e.g., Epic messaging, order pending, periodic phone calls, etc).  
At primary care visits of DM patients with known ADRD or a positive cognitive screen, PCPs, 
coordinating with PMs, will proceed with DM management according to EQUIPED -ADRD 
Guidelines. PCPs will have PM information about CG stress, treatment preferences, and need for CG support referrals through the PM notes or Epic “in- basket” communications.  PCPs will 
reassess as needed and encourage referrals. In patients with a positive cognitive screen, PCPs will follow guidelines for further cognitive evaluation per dyad preference. PCPs will have scripts 
to facilitate discussions, knowing that the PM will follow -up with the dyad after the visit. Clinic

Version date: 6/03/[ADDRESS_637946] management support as clinically appropriate to meet management targets, 
communicating as needed with t he PCP. EHR -generated reports on DM management will 
support intervention PCPs and PMs.  
Provider Feedback.  In the INT clinics, bi -annual reports will be given to providers and these will 
be discussed at bi -annual meetings which will be either by [CONTACT_314137]; in- person 
meetings will be held at least once a year. The provider –specific reports will detai l DM-ADRD 
patients’ medical management metrics such as numbers of caregiver referrals to community 
support, any changes in proportions of patients in range for HbA1c and BP, and the number of older adults with DM screened for cognitive impairment.  Monthly  patients lists will serve as 
periodic reminders of the quality improvement program. Other feedback and collaborative learning opportunities for INT clinic providers include quarterly “office hour” webinars with the 
mPI’s and co -I’s to review the reports and brainstorm opportunities for improvement.  
CON Clinics : 
Providers will get a list of eligible patients DM -ADRD initially, giving them the opportunity to 
follow the decisional guidance. In addition, the guideline will specify cognitive screening in DM 
patients, ≥75 years with high or low HbA1cs or BP’s because we suspect that these values may 
represent self -management red flags due to cognitive (especially memory and executive) 
impairment. During training the CON providers will be encouraged to do cognitive screening as well as follow the guidelines in general. Clinics can decide who does the cognitive screen, such 
as a RN or MA, using the MiniCog
TM we will address this issue in the guideline and during 
provider training. Per guidelines, any patient with a MiniCogTM score < [ADDRESS_637947] 
further cognitive assessment per the guideline and preferences of the patient/caregiver dyad. These patients will also become eligible for the evaluation and can be identified by [CONTACT_496270] -ADRD diagnoses in the CON clinics. When 
identified we will enroll them for the evaluation (4.2). As with INT clinic patients, we anticipate 
patient/caregiver loss over the [ADDRESS_637948]. These meetings will serve to answer 
questions, get feedback from PCPs and provide general feedback on the progress of the quality 
improvement program.  
 
5.  Methods and Procedures (Evaluation) 
 
5.1 Screening and Identification  
 
We will use NYU Langone Health Epic to identify patients in the INT and CON clinics who meet 
inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Section 3.2.  
There will be three levels of screening:  
 
 
Study #: s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  
   
 Page 13 
Version date: 6/03/2020 
 
   
• Level 1:  Initial screening will be automated by [CONTACT_496271] a report 
based on inclusion criteria (above).  
 
• Level 2: The initial list of patients generated by [CONTACT_496272] (see Section 3.2 ). Should the 
patient not meet inclusion criteria, for example they don’t actually have a diagnosis of 
diabetes, or speak English or Spanish; the patient will be removed from the list of 
potentially eligible patients.  
 
• Level 3: Those patients who remain eligible following chart review  to their PCP’s in the 
INT clinics to notify them about their patients with DM -ADRD. The PCP’s will be 
encouraged to review their list and decide if a patient is misclassified or inappropriate; 
some will review the lists and some will not. Any patient a PCP indicates as inappropriate 
or misclassified will be ineligib le and will be screen failures. The amended list of eligible 
patients with both DM and ADRD for both the INT and CON clinics will go back to the RM who will send a letter to the patients informing the patients/caregiver of the quality 
improvement program and of a potential telephonic survey.  
 
While e ligible patients are easily identified by [CONTACT_332762], their caregivers (the respondents to the 
surveys and interviews to evaluate the quality improvement program) are not always listed in the 
patient chart.  To identify an appropriate caregiver, a letter from the primary care physician will ask 
the patient to read the letter and then give it to their caregiver . The letter will explain the quality 
program briefly and state that a research assistant will call the patient’s home unless they do not want to be called.  
 If the dyad, for whatever reason, does not want to participate in a call, they will be asked to opt 
out using the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of NYU Langone Health as outlined in SOP 
#HSR- 312, Version Number 2.0. This SOP states that patients are able to opt -out of the Direct 
Recruitment process either by [CONTACT_648] (1- [PHONE_2698]) or email (research- contact -
[EMAIL_2365]). Patients who wish to opt out must provide at least three of the following identifiers:   
 
1. Full name 
2. Date of birth  
3. Address  
4. Medical record number  
 
The opt -out phone line and email account are managed by [CONTACT_496273] (OSR) 
personnel. Authorized OSR personnel and the Senior Director of Compliance and Privacy are the  
only individuals authorized to add patients to the opt out list. Should we receive a patient opt out 
request we will instru ct the patient to follow th is process. OSR will process this request upon 
receipt of all required information, and update the patient status in a tracking sheet and in Epic to “Do Not Contact.”  
 5.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation  
 
5.2.1 Process of Consent  
 The patient and caregiver (dyad) is enrolled in the study (the evaluation of the RCT of a quality

improvement program) when verbal consent (or assent, see E3) is obtained from the patient and 
caregiver.  
 
Verbal Consent  
We are requesting a HIPPA waiver of authorization and documentation of consent  in order for 
caregivers  and patients to give verbal consent for the survey , qualitative interview  and use of 
patient  data (EHR and claims).  
 
We request the use of verbal consent and a waiver for documentation of  consent  because:  
 
1) This study presents no more than minimal risks to privacy for subjects. All survey data 
obtained will be stored in HIPPA compliant REDCap library accessible only to the IRB 
approved study team. All data exported from REDCap will be fully de- identified, and  
contain no subject identifiers. 
 
2) It would not be possible to conduct this study without the use and analysis of subject PHI to evaluate the improvement in care for patients, and burden for caregivers. Investigators will take all precautions, outlined in Section 6.[ADDRESS_637949] the privacy and maintain confidentiality of subjects.  
 
3) Surveys and qualitative interviews  will occur by [CONTACT_496274] 1,000 patients and caregiver dyads.  
 
4) Verbal consent provides opportunity to fully explain study procedures, risks and benefits 
and assess  for capacity to consent, an important and necessary procedure in this 
population both for patients  and caregivers.  
 
5) It Requiring an elderly person to recall, interpret, and understand requested instructions for consent purposes through mail will result in many unreturned documents and an 
unfair prevention of participation for those persons who want to participate but are 
otherwise “unable” to.  
 
6) Finally, in the clinical space, where HIPPA rules are equally enforced, we conduct verbal consents  for release of information when written consents are not feasible and 
complete that authorization by [CONTACT_496275] a legally authorized representative 
(in this case, a physician).  
 
Step by s tep process of consent:  
1. INT: RA mails letter ( see Patient Letter) to patients in INT clinic signed by [CONTACT_496276], 
lead physician, or primary provider (depending on clinic preference) informing them about 
EQUIPED quality improvement program and evaluation. 
 
2. INT and CON : RA calls eligible patient and/or caregiver using contact [CONTACT_496277]. If caregiver information is not available in the chart, the RA will ask the 
patient for caregiver contact [CONTACT_3031].  
 
3. INT and CON : RA screen Patient and/or Caregiver for Capacity to Consent ( See section E3)  
a. If the patient demonstrates capacity, the patient is deemed able to provide verbal 
consent to have the study team  talk to the caregiver  to obtain their verbal consent  
 
 
Study #: s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  
   
 Page 15 
Version date: 6/03/[ADDRESS_637950] the study personal obtain and analyze health data (medical records and 
claims). 
b. I f the patient does not have capacity and assents  to the study, the RA is able to speak 
to the caregiver who provides verbal consent for the caregiver survey  , and the H ealth 
Care Proxy (HCP)  (who may or may not be the caregiver) provides verbal consent 
for study personnel to obtain and analyze the patients’ health data (medical records 
and claims).   
c. I f the patient does not have capacity, and refuses  (no assent), the dyad will not be 
enrolled although the clinical team (Panel Manager) can re- contact [CONTACT_496278].  
 
4. INT and CON : If the caregiver demonstrates capacity (screened using Capacity to Consent, 
at the discretion of the RA) verbal consent will be documented by [CONTACT_496279]. Caregiver consent covers 
participation in 4 telephone surveys.   
 A healthcare proxy is an individual who is designated as a representative/agent through a health care proxy signed by [CONTACT_496280]/agent. For a health care 
proxy to be effective, it must have been signed at a time when the subject had decision- making 
capacity. In addition, the health care proxy must not specifically prohibit research.  Determination 
of the legal authority of a surrogate will be obtained through Epic, or verbally by [CONTACT_5363]/or caregiver.  
 Potential subjects will be told that their involvement in the study is completely voluntary and that they can withdraw from the study at any point. Caregivers may themselves be elderly and might 
have cognitive impairment such that it impacts their capacity to consent to research. For all 
potential participants, we will assess the individual’s ability to provide informed consent using 
IRB approved interview procedures to assess capacity to consent for research. Some subjects 
may be too hearing impaired to communicate by [CONTACT_496281]’s capacity to consent. Although we have conducted numerous studies with elderly 
subjects, this has been a rare occurrence. Nonetheless we will not enroll any caregiver 
participant who cannot communicate by [CONTACT_756].  
 
If the patient demonstrates capacity  (See E3. Subject Capacity), the patient is deemed able to 
provide verbal consent to have the RA talk to the caregiver and to have the study personal obtain and analyze health data. If the patient does not have capacity  and assents the caregiver will 
provide verbal consent for the caregiver survey, and the HCP (who may or may not be the caregiver) provides verbal consent for the health data (medical records and claims). If the patient refuses (with or without capacity), the dyad will not be enrolled although the clinical team can re -
contact [CONTACT_496282].  
 
If the caregiver, after following our standard consent procedures, demonstrates capacity using 
the below questions, verbal consent  will be documented and the caregiver will be consented to 
the study. Caregiver consent covers participation in 4 telephone  surveys.  Patient (with capacity) 
or HCP (if patient assents but does not have capacity) will provide verbal consent for health data  
(EHR and claims information). The research assistant will document this agreement to 
participate using a standardized form kept for documentation purposes.

the Treatment Burden Questionnaire (TBQ) for Caregivers and identify any potential 
problems that may compromise the quality of data collected using the TBQ with caregivers. The purpose of these interviews is to validate this tool for future studies to measure treatment burden of caregiver s. These  60 interviews will be audio recorded 
(included in verbal consent) and transcribed. Audio tapes will be destroyed once 
transcriptions are complete, which will be stored in a HIPAA -compliant NYU secure 
server.  
 
 
3. Provider/Staff Qualitative Interviews will be conducted using  purposive sampling 
framework with members from each category: internal medicine physician; specialty 
physician; care managements and nursing. Written informed consent will be obtained.  Intervie ws will be conducting via phone. These interviews will be audio recorded  and 
transcribed. Audio tapes will be destroyed once transcriptions are complete, which will 
be stored in a HIPAA -compliant NYU secure server.   
 
4. Patient data from Epic . An trained member of the research team (Research Coordinator) 
who will be blinded to participant INT or CON group affiliation will be responsible for 
collecting and entering EHR data into REDCap for enrolled patients. The dyad will have 
consented verbally to review of their medical record in Epic.  In order to evaluate this quality 
improvement intervention, the study team will pull and review administrative data from Epic on patients in the intervention and control clinics. These  data will be de -identified and 
used to monitor safety and evaluate effectiveness of the intervention.

and includes questions about the CG and about the patient; ** Baseline utilization variables will have [ADDRESS_637957] been widely used to investigate how a caregiver perceives the patient’s conditions. Below we discuss instruments 
used for caregiver reported variables, as well as the use of EHR and claims to measure patient -
related variables. (Table [ADDRESS_637958] the qualitative evaluation. The qualitative study as 
discussed in Section 3 and elsewhere above, will investigate the experiences of caregivers, 
patients and providers.)  
 
Variables describing the patients, caregivers and clinics include: a) characteristics of patients and 
of caregivers, including demographics, marital status, living arrangements, and general health 
and function; b) patient medical and utilization characteristics, including comorbid conditions, 
medication complexity, patient symptoms potentially related to diabetes or to medication use and 
changes, depression and history of substance uses and healthcare utilization in the prior year.  
Dementia specific characteristics of the patients include type of dementia, its severity, and function. The survey respondent is always the caregiver, although the questions may measure 
patient or caregiver status.  
 
We will also measure structure of care variables. These include patient use of consistent PCP 
care, home health services, and patient  insurance. Clinic characteristics are size, support staff 
number, proportion of Medicare and Medicaid patients.  Several baseline variables relate to 
diabetes but because they are also outcome variables they will be described later.  As shown in 
table 1, many of these baseline and control variables are measured in the EHR and Epic 
administrative reports, or by [CONTACT_496285]. Some are measured by [CONTACT_496286], which 
are discussed briefly below.  
 
We will collect m any process  of care measures at baseline and at follow -up.  These include: a) 
provider use of Epic templates and tools; b) provider attendance at educational sessions; c) PM -
PCP communication; d) PM -caregiver contact [CONTACT_35043]; e) referral for caregiver -support 
servi ces; f) cognitive screening of diabetes patients over 75; g) change in diabetes medications; 
h) change in hypertensive medications; i) change in anticholinergic burden; j) change in 
medication complexity.  These variables are measured by [CONTACT_496287].   
 
Outcome variables  i
 nclude HbA1c level and blood pressure.  These variables will be measured 
at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months when available. Our main outcome is the proportion of patients 
achieving consensus HbA1c targets. BP will be measured by [CONTACT_496288].  Theses variables will be measured by [CONTACT_14578].   
 
Utilization outcome variables  ar e ED, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], SNF and ambulatory clinic utilization measured by 
[CONTACT_496289] (for non -[LOCATION_001] Langone Health utilization).  SNF days must be measured 
by [CONTACT_496285]; Epic reports have discharge destination but do not have SNF days. Utilization variables 
will be measured at 6, 12, 24  months; the baseline measures include a 20 month look back  at 
utilization.  
 
Multiple caregiver reported outcomes  about  the caregiver and about the patients will also be 
 
 
Study #: s18 -[ZIP_CODE]

collected at 0, 6, 12, 24 months. General outcomes include: a) caregiver perception of care quality 
(our main caregiver -reported outcome), dyad care goals, preferences, and satisfaction; b) 
treatment burden; c) caregiver global health.  Dementia and diabetes specific outcomes include: 
a) patient dementia symptoms; b) caregiver diabetes stress.  
 Below is a brief description of the instruments we will use, all of which have been studied and 
validated, although not always with caregivers.  
 
• Social Support MOS -5.  This survey instrument has been used to investigate social 
support for caregivers of dementia patients and is well studied.
79, 80 It has 5 questions.  
 • Global Health (Promis Scale v1.2):  This commonly used instrument from the Promis 
series of instruments
83 assesses the general health of the caregiver and is reported 
by [CONTACT_359895]. It has 10 questions. 
 • Diabetes Caregiver Distress Scale:  This scale is adapted from the diabetes distress 
scale.
84 We were unable to find a diabetes care distress or care burden scale that is 
directed at caregivers, even when checking literature for type 1 diabetes and children 
with diabetes.  We therefore will use this instrument for caregivers although it is usually 
given to patients.  It has 7 questions.  
 
• Mental Health and Substance Use: These 5 questions ask about caregiver history 
of mental health, including stress and depression, alcohol and illicit drug u se. 
 
 
• Treatment Burden Questionnaire (TBQ): This in strument has been used in studies 
with patients but not with caregivers who are supervising or providing care for care-
patients (patients).  The form has [ADDRESS_637959] psychometric evaluation to validate the TBQ for use 
with caregivers.  
 
• Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS): This is a caregiver questionnaire that asks 
about the patient’s dementia characteristics.87 It has been used in many studies, 
including studies by [CONTACT_27156], and is well validated.  This scale includes questions 
related to the patient’s functional ability.  
 
• COVID Questionnaire: This instrument assesses the impact of COVID -[ADDRESS_637960] once (baseline or follow -up) with every caregiver/care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_441710].  
 
• Follow -up COVID Questionnaire: This survey will capture any changes that may 
have occurred since the first COVID survey and will be administered to any 
participant that has already completed an initial survey.  
 
 
 
Study #: s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  
   
 Page 26 
Version date: 6/03/[ADDRESS_637961] variables measured by [CONTACT_496290] -explanatory.  However, two other 
instruments will be used with EHR and claims.  
 
• Patient: Charlson Comorbidity Index:  This well- known modified index will be 
calculated from the EHR and/or claims.88 
 
• Patient: Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale:  This is also a commonly used 
scale derived from chart review that has been used in the past by [CONTACT_27156].[ADDRESS_637962].  
 
No survey or qualitative interview data will be gathered without patient and caregiver consent (or 
in some cases, patient assent). However, some questions may cause anxiety, embarrassment or 
be emotionally upsetting. The RA/RC will receive training in minimizing emotional impact or 
discomfort and remind subjects that they may discontinue participation at any time. [CONTACT_496304] 
is experienced in qualitative interviews and will also minimize emotional impact or discomfort. In the event of significant emotional upset, the mPIs will be notified and will intervene to address any 
concerns.  
 
Subject loss of confidentiality is another risk of clinical trials like the one proposed here and with 
this type of data collection. However, the computerized assisted telephone interview (CATI) and in some cases, in person, data collection method using a REDCap survey tool that we utilize is 
specifically designed to mitigate such loss as no data is collected with personal identifiers and 
contact [CONTACT_104847], addresses and telephone numbers, which are maintained in separate databases.  
  
6.[ADDRESS_637963] (see below) and all personnel are trained in Human Subjects Research HIPPA standards, and data security.  
 To further protect  against risk to loss of subject confidentiality, all records will be coded with 
anonymous identifiers. Only de- identified data will be shared with the research team without a 
need to know identifying information. Documentation of consent will be encrypted and will not be 
known by [CONTACT_496291]. We will keep one separate and password protected and 
encrypted computer file that contains identifiable data that is necessary to contact [CONTACT_1766] (phone numbers and U.S. mailing addresses). This file will be the only file that can link subject names,

Version date: 6/03/2020 
 
   
addresses, and/or telephone numbers to the study unique codes, and is only accessible by [CONTACT_496292].  
 
Qualitative interviews with caregivers and providers/staff will be audio recorded should patients 
verbally consent. Audio recording is necessary for transcription and qualitative analysis of interviews. Audio tapes of subject interviews will be labeled with subject anonymous identifier  
(described above), only linked in a secure file accessed only by [CONTACT_496293]. Audio 
tapes will be destroyed once transcriptions are complete, which will be stored in a HIPAA -
compliant NYU secure server.   
All other computer files containing data from this study (survey and interview files and files containing medical record and claims data) will be stripped of identifiable data, and subjects will 
only be differentiated by [CONTACT_496294]. Data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_496261]. All identifying data will be eliminated from files 
before the statistician analyzes the data. All electronic data will be kept in password- protected 
databases and program files.  
 Procedures for maintaining c onfidentiality will be reviewed quarterly with the research team to 
assure compliance. Audiotaped intervention sessions that will be used to ensure the quality of the intervention and judge treatment fidelity will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dickson and subsequentl y 
destroyed. A separate consent for audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_129378]. All study personnel will be trained 
in data confidentiality, Human Subjects Research and HIPPA compliance, as will the panel 
managers. Even though the panel managers are part of the clinical  team and not the research 
team, they will interact with the research team and the patient/caregiver dyad and need to understand the context and relationship of the quality improvement program and the research evaluation.

and interquartile range; categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies. We will assess 
the balance by [CONTACT_496295] (e.g., age, gender, Charlson Index, socioeconomic status, baseline TBQ, etc.) using standard t ests (t -tests, Wilcoxon rank -sum tests, and χ2 tests 
as appropriate).  Any factors that appear to be unbalanced by [CONTACT_496296].  All hypothesis testing will be two- sided 
and conducted using a significance level of 0.05.  
 The primary outcome of ‘on target’ HbA1C values will be measured for each patient as a binary 
indicator.  The primary analysis will use a generalized linear mixed model approach, with a logit 
link, for the probability  of being ‘on target.’ The treatment group (CON vs INT) will be the primary 
fixed effect of interest; we will also include the practice as a random effect to accommodate clustering of patients within clinics.  We will also explore non- parametric methods such as quantile 
regression or other rank -based approaches.  As noted above, randomization should obviate the 
need for any additional covariate adjustment, but we will explore whether adjustment for clinic -
level characteristics (e.g., clinic size) and provider -level characteristics (e.g., provider 
demographics and panel size) is necessary.  We will use standard assessments of goodness -of-
fit, including residual plots, to evaluate the models.  Finally, in addition to reporting the treatment 
difference in terms of the odds ratio from the logistic regression, we will report absolute risk difference as well.   
The secondary outcome of TBQ score, transformed into a binary outcome using an appropriate 
threshold (e.g., the median) will also be assessed using generalized logistic mixed models as 
described above; the treatment group (CON vs INT) will be the primary fixed effect of interest, 
with practice included as a random effect. As with the primary outcome, we will assess the need 
for adjustment using demographic or clinical characteristics, and will evaluate goodness -of-fit 
using standard approaches. We will also evaluate the TBQ as a continuous score using a linear 
mixed model. We will assess the validity of the linearity assumption, and seek a suitable 
transformation of the TBQ score if it appears to be violated.  The statistical power for this analysis 
will be greater than that for the binary version of the outcome because of the additional information 
provided when using the scale in its original form.  
Health care utilization outcomes will be analyzed using similar generalized linear mixed models; 
indicators of use will employ the logistic  link function, and counts of days in various facility types 
will employ Poisson regression with the log link function. Treatment burden (using the Treatment Burden Scale) and dementia symptoms/cognitive function (using the DSRS) will also be evaluated 
as important secondary outcomes.  We will have repeated assessments of these items at 6, 12, 
and 24 months, and will apply longitudinal mixed effects models
 to evaluate the trajectories and 
assess whether they differ by [CONTACT_1570].  Specifically, we will  model time using indicator 
variables, and include interaction terms between time indicators and treatment group (CON vs 
INT); the statistical significance of the coefficients of the interaction terms will indicate whether 
 
 
Study #: s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  
   
 Page 29 
Version date: 6/03/[ADDRESS_637966].  We will choose link functions that address ordinal outcomes, such as the log link for ordered categorical 
outcomes, in the context of proportional odds or multinomial logistic regression.  
All clinical trials are at risk for missing data.  Although we will attempt to retain as high a fraction 
of participants as possible, we acknowledge that some attrition is likely, leading to missing 
outcome values. The generalized linear mixed models proposed for the primary and secondary 
analyses incorporate an assumption of data that are missing at random (MAR), meaning that the 
likelihood of a value being missing depends on observable characteristics (e.g., sex, age, baseline 
clinical status, etc).  In sensitivity analyses, we will assess the impact of different assumptions about the missing data mechanism, and will determine the robustness of trial results to these 
different a ssumptions.  These sensitivity analyses will take the several forms. The first extreme 
value imputation, in which we assume that all members of one intervention group experience either a success or a failure (e.g., HbA1 on or off target) while the opposite occurs in the other 
intervention group.  We will also apply a more formalized assessment using the Index of Sensitivity to Nonignorability, developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Troxel and colleagues, which provides an 
objective assessment of the robustness of trial results to  different assumptions about the missing 
data mechanism.  
 
8. Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
This study will be monitored by 1)  the multiple Principle Investigators ( mPIs ) and 2) the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ).

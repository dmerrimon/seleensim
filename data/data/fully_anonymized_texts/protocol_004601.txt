1.0 Study Personnel  
 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_812034], DO , Chief of the SVAMC SCI Unit

2.[ADDRESS_1124453] injury (SCI). Over 42,000 vetera ns hav e SCI, representing more 
than 15% of the total America n population with SCI. Followin g SCI, the colon is of ten 
unable to evacuate stools via peristaltic propulsion. Losing bowel func tion c an cau se 
constipation, gastro -intestinal complications, and fe cal in continence, severely impacting 
health and quality of l ife. 
 
The standard of care for individuals with neuro genic bowel dysfunction involves the 
design of a bowel program for predicta ble an d effe ctive elimination of the bowels. A 
bowel program include s diet , fluid intake, activity, and pharmaceutical or mechan ical 
rectal stimulation. Approx imately 80% of individ uals with neurogenic bowel 
dysfunction use digital stimulation of the rectu m to r eflexi vely activate the colon, 
improve colonic motility, and f acilit ate bowel evacuation. However, the bowel routine 
can r equire over an hour to evacuate  the bowels and this p rocess often requires the 
assistance of a caregiver, which adds to the cost  of ca re and  reduces independence. 
Restoring bowel function is consi dered a high priority by [CONTACT_812047],  
but it remains a critically unmet nee d requiring further devel opment. The top priority 
for individuals with tetraplegia is reaching an d hand  funct ion, but pelvic functions are 
still of high concern.  
 
Digital rectal distension is the clinical standard for eliciti ng colon motility. The majority  
of individuals with neur ogenic bowel dysfunction use digital rectal stimulation to 
mechanically disten d the rectum and reflexively activate colon peristalsis, which  loads  
stool into the rectum for bowel emptying. Digital rec tal distension takes advantage of an 
existing reflex pat hway affecting bowel function. The recto -colonic reflex has been well -
studied in cat s, dogs, and humans. Rectal distension activates mechano recept ors 
innervating the rectum, which sends afferent infor mation via small Aδ and C fiber s to 
the sacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_789239]. This input modulates a spi[INVESTIGATOR_812035], causing coordinated peristalsis and incre asing colonic 
motility. Digital rectal stimulation is effect ive, but it requires an individ ual, or a 
caregiver, to r each into the individual’s rectum with gloved fingers. Even with digital  
 Page [ADDRESS_1124454] provided supporting  evidence that 
electrical stimula tion of the rectum or distal colon can modulate  this excitatory recto -
colic reflex and potentially prom ote bo wel emptying. W e hope  to quantify the effects of 
minimal ly invasive electrical  rectal stimulation , in comparison to subjects ’ typi[INVESTIGATOR_812036] g routine,  on colonic activity in persons with neurogenic bowel dysfunction.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1124455] size and so power future studies  that measure colonic  
motil ity in response to electrical stimulation   
Our hypothesi s is that electrical  rectal stimulati on will produce increased colonic 
motility  that result s in defecation  and that defecation time will be similar to subjects’ 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_812037].   
4.[ADDRESS_1124456] able bowel routines . We will work with 
nursing staff  on the study  to maintain a consistent bowel emptying schedule for the 
subjects. We wil l not disrupt the patient’s typic al bowel emptying routi ne. On ly the 
Research Nurse will be comple ting any rese arch r elated procedures.  Data will be 
collected from subjects over [ADDRESS_1124457] the end of the exper iment period. Subjects will r eturn to their 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_812038] o f the 6-week stimulation testing period. For patients 
>[ADDRESS_1124458] of their typi[INVESTIGATOR_812039]. Nurse s will log dig stim data as they usually do and this data will be 
used as control data fo r the  study . During the e xperimental phase of the experiment, dig 
stim will be replaced with electrical stimulation. Use of electrical stim will not change 
the patients ’ bowel routine otherwise. There is no set schedule for the intervention 
because we are adapt ing to each pat ients ’ normal bowel routine. The only structure is 
that we have a defined control period using their normal routine, followed by a defined 
experimental period with the e lectrical stimulation. For a normal bowel routine, 
patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y receive bowel intervention every other day in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711].  
 
For subjects within 6 months of SCI diagnosis, but after the acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_812040], 
we will instead  alter nate between periods of control interven tion (dig stim) and 
electrical stimulation. Th is will be done 3 -7 times a week to optimize data acquisition, 
rather than having a defined control period followed by a defined experimental period. 
Neither the al tered pr ocedure nor the inclusion of patients who are < [ADDRESS_1124459] t he inside of the rectal wall for approximately 30 seconds . Time is a llowed for 
the colon to move and e vacuate some stools , then the  process is repeated (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 15 -
20 minutes  later). Digit al rectal stimulat ion is thus repeated until the colon contents ar e 
empty, usually marked by [CONTACT_812048] o f stools in the 
distal colon or re ctum.  Some subjects  may  also receive a mini -enema or other 
 Page [ADDRESS_1124460] ’s baselin e data on bowel emptying time, nur se experience , 
or clini cian e xpertise, then we will cease stimula tion for tha t day and re turn to the 
subject’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_812041] . If stimulati on fails to increa se colonic motility for bowel 
emptying on [ADDRESS_1124461] to their typi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l bowel rout ine. 
 
The procedures in this study involve certain risks,  which are similar  to the risks of 
digital rectal stimulation, whi ch is part of a pa rticipant ’s bowel routine.  The incremen tal 
risks involv ed in performance of these studies are not signi ficantly gre ater than those 
encountered during a standa rd b owel routi ne. However, t hese  risks are outlined in the 
participan t’s con sent  form, along with  explanation s of what w ould  be done to reduce the 
likeli hood of adverse av ents, and what would be done s hould any occur.

and exclusion criteria.  
Individuals who do not speak English will not be recruite d. How ever , it is n ot 
anticipate d that  non-English speaking potential participants will be enco untered.  
Participants will be paid  $[ADDRESS_1124463] in 
a qu iet, private area (o n the SCI Un it or in a physician's private office), finding out 
whether he or she is capable of giving consent, and d iscussing the pu rpose, risks, and 
benefits of participation. We will ensure that all subjects genuinely understand  the 
study , that they are  aware t hat pa rticipation is entirely volun tary, and that they c an 
choos e to discontinue participation at any time.  
HIPAA authorizat ion will be discus sed with the potential participant at the time t he 
patient is interviewed and a c opy of the authorization  will be  given  to them for their 
review. Specific information co llected will include:  Date of bi rth, date of spi[INVESTIGATOR_812042], 
level of  spi[INVESTIGATOR_342220], ge nder, name, medical record number (social securi ty number), 
current medications, prev ious bladder or urin ary trac t inte rventions, current medical 
status, and phone numbe r. This info rmation is be ing collected  because these da ta are 
used to  categorize indivi duals according to medical condition and allow i nvestigation of 
medically  related differences between the  respo nses of different individuals. The 
participant’s social se curity numbe r will be col lected in ord er to place appro priate

typic ally conduct ed with di gital rectal stimulation  and/ or the insertion of suppositories 
or similar chemical sys tems.  The time that elapses between initial intervention  and 
bow el emptying will be measur ed as bowel emp tying ti me. We will also test electrical 
stimulation to  modulate an excitatory recto -colic ref lex b y stimulating via a rectal probe 
electrode. These sy stems  are clinically available for chronic c onstipation in other  
indications and are  consi dered minimal r isk. We have e xperience measuring bowel 
activity with t hese metho ds. Initial introduction  of the rectal probe electrode  may cause 
temporary distension of th e rectum. To ensure that reflexive acti vity due to the prob e

PROTOCOL  
 
Overall design . We will use the existing infrastructure of the Baylor Infant twins Study ( BITS ). BITS initiates 
contact [CONTACT_330088] -child check -ups up to the age of [ADDRESS_407798] BITS visit , 
depending on mode of recruitment . The current proposal adds  the parent study  1) additional biological sample 
collection, and 2) permission to review medical records for  chorionicity  during the contact .  For the current 
proposal, w e will recruit [ADDRESS_407799] buccal swabs, 
urine,  and nail samples to be used for DNA isolation and monochorionic/dichorionic comparisons in Aim 2. 
From a subset (at least 23 individuals , monochorionic or dichorionic ) we will also collect hair follicles from both 
twins  to be used for the tissue comparisons in Aim 1.  
 
Participants .  
 
Cohort description : A cohort of [ADDRESS_407800] exclusion criteria based on mode 
of delivery, gestational age or birth weight.  Inclusion criteria : Infants from a twin birth less than 4 months  of 
age, with available medical records from pregnancy, from a predominantly English-  or Spanish-  speaking 
family . Exclusion criteria: Infants from a pregnancy with twin- to-twin transfusion syndrome.  Infants with major 
congenital anomalies  (assessed by [CONTACT_330089] -report at the time of recruitment) . Parents with 
inadequate English or S panish to understand the study protocol and give informed consent. Infants from 
mother s < 18 years of age ( mothers must be  at least  18 to give consent for the infants’ participation in [LOCATION_007] ).  
Recruitment . We will recruit twins through one of 6 routes:  
(1) Medical records for women seeking prenatal care at TCH will be searched. For twin pregnancies meeting 
the criteria above, women will be sent an informational package to their home address giving details on the 
study, at approximately [ADDRESS_407801] to return after the twins’ birth. If we have not heard from them by [CONTACT_330090], a follow -up ‘phone call will occur.  
(2) Birth records from TCH will be examined daily. Where two birth codes are recorded to the same mother , on 
the day of discharge , the study coordinator will visit the woman and invite her to par ticipate in the study.  
(3) Advert isement s inviting study participation will be posted on ‘Bellaire Moms of Multiples’ support group 
pages. Brief study details will be given and interested women invited to contact [CONTACT_9137]. Initial 
consent will be given over the phone. The first study visit will be scheduled and written consent obtained.  
(4) Lactation consultants at TCH will be asked to pass out study flyers to mothers of twins under [ADDRESS_407802] study visit will be scheduled and written consent obtained.  
(5) TCP pediatricians will be asked to hand out flyers to mothers of multiples at well child checks for children between the ages of [ADDRESS_407803]  buccal swab, urine,  nail, and (from a subset) hair  follicle  samples  (termed 
“the first study visit”  for this proposal ).  
For participants recruited prenatally or at well -child checkups  a visit will be scheduled at the Children’s Nutrition 
Research Center (CNRC) metabolic research unit (MRU) when the infants are ~4 months  of age (this 
coincides with the initial BITS visit) .  
For all participants , informed consent forms will be offered in both English and Spanish due to the high volume 
of native Spanish speakers in Houston. It is prohibitive to offer consent in other languages. Informed consent 
will cover accessing medical records, and both the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_330082], as well as a separate consent 
section covering the deposition of data  from potential future genomic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_330083].  Participants will receive $50 compensation per twin pair,  as well as 
commemorative photographs of their children.  
All participant will be enrolled into the parent study (BITS) and so be contact[CONTACT_5365] f ollow -up visits at 4 months 
(if the first visit was postnatal), 1 and 2 years (by [CONTACT_330091]) and 3 years (in 
person follow -up at the CNRC).  
Measures . 
Assessment of Chorionicity . At the referring centers for this study,  chorionicity is routinely determined by 
[CONTACT_330092] [ADDRESS_407804] and will be retrieved by [CONTACT_70910].  
 
Samples for DNA methylation analysis.  
 
Buccal swab : A buccal swab is collected using an Isohelix’s SK -2 kit. A research assistant swabs the child’s 
mouth for [ADDRESS_407805] method.  
Hair follicles : For this procedure, as adapted from our previous studies,[ADDRESS_407806] method.  
Urine : Upon arrival at the MRU , or in the mother’s birth room,  a [ADDRESS_407807] the bag. Urine is immediately combined with urine conditioning buffer, after which 
it is stable for up to 6 days until DNA isolation (Extract -ALL Urine DNA Kit, Zyme Research).  
Peripheral Blood Cells ( PBCs ): A small heel pri ck is administered by [CONTACT_9137] . A [ADDRESS_407808] (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) is  used to collect a single sample of blood. Each well holds 75-
80 µl of sample; we anticipate needing <[ADDRESS_407809] will be used for each participant.  The QiaAmp DNA 
Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) will be used to isolate DNA from blood.  
Nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_14839] : A standard safety clipper is used to clip the infants’ fingernails (preferentially) or toenails (if 
necessary). As a service to  our parents, all fingernails (or toenails) are  clipped as appropriate –  we do not stop 
when a suitable quantity of sample has been collected.  The clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] s are stored in a sterile tube  -80 C , then 
washed several times in EDTA before DNA isolation .  
 
Analysis of DNA methylation by [CONTACT_330093] -pyrosequencing.  Genomic DNA is bisulfite -modified (EZ DNA 
Methylation- Direct kit, Zymo Research), amplified by [CONTACT_31806]- round of PCR using locus -specific primers, and 
sequenced on a Qiagen MD Pyrosequencer, by [CONTACT_330094] .1,[ADDRESS_407810] , including for 
example, PAX8 , DUSP22 , VTRNA2 -1, etc. Final selection of the ME panel  will be based on ongoing ME -
discovery in the Waterland laboratory  and review of the current CVD literature . 
 
Statistical Plan  
Aim 1: Validate nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_330084] . 
In a subset of the infants recruited for this study, in which both hair follicle and nail DNA is obtained from 
infants  (n=23), we will study the correlation between ME methylation in nail and hair follicle DNA. At each ME, 
% methylation values for multiple CpG sites will be averaged to yield a mean % methylation value for each 
sample. The correlation between % methylation at 10 MEs in nail  and hair follicle DNA will be assessed using 
Pearson correlations.  At ME loci with non -normal methylation distributions , data will be transformed to improve 
normality prior to correlation analysis.  
 
Aim 2: Compare epi[INVESTIGATOR_330085]. dichorionic MZ twins .  
 
Analysis : At each ME , we will compare the intra -class correlation between monochorionic and dichorionic twin 
pairs. Given the small sample size, we will likely report results which compare the intra- class correlation for % 
methylation averaged over 10  CpG sites. We will compare the results for the tissue types: fingernail / urine -, 
buccal swab and PBC.

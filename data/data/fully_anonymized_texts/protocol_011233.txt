2. BACKGROUND
 
 
2.1  Refractory and Relapsed Non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
 
Refractory is a term that refers to patients that do not respond to treatment, while 
relapsed patients’ malignancies have recurred after treatment. Patients with aggressive 
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (HL) that have relapsed 
after or are refractory to standard induction chemotherapy normally undergo autologous 
stem cell transplantation if their disease is chemosensitive (i.e. responding) to salvage 
therapy (therapy used for relapsed disease) . [ADDRESS_1048882] 
cure rates of approximately 50 to 60% with autologous stem cell transplantation    
(PARMA study). More recent data suggest that patients failing initial treatment with 
rituximab containing regimens (which constitute the large majority of lymphoma 
patients) or those with early relapses represent a more unfavorable group.  
 
The CORAL study showed that subjects had only approximately a 20% cure rate with 
salvage autologous transplant, as did those with early relapses (< 1year)2. Subjects’ 
whose disease did not demonstrate chemosensitivity did not benefit from standard 
autologous transplantation, even with intensified regimens.[ADDRESS_1048883] practice: 
1) Dose density combined with dose intensity 
2) High dose bendamustine 
3) The use of allogeneic transplantation in selected subjects (based on entry 
criteria).  
 
2.2.1  Dose Density Combined with Dose Intensity 
 
Dose density is an approach used to overcome lymphoma resistance to therapy. This 
method involves giving chemotherapy frequently within a short time frame so as not to 
allow the malignant clone to recover. One example is the dose dense approach of the 
German lymphoma group, Pfreundschuh, who used the CHOP regimen every 14 days 
rather than every 21 days in the front line lymphoma setting. 7 Gianni’s group used a 
high dose sequential chemotherapy approach (dose dense) followed by [CONTACT_765245] (dose intense). This study showed a marginal benefit over 
standard chemotherapy and autologous transplant but this could not be reproduced in a 
multicenter trial due to excessive toxicity.8 
 
Dose intensity is the hallmark of high dose chemotherapy regimens, but attempts at 
both dose intensity and dose density (e.g. double autologous transplant) have often 
faltered because of inordinate delays between successive cycles of chemotherapy. 
Examples of this approach include a recent study of tandem autologous transplant for 
relapsed and refractory lymphoma with the first transplant using myeloablative BEAM as 
the conditioning regimen and the second transplant using radioimmunotherapy.9 The 
estimated 4-year OS and PFS were 67% and 64%, respectively.  
 
A second study of tandem transplants had an overall survival of 59% at [ADDRESS_1048884] results noted in the CORAL study 
for single transplants in this situation.10 Furthermore, 86% of patients who achieved a 
complete response (CR) remained alive and disease free for [ADDRESS_1048885] disease that tends to grow quickly, 
repopulating malignant cells between salvage cycles. Such disease is often 
characterized by [CONTACT_765246], more readily measured, a high 
serum lactat
e dehydrogenase  (LDH). Such disease may be more effectively addressed 
[ADDRESS_1048886] already 
demonstrated certain success in the front line treatment of lymphoma.   
A combination of dose intensity and dose density is used in the French rituximab, 
doxorubicine, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycine, prednisolone (R-ACVBP ) 
(ACBVP R) regimen11. This study included subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
with 2 or 3 International Prognostic Index factors. Subjects received four cycles of 
intensive biweekly chemotherapy with R-ACVBP followed by [CONTACT_331437]-transplantation in 
responding subjects. This resulted in a in a 78% 4-year overall survival. These results 
warrant being compared to other approaches. 
 
The approach of giving a high dose salvage regimen followed quickly and sequentially 
by [CONTACT_660865], timed such that the disease does not have the opportunity 
to regrow between cycles, has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_765227].  
Patients with refractory leukemia have been treated with an intensive cycle of salvage 
chemotherapy and then proceeded to allogeneic transplant within [ADDRESS_1048887] of care in 
the treatment of lymphoma, but using the timing/ sequential strategy that has been 
developed in the refractory leukemia population. Currently, no timing- to-transplant 
regimen has been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Also, the 
FDA has not approved any transplant conditioning regimens; only the use of individual 
drugs.  
 
2.2.2  High Dose Bendamustine 
 
Bendamustine is an FDA approved drug that has efficacy in treating lymphoma and has 
a unique mechanism of action.15We propose to use high dose bendamustine at a dose 
of 200 mg/m2/day for two consecutive daysas a dose intense approach to relapsed and 
refractory lymphomas prior to proceeding to transplant with BEAM conditioning, a 
commonly used conditioning regimen. This will be done in a sequential manner so that 
dose de
nsity will also be maximized.  
 
The current standard dose of bendamustine in treating malignancies, such as 
lymphoma, is 240 mg/m2 per cycle.16 In one study. Bendamustine had been used in a 
conditioning regimen for autologous lymphoma transplants up to 200 mg/m2/day over 2 
days, for a total of 400 mg/m2 and this still was not the maximally tolerated dose.17In 
this modified Fibonacci dose-escalation study, subjects received 160-200 mg/m2 daily 
x2 on days -[ADDRESS_1048888].  Dose escalation proceeded up to the 
maximum planned dose (400 mg/m2 cumulative) without any non-hematologic dose-
limiting toxicity.  As prior phase I studies of bendamustine in advanced solid tumors 
demonstrated cardiac toxicity at 280 mg/m2 as a single dose (not seen when 
fractionated over 2 days as in the proposed schedule), additional subjects were enrolled 
and 0 of 6 demonstrated dose-limiting toxicity. Bendamustine has been used in at 
WCMC as part of a conditioning regimen for auto-transplantation in multiple myeloma. 
In that study, a dose of 225 mg/m2 of bendamustine was been combined with 
melphalan with no major toxicities. [ADDRESS_1048889] disease progression 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_765228].19 
Allogeneic transplantation offers the benefit of an immunological strategy (graft versus 
lymphoma effect) in addition to the intensive chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy of the 
conditioning regimen. For some subjects in this study, allogeneic transplantation will be 
considered. 
 
The following criteria will be used to determine whether subjects will proceed to  
autologous or allogeneic transplantation: 
 
Autologous transplantation 
 Subjects with relapsed lymphoma who have at least a partial response to their 
prior salvage regimen defined as: 
 PET positivity with SUV ≤ 8and > 50% bidimensional decrease in lymphoma 
masses.  
 
Allogeneic transplantation 
 Subjects with lymphoma who had a prior autologous transplant 
or 
 Subjects with refractory lymphoma who did not achieve a partial response to 
salvage therapy as defined above. 
 
NOTE: The response definitions are outlined in the Cheson criteria (Appendix C)..20 
 
2.2.4 Treatment Justification 
 
1) The subjects included in this protocol have a low likelihood of durable response 
to standard salvage therapy and arein great need of new curative options. 
 
2) The protocol is formally designed to assess the toxicity of the entire treatment 
sequence. But the secondary endpoints include an effort to assess benefits  and 
toxicity of every component (drug and transplant) individually.   
 
3) In some respects this study mirrors current clinical practice and 
codifiesmanagement that is routinely performed in desperate cases.

Rabbit ATG (rATG)-thymoglobulin: 1.5 mg/kg/day IV x3 days total for all patients. ATG will be 
dosed according to actual body weight. The first dose will be infused over at least six hours, and 
subsequent doses over at least 4 hours.  Pre-medications include acetaminophen 650 mg by 
[CONTACT_1966], diphenhydramine 25-50 mg by [CONTACT_324945], and methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg 
(1 mg/ kg at the initiation and 1 mg/kg half-way through anti-thymocyte globulin administration). 
Circumstances may require minor changes in scheduling of chemotherapy. Variations of up to 
24 hours in scheduling will be acceptable. 
 
TBI*: Because of occasional cases of graft failure, conditioning has been intensified for certain 
groups of patients. Patients at high risk for CNS relapse (e.g ALL or Burkitt’s) or patients at high 
risk for graft rejection (i.e., donor-specific HLA antibodies, patients with severe aplastic anemia, 
or hemoglobinopathies) may receive 2 doses of TBI as part of the conditioning. In rare cases , 
full dose TBI (1200 Grey) will be part of the regimen if the other regimens cannot be used.

enrolled in the study but will not receive rituximab.   
 
Rituximab is FDA approved for B cell malignancies at this dose and schedule. However, 
as stated earlier, the FDA does not approve transplant regimens. Using rituximab has 
been utilized in many transplant published studies.  
 
7.1.4  GVHD Prophylaxis for Related and Unrelated Transplants 
 
Subjects will receive the drug tacrolimus (Prograf ®) starting before transplant to reduce 
the risks of graft versus host disease and to promote the growth of the graft.   
 
Tacrolimus will be given at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day using continuous intravenous 
infusion over [ADDRESS_1048912] is able to take 
orally, then a tacrolimus dosage of (approximately) 0.09 mg/kg orally in 2 divided doses.  
Tacrolimus should be given at full dose to maintain levels of 5-15 ng/mL through Day 
100 for related transplants and through Day 180 for unrelated transplants, tapered by 
20% every week thereafter. In the presence of GVHD, a clinical decision by [CONTACT_765247].

7.1.5 GVHD Prophylaxis for Alternative Donor Haplo/Cord  and Double Cord Transplants  
Patients undergoing haplo cord transplant in this protocol will receive the following 
GVHD prophylaxis in addition to ATG;  
 
Subjects will receive the drug tacrolimus (Prograf ®) and another immunosuppressant, 
mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept ®), starting before transplant also to reduce the risks of 
graft versus host disease and to promote the growth of the graft.   
 
Tacrolimus: 0.03 mg/kg/day using continuous intravenous infusion over [ADDRESS_1048913] is able to take by [CONTACT_1966], then 
tacrolimus approximately 0.09 mg/kg by [CONTACT_765248] 2 divided doses.  Tacrolimus should 
be given at full dose to maintain levels of 5-15 ng/mL through approximately Day 180, 
tapered by 20% every week thereafter. Infection ,toxicity or other clinical circumstances 
may prompt earlier discontinuation. In the presence of GVHD, a clinical decision by [CONTACT_765249].  
PO tacrolimus can be used in the pre-engraftment period when IV access for tacrolimus 
is not available. 
 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): will be started on Day -2 and given at a dose of 1000 mg 
every 8 hours until Day 28. Earlier discontinuation, dose adjustments or more prolonged 
administration may be required for clinical reasons. MMF may be given PO or IV. . 
Infection, toxicity, very low patient weight (<50kg) may prompt earlier discontinuation or 
adjustment of doses

9. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
investigator will be required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings 
that suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side effects, or precautions pertinent 
to the safe use of the drug under investigation.  Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_765250], 
as well as by [CONTACT_57432], x-rays, 
electrocardiographs, etc. 
22 
  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_765231]. All AEs occurring after any administration of the study drug(s) will be 
followed until resolution 
 
9.1 Study Agents Risks  
 
All risks for drugs given to subjects within this protocol will be outlined in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. Additional information is in Appendix C – Background Drug 
Information. Risks for each drug will be specifically listed for subjects in the informed 
consent form. 
 
9.2  Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  A copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
 Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
   
9.3 Recording of Adverse Events 
 
All Grade 3-4 adverse events which are possibly related to the study and 
unexpected will be recorded on a IRB’s adverse event log.  The AE log will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_765251]’s research chart.  
Hematologic AE’s will not be tracked since they are an expected 
consequence of transplant. Some other grade 3-4 AE that are expected i n 
stem cell transplant will not be collected (e.g. alopecia).   
 
 
9.4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1048919] or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
 
23 
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experience that occurs at any dose 
that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death. 
• Life‐threatening adverse drug experience.* 
• Require
s inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765232]. For the purpose of this study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765233]‐scheduled procedures, blood product transfusions, social reasons (ie, 
awaiting transport home), or deemed expected events will not be considered 
SAEs. 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity.** 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event*** 
• Suspected positive pregnancy 
*“Life-threate
ning” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
**“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
***Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above 
occurred.  Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765234].  
 
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new 
diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically 
important.  
 
9.4.2  Reporting of SAE to IRB 
 
All SAEs occurring on this study will be reported to the IRB according to the IRB policy.  
The IRB requires immediate reporting of all unexpected and study-related (definite or 
probable) adverse events.  The following procedure will be followed for reporting SAE to 
the IRB: 
 
 Complete the SAE Cover Sheet (See Appendix B) 
 If the event is unexpected AND definitely or probably related to the study, 
complete the IRB Unexpected, Study-related Adverse Events, Incidents, and 
Information Reporting Form.  This form should be submitted within 24 
business hours of investigator notification of the event. 
 
 If the event is expected OR possibly or unrelated to the study, only the SAE 
Cover Sheet must be completed.  These events will be reported to the IRB at 
the time of continuing renewal on the Adverse Event & IND Safety Reporting 
Cumulative Table. 
24 
  
Forms may also be downloaded from the IRB website at:

10. DATA REPORTING AND COLLECTION  
 
10.1   Data Collection  
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture all treatment, 
toxicity, and efficacy data for all enrolled subjects. This is a trial to assess the feasibility 
including both safety and possible efficacy of a total sequential approach to treating 
refractory and relapsed Non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s lymphoma subjects.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1048920].  
 
10.3     REDCap  
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software 
system that is fully supported by [CONTACT_57421]-Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool for 
the creation of customized, secure data management systems that include Web-based 
data-entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features including user and 
group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP system, with a full audit 
trail of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is maintained on CTSC-
owned servers that are backed up nightly and support encrypted (SSL-based) 
connections.  Nationally, the software is developed, enhanced and supported through a 
multi-institutional consortium led by [CONTACT_57422].

11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoints:  
 Proportion of patients able to proceed to transplant within 14 days of 
starting be
ndamustine  and recover after transplant as determined by:   
 
1) Engraftment: This will be defined as a neutrophil count of 500 /mm3 
and a platelet count of 20,[ADDRESS_1048922] one 
week. 
 
2) Regimen related toxicity: This will be assessed using CTCAE version 4 
 
- Hematologic toxicity will not be taken into account. 
 
Secondary Endpoints :  
 Disease Response: This will  be defined as complete response, partial 
response, no response, progression according to Cheson Criteria 
(Appendix C). Response will be assessed after the bendamustine and 
again after the transplant.  
 
 Progression – Free Survival : This will be defined as survival free of 
progression of disease starting from the  day bendamustine starts and also 
calculated from day 0 of the transplant.  
 
 Survival: This will be defined in days post initiation of bendamustine and 
also recalculated as the numbers of days post-transplant and will be 
specifically evaluated at Day 100, one year and overall survival. 
 
 Transplant Related Mortality (TRM): Death due  to treatment within the first 
100 days.  
 
Note: Acute GVHD will be scored according to the criteria proposed by [CONTACT_267135][INVESTIGATOR_20360]. 
(Appendix E). Chronic GVHD will be scored according to the NIH Consensus 
Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease 
(Appendix F). 
 
Subject will have toxicity assessments using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 criteria and response assessments as per 
PET/CT after each stage of this multifaceted approach.  
 
11.2 Sample Size, Analysis Plan and Accrual Rate  
 
Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no formal sample size calculation is required and the 
primary endpoint will be assessed descriptively.  However, with 15 subjects completing 
protocol-based requirements on both the allogeneic arm and autologous arm of the 
26 
 study, 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of subjects who are able to proceed 
to transplant and recover after transplant can be constructed to be within ± 20.2% of the 
true proportion of such patients in the allogeneic arm and within ± 11.0% of the true 
proportion of such patients in the autologous arm.  These calculations assume that the 
proportion of such subjects who are able to proceed to transplant and recover after 
transplant is 80% and 95% in the allogeneic and autologous arms, respectively.  
 
 The proportion of subjects able to proceed to transplant within 14 days after starting 
bendamustine and recover after transplant (i.e., primary endpoint) will be calculated and 
a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) will be estimated via binomial proportions.  
Secondary endpoints of disease response and transplant-related mortality (i.e., 
proportions and 95% CI) will also be estimated via binomial proportions.  Secondary 
endpoints of progression-free and overall survival will be assessed by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier 
survival analysis.Greenwood’s formula will be used to calculate 95% confidence 
intervals for the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. 
 
 The frequency of subjects experiencing toxicities will be tabulated.  Toxicities will be 
assessed and graded according to CTCAE v. 4.[ADDRESS_1048923] 95% confidence 
intervals around the toxicity proportions will be calculated to assess the precision of the 
obtained estimates. 
 
 All p-values will be two-sided with statistical significance evaluated at the 0.05 alpha 
level (for exploratory analyses comparing secondary endpoints between arms).  All 
analyses will be performed in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and 
STATA Version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). 
 
It is expected that the study will accrue [ADDRESS_1048924] (DSMB ), and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626]” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.   
  
11.3.1 Transplant-Related Mortality (TRM) 
 
Non-relapse deaths in the first 100 days will be monitored.  A TRM rate of > 20% of 
subjects in the first 6 months within the allogeneic cohort and > 5% of subjects in the 
autologous cohort would be unexpected.  This would be reported to the DSMB and, 
subsequently, the research team will immediately review the data and protocol should 
this rate be exceeded.  Entry of subjects into the trial will be stopped while the protocol 
and deaths are reviewed .  
11.3.2 Graft Failure 
 
Failure to engraft by [CONTACT_2006] 35 is expected to occur in <=10% of subjects with this 
approach.  A graft failure/graft rejection rate of > 10% would be unexpected and the 
27 
 research team and DSMB will review the data and protocol should this rate be 
exceeded.  Failure to engraft will be defined as lack of evidence of hematopoietic 
recovery (ANC < 500/mm3 and platelet count < 20,000/mm3) by [CONTACT_2006] +35, confirmed by 
a biopsy revealing a marrow cellularity < 5%.  Secondary graft failure will be defined as 
initial myeloid engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] +35, documented to be of donor origin, followed by a 
drop in the ANC to < 500/mm3 for more than three days, independent of any 
myelosuppressive drugs, severe GVHD, CMV, or other infection.  
 
Graft rejection will be defined as graft failure with documentation of return of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_765235]/or chimerism studies. If there is 
evidence that the Day 35 graft failure rate is more than 10%, entry of subjects into the 
trial will be stopped while the protocol and failures are reviewed.  
 
11. 4  Reporting  
 
11.4.1  Evaluation of toxicity:  All subjects will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment . 
 
11.4.2  Evaluation of response: All subjects included in the study will be assessed 
for response to treatment. 
 
12. DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD 
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is being requested to review safety data and 
to make recommendations regarding continuation, termination, or modification to the 
study. The research team will report all adverse events to the DSMB per their reporting 
policies. The DSMB will be constituted at Weill Cornell Medical College and will be 
composed of medical and statistical independent reviewers and will meet to review the 
efficacy and safety data and determine a risk/benefit analysis in this subject population.   
 
The purpose of the DSMB is to advise on serious safety considerations, lack of efficacy 
and any other considerations within the charge to the Committee.  The DSMB may 
request additional meetings or safety reports as deemed necessary upon discussio n 
with the research team.  The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_765268] will be the safety 
contact [CONTACT_588969]. 
 
[CONTACT_765269]’s office is located at: 
NYPH-WCMC 
[ADDRESS_1048925]., F364 
[LOCATION_001], NY  [ZIP_CODE]  
Phone [PHONE_15970]  
 
The research team will report all adverse events to the DSMB per their reporting 
policies. They will convene every six months to discuss outcomes of the ongoing trial.  
They will be informed of the results of the interim analysis and they will have the 
authority to close the study in the interest of subject safety if they feel that one of the 
arms is clearly inferior or for futility.  
 
[ADDRESS_1048926] 3 are reviewed, the DSMB will meet to monitor the study every six months to 
discuss outcomes of the ongoing trial. Appropriate efficacy and safety data summaries 
will be provided to the DSMB after each interim analysis. 
 
The binomial distribution will be used to establish pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/review 
guidelines for toxicity.  A binomal distribution probability greater than 10% (i.e., 
estimated based on xsubjects with toxicity among 3 enrolled subjects in each cohort) 
will be chosen as the threshold for initiating a DSMB stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_765236](s).  As detailed above, a TRM rate of >20% in the allogeneic cohort would be 
unexpected.  Assuming a TRM rate of 20% in the allogeneic cohort and utilizing the 
binomial distribution, the probability that 1 out of 3 enrolled subjects will experience 
TRM is 0.38 (and thus >10%).  Therefore, if [ADDRESS_1048927] 3 enrolled subjects 
experience TRM in the allogeneic cohort, the study cohort will be halted and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_4318].  Similarly, a TRM rate of >5% in the autologous cohort would be 
unexpected.  Assuming a TRM rate of 5% in the autologous cohort and utilizing the 
binomial distribution, the probability that 1 out of 3 enrolled subjects will experience 
TRM is 0.14 (and thus >10%).  Therefore, if [ADDRESS_1048928] 3 enrolled subjects 
experience TRM in the autologous cohort, the study cohort will be halted and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_4318].  This process will repeat for each set of three enrolled subjects in the 
cohorts. 
 
As detailed above, a graft failure/graft rejection rate of >10% in the study would be 
unexpected.  Assuming a graft failure/graft rejection rate of 10% in the study and 
utilizing the binomial distribution, the probability that 1 out of 3 enrolled subjects will 
experience graft failure/graft rejection is 0.24 (and thus >10%).  Therefore, if [ADDRESS_1048929] 3 enrolled subjects experience graft failure/graft rejection in the study, the 
study will be halted and reviewed by [CONTACT_4318].  This process will repeat for each set of 
three enrolled subjects in the cohorts.

APPENDIX E: BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION 
 
DRUG FORMULATION, AVAILABILITY, AND PREPARATION  
 
Qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
themselves and to the environment will undertake the preparation, handling and safe disposal of 
chemotherapeutic agents in a self-contained, protective environment. Unused portions of 
injectable chemotherapeutic agents that do not contain a bacteriostatic agent or are prepared 
with unpreserved diluents will be disposed ( i.e., Sterile Water for Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride for Injection USP) within eight hours of vial entry to minimize the risk of bacterial 
contamination.  
 
FILGRASTIM  (G-CSF:  Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor, Neupogen )   
 
AVAILABILITY 
G-CSF is commercially available in 1.0 and 1.6 mL vials containing 300 mcg and 480 mcg G-CSF, and in 
prefilled syringes containing 300 mcg/0.5 mL and 480 mcg/0.8 mL. 
  
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Intact vials and prefilled syringes should be stored under refrigeration.  Do not allow the drug to freeze.  
 
ADMINISTRATION 
The daily dose of G-CSF should be injected subcutaneously in one or two sites.  The dose following 
peripheral blood stem cell infusion is 5 mcg/kg/day.  The dose of G-CSF may be rounded up to the 
nearest vial size. 
 
TOXICITY 
The most common side effect associated with G-CSF is bone pain.  Bone pain is usually reported as mild 
or moderate and, if necessary, may be treated with non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_765237]. 
 
MELPHALAN (Alkeran) 
 
AVAILABILITY 
Melphalan for IV use is commercially available in sterile [ADDRESS_1048941].  The special diluent has 0.20 g sodium citrate, 6 mL propylene glycol, 0.5 mL 95% ethanol, and 
sterile water. 
  
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Intact vials should be stored at room temperature (15oC-30oC) and protected from light.  Reconstituted 
solutions are chemically and physically stable for at least 90 minutes at room temperature.  Solutions 
further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 0.45 mg/mL are stable for at 
least 60 minutes.  Solutions diluted to 1 mg/mL are reported to be physically stable for at least 4 hours at 
room temperature-chemical stability of this dilution is not known.  Because of the relative instability of 
melphalan solutions, it is recommended that administration of the diluted solution be completed within 60 
minutes of reconstitution.  Reconstituted solutions should not be refrigerated. 
 
PREPARATION 
Melphalan should be prepared immediately before intended use.  Each vial is reconstituted with 10 mL of 
the special diluent to yield a concentration of 5 mg/mL.  The reconstituted solution may be diluted with 
0.9% sodium chloride to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 0.45 mg/mL. 
 
ADMINISTRATION 
[ADDRESS_1048942] occurred with high dose melphalan and also acute renal failure. Tissue 
necrosis may result if infiltration occurs.    
 
TACROLIMUS  (Prograf , FK506)  
 
AVAILABILITY 
Tacrolimus is commercially available as an injection (5 mg/mL; 1 mL ampuls) and as oral capsules (0.5 
mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg). 
  
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Store tacrolimus capsules and injection at controlled room temperature, 15oC-30oC (59oF-86oF). 
 
PREPARATION – FOR IV USE 
Tacrolimus injection must be diluted prior to IV infusion with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose 
injection to a concentration of 4-20 mcg/mL.  Solutions should be prepared in non-PVC plastic or glass.  
Tacrolimus injection and diluted solutions of the drug should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. 
 
ADMINISTRATION 
Oral therapy should be started as soon as possible as per protocol and 8 to 12 hours after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_765238].  Oral doses will be administered twice a day.  The conversion from IV to oral therapy 
should take into account concomitant medications (such as voriconazole). 
 
TOXICITY 
In patients receiving tacrolimus, 5% to 47% experienced anemia, 8% to 32% experienced leukocytosis, 
and 14% to 24% experienced thrombocytopenia.  Rare cases of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia have 
been reported.  Chest pain was reported in 19%.  Mild to moderate hypertension is a common adverse 
effect associated with tacrolimus therapy.  Antihypertensive therapy may be required.  The most common 
adverse effects of tacrolimus have involved the central nervous system, and include headache (37% to 
64%), tremors (48% to 56%), insomnia (32% to 64%), paresthesia (17% to 40%), and dizziness (19%).  
Tremor and headache may respond to dosage reduction.  Visual changes, agitation, anxiety, confusion, 
seizures, depression, hallucinations, myoclonus, neuropathy, psychosis, incoordination, and abnormal 
dreams have been reported in 3% to 15%.  Hyperkalemia (13% to 45%), hypokalemia (13% to 29%) 
hypophosphatemia (49%) and hypomagnesemia (16% to 48%) have been associated with tacrolimus 
therapy.  Hyperuricemia has been reported in >3%.  Gastrointestinal adverse effects included nausea 
(32% to 46%), vomiting (14% to 29%), anorexia (7% to 34%), constipation (23% to 35%), and diarrhea 
(37% to 72%).  Nephrotoxicity was reported in 38% to 52% of liver and kidney transplant patients, 
respectively.  Hematuria has been reported in greater than 3%.  Abnormal liver function tests have been 
reported in 6% to 36% of patients; ascites in 7% to 27%.   
 
Other effects reported in clinical trials include pain, fever, asthenia, back pain, and peripheral edema.  
The incidence of hyperglycemia was 17% and may require therapy with insulin.  Other less frequently 
occurring effects include abscess, chills, peritonitis, and photosensitivity reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been 
reported in a few patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus.  Tacrolimus injection contains cremophor 
which in other drugs has been associated with anaphylaxis.  Because tacrolimus is an 
immunosuppressant, the risk of opportunistic infections is increased. 
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS   
38 
 Tacrolimus is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4.  Drugs that are inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole) of 
inducers (e.g. phenytoin) of 3A4 might be expected to increase or decrease tacrolimus concentrations, 
respectively, possibly resulting in increased or decreased effects.  
 
ETOPOSIDE 
DESCRIPTION 
Etoposide (also commonly known as VP-16) is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin used in the 
treatment of certain neoplastic diseases. It is 4'-demethylepi[INVESTIGATOR_202715] 9-[4,6-0-(R)-ethylidene-β-D-
glucopyranoside]. It is very soluble in methanol and chloroform, slightly soluble in ethanol and sparingly 
soluble in water and ether. It is made more miscible with water by [CONTACT_765252]. It has a 
molecular weight of 588.58 and a molecular formula of C29H32O13. 
Etoposide Injection USP is administered intravenously. Etoposide Injection USP is available in 100 mg (5 
mL) and 250 mg (12.5 mL) sterile, multiple dose vials. The pH of the clear, colourless to pale yellow 
solution is 3 to 4. Each mL contains 20 mg Etoposide, 2 mg anhydrous citric acid, 30 mg benzyl alcohol , 
80 mg polysorbate 80/tween 80, 650 mg polyethylene glycol 300, and 30.5 percent (v/v) dehydrated 
alcohol. Vial headspace contains nitrogen. 
The structural formula is: 
 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Its main effect, however, appears to be at the G2 portion of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. The 
predominant macromolecular effect of Etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by [CONTACT_765253].  
 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
On intravenous administration, the disposition of Etoposide is best described as a biphasic process with a 
distribution half-life of about 1.5 hours and terminal elimination half-life ranging from 4 to 11 hours. Total 
body clearance values range from 33 to 48 mL/min or 16 to 36 mL/min/m2 and, like the terminal 
elimination half-life, are independent of dose over a range of 100 to 600 mg/m2. Over the same dose 
range, the areas under the plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUC) and the maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) values increase linearly with dose.  
Etoposide enters the CSF poorly., Etoposide is highly protein bound (97%) to human plasma proteins.  
. 
There is no evidence of a first-pass effect for EtoposideIn adults, the total body clearance of Etoposide is 
correlated with creatinine clearance, serum albumin concentration, and nonrenal clearance. Patients with 
impaired renal function receiving Etoposide have exhibited reduced total body clearance, increased AUC 
and a lower volume of distribution at steady state.  
 
WARNINGS 
Patients being treated with Etoposide Injection USP must be frequently observed for myelosuppression 
both during and after therapy. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of an anaphylactic 
reaction manifested by [CONTACT_346566], fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. The infusion 
should be terminated immediately, followed by [CONTACT_765254], corticosteroids, 
antihistamines, or volume expanders at the discretion of the physician. 
 
For parenteral administration, Etoposide Injection USP should be given only by [CONTACT_202745] 
(usually over a 30- to 60-minute period), since hypotension has been reported as a possible side effect of 
rapid intravenous injection. Etoposide Injection USP should be considered a potential carcinogen in 
humans.  
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
The following data on adverse reactions are based on intravenous administration of Etoposide Injection 
USP as a single agent, using several different dose schedules for treatment of a wide variety of 
malignancies. 
 Hematologic Toxicity 
 Myelosuppression. . 
 Gastrointestinal Toxicity 
39 
  Nausea and vomiting are the major gastrointestinal toxicities. Mild to severe 
mucositis/esophagitis may occur. 
 Hypotension 
 Transient hypotension following rapid intravenous administration has been reported in 1% to 2% 
of patients. It has not been associated with cardiac toxicity or electrocardiographic changes. No 
delayed hypotension has been noted. To prevent this rare occurrence, it is recommended that 
Etoposide Injection USP be administered by [CONTACT_765255] a 30- to 60-minute 
period. If hypotension occurs, it usually responds to cessation of the infusion administration of 
fluids or other supportive therapy as appropriate. When restarting the infusion, a slower 
administration rate should be used. 
 Allergic ReactionsAnaphylactic-like reactions characterized by [CONTACT_346566], fever, tachycardia, 
bronchospasm, dyspnea, and/or hypotension have been reported to occur in 0.7% to 2% of 
patients receiving intravenous Etoposide Injection USP and in less than 1% of the patients 
treated with oral capsules. These reactions have usually responded promptly to the cessation of 
the infusion and administration of pressor agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume 
expanders as appropriate; however, the reactions can be fatal. Hypertension and/or flushing have 
also been reported. Blood pressure usually normalizes within a few hours after cessation of the 
infusion. Anaphylactic-like reactions have occurred during the initial infusion of Etoposide 
Injection USP. 
 Facial/tongue swelling, coughing, diaphoresis, cyanosis, tightness in throat, laryngospasm, back 
pain, and/or loss of consciousness have sometimes occurred in association with the above 
reactions. In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity-associated apnea has been reported rarely. 
 Rash, urticaria, and/or pruritus have infrequently been reported at recommended doses. At 
investigational doses, a generalized pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, consistent with 
perivasculitis, has been reported. 
 Alopecia, Reversible alopecia, sometimes progressing to total baldness was observed in up to 
66% of patients. 
 
OTHER TOXICITIES 
The following adverse reactions have been infrequently reported: abdominal pain, aftertaste, constipation, 
dysphagia, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, somnolence, transient cortical blindness, optic neuritis, interstitial 
pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis, fever, seizure (occasionally associated with allergic reactions), Stevens-
Johnson syndrome, and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and a single report of radiation recall 
dermatitis. 
 
Hepatic toxicity, generally in patients receiving higher doses of the drug than those recommended, has 
been reported with Etoposide Injection USP. Metabolic acidosis has also been reported in patients 
receiving higher doses. 
 
Reports of extravasation with swelling have been received postmarketing. Rarely extravasation has been 
associated with necrosis and venous induration. 
The incidences of adverse reactions in the table that follows are derived from multiple databases from 
studies in 2,081 patients when Etoposide Injection USP was used either orally or by [CONTACT_765256] a single 
agent. 
 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
Note: Plastic devices made of acrylic or ABS (a polymer composed of acrylonitrile, butadiene, and 
styrene) have been reported to crack and leak when used with undilutedEtoposide Injection USP. 
 
ADMINISTRATION PRECAUTIONS 
As with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparing the 
solution of Etoposide Injection USP. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to Etoposide 
Injection USP may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If Etoposide Injection USP solution 
contacts the skin or mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash the skin with soap and water and flush the 
mucosa with water. 
 
[ADDRESS_1048943] be diluted prior to use with either 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to give a final concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/mL. If solutions are 
prepared at concentrations above 0.4 mg/mL, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_59392]. Hypotension following rapid 
intravenous administration has been reported; hence, it is recommended that the Etoposide Injection USP 
solution be administered over a 30- to 60-minute period. A longer duration of administration may be used 
if the volume of fluid to be infused is a concern. Etoposide Injection USP should not be given by [CONTACT_765257].Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. 
 
STABILITY 
Unopened vials of Etoposide Injection USP are stable for 24 months at room temperature (25°C). Vials 
diluted as recommended to a concentration of 0.2 or 0.4 mg/mL are stable for 96 and 24 hours, 
respectively, at room temperature (25°C) under normal room fluorescent light in both glass and plastic 
containers. 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several 
guidelines on this subject have been published.1–8 There is no general agreement that all of the 
procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.

WARNINGS 
Hematologic EffectsConventional cytarabine: Potent myelosuppressant. High-dose Regimens with 
Conventional Cytarabine 
Severe and sometimes fatal CNS, GI, and pulmonary toxicities reported following experimental dosage 
regimens for refractory or secondary acute leukemia or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas; differ from 
reactions seen with regimens employing lower dosages.Cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction (e.g., 
somnolence, coma, personality changes) reported; usually reversible. Reversible, acute aseptic 
meningitis, combined with cerebellar dysfunction, reported in at least [ADDRESS_1048944] occurred occasionally.Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at 
increased risk of CNS toxicity associated with high-dose cytarabine therapy. Monitor patients receiving 
high-dose therapy closely for signs of central or peripheral neurotoxicity Dosage schedule adjustment 
may be necessary to avoid irreversible neurologic toxicity. Severe GI ulceration (including pneumatosis 
cystoides intestinalis leading to peritonitis), bowel necrosis, necrotizing colitis , hepatic abscess or hepatic 
damage with increased hyperbilirubinemia reported. Pancreatitis reported in patients previously treated 
with asparaginase and those receiving high-dose cytarabine therapy.Pulmonary edema reported. Diffuse 
interstitial pneumonitis reported occasionally in patients receiving relatively high doses (e.g., 1 g/m2) of 
cytarabine alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents.A syndrome of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4783] , rapi[INVESTIGATOR_765239], which 
was sometimes fatal, has been reported in patients with refractory acute leukemia receiving high-dose 
therapy.Severe skin rash  leading to desquamation has been reported rarely. Complete alopecia occurs 
more commonly with high-dose regimens.Fatal cardiomyopathy reported in patients receiving high-dose 
cytarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide in preparation for bone marrow transplantation; this 
cardiac toxicity may be schedule dependent.Hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and reversible corneal toxicity 
(e.g., keratitis) reported; may be minimized or Sensitivity Reactions. AnaphylaxisAt least one case of 
anaphylaxis that resulted in acute cardiopulmonary arrest and required resuscitation has been reported 
after IV administration of conventional cytarabine. 
 
GENERAL PRECAUTIONS 
 Cytarabine (Ara-C) Syndrome 
 Cytarabine syndrome reported; may manifest as fever, myalgia, bone pain, maculopapular rash, 
conjunctivitis, malaise, and occasionally chest pain.. j Generally occurs 6–12 hours after 
administration of conventional cytarabine.. 
 Corticosteroids are beneficial in treatment and prevention.If symptoms require treatment, 
consider administration of corticosteroids, as well as continuation of conventional cytarabine 
therapy.. 
 GI Effects 
 Nausea and vomiting  are more frequent and severe following rapid IV administration of 
conventional cytarabine than with continuous IV infusion. 
 Pancreatitis - Pancreatitis reported in patients receiving conventional cytarabine and in those 
previously treated with asparaginase.. 
 Hyperuricemia - Hyperuricemia may occur in patients receiving conventional cytarabine because 
of extensive purine catabolism accompanying rapid cellular destruction.. 
 Monitor serum uric acid concentrations in patients receiving conventional 
cytarabine..Hyperuricemia may be minimized or prevented by [CONTACT_74918] , alkalinization 
of urine, and/or administration of allopurinol. 
 Hepatic Impairment, Use with caution; increased risk of CNS toxicity after high-dose therapy with 
conventional cytarabine because of decreased clearance. Assess hepatic function prior to and 
periodically during prolonged therapy. 
 Renal Impairment, Use with caution; increased risk of CNS toxicity after high-dose therapy with 
conventional cytarabine because of decreased clearance Assess renal function prior to and 
periodically during prolonged therapy.  
 
COMMON ADVERSE EFFECTS 
 IV, sub-Q, or IM administration of conventional cytarabine: Myelosuppression, anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, oral and anal inflammation or ulceration, hepatic dysfunction, fever, rash, 
42 
 thrombophlebitis, bleeding (all sites). 
 
INTERACTIONS FOR CYTARABINE 
No formal drug interaction studies conducted with liposomal cytarabine to date. 
 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
AbsorptionBioavailability 
Conventional cytarabine: <20% of dose is absorbed after oral administration; not effective when 
administered orally. Conventional cytarabine: Continuous IV infusions produce relatively constant plasma 
concentrations of the drug in 8–24 hours. 
 
Distribution Extent 
Conventional cytarabine: Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_765240], including liver, plasma, 
and peripheral granulocytes crosses blood-brain barrier to a limited extent.Conventional cytarabine: CSF 
concentrations are higher during continuous IV or sub-Q infusion than after rapid IV injection and are 
approximately 40–60% of plasma concentrations.Conventional cytarabine: Apparently crosses 
placenta;not known if distributed into milk.  
 
Half-life 
Conventional cytarabine: After rapid IV injection, plasma drug concentrations appear to decline in a 
biphasic manner with a half-life of about 10 minutes in the initial distributive phase and about 1–3 hours in 
the terminal elimination phase; .reportedly undergoes triphasic elimination in some patients. . 
Conventional or liposomal cytarabine: Liposomal cytarabine has a substantially longer half-life in the CSF 
than conventional formulations after intrathecal injection.Conventional or liposomal cytarabine: CSF 
concentrations reportedly decline in a biphasic manner after intrathecal injection. di CSF terminal half-life 
of conventional cytarabine is approximately 2–3.4 hours;.CSF terminal half-life was 100–263 hours after 
intrathecal liposomal cytarabine doses ranging from 12.5–75 mg.

. 
GENERAL ADVICE 
Administer by [CONTACT_16228]. Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of chemotherapy drugs. 
Wear gloves and avoid skin exposure and inhalation of fumes. 
 
The reconstituted solution is administered by [CONTACT_202747] 1 to 2 h. Shorter infusion times may produce 
intense pain and burning at the site of injection.Dissolve 1 vial with 3 mL of the dehydrated alcohol 
diluent, followed by 27 mL of sterile water for injection for a final concentration of 3.3 mg/mL in 10% 
alcohol. This solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose for a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in glass 
containers.Accidental contact [CONTACT_765262][INVESTIGATOR_371]; wear gloves when handling. Double gloving is recommended. 
 
43 
 When administered with polyvinyl chloride tubing, longer infusion times may result in unacceptable drug 
loss. To avoid drug loss, polyethylene tubing, such as nitroglycerin tubing, can be utilized for infusions of 
carmustine.Open the foil pouches containing the wafer in the operating room immediately prior to 
implantation.Unopened foil pouches are stable at room temperature for up to 6 h at a time. 
Wafers may be used if broken in half. Do not use if broken in more than 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]; dispose of as a 
hazardous chemical waste.Use a dedicated surgical instrument for handling the wafers during 
implantation. 
 
STORAGE/STABILITY 
Store the unopened vials in a refrigerator (2° to 8°C; 3° to 46°F). After reconstitution, store at room 
temperature (25°C; 77°F) for up to [ADDRESS_1048945] from light. 
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
 CNS - Depression (16%); intracranial hypertension (9%); anxiety, facial paralysis (7%); ataxia, 
hypesthesia (6%); dizziness, hallucinations, seizures (5%); headache (28%); meningitis; abscess; 
asthenia; confusion; somnolence; brain edema; intracranial infection. 
 Dermatologic - Rash (wafer) (12%); local burning pain at the injection site; intense flushing of the 
skin. 
 GI - Constipation (19%); abdominal pain, diarrhea (5%), (wafer); nausea (22%); vomiting (21%). 
 Genitourinary - UTI (8%; wafer); amenorrhea; male infertility. 
 Hematologic - Bone marrow suppression; myelosuppression. 
 Hepatic - Transient LFT elevations; hepatic necrosis and veno-occlusive disease after bone 
marrow transplantation. 
 Metabolic - Diabetes mellitus (wafer). 
 Renal - Dose-related, delayed-onset, progressive renal failure. 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] - Early pulmonary toxicity; delayed pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Special Senses - Retinitis; optic neuritis; suffusion of the conjunctiva. 
WARNINGS  
 Bone marrow suppression (notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) May contribute to bleeding 
and infections. Toxicity is cumulative, thus adjust dose based on nadir counts from prior doses. 
Do not repeat doses more frequently than every 6 wk. Perform weekly complete blood cell counts 
for 6 wk postdose. 
 Hematologic - The most frequent and serious toxic effect of injectable carmustine is delayed 
myelosuppression. 
 Pulmonary fibrosis - Delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis has occurred up to 17 yr after treatment 
and has been reported in patients who received injectable carmustine in childhood and early 
adolescence. 
 Pulmonary toxicity -Pulmonary toxicity from injectable carmustine appears to be dose-related. 
Patients receiving more than 1400 mg/m [ADDRESS_1048946] occurred. 
 Monitor liver and renal function tests periodically.Conduct baseline pulmonary function studies 
and frequent pulmonary function tests during treatment. Patients with a baseline less than 70% of 
predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL co ) are at 
particular risk. 
 Long-term use of nitrosoureas has been reported to be associated with the development of 
secondary malignancies.There have been reports of persistent testicular damage causing 
infertility with injectable carmustine.  
 Nausea and vomiting after IV administration. This dose-related toxicity appears within 2 h of 
dosing and lasts 4 to 6 h. Healing abnormalities - The majority of these events were mild to 
moderate in severity. 
 Reversible hepatic toxicity, manifested by [CONTACT_765263], alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin levels, has occurred in a small percentage of patients using injectable carmustine. 
 Ocular - Toxicity manifested as nerve fiber-layer infarcts and retinal hemorrhages has been 
associated with high dose injectable carmustine therapy. 
44 
  Renal toxicity - Decrease in kidney size, progressive azotemia, and renal failure have occurred in 
patients. 
 
ALEMTUZOMAB (CAMPATH) 
  
CAMPATH DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
Premedication and Patient Monitoring 
To minimize risk of IV infusion-related reactions, administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg and 
acetaminophen 500–[ADDRESS_1048947] alemtuzumab infusion and when dosage is 
escalated.1  (See Infusion-related Effects under Cautions.) 
Monitor patients carefully during or shortly after infusion for manifestations of infusion reactions (e.g., 
rigors, fever, bronchospasm, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, urticaria, dyspnea, hypotension). 1 
 
To minimize risk of injection site reactions, administer an antihistamine  and acetaminophen prior to sub-
Q† injections (e.g., 30 minutes before administration); 343536  in one study, premedication was gradually 
withdrawn following resolution of any injection-related reactions. 34 
 
Anti-infective Prophylaxis - To minimize risk of serious opportunistic infections, give prophylactic anti-
infectives upon initiation of alemtuzumab and continue for 2 months after completion of therapy or until 
CD4+ T-cell count ≥200/mm3 (whichever occurs later). 1 (See Infectious Complications under Cautions.) 
Administer co-trimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg per dose) twice daily 3 
times weekly (or equivalent) for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii) pneumonia. 1 
Administer famciclovir 250 mg twice daily (or equivalent) for prophylaxis of herpesvirus infection. 1 
 
ADMINISTRATION 
Administer by [CONTACT_16228]. 1 May be administered by [CONTACT_26423]-Q injection †.IV Administration 
For solution compatibility information, see Compatibility under Stability.Administer by [CONTACT_628023]. 1 Do 
not administer by [CONTACT_765264] (e.g., IV push or bolus). Do not mix with any other drug or administer 
any other drug simultaneously in the same IV line. Vials are for single use only.  
 
DILUTION 
Use strict aseptic technique since drug product contains no preservative. Do not shake vial prior to use. 15 
Withdraw appropriate dose of alemtuzumab concentrate into a syringe calibrated in increments of 0.01 
mL when preparing a 3-mg dose or a 10-mg dose; for a 30-mg dose, use a syringe calibrated in 
increments of 0.1 mL. 1 To prepare a 3-mg dose, withdraw 0.1 mL of alemtuzumab concentrate into a 1-
mL syringe; to prepare a 10-mg dose, withdraw 0.33 mL into a 1-mL syringe; and to prepare a 30-mg 
dose, withdraw [ADDRESS_1048948] vial, including any unused portion, after 
withdrawal of dose. 1 
Add appropriate dose of alemtuzumab concentrate to 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose 
injection; gently invert bag to mix solution. [ADDRESS_1048949] dosage and/or temporarily discontinue 
therapy if severe cytopenias (except lymphopenia) occur; permanently discontinue drug in patients with 
evidence of autoimmune hematologic toxicity (i.e., autoimmune anemia or thrombocytopenia).  
No dosage modifications recommended for lymphopenia.  
 
INFUSION REACTIONS 
Withhold therapy in patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions.  
Infectious Complications - If serious infection occurs, temporarily discontinue therapy; may reinitiate 
therapy following resolution of infection. Withhold therapy during antiviral therapy for CMV infection or 
confirmed CMV viremia (defined as positive for CMV according to PCR in ≥2 consecutive samples 
obtained ≥1 week apart) and initiate anti-infective therapy (ganciclovir or equivalent).  
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
None.  
 
45 
 WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS 
Use under supervision of a qualified clinician experienced in therapy with antineoplastic agents.  
 Hematologic Effects 
 Risk of severe (sometimes fatal) autoimmune anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and 
prolonged myelosuppression. 
  Hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, bone marrow  aplasia, and hypoplasia have occurred in 
patients receiving recommended dosage. 1 Increased incidence of pancytopenia with higher than 
recommended dosages (i.e., single doses >30 mg or cumulative weekly doses >90 mg). 
 Withhold alemtuzumab in patients who develop severe cytopenias (except lymphopenia). 1 (See 
Dosage under Dosage and Administration.) 
 Discontinue therapy permanently in patients with autoimmune hematologic toxicity (i.e., 
autoimmune anemia or thrombocytopenia) or recurrent or persistent severe cytopenias (except 
lymphopenia). 1 Safety of reinitiating alemtuzumab in patients with autoimmune cytopenia or bone 
marrow aplasia not established. 
 Severe idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), sometimes fatal, reported in 3 patients 
receiving alemtuzumab in a clinical trial evaluating the drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis .32 
Two of these patients received cumulative doses that exceeded the cumulative weekly dose limit. 
 Infusion Reactions - Risk of acute infusion reactions, including rigors, fever, bronchospasm, chills, 
nausea, vomiting, rash, urticaria, dyspnea, and hypotension occurring during or shortly after IV 
infusion, particularly during first week of therapy. 
 Serious, sometimes fatal, infusion-related reactions (e.g., syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, ARDS, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374], cardiac arrhythmias, MI, acute cardiac insufficiency, cardiac arrest , 
angioedema, anaphylactoid shock) reported. Monitor closely for adverse reactions during and 
shortly after infusion. 1 Withhold alemtuzumab in patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reactions. 1 Initiate medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], meperidine) as 
clinically indicated. 
 Premedication and incremental dosage escalation used to prevent or ameliorate reactions. 
Acute systemic injection-related reactions, including fever and chills/rigors, also reported with 
sub-Q † injection of alemtuzumab, but appear to be more common with IV infusion 
Immunosuppression 
Risk of severe and profound lymphopenia, which increases the potential for tranfusion-associated 
graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD). 12 Administer only irradiated blood products unless 
immediate transfusion is required because of emergency. 1 
Infectious Complications -Risk of serious (sometimes fatal) opportunistic bacterial, viral, fungal, or 
protozoan infections resulting from severe and profound lymphopenia. 1 
 Administer prophylactic anti-infectives against Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis 
carinii) and herpesvirus infections during alemtuzumab therapy and for at least [ADDRESS_1048950] dose of alemtuzumab. 134 (See Anti-infective Prophylaxis under Dosage and Administration.) 
 Risk of potentially serious or life-threatening CMV infection. [ADDRESS_1048951] 2 months following completion of alemtuzumab therapy. 1 
 
If serious infection occurs, temporarily discontinue alemtuzumab; 1 reinitiate therapy following resolution 
of infection.

 Organ scoring of chronic GVHD. *AP may be elevated in growing children, and not reflective of liver 
dysfunction. †Pulmonary scoring should be performed using both the symptom and pulmonary function 
testing (PFT) scale whenever possible. When discrepancy exists between pulmonary symptom or PFT 
scores the higher value should be used for final scoring. Scoring using the Lung Function Score (LFS) is 
preferred, but if DLCO is not available, grading using FEV1 should be used. The LFS is a global 
assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established 
[29]. The percent predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be 
converted to a numeric score as follows: >80% = 1; 70 -79% = 2; 60 -69% = 3; 50 -59% = 4; 40 -49% = 5; 
<40% = 6. The LFS = FEV1 score + DLCO score, with a poss ible range of [ADDRESS_1048956] disease; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; KPS, Karnofsky Performance Status; 
LPS, Lansky Performance Status; BSA, body surface area; ADL, activities of daily living; LFTs, liver 
function tests; AP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; 
ULN, upper limit of normal.  
 
 
 
Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung: see below), 
with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected 
organs or sites). Moderate chronic GVHD involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with 
clinically significant but no major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or 
site) or (2) 3 or more organs or sites with no clinically significant functional impairment 
(maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be 
considered moderate chronic GVHD. Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability 
caused by [CONTACT_190963] (score of 3 in any organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater 
will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.

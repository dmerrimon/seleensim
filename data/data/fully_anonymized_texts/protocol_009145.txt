It is well accepted that the greatest contributor to the health of the periodontium and dentition 
is regular and thorough dental plaque removal, typi[INVESTIGATOR_567669]. 
Although patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_567670]/dental disease by [CONTACT_567675], research has shown that an 
undesirably high proportion of adults find thorough toothbrushing with a standard manual 
toothbrush to achieve a plaque -free state c hallenging, as evidenced by [CONTACT_567676]/or periodontitis .  
The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the plaque removal efficacy of two electric 
powered toothbrushes after a single use, as well as the effect on plaque accumulation and 
gingivitis after 14 days and 30 days period.  
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Study design :  randomised, single blinded , parallel.   
 
After the screening procedure and based on inclusion  requirements , all subject s will receive oral 
prophylaxis  (T0) to ensure a baseline of 0 P laque Index (PI)  prior to the first appointment  (T1). 
The subject s will be instructed  not to use  a tooth brush or any mechanical cleaning  device until 
the initial PI [INVESTIGATOR_567671] (GI) are taken  at 24 hours  after T0.  
The subjects  will be randomized  into 3 groups , and the will be provided  one of  the two evaluated  
toothbrush es, as well as  toothpaste. All subjects will be using identical toothpaste and will receive 
oral hygiene instructions based on the manufacturer ’s recommendations .  
At T1 initial GI and PI [INVESTIGATOR_567672] a second PI [INVESTIGATOR_567673].  
The subject s will be instructed to brush twice a da y for a period of 2 minutes (follo wing the 
programmed toothbrush timer) and refrain from using  dental floss, t ooth pi[INVESTIGATOR_567674] . 
On the second visit  at 14 days (T2) and  third visit at  30 days ( T3), additional GI and PI [CONTACT_5978] s 
will be  taken  and data will be  recorded . All measurements and clinical examinations  will be 
performed by  a single  blinded examiner.  Evaluation on teeth will be  made on six teeth  
#3,7,12,19,23 and 28 (mesio -buccal, buccal, disto -buccal and mesio -lingual, lingual, disto -lingual)  
following the  Silness -Loe Index.  
Other  effect s on hard and soft tissue will also be recorded such as cervic al abrasion, gingival 
abrasion and effect on dental restorations.   
 
Toothbrushes:  Oral B (A) , BURST Oral care  (B), manual toothbrush (C)  
 
Dentifrice:   Colgate Total  
 
Duration  of study:  32 days period  
 
Baseline , data & Indices : oral prophylaxis will be performed to establish  baseline scores to  0. 
Plaque indices  and gingival indices  (Silness -Löe Index ) will be collected  [ADDRESS_745612] use of the

Subject Compensation  
 
Study  participants will receive $100 for their participation. $50 will be given at T2 and $50 at T3.  
 
Statistical Analysis   
ANOVA : 
 Compare the plaque level between the three groups after 30 days  
 Compare the gingitis level between the three groups after 30 days

2. Objectives   
Objective  1: Test whether HDAC inhibition through modified Atkins diet modifies the  
neurocognitive or neurobehavioral phenotype in individuals with Kabuki syndrome. Previously, a ketogenic diet has been shown to ameliorate cognitive and neurohistological  defects in a mouse model of Ka buki syndrome. This proposal aims to 
conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 10- 15 adult patients with Kabuki syndrome given 12 weeks of 
HDAC inhibition through diet and determine whether performance on the cognitive assessment protocol changes.  
  
3. Background   
Kabuki synd rome (KS; MIM 147920) is a genetic disorder occurring in about 1 in every  
32,000 births characterized by [CONTACT_658682]; dysmorphic facial features, skeletal 
anomalies,  persistence of fetal fingertip pads, postnatal growth deficiency, and 
intellectual disability (ID). The most  common variants in patients with KS are found in 
KMT2D – a histone methyltransferase that adds mono -, di- and trimethylation to K4, 
changes found at enhancers and actively transcribed promoters. Mutations in KDM6A – a histone demethylase that removes H3K27me3, a modification seen in closed chromatin – represent another known, but less common cause of KS (MIM 300867).  Mutations in KMT2D or KDM6A thus  result in widespread changes in normal cellular transcription 
due to loss of histone modifications resulting in  too much closed chromatin. Kabuki 
syndrome is thus an excellent example of a Mendelian disorder of histone  machinery 
(MDEM), most of which, like KS, result in intellectual disability. In addition to information about a  specific rare disease, understanding more about the cellular 
mechanisms resulting in impaired cognition in KS  gives insight into the whole group of 
MDEMs. Understanding these as a group, in turn, may provide a window  into the 
mechanisms underlying normal cognition and memory and learning, and pathologic states – specifically intellectual disability.   
Intellectual disability (ID) is a heavy burden on patients, family and society. Many genetic syndromes result in intellectual disability; however, although the ca usative genes 
of these syndromes are known, little is understood about how these variants lead to intellectual disability. Only recently, basic science has begun to try to characterize the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment. This work has led to tr eatment trials in 
diseases such as Fragile X syndrome and Angelman syndrome. The Bjornsson lab has demonstrated that Kmt2d is highly expressed in the granule cell layer of the dentate

 gyrus. Kmt2d +/βGeo mice have many physical features of humans with KS as well as 
abnormalities in visuospatial memory and deficits in neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus seen in association with a thinner granule cell layer. Import antly, these cognitive and histopathologic deficits were corrected with postnatal 
administration of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and with the ketogenic diet. The dentate gyrus – and postnatal neurogenesis in this region – has been linked to spatial patt ern 
separation and thus tests that examine visuospatial reasoning and memory at least partially localize to this brain region. While problems with visuospatial areas of cognition are far from a 1:[ADDRESS_888630] this neuroanatomical region 
to be abnormal in individuals with KS if mouse studies are predictive. Our recently published study of 23 patients solidified the visuospatial/verbal differences in the KS cognitive profile and more specifically linked the weaknesses in the profile to the 
dentate gyrus region. Additionally, by [CONTACT_658683] -matched 
controls, we established that this cognitive phenotype is specific to Kabuki syndrome and different from what is seen in other causes of ID. In addition, impaired neurogenesis 
in the hippocampus has been strongly linked to anxiety and anecdotally we have noticed a significant burden of anxiety in patients with Kabuki syndrome. Thus it is important to examine emotion and behavior in totality as well as anxiety in depth in this population and determine whether anxiety moderates the cognitive performance. As a next step, a biologically relevant and evidence -based treatment must be selected as an  intervention 
for a clinical trial.  The Bjornsson lab has demonstrated that in the Kmt2d +/βGeo mice, a ketogenic diet is equally effective in reversing the visuospatial deficits and increasing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This is a treatment that is used clinically for many conditions including 
ones that affect the central nervous system like epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Modified Atkins diet has been shown to be effective in these conditions in place of stricter ketogenic diet and is easier for patients to tolerate. T he pi[INVESTIGATOR_658675] a larger 
trial which could have immediate benefit to patients and change clinical practice. The Bjornsson lab demonstrated in 2016 that neurogenesis and memory deficits in the mouse model of KS was not  only rescued by [CONTACT_658684] -42, but that 
it was also rescued with the ketogenic diet
 (Figure 2). Beta hydroxybutyrate, a ketone 
body that is actively transported into the central nervous system and enters the hippocampus during ket osis, is a potent HDAC inhibitor. Modified Atkins diet (MAD) 
has been shown to be an effective, safer to initiate, and easier to comply with substitute for the ketogenic diet in other CNS processes like epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Thus we believe the 
rationale is there to a ttempt a low -risk pi[INVESTIGATOR_658676]. The Neurology teams at Johns Hopkins include nutritionists, clinicians, and 
researchers who have extensive experience with MAD and they will be available for 
consultation and for an y diet -related needs. [ADDRESS_888631] protocol revision : ____ 3/7/2022 ______

 4. Study Procedures  
a. Participants with Kabuki syndrome 18 years a nd old er will be recruited to 
participate.  Recruitment will stop once fifteen participants are consented. This 
number allows for the ~30% rate of dropout  expected based on difficulty complying 
with the diet in order to have data from [ADDRESS_888632] their initial visit and conclude 12 weeks later. See Figure 1.

genome -wide DNA methylation analysis  to look for the known abnormal signature [CONTACT_658690]. Participants and /or their 
caregivers will keep a daily diet log and /or will be asked to downloa d the free Carb 
Manager application onto their smartphone. They will send the logs and data back weekly.  The application is optional, only if participants prefer it to keepi[INVESTIGATOR_658678].  Participants will be given urine ketone strips and asked to use and record in their 
diet log twice weekly. Participants will have blood ordered and drawn remotely every 3 weeks and sent securely to the study team. Beta- hydroxybutyrate will be measured on 
this sample as well as genome -wide DNA methylation measured every  3 weeks to see if 
it changes over the course of the trial. At the 6 week mark participants will also securely send a urine sample for measurement of urine ketones and amino acids to investigate metabolism while on the diet. Participants will return to Baltimore at the end of 12 weeks for a one day visit to repeat the cognitive assessment protocol, neurobehavioral measures, and repeat the initial lab tests  including genome -wide DNA methylation  
(Figure 1).

Another [ADDRESS_888636] 
blood ordered and drawn remotely every 3 weeks and sent securely to the study 
team. Once the study team receives it, one vial will go to JHH core lab and one to the Bjornsson lab. Beta -hydroxybutyrate will be measured on this sample by [CONTACT_658685] 3 weeks and the other tube will again be taken to the Bjornsson lab to perform genome -wide DNA methylation a rrays at 6 weeks  to see if it changes over 
the course of the trial.  
 
5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
We will recruit 15 total participants with clinically -definite and genetically -confirmed 
Kabuki syndrome type 1 age 18 years and olde r. Clinical diagnosis of  KS will be made 
based on recently published consensus diagnosis criteria. Genetic confirmation of a pathogenic mutation in KMT2D will also be required. Exclusion of participants younger than 18 years old is based on: 1) adults being able to consent to the ir own diet therapy,  
2) ability to adhere to the diet , and 3) ability to standardize one cognitive battery to 
compare across and between participants. Other exclusion criteria include presence of another known genetic syndrome , a health problem that would make a modified Atkins 
diet harmful, inability to travel to Baltimore for 2 visits separated by 12 weeks . 
Recruitment of participants will be done solely by [CONTACT_658686]00240569 to participate in this study as well. No recruit ment will be done of 
participants not already enrolled in the other study.  
 
6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The Bjornsson lab demonstrated in 2016 that neurogenesis and memory deficits in the mouse model of KS was not only rescued by [CONTACT_658684]-42, but that it was also rescued with the ketogenic diet
 (Figure 2 ). Beta 
hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body that is actively transported into the central nervous system and enters the hippocampus during ketosis, is a potent HDAC inhibitor . 
Modified Atkins diet (MAD) has been shown to be an effective, safer to initiate, and easier to comply with  substitute for the ketogenic diet in other CNS processes like epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Thus we believe the rationale is there to attempt a low -risk pi[INVESTIGATOR_658680] i ntervention in patients with KS. The Neurology teams at Johns Hopkins 
include nutritionists, clinicians, and researchers who have extensive experience with MAD and they will be available for consultation and for any diet -related needs. [ADDRESS_888637]. To date, no study of treating epi[INVESTIGATOR_658681].  AR42 and Vafidemstat were chosen as in vitro comparisons (no in vivo 
use of these drugs) because of the p revious evidence from the Bjornsson lab that

 both HDAC inhibition and LSD1 inhibition also ameliorate the phenotype in mice 
like ketogenic diet does.  
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable: Change in cognitive testing protocol before and after 12 week s of the diet  
b. Secondary outcome variables : 1) Change in anxiety measure scores after 12 
weeks on the diet. 2) Change in genome -wide DNA methylation array 
signature [CONTACT_658691]. 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification: We will recruit [ADDRESS_888638] of the proposed research presents no more than minimal physical, psychological, legal, or financial risk to participants. Neurological examination is part of a routine physical examin ation and 
involves no more than minimal  risk to the participants. Neuropsychological 
testing can take a prolonged amount of time and can cause anxiety and discomfort in participants. Venipuncture can cause discomfort and mild 
bruising or bleeding at the si te. Risk of infection is minimal. Patients may be 
disturbed by [CONTACT_658687]. Risk of using the CarbManager 
application is minimal.   Participants do not enter name [CONTACT_40234]. They 
do enter a username (which will be their subject ID), sex,  and year of birth. 
However sex and year of birth can be skipped.  Other than that, participants only enter diet logs daily.   The participant then generates weekly reports 
through the app that will be saved as a pdf to their device which they then will sec urely email to the study team.   Use of the app is optional for 
participants and they can opt to just type their diet logs and securely email them

e. Participants may incur a financial toll by [CONTACT_658688]. We will minimize this by [CONTACT_658689].  
 
9. Benefits  
a. There is a possibility that patients may experience improvement in their 
cognition after 12 weeks on the diet. Other benefits of the study include furthering the scientific knowledge about Kabuki syndrome specifically and brain -behavior relationships in gener al 
  
10. Payment and Remuneration 
a. Participants will not receive any payment as part of this study but will be provided lunch and parking  during the study visit s.  
 
11. Costs  
a. Participants will not incur significant costs as part of this study. 
Neurobehavioral testi ng and laboratory  costs will be paid for by [CONTACT_976]’s grant 
funding. Participants will be responsible for their own travel costs to 
Baltimore. Participants will also be responsible for the cost of their own food during the diet period.

  Safety  and Tolerability Study of R(+)Pramipexole in Alzheimer’s Disease  
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
The looming problem  
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) type pathology currently afflicts 3.[ADDRESS_971030] wages of caregivers 
estimated to be 150 -200 billion dollars. Because the major risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_713383], and given 
the projected 2 to 2.5 -fold increase in the age -vulnerable population as the “baby [CONTACT_346885]” generation 
ages, projected expenditures for AD care in 15 -20 years could equal the baseline Department of 
Defense budget. In addition to the immense personal tragedies inflicted by [CONTACT_22802], the looming medical 
and socioeconomic disaster posed by [CONTACT_713414] n aging should stimulate massive efforts 
to both understand its pathophysiology and develop disease trajectory -altering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
What are the roadblocks limiting disease -altering AD therapy development?  
 The vast majority of AD (~95%) occurs sporadically  without clear autosomal genetic cause. 
While certain genes such as APOE4 increase risk of acquiring AD, they certainly are not causal. Genes felt to be causal for genetic (familial) AD that represents ~5% of the AD population involve either one of 
multipl e known mutations of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or mutations in one of the two known 
presenilin genes (PS1 or PS2). Because cells expressing APP only or with PS mutations (but not PS 
mutations alone) overproduce 40 -42 amino acid long peptide fragments  of APP, known as beta amyloid 
1-40 or 1- 42, because AD brains characteristically accumulate beta amyloid as visible plaques, and in 
light of the in vitro  neurotoxicity of beta amyloids (esp the 1 -42 peptide), a causal theory known as the 
“beta amyloid cas cade hypothesis” was advanced ~[ADDRESS_971031] been both many and at times stridently debated. Opponents argue that this hypothesis has now been tested in humans with 
several different types of beta amyloid lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713384]. Proponents argue 
that the theory either has not yet had the proper testing in humans, and/or that the toxic species are low 
molecular weight soluble  oligomeric forms of beta amyloid (as opposed to insoluble plaques). 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713385] (beta - or gamma -secretase inhibitors) or remove 
accumulated beta amyloid (immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) continue to be developed and enter testing in humans 
with AD. As a result, the amyloid cascade hypothesis will “get its day in court”, but there is clearly a 
substantial risk of failure in pursuing solely this single therapeutic avenue.  
 In addition to whatever conceptual barriers that have arisen as a result of the dominance of the 
amyloid cascade hypothesis (some have compared its vocal proponents to a “scientific cartel”), a more vexing problem relates to defining other “targets”. Traditional pharma drug development has relied upon 
defining speci fic molecular targets, developi[INVESTIGATOR_713386], 
and selecting the most efficacious/least toxic for potential development to use in humans. For a complex and likely heterogeneous disease such as AD, the identities of  the targets causal for disease 
progression are not clear. A major premise of this application is that the molecular target approach for 
altering neurodegenerative diseases is too limiting and likely to fail. That has been the case so far in 
Parkinson’s di sease [3], the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of adults. Rather, the 
approach taken in this application is to try and define consistent abnor malities in systems biologic 
processes that are defective in AD, then apply therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713387]. This proposal advances a process -altering, not a molecular target -driven approach.  
Elevated oxidative stress appears ear ly in AD and can drive increased beta amyloid accumulation  
 Most eukaryotic life on earth lives in atmospheric oxygen and is dependent on oxidative 
decarboxylation of fuels and reduction of oxygen to water by [CONTACT_713415][INVESTIGATOR_713388] (ATP). Highly differentiated, non -mitotic cells such as neurons are energy intensive, 
very dependent on mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and as a consequence must inactivate relatively large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion and its diffusible dismutation 
product hydrogen peroxide. When ROS production rates exceed inactivation rates, a state of “oxidative 
stress” exists, wherein proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_713389]. Because most ROS 
normally arise from th e small inefficiency of mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], mitochondrial components 
R(+) pramipexole in Alzheimer ’s Disease   James P. Bennett, Jr. M.D., Ph.D. -Sponsor  
2/18/[ADDRESS_971032] spi[INVESTIGATOR_713390], formulated as the “mitochondrial hypothesis of aging”, at least as applied to energy -
intensive, non -mitotic tissue s such as brain, heart, retina and muscle.  
 Relative oxidative stress in brain tissue can be monitored in living subjects by [CONTACT_713416] F2 -isoprostanes/neuroprostanes [4,5,6,7,8] . In deceased 
subjects, brain tissues can be assayed for the same molecules, as well as oxidized proteins, other 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_713391]. For subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a pre -AD state for a certain 
fraction, elevated oxidati ve stress markers are present in spi[INVESTIGATOR_713392] 
[4,5,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19] . For mice expressing familial AD genes, brain oxidative stress is 
elevated long before beta amyloid accumulation  begins [6]. For AD brains, elevated oxidative stress 
could be responsible for appearance of elevated beta amyloid peptides, as expression of beta secretase enzyme (necessary for cleaving the N -terminal part of bet a amyloid from APP) is increased 
by [CONTACT_174026], and activity of insulin degrading enzyme (neprilysin), which degrades beta amyloid peptide, is decreased by [CONTACT_174026] [20,21,22,23,24] . 
mtDNA in sporadic  AD can contribute to oxidative stress and increased beta amyloid production  
 Human mitochondria have multiple copi[INVESTIGATOR_713393] (~16.6 kbase) circular, maternally 
inherited DNA that codes for 13 essential respi[INVESTIGATOR_713394]. Human brain mtDNA ac cumulates point 
mutations and oxidative damage with aging. Individual brain neurons also experience clonal expansion of mtDNA’s containing sizeable (5 -7 kbase) deletions that cannot produce essential respi[INVESTIGATOR_713395]. As a result, age -related damage to  brain neuronal mtDNA, leading to increased oxidative 
stress, is an attractive hypothesis for risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_713396].  
 In our previous studies we have tested the hypothesis that AD patients harbor pathogenic 
mtDNA’s by c reating cybrid cells that selectively express mtDNA against constant nuclear genetic and 
neuronal cell culture backgrounds [25]. We found that compared to cybrid cells made from age -
matched non -AD controls, cybrids from AD subjects had increased oxidative stress, impaired 
mitochondrial functions and secreted increased beta amyloid peptides [15,25,26] . While not providing 
insight into the specifics of mtDNA abnormalities, and  not proving causality of mtDNA to initiate AD 
pathogenesis, our cybrid studies implicated mtDNA -driven oxidative stress as a likely contributor to 
beta amyloid overproduction in AD.  
 If abnormal mtDNA’s produce impaired respi[INVESTIGATOR_713397], and if such increased oxidative stress further 
damages mitochondrial components and increases beta amyloid production, then reduction of 
mitochondrial oxidative stress should exert a di sease -slowing effect in AD. This benefit, if present, 
would neither support nor refute the amyloid cascade hypothesis, since oxidative stress by [CONTACT_713417]. However, there is also no a priori  reason to reject the possibility o f 
multiple interacting drivers of neurodegeneration. To return to the initial argument advanced, what this 
application proposes is development of approaches to reduce mitochondrially generated oxidative 
stress as a systems biological problem in AD, rather than target a specific macromolecule.  
What about regional vulnerability?  
 A consistent, defining characteristic of adult neurodegenerative diseases is regional 
vulnerability, meaning that selected neuronal populations degenerate at increased rates relative  to 
other neurons. For AD, loss of hippocampal and nucleus basalis neurons is greatest, followed by 
[CONTACT_713418]. For PD, nigral dopamine and other brainstem aminergic neurons 
are most vulnerable. How can this be?  
 The honest answer is that causes of regional vulnerability are both intriguing and remain 
elusive. Altering their mechanisms may offer great therapeutic benefits. Yet, rational experiments to 
alter pathogenic mechanisms can proceed in the absence of knowing how regional vulnerability occurs. 
In the case of AD and PD, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_713398], at least in some subjects.

2/18/2011  $"SPECIFIC AIMS  
The primary aim of this protocol is to test the safety and tolerability of R -Pramipexole in humans 
with probable AD.  We will also explore changes in oxidative stress and brain metabolic consequences 
as a “proof of concept” exploratory aim.   
Primary Aim: Assess the safety and tolerability of R -Pramipexo le in probable  AD.  Twenty 
subjects with probable AD will initiate treatment with 100 mg/day of R(+) pramipexole for one month. If 
tolerated, the subjects will increase to 200 mg/day for one month and  then 300 mg/day for the next [ADDRESS_971033] routine safety 
blood labs performed every two months .  
Exploratory Aim: Assess the effect of R -Pramipexole on oxidative stress and brain metabolic 
consequences .  Prior to initiation of R(+)PPX dosing, we will obtain plasma and spi[INVESTIGATOR_713399]  (2FDG PET). During the last 
month of 300 mg/day dosing, obtain plasma and spi[INVESTIGATOR_713400] 2FDG PET scan.  
PRELIMINARY DATA  
R(+)pramipexole is a mitochondrially concentrated antioxidant  
Pramipexole (PPX) is a benzothiazole synthesized in the 1980’s as an apomorphine analogue 
[27]. The stereospecific synthesis yielded S( -)PPX (Figure 1), which possessed potent and full agonist 
actions at the D2 family of brain dopamine receptors. S( -)PPX was developed for clinical use in humans 
and was approved in 1997 by [CONTACT_713419] �, for treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms 
due to nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency.  
PPX synthesis also yielded the R(+) PPX enantiomer (Figure 1), which was subsequently 
shown to possess very weak potency at D2 receptors. However, both R(+) and S( -) PPX are present at 
physiological pH as lipophilic, doubly charged cations, a property that predicted to the sponsor that they 
would be concentrated into mitochondria. Because PPX also possessed a favorable reduction potential 
that predicted it would inactivate all common ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), R(+)PPX had 
potential as a mitochondrially concentrated ROS/RNS scavenger that should be tolerated in very high 
doses because of its weak potency at D2 receptors.  
R(+)PPX is concentrated into mitochondria (Figure 2) and scavenges mitochondrial superoxide 
(Figure 3).

plasma levels of > 1 µM in humans dosed with 300 mg/day. (Figure 5)  
 
 
R(+)PPX can safely be administered to humans up to 300 mg/day and slows progression of ALS  
Based on the preclinical pharmacology of R(+)PPX and his prediction that it would be tolerated 
in much higher doses than S( -)PPX (limited to 4.5 -6 mg/day), the sponsor (Bennett) obtained a 
physician- sponsor IND from the FDA to administer R(+)PPX to humans with ALS. Dosing began in 
spring, 2004. With private funding, the sponsor carried out a series of small Phase 1- 2 studies in ALS 
subjects, culminating in a dose escalation study to 300 mg/day carried out in 2006 -07. In each study, 
the sponsor obtained data showing a slowing of disease progression in ALS, but the numbers were too 
small and the studies were all comparative dose, open label that did not allow definitive statements 
about efficacy [2] 
In 2006 R(+)PPX was licensed to Knopp Neurosciences that began its own commercial 
development of R(+)PPX. In Dec, 2009 Knopp announced its very positive Phase 2b results from a 
placebo- controlled trial in early ALS subjects 
(http://www.knoppneurosciences.com/index.php?section=news&subsection=news&id=60) 
In the case of ALSFRS -R, the number of treatment failures, defined as the loss of 6 points or greater 
in ALSFRS- R scores from baseline, totaled 9 subjects (or 33%), in the placebo group; 8 subjects 
(35%), in the 50 mg/day group, 4 subjects (15%) in the 150 mg/day group, and 2 subjects (8%) in the 
300 mg/day group (p=0.014).  
   In the case of pulmonary function, the number of treatment failures, defined as a reduction in forced vital capacity of 20% or greater from baseline, totaled 8 subjects (30%) in the placebo group, 3 subjects 
(13%) in the 50 mg group, 3 subjects (12%) in the [ADDRESS_971034] (4%) in the 300 mg group (p=0.028). 
Both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_713401] R(+)PPX. The sponsor has 
searched for evidence of suppression of serum prolactin, as a consequence of in vivo D2 dopamine 
receptor activity, in ALS patients undergoing dose escalation with R(+)PPX. He found no evidence of 
suppression of prolactin levels (Figure 6). This suggests that at a daily dose of 300 mg/day, his 
preparation of R(+)PPX has no detectable activity at central D2 dopamine receptors and should be well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_713420].

Thus, at this point in time R(+)PPX has been administered to ~170 subjects, ~[ADDRESS_971035] taken 
300 mg/day for 6 -9 months. R(+)PPX has an excellent safety record with no drug -related serious 
adverse events reported.  It has excellent preclinical data supporting brain and mitochondrial 
concentration and ROS scavenging. Its clinical use in humans with the devastating disease ALS demonstrated efficacy in slowing disease progression in a placebo -controlled trial. It is en tering 
definitive Phase 3 efficacy testing in ALS and is ready to be tested in probable AD in this trial.  
While the sponsor  (Bennett) and Knopp Neurosciences maintain a collegial relationship, each 
has his/its own IND, R(+)PPX supply, and independently pu rsues clinical testing of R(+)PPX. Knopp is 
presently completely focused on pursuing Phase 3 testing of R(+)PPX in ALS. The sponsor  of this 
proposal has amended his IND to pursue testing of R(+)PPX in AD and PD subjects. The sponsor  
declares a financial in terest in the uses of R(+)PPX in degenerative illnesses.  
 
AD subjects show early increases in brain oxidative stress and reductions in cortical energy metabolism  
 In recent years several groups have argued persuasively that mitochondrial dysfunction and 
increased oxidative stress are early deficits in humans with AD and transgenic mice expressing familial 
AD genes. It is not necessary to repeat the details of these arguments here; the reader is referred to 
specific reviews for details [9,10,11,12,13,14,28,29,30] .  
 One of the very recent reviews of this subject [10] is particularly passionate in its arguments and 
summarizes most forcefully the basic argument. Bonda, et al [10] argue that increased beta amyloid 
production occurs as part of an antioxidant response t o early oxidative stress. This beta amyloid 
response paradoxically turns into its own neurodegenerative stimulus, stimulating increased oxidative 
stress in its own right.  This positive feed -forward “vicious” neurodegenerative cycle is well established 
by [CONTACT_713422]. Bonda, et al, and others, argue for early initiation of effective antioxidant therapy, at the 
earliest sign of cognitive impairment.  
 Under norma l dietary (non -fasting) circumstances, most brain energy is formed from glucose 
metabolism. Rates of accumulation of deoxyglucose provide measure of regional brain glucose metabolic rates, which reflect cytosolic glycolysis and ultimately pyruvate metaboli sm in mitochondria. 
Robust cerebral cortical glucose metabolism is reduced in MCI subjects in a pattern that recapi[INVESTIGATOR_713402].  
 Recent advances in understanding the utility of cerebral gluc ose metabolism, studied with FDG -
PET, to discriminate MCI from AD and follow progression of AD have begun to appear as a result of the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).  The results of a very recently reported study 
using statistical brai n mappi[INVESTIGATOR_713403] -PET scans in MCI and early/probable AD subjects [31] are 
shown in Figure 7. The authors found multiple co rtical areas of decline in both MCI and early AD 
subjects. Notably, they calculated that [ADDRESS_971036] with 80% power at p=0.05 a 25% change in decline of FDG 
accumulation ove r a 12 month period .

2/18/[ADDRESS_971037] not been helpful  
As recently reviewed by [CONTACT_713423], et al, [12] several trials of antioxidants have been carried out in AD 
subjects. Compounds showing some positive activity in transgenic mouse models but gene rally failing 
in human subjec ts included vitamin E, idebenone (CoenzymeQ10 analogue)  cloquinol, curcumin and 
dimebon. One possibility for failure of these compounds in humans, in addition to kinetic issues, is that 
none are predicted to accumulate into bra in mitochondria. If one is testing the hypothesis that 
mitochondrially generated ROS are driving elevated oxidative stress damage in AD, then brain and 
mitochondrial concentration of the ROS scavenger are critical.  R(+)PPX satisfies these criteria (see 
Figures 2 and 4 above).  
 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS  
General  
This is a safety and tolerability  study of R(+)PPX in subjects with probable AD. R(+)PPX is an 
orally active, brain and mitochondrially concentrated free radical scavenger that has shown excelle nt 
safety and tolerability in Phase 1 and 2 studies in >100 ALS subjects. Its lack of in vivo  D2 dopamine 
receptor activity (based on not lowering serum prolactin) at daily doses up to 300 mg/day contrasts with 
the potent dopamine receptor -limiting dosing of S( -)PPX (Mirapex) at 4.5 -6.0 mg/day. Pharmacokinetic 
studies carried out by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_713404] R(+)PPX doses of 300 mg/day frequently yield steady -
state trough plasma PPX levels >[ADDRESS_971038] highly neuroprotective brain PPX levels of >6 µM 
[2].  
R(+)PPX slows the progression of disability and decline of respi[INVESTIGATOR_713405] (Knopp Phase 2b, Phase 3 pending).  The  scientific rationale for the current proposed study in 
probable AD is that oxidative stress is an early abnormality in human AD and transgenic animal models of familial AD. Increased brain oxidative stress is likely causal for AD pathogenesis and can stim ulate 
net production of beta amyloid by [CONTACT_713424] (beta secretase expression) and 
inhibiting beta amyloid degradation (neprilysin activity). The  sponsor’s  group has shown that mtDNA 
from AD subjects expressed in a cybrid model can d rive increased oxidative stress and beta amyloid 
production, which is reduced by [CONTACT_713425]. The current study will not define how oxidative stress is 
increased in AD brain, rather it will correct that problem by [CONTACT_27180] a well tolerated and novel 
mitochon drial antioxidant.  
The sponsor  has extensive experience testing R(+)PPX in ALS and has an active physician -
sponsor IND that has been amended to allow testing of R(+)PPX in AD subjects  (see DSMB charter in 
appendix for more information) .  Because of confli cts of interest, the sponsor  will not be involved at all 
in recruitment, treatment or evaluation of AD subjects; that will occur at Kansas University Medical Center (KUMC), with [CONTACT_713453] as the Principal Investigator . James Bennett, Jr.,MD, PhD  will 
function as Sponsor in this study but will have no direct involvement in clinical care.  
The primary goal of the study is to establish the safety and tolerability  of the study medication  in 
individuals with AD . Exploratory variables involve changes in brain  and peripheral oxidative stress 
assayed by [CONTACT_713426][INVESTIGATOR_713406], respectively, change in cognitive function and improvement in brain glucose metabolism assayed by [CONTACT_6789] -PET scan. The goal of the present study is 
to establish that up to 300 mg/day of R(+)PPX is tolerated by [CONTACT_713427], lowers 
oxidative stress and may show a trend of improving brain glucose metabolism.  
 
Subject selection and recruitment  
 Subjects with probable AD will be identified and recruited through the Memory Disorders Clinic 
at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). This clinic is under the direction of [CONTACT_713453], 
an accomplished AD clinical investigator.  
KU Alzheimer and Memory Program

identification, recruitment, and characterization of nondemented and probable AD research participants ,

Anne Arthur, ARNP), a director of research (Anita Macan), and a research nurse (Cherie Parker).  Pat 
Laubinger provides ove rsight and planning for the Clinical Trial Unit through her role as the 
administrative director of the AMP.  
 
Alzheimer and Memory Clinic  
[CONTACT_56777] directs the Alzheimer and Memory Clinic, the major referral clinic for the area and the 
state of Kansas  and the clinical study site for this application .  The clinic evaluates more than 600 
patients annually, 300 of which are new evaluations, and is staffed by [CONTACT_713428] (Burns, Anderson, 
Swerdlow, and Arthur) in addition to a multidisciplinary team (social  worker, pharmacist, 
psychometrician, and a nurse).  AMP research evaluations are not conducted in the clinic.  Rather, 
patients interested in research who appear to meet criteria for entry are referred to the AMP for 
enrollment into specific studies.   
Clinic Database:   Patients evaluated in the clinic are asked to provide consent to be contact[CONTACT_713429].  Additionally, consent is provided to store 
health information in a database.  The database contains  information regarding patient diagnosis, 
medications, medical history, and basic cognitive performance data (MMSE and memory testing [logical 
memory]).  The information collected was chosen to provide basic information regarding common 
inclusion and exclu sion criteria to best target potential recruitment into our ongoing investigational 
studies and clinical trials.   
Since initiating the database in September 2004, information on a total of 945 unique patients has 
been entered into our database.  Of these,  486 were diagnosed with AD (mean age 74.7 years, MMSE 
19.8, and logical memory II 1.5) and 112 were diagnosed with MCI (mean age 72.5, MMSE = 26.8, 
logical memory II = 5.1).  Forty patients included in the database have a diagnosis of dementia with 
Lewy bodies and [ADDRESS_971040] to recruit participants from our active clinic population.   
 Alzheimer’s Disease:
  Individuals with AD  meet NINDS -ADRDA criteria for possible of probable AD  and 
have a score of 1 4 - 26 inclusive on the MMSE .  NINDS -ADRDA criteria are operationalized as 1) 
memory impairment, 2) the gradual onset and progression of impairment in memory and in at least one 
other cognitive domain  (as demonstrated by [CONTACT_713430]) and 3) the 
absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of other disorders that could account for memory or cognitive decline or if a second disorder is present it is n ot considered the primary cause of dementia.

Treatment protocol  
Overview (see calendar of events below) : After providing  signed informed conse nt, participants 
will undergo a screening visit to assess study participant eligibility.  Neuropsychological testing (ADAS -
Cog) will be perfo rmed at baseline and every t wo months (visits 2, 3, 4, and End of Study (EOS) ). A 
lumbar puncture and blood draw (f or isoprostane analysis) and fluoro -deoxy- glucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG -PET)  will be performed  at baseline and after 6 months of treatment to s erve as 
exploratory “proof of concept” measures  to explore the effect of R-Pramipexole  on key biologi cal 
targets .  Safety visits  with laboratory testing and physical assessments  will occur every two months . 
Follow up phone calls to the participants and their study partner will be conducted every two weeks 
during treatment to assess for possible adverse ev ents. 
 Screening Visit:  A screening visit will occur in the GCRC  and last approximately 2  hours.  
Participants will be accompanied by a study partner  and provide informed consent.  De mographics, 
medical history, and medications will be collected by a stud y coordinator.  The study coordinator will 
administer the mini -mental status exam, Geriatric Depression Scale and Hachinski Ischemic Scale.  
Vital signs will be assessed (height, weight, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature) and non-
fasting blood and urine will be collected  for routine safety labs  including a chemistry panel (s odium, 
potassium, chloride, CO2, BUN, glucose, calcium, total protein, total bilirubin, albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, AST and ALT ), hematology panel (complete blood count in cluding differential), and a 
microscopic urinalysis.    A study clinician will perform a ph ysical and neurological exam and review the 
inclusion / exclusion criteria and AD diagnostic criteria  to determine study participant eligibility .

  Baseline Assessmen ts:  Baseline assessments will occur within four weeks of the screening 
visit and will consist of two or three visits to KUMC: 1) Cognitive testing at the KU Alzheimer and 
Memory Program  (<1 hour ), 2) FDG PET scanning in the radiology department  (1.5 hours ), and 3) 
GCRC visit for a blood draw and lumbar puncture (2 hours).   
Cognitive Testing :  A study psychometrician will perform a standard battery of cognitive tests on 
all par ticipants utilizing  the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscal e (ADAS -Cog).  
The ADAS -Cog is composed of 11 subtests of memory and language and is frequently used for clinical 
trials.   
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans:   Fluoro -deoxy- glucose (FDG) PET imaging will be 
performed on all participants at baseline and after treatment for [ADDRESS_971042] four hours prior to the scanning session.  The participant ’s blood glucose will be 
checked prior to scanning and must be < 180 mg/dL.  After the injection of 5 mCi of tracer , subjects will 
sit in a quiet, dimly lit room for 30 minutes after which they are placed in the scanner.  Procedures will 
be identical to those used extensively by [CONTACT_713431]’s Disease Neuroima ging Initiative.   
Lumbar Puncture:  Participants will arrive in the GCRC in the early morning  after an overnight 
fast for blood and CSF collection.  Fasting blood (14 cc) will be drawn for isoprostane analysis.  [CONTACT_713454] will perform all lumbar punctures .  Lidocaine will be used for topi[INVESTIGATOR_713408] a n 
atraumatic 24 gau ge Sprotte needle will be inserted for CSF collection  at the L3/4 or L4/5 interspace.  2 
cc of fluid will be discarded and 2 cc sent to the local laboratory for routine cell counts, protein, and 
glucose.  Ten milliliters of bloo d will be collected and spun. The serum sample  will be sent to the 
protocol investigator for isoprostane analyses.  After completion of the procedure, participants will be 
remain in the GCRC;  have breakfast; and rest for about [ADDRESS_971043] 24 hours apart. 	
  	
  
Safety Visits:  Participants will have in -person safety assessments (1.5 hours) in the GCRC 
every 8 weeks.  Vital signs  and weight  will be measured ; concurrent medications and adverse events 
will be assessed. A physical and neurological examination will be performed by a study clinician.  A 
targeted symptom checklist will be reviewed with the participant and study partner at each visit to 
assess occurrence of adverse events including those most associated with th e use of pramipexole 
(Mirapex, see table 1 of appendix).  Blood and urine will be collected for safety labs.   Study drug will be 
dispensed at s afety visits i.e. visits 1, 2, and 3 .  Cognitive testing (ADAS -Cog) will be administered at 
each safety visit.     
Study Drug Administration:  R(+)PPX is provided by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor to the KUMC investigational 
pharmacy as the water soluble dihydrochloride salt, in the form of powder manufactured under GMP 
conditions by [CONTACT_713432], the supplier of drug for all of [CONTACT_170989]’s studies. The 
investigational pharmacy prepares a water solution at 10 mg/ml. This solution has been tested by [CONTACT_713433] [ADDRESS_971044] two months.  
 Treatment is initiated after the Baseline visit at 100mg a day ( 50 mg bid in morning and early 
evening)  for 1  month. If tolerated, dosing will increase to 200mg a day ( 100 mg bid) for a second one-
month interval . If at the end of four months of being on study drug, the par ticipant is not experiencing  
side effects the study drug will be increased to 300mg a day ( 150 mg bid) where it will remain for the 
next 4 months.   Subjects will be seen every two months for safety assess ments prior to any dose 
escalation and will also be contact[CONTACT_713434]  (see below) . If a participant  
experience s mild, non-serious adverse events possibly due to the study drug, the study clinician will 
determine the causality and make a decision whether to continue the study medication and at what 
dosage. If study drug is dis continued  temporarily (>10 days) , it will be titrated to the target dose with 
dose increases no more frequent than once a month.   
            Drug Accountability:   Participants in the study will return any unused drug and study drug 
containers at each of the safety visits. Study partners will be asked to account for any missed dosages 
of the study drug and the reason for missing the dosing. Participants are  encouraged to maintain 100 
percent compliance with dosing. The study partner and the participant wil l be advised of their

2/18/2011  10	
  compliance at each safety visit before the study drug is dispensed and means and measures to 
increase compliance will be initiated. All unused study drug and containers will be returned to the 
investigational pharmacy for disposal.  
Phone Calls:   Participants and their study partner will be contact[CONTACT_713435].   
            End- of-Treatment A ssessments (Visit 5 ):  Final outcome assessments will be complete d 
during week 24 visit/ Visit [ADDRESS_971045] of identical procedures to the baseline assessments (see 
above):  1) Cognitive testing at the KU Alzheimer and Memory  Program (1  hour ), 2) FDG PET scanning 
in the radiology department (1.5 hours), and 3) GCRC visit for a blood draw and lumbar puncture (2 
hours).  In addition the participant will have a physical/ neurological examination, safety laboratory 
sampling, vital signs, concurrent medications and adver se events. The participant will return all 
remaining study drug and containers at this visit. No additional medication will be dispensed.  
 End- of-Study Visit:   Participants will return two weeks  after completing  the R(+)PPX treatment 
for a final physical a nd neurological exam and review of adverse events.   
  
Data analysis  
Primary Aim: Safety  
 Subject safety is the primary variable and item of greatest concern in this study. The extensive 
dosing experience with R(+)PPX in ALS subjects, many of whom have mil d dementia, combined with 
its lack of detectable D2 dopamine receptor activity in vivo  at 300 mg/day dosing, support its safety in 
probable AD subjects. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_713436] .  The frequency and severity of adverse events will 
be examined and their potential causal relationship to the study drug (as determined by [CONTACT_7357]) will be assessed (the adverse events related to Mirapex [pramipexol e] are listed in table 1 of 
appendix) .  This information will be used to guide dose selection and inform a more definitive safety 
and efficacy study.  Additionally, c ognitive performance data will be acquired  every two months to 
assess the  cognitive trajec tory to explore possible dose -related changes in cognitive decline over the 6 
months of intervention.   
 
Exploratory Aims  
Oxidative stress  
 Isoprostanes are stable oxidative products of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oxidative stress will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_713437] R(+)PPX. A very sensitive LC -MS assay will be used. Serum and CSF 
PPX levels will also be assayed by [CONTACT_29864] -MS.  To assess change in isoprostane levels with treatment, we 
will compare baseline (pre -treatment) and 6-month (post -treatment) isoprostane levels using a paired t -
test.  We hypothesize that isoprostane levels  will be reduced after 6  months of R(+)PPX treatment.    
 
2-FDG PET  
 Changes in ce rebral glucose metabolism as a proxy for mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_713409] a period of several months dosing with R(+)PPX at 300 mg/day. Multiple 
regions will be compared, with particular attention paid to hippocampus. The sta tistical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_713410], et al [31] will be used. Regional FDG uptake will be compared pre - and 
post-PPX dosing. Correlations will also be sought with assays of oxidative stress reduction, to see if 
greater reductions in brain oxidative stress (reflected by [CONTACT_713438]) are reflected 
in elevations in cortical 2 -FDG.  
 
Conclusions  
 An abundance of compelling evidence supports the early appearance of oxidative stress as a 
pathogenic event in AD. Oxidative stress is elevated in brains of persons with pre -AD condition of MCI 
and in transgenic mice expressing familial AD genes  prior to the am yloidosis seen in these models. Our

  studies in the mitochondrial transgenic cybrid model of AD supports mtDNA as a contributor to AD 
oxidative stress and beta amyloid production. In toto , reduction of oxidative stress early in the course of 
AD should reduc e the trajectory of neurodegeneration.  
 The sponsor  studied S( -) and R(+) PPX in his laboratory beginning in 1997 and has clinically 
tested R(+) pramipexole in ALS subjects under a physician -sponsor IND since 2004. R(+)PPX is now 
commercially licensed and under separate development for treating ALS by [CONTACT_713439]. 
R(+)PPX is a brain and mitochondrially concentrated antioxidant that can be safely administered to 
humans at daily doses up to 300 mg/day and has no detectable DA receptor activity in vivo . At this 
dose many subjects achieved trough steady -state PPX levels of >1 µM, predicting brain levels of >6 µM 
that are clearly in the ROS scavenging and neuroprotective levels. R(+)PPX at 300 mg/day 
substantially improves the course of ALS in short -term studies and will enter Phase 3 testing later this 
year.  
 The present application seeks to introduce R(+)PPX treatment to subjects with early AD. In this 
protocol the subjects will undergo careful dose escalation from 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day R(+)PPX 
over [ADDRESS_971046] regular serum, combined with baseline and late treatment spi[INVESTIGATOR_190873], assayed for isoprostanes as measures of oxidative stress. Serum and spi[INVESTIGATOR_713411] [PPX]. As a measure of cerebral metabolism,  brain 2 -FDG PET scans will be obtained at 
baseline and after several months of dosing with 300 mg/day R(+)PPX.  
 The goal of the present study is to determine if R(+)PPX can be administered in high doses to 
probable AD subjects, and if so, whether oxidativ e stress is reduced and cerebral metabolism is 
increased. Hopefully the results from this study will justify the cost of a larger early efficacy study in 
probable AD.  
 
Data Management  
The KU Alzheimer and Memory Program currently uses an  electronic databa se system, called 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) , for much of its data management needs.  REDCap was 
developed by [CONTACT_50222], with collaboration from a consortium of institutional partners, for electronic collection and management of r esearch and clinical trial data. This secure system is hosted 
by [CONTACT_713440] (CRMDA) at the University of Kansas 
Lawrence (KU-L) campus .  The CRMDA hosts a KU -L Information Technology -controlled, HIPAA -
certified REDCap  database server on which project data will be stored. The REDCap system provides 
secure, web -based applications  that have  an intuitive interface for users to enter data and  real time 
validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time  of entry. These systems offer 
easy data manipulation with audit trails and an automated export mechanism to common statistical 
packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus). REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA -Security 
guidelines and all web -based info rmation transmission is encrypted. REDCap is used at many 
institutions and currently supports > 170 academic/non -profit consortium partners on six continents and 
13,000 research end -users ( www.project -redcap.org ).  Brad Amstein, a member of the Alzheimer and 
Memory Program at KUMC , is responsible for  working with the CRMDA and the REDCap system to 
design  the database, its forms, the data entry process, and reports related to adverse events and 
pertinent safety data for this research study.   
 
Data Safety  and Monitoring Plan
  
All adverse event s (AE’s) will be  reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_713412] a timely fashion. The study 
coordinator will enter the AE data from the source documentation into REDCap within  [ADDRESS_971047]’s 
Committee according to reporting guid elines.  
 A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB, see DSMB charter attached below) will meet quarterly to 
review AE ’s and the overall safety of the ongoing trial.  The DSMB is composed of three experienced 
clinicians: Maral Mouradian , MD from the Robert W ood Johnson Medical School , Un Kang , MD from 
R(+) pramipexole in Alzheimer ’s Disease   James P. Bennett, Jr. M.D., Ph.D. -Sponsor  
2/18/[ADDRESS_971048] access to de-identified partic ipant medical records and other study -related  
records. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor (s) to ensure that  any problems detected 
in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  Personal contact [CONTACT_713441].  
 
The DSMB will perform a quarterly review of lab safety  data, results of physical/ neurological 
assessments  and s ubject adverse event/SAE reports. The DSMB can advise and recommend 
temporary or permanent withdrawal of a subject or that the entire stud y be placed on hold or 
terminated.  
 All grade 2 and above AE ’s according to CTCAE v3.[ADDRESS_971049] of each AE grade 2 or higher (by [CONTACT_3989] v3.0) will be generated fr om REDCap.   Each AE listed will include the grade, the type of event, and the potential 
relationship of the AE to the study intervention.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_133203] 24 hours by [CONTACT_713442]’s grade 3 or higher.   Should a study participant experience an AE in any category rated 3 or greater according to CTCAE v3.0, that individual will be removed from the study immed iately.  
Should three  or more subjects  (15% of target enrollment)  have AE’s in any category that is grade 3 or 
higher according to CTCAE v3.0 that are possibly or probably related to study intervention , the study 
will be terminated.

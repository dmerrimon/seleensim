Intervention
for
Alcohol
Use
and
Sexual
Violence
in
College
Students
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
June
29,
2023
Study
Protocol
A
randonmized
control
trial
to
assess
the
full
trial
protocol
and
to
generate
estimates
of
multi-tar get
intervention
efficacy
compared
to
an
alcohol
use
reduction
TM
intervention.
This
aim
will
also
explore
gender
and
SV
exposure
as
potential
moderators
of
the
intervention’ s
effects.
Scientific
Premise:
Data
from
Aim
2
student
participants
will
be
used
to
systematically
review
message
content
and
decision
trees
by
[CONTACT_887835].
Study
procedures
will
also
be
reviewed
and
revised
using
data
obtained
from
campus
faculty/staf f
during
Aim
2.
The
pi[INVESTIGATOR_887830]-tar get
TM-delivered
intervention
among
college
students
seeking
care
from
campus
health
centers.
We
will
also
begin
to
explore
two
hypotheses,
that
the
multi-tar get
intervention
will
show:
1)
greater
decrease
in
alcohol
use
than
the
alcohol
use
reduction
condition
and
2)
greater
increase
in
the
use
of
SV
harm
reduction
behaviors
than
the
alcohol
use
reduction
control
condition.
Intermediate
outcomes
of
SV
harm
reduction
behavior
knowledge
and
self-ef ficacy
will
also
be
assessed.
Exploratory
analysis
will
be
conducted
to
examine
potential
moderation
effects
of
gender
and
SV
history
on
the
intervention’ s
effectiveness.
To
achieve
this
aim,
we
will
recruit
[ADDRESS_1242502]
of
the
multi-tar get
TM
intervention.
Following
intervention
completion,
a
sub-group
of
participants
will
be
invited
to
participate
in
semi-structured
interviews
to
elicit
feedback
on
their
experiences
participating
in
the
intervention.
Setting:
This
phase
of
the
intervention
will
continue
to
build
on
existing
relationships
from
[CONTACT_887838] ’s
campus
health
center
work
(See
stakeholder
letter
of
support).
Student
recruitment,
eligibility
requirements,
screening
and
consent
procedures
will
be
as
described
in
Aim
2
(the
addition
of
recruitment
sites
will
be
used,
as
needed,
to
achieve
the
proposed
sample
size).
Eligible
students
will
complete
baseline
measures
and
be
randomized
via
computer
to
the
intervention
(multi-tar get
SV/alcohol
use
messaging)
or
control
(alcohol
use
reduction
messaging
alone)
condition.
To
examine
potential
moderators
of
intervention
effect,
stratified
randomization
will
be
used
to
ensure
an
equal
distribution
of
students
by
[CONTACT_887836] .
Intervention
condition:
The
multi-tar get
intervention
will
use
a
similar
model
to
the
alcohol
use
reduction
intervention
developed
by
[INVESTIGATOR_124].
Suffoletto.13-15
Students
will
be:
1)
queried
via
TM
prior
to
planned
drinking
days
regarding
both
alcohol
use
and
SV
harm

goal
setting;
2)
provided
with
goal
reminders
during

period;
and
3)
assessed
for

and
given

following

tailoring
based
on

is
anticipated,
and
will
be
developed
and
modified
with
feedback
obtained
during
Aim
1

groups
and
from

Gender -based
tailoring
will
likely
include
addressing
risks/fears
that
are
associated
with
or
specific
to
different
sex/gender
categories
(e.g.
risk
of
pregnancy
for
women,
fear
of
being
accused
of

among
men,
gender -specific
statistics).

is
anticipated
to
include

regarding

while

history
tailoring
will
remain
focused
on
universal
education
regarding
consent,
and
risk
reduction
techniques
such
as
alcohol
use
reduction
and
use
of
social
support
mechanisms
to
monitor
behavior
while
drinking
(e.g.
planning
with
friends
how
the
group
will
get
home
after
a
night
out).
Control
condition:
The
control
condition
will
be
the
TM-delivered
alcohol
use
reduction
intervention
developed
by
[INVESTIGATOR_124].
Suffoletto.13-15
This
intervention
has
been
tested
in
young
adults
(age
18-25)
recruited
from
Emer gency
Department
and
college
settings,
and
will
be
used
to
provide
an
attention
control
group
for
efficacy
testing.
Prior
to
typi[INVESTIGATOR_887832],
individuals
planning
a
drinking
event
are
prompted
to
consider
committing
to
a
drinking
limit
goal,
i.e.:
“Would
you
be
willing
to
set
a
goal
to
drink
less
than
X
drinks
when
drinking?”.
Based
on
willingness
to
commit
to
the
goal,
a
feedback
message
is
provided.
During
typi[INVESTIGATOR_887833],
individuals
receive
a
goal
reminder .
The
following
day,
the
program
provides
goal
success/failure
feedback
or
drinking
quantity
feedback.
For
example,
those
occasions
where
an
individual
committed
to
a
drinking
limit
goal
triggers
either
messages
to
reinforce
goal
successes
or
reframe
goal
failures.
When
an
individual
did
not
commit
to
a
drink
limit
goal,
they
are
provided
feedback
based
on
alcohol
quantity
(e.g.
abstinence
feedback,
high
risk
drinking
feedback).

time
point
three
months
following
the
end
of
the
intervention
(T3).
Analysis:
Assessment
of
the
full
trial
protocol
will
be
conducted
using
descriptive
statistics,
including
proportion
of
those
recruited
who
are
willing
to
be
randomized,
proportion
adherent
to
the
intervention
and
control
treatments,
and
proportion
who
are
retained
three
months
post-intervention.
These
estimates
will
be
crucial
to
design
and
success
of
a
larger
R01-scale
study .
In
addition
to
descriptively
assessing
the
full
RCT
protocol,
we
will
conduct
analyses
of
the
specified
exploratory
outcomes,
which
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
full-scale
study .
Each
exploratory
outcome:
1)
number
of
drinking
days
per
month,
2)
number
of
binge
drinking
days
per
month,
3)
use
of
SV
harm
reduction
strategies,
4)
knowledge
of
sexual
violence
and
alcohol
risk,
5)
self-ef ficacy
to
obtain
sexual
consent,
and,
will
be
tested
for
differences
between
the
intervention
and
control
conditions
at
T2
and
T3
using
generalized
linear
modeling.
All
models
will
be
adjusted
for
age,
SV
history ,
and
gender .
Imbalances
between
groups
on
additional
baseline
characteristics
(e.g.,
relationship
status,
residence,
other
substance
use)
will
be
assessed,
and
if
differences
are
noted,
variables
will
be
included
in
multivariable
models.
Following
intention-to-treat
principles,
analyses
will
be
conducted
on
all
who
were
randomized
to
a
condition
regardless
of
degree
to
which
they
interacted
with
the
intervention.
The
estimates
found
in
these
analyses,
including
baseline
prevalence
estimates
and
confidence
intervals,
will
be
used
as
the
basis
for
sample
size
considerations
in
a
larger
R01-scale
study .
Due
to
the
small
sample
size
of
this
pi[INVESTIGATOR_254947] ,
we
do
not
expect
to
be
powered
at∝
of
0.05,
and
will
thus
consider
interactions
terms
at
p<0.[ADDRESS_1242504]
of
missing
data,
we
will
compare
the
primary
models
(maximum
likelihood)
to
full
information
maximum
likelihood
models;
differences
in
results
between
the
two
models
will
be
described.
Participation
biases
and
attrition
analyses
will
be
completed
to
inform
future
study
design.
The
effect
sizes
calculated
from
these
data
will
be
used
to
estimate
sample
size
needed
for
each
outcome
at
of
0.2
and
two-sided∝
of
0.05
for
subsequent
study .
Sample
size
considerations:
Assessing
70
students
per
arm
(total
n=140)
that
have
completed
the
program
and
follow
up
would
provide
sufficient
data
on
the
full
RCT
protocol
across
multiple
campuses
as
well
as
estimates
of
intervention
effects.
Assuming
a
conservative
retention
rate

70%
for
the

post-intervention
follow
up,

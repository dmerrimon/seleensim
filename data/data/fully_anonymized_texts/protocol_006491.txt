Phase of development: 2 
Primary Objective:    
• To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of daily dosing of oral BCX7353 in subjects with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE)  
Secondary Objective:  
• To assess the effectiveness (ie, HAE attack frequency, severity and disease activity over time) of BCX7353 
during long -term administration  
• To evaluate quality of life (QoL) during long- term administration of BCX7353  
• To evaluate subject’s satisfaction with medication during long- term administr ation of BCX7353  
Methodology:  
This is a single -arm, open- label study to evaluate the long- term safety and effectiveness of orally administered 
BCX7353 in subjects with HAE who are expected to derive benefit from an oral treatment to prevent angioedema 
attacks.  
Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study for up to 96 weeks. 
Subjects enrolled under protocol versions 6.0 and 9.0 will receive BCX7353 150 mg administered orally once 
daily (QD).  
Study visits will occu r at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, [ADDRESS_343571] an additional visit to measure alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrog enase 
(LDH), gamma -glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), and total and direct bilirubin 2  weeks (+7 days) after androgen 
discontinuation and before initiating treatment with BCX7353.  
Data from ongoing studies BCX7353- 302 (Phase 3 study), BCX7353- 301 (Phase 3 study) and the current study, 
BCX7353- 204, are reviewed by [CONTACT_281936]7353 data monitoring committee (DMC) at protocol -specified intervals. 
The DMC may also be convened if a new clinically significant safety signal emerges or at other times as requested. The lates t data review was conducted on [ADDRESS_343572] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 7 Study drug will be discontinued for subjects who are deriving no clinical benefit, are intolerant of study drug, or 
experience an unacceptable drug -related adverse event (AE). The study will be discontinued if ongoing 
regulatory or institutional review board/ethics committee approval is withdrawn, or in the event that technical or 
logistical factors prevent the ongoing conduct of the study. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through 
assessments of AEs, laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, hematology,  coagulation and urinalysis), vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations.  
The main study will be comprised of adult subjects (≥  18 years of age); a substudy will be included that allows 
adolescent subjects ≥  [ADDRESS_343573]’s normal standard 
of care. Treatments for angioedema attacks will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034] . 
Patient- reported outcomes will be completed by [CONTACT_281937] -specific Angioedema Quality of Life 
(AE-QoL) questionnair e and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), where validated 
translations are available. Subjects will be asked about time away from work or school. Additional data collection may be conducted by a specialty pharmacy to better understand the subject experience with the study drug during the subject’s participation in the study.

Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety:  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 9 Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_2695], laboratory analyses (clinical c hemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis) , 
vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. An independent DMC will review safety data in accordance with a 
separate DMC Charter. 
Effectiveness:  
Effectiveness will be evaluated by [CONTACT_281939] a ttacks and related details (timing, duration of 
symptoms, anatomical location, treatment), number of days with angioedema symptoms, assessment of attack severity, discontinuations due to lack of efficacy (through Week 48), and number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281893] .  
Patient Reported Outcomes/Quality of Life:  
QoL will be assessed using the AE-QoL questionnaire and subject’s satisfaction with their medication using the 
TSQM . The number of days lost from school and/or work will also be assessed.  
Statistical methods:  
Analysis of Safety:  Safety endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_281940]: with treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs); who discontinue due to a TEAE; who experience a 
treatment -emergent serious adverse event (SAE); who experience a Grade 3 or 4 TEAE; who experience a 
treatment -emergent, treatment -related AE consistent with a drug rash (eg,  maculopapular rash, papular rash); and 
who experience Grade  3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities.  
AEs wi ll be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term (PT) and 
system organ classification (SOC). The occurrence of TEAEs will be summarized using MedDRA PT, SOC, and severity. In addition to severity, AEs and SAEs will be summarized based on  Investigator  assessment of 
relationship to study drug.  
Time to discontinuation due to a TEAE and time to development of drug- related  Investigator -identified rash 
event of special interest (EOSI) will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. For subjects with a 
drug- related  Investigator -identified rash EOSI, clinical and laboratory findings will be summarized as well as the 
proportion of subjects who successfully continued therapy following onset of rash.  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs, weight, and clinical laboratory results will be presented by [CONTACT_15449]. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded and flagged automatically with a reference range scale. The number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing treatment -emergent graded toxicities will be summarized. Laboratory 
toxicity shifts from baseline to the worst post- baseline value as well as the last visit will be summarized. The 
number and percentage of subjects who have elevations in ALT, AST, or bilirubin abnorm alities in relation to 
fold above ULN will be summarized according to the US Food and Drug Administration’s Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation on Drug- Induced Liver Injury Guidance for Industry.  
Clinically significant abnormal ECG findings will be summarized  by [CONTACT_15449]. Changes from baseline in ECG 
parameters will also be summarized by [CONTACT_15449]. The number and proportion of subjects with clinically important absolute and change from baseline thresholds in QTcF will be summarized.  
Analysis of Effective ness:  Effectiveness endpoints will be analyzed by [CONTACT_281941], durability of response, number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms, angioedema attack medication administrations, discontinuations due to  lack of efficacy, and disease severity. The 
durability of response assessment will be based on attack rate trend over time.  
Additional related details of HAE attacks (e .g., symptoms, anatomical location, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency room 
visits, attack severity, attack duration) and number of days lost from work and/or school due to attacks will be 
listed and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
No formal tests of hypotheses will be conducted.  
Quality of Life Analyses:  The baseline, follow -up, and change from baseline in the domain scores of the 
AE-QoL as well as the composite score of each instrument will be calculated and summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. Individual items will be analyzed to understand their contribution to the domain sub -scores. A TSQM 
global satisfaction score will be calculated as validated. Data on the global score as well as relevant subscales will be listed and summarized.

 19 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 -esterase inhibitor (C1 -INH) deficiency is an autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_281895], pharynx, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, genitals, and extremities (Longhurst and Cicardi 2012) . The frequency 
of attacks varies between subjects, from rarely in some patients to every few days in others. 
Angioedema attacks may or may not be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_216020] a stimulus (such as stress, trauma, or 
estrogen) and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_281896], with symptoms subsiding gradually over the following 
3 to 5 days  (Zuraw and Christiansen 2011) . Oropharyngeal swelling can be life-threatening 
(Bork, Hardt et al. 2012) , while attacks in other sites, including limbs, genitalia, face and 
intestines, can be painful, disabling, and disfiguring, and have a significant impact on functionality and quality of life (QoL) (Lumry, Castaldo et al. 2010) . Although mortality risk 
from asphyxiation is much higher in undiagnosed patients with HAE, deaths still occur in diagnosed pat ients with access to care at centers of excellence (Bork, Hardt et al. 2012) . 
Extensive evidence from animal models and clinical studies supports the role of bradykinin (BK) as the principal mediator of the signs and symptoms that c haracterize attacks of HAE  (Kaplan 
2010, Zuraw and Christiansen 2011) . Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease integral to the contact 
[CONTACT_84239]  (Saxena, Thompson et al. 2011 ). Kallikrein circulates in plasma as a 
zymogen, prekallikrein (PKK), bound to one of its main substrates, high- molecular -weight 
kininogen (HK). During contact [CONTACT_84188], PKK is cleaved by [CONTACT_281942], forming the active protease kallikrein. Kallikrein in turn cleaves HK, producing BK ( Kaplan and 
Ghebrehiwet 2010) . The activation of the BK B2 receptor by [CONTACT_281943], increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction, all of which lead to the tissue swelling that characterizes HAE  (Kaplan 2010) .  
BCX7353 is a potent, synthetic, second- generation small molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. 
In contrast to parenterally administered options commercially available for prophylaxis against HAE attacks, inhibition of kallikrein with an orally bioavailable small molecule such as BCX7353 offers the advantage of oral administration. 
5.2. Findings for BCX7353 
The principal results of non- clinical, clinical pharmacology, PK, clinical safety and efficacy 
studies of BCX7353 are described in the BCX7353  Investigator's brochure (IB).  
Two Phase [ADDRESS_343587] results reported 
for the primary analysis.  Study BCX7353-302 Part 1  results  are summarized below.  Study 
BCX7353-301 had a safety profile and similar efficacy as Study BCX7353-302 and will not be 
individually discussed below. 
5.2.1. Summary of Study BCX7353-302 
BCX7353-302 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, 3- part 
study in subjects with Type I or II HAE. The primary objective of Part 1 of the study was to 
determine the efficacy of prophylactic BCX7353 150 and 110 mg administered or ally once daily 
(QD) for [ADDRESS_343588] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 20 In Part 2, all subjects received active treatment with BCX7353 from Weeks 25 through 48, and 
Part 3 of the study extends treatment with BCX7353 through 96 weeks . Results for Part 1 are 
summarized herein.  
Overall, a total of 160 subjects were screened, 121 subjects were randomized (stratified by [CONTACT_281944], < 2 vs. ≥ 2 per 28 days), and 120 randomized subjects (99%) were treated. 
Of these, 108 subjects completed 24 weeks of study drug dosing in Part 1: 37 of 40 BCX7353 150 mg subjects (93%), 37 of 41 BCX7353 110 mg subjects (90%), and 34 of 39 placebo subjects (87%). 
The mean baseline rate was 2.98 attacks per month. The majority of subjects (70%) had  
≥ 2 attacks per month at baseline, and the attack frequency was generally well distributed across the 3 treatment groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of  Investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during 
dosing in the entire 24- week treatment period. This study achieved its primary endpoint for both 
dose levels, with the 150 and 110 mg doses reducing HAE attacks by 44% (p < 0.001) and 30% (p  = 0.024), respectively, vs. placebo. The attack rate per [ADDRESS_343589] 4 weeks and stable over the entire 24-week duration of Part 1. 
Secondary endpoints (change from baseline in the angioedema quality of life questionnaire 
[AE-QoL], number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms, and r ate of  
Investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the effective dosing period [beginning on Day 8 
through Week 24]) were analyzed using hierarchical testing. Results for the first secondary 
endpoint, AE-QoL, were not statistically significant vs. placebo for either treatment group; therefore, inferential statistical testing was not performed on the descending secondary efficacy endpoints. 
BCX7353 significantly reduced the use of standard of care acute attack medication per 28 days 
vs. placebo by 53.6% (p < 0.001) for 150 mg and 46.3% (p < 0.001) for 110 mg. In responder 
analyses, 58%, 50%, and 23% of subjects receiving 150 mg BCX7353 had a ≥ 50%, ≥ 70% or 
≥ 90% reduction in their HAE attack rates compared to baseline vs. 25%, 15%, and 8% of placebo subjects,  p = 0.005, p = 0.002, and p = 0.073 respectively.  
Administration of BCX7353 at doses of 150 and 110 mg QD for 24 weeks was safe and generally well tolerated.  
Overall 81.7% of subjects experienced a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) on study: 
85.0% of 150 mg subjects, 82.9% of 110 mg subjects, and 76.9% of placebo subjects; 39.5% of BCX7353-treated subjects and 33.3% of placebo subjects experienced a drug- related TEAE. 
Five subjects discontinued study drug due to TEAEs: 1 (2.5%) on 150 mg, 3 (7.3%) on 110 mg, 
and 1 (2.6%) on placebo. No subjects on [ADDRESS_343590] on 110 mg (2.4%), and 3 subjects on 
placebo (7.7%) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) on study; none of these events were drug related. All drug- related TEAEs were mild to moderate on placebo and in the 150 mg 
group, and the majority of TEAEs in the 110 mg group were mild to moderate; 3/41 (7.3%) 110-mg subjects experienced Grade [ADDRESS_343591] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 21 been exposed to androgens had Grade 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation and Grade 3 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation without symptoms, which resolved after 
discontinuing study drug. 
The most common TEAEs across all arms were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and vomiting. Overall, 
50.0% and 41.5% of BCX7353 150 and 110 mg subjects, respectively, had gastrointestinal (GI) 
abdominal-associated TEAEs vs. 35.9% of placebo subjects. There were no drug- related rashes  
(events of special interest [EOSI]).  
Orally administered BCX7353 was a generally safe, well -tolerated, and effective treatment for 
the prevention of HAE attacks in Part 1 of this study, with better efficacy at the 150 mg dose compared to the 110 mg dose, and no increase in safety risk. 
5.2.2. Summary of Interim Data of BCX7353- 204 (Current Study)  
An interim analysis of this current study has been completed.  As of the cut- off date of 
[ADDRESS_343592] completed dosing through Week 48 (30 subjects on BCX7353 110 mg and 73 subjects on BCX7353 150 mg).  
Of the  [ADDRESS_343593] transitioned to BCX7353 150 mg; however, none of these subjects have data available 
from a regularly -scheduled study visit after transitioning to the BCX7353 150 mg dose since 
visits occur only on a quarterly basis. A total of 30 subjects reported 5 TEAEs after switching 
from  BCX7353 110 to 150 mg; all 5 events were assessed by [CONTACT_281945].  
Except for race and ethnicity, the safety population was generally quite diverse. The mean age 
was 40.3 years (range 12 to 72 years), and most subjects were white (84.6%) and non-Hispanic (93.0%). Overall 10 adolescent subje cts (4.4%) ≥12 to 17 years of age and 5 elderly 
subjects (2.2%) ≥ 65 years of age were enrolled in the study.  
Overall, oral treatment with  BCX7353 150 and 110 mg QD was safe and generally well 
tolerated. No new safety signals were identified, safety risks were consistent with the risks 
previously noted in the Phase 2 proof-of-concept Study 203 and consistent with safety seen in 
the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] 302 and the Phase 3 Study 301 conducted in Japan. Across both dose groups the mean (range) exposure to study drug was 282.7 (11 to 540) days. Safety monitoring 
revealed no cardiac, renal, hematologic or neurologic safety concerns.  Vital signs and ECG 
findings during the course of the study were unremarkable and consistent with normal variability.  
Fifty -nine subjects (26.0%) prematurely discontinued study drug; 57 subjects (25.1%) 
discontinued study drug before [ADDRESS_343594] common reasons for discontinuation of study drug were perceived lack of efficacy (12.3%) and laboratory 
abnormalities or TEAEs (8.4%). Overall, more subjects treated with  BCX7353 110 mg 
compared to  BCX7353 150 mg discontinued study drug due to perceived lack of efficacy; 17 of 
100 subjects (17.0%) vs. 11 of 127 subjects (8.7%). Overall, 19 subjects (8.4%) discontinued study drug due to TEAEs; 6 (6.0%) and 13 subjects (10.2%) in the BCX7353 [ADDRESS_343595] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 22 dose groups, respectively. TEAEs leading to discontinuation in > [ADDRESS_343596] were ALT increased 
(4 subjects [1.8%]), upper abdominal pain (3 subjects [1.3%]), vomiting (2 subjects [0.9%]), 
AST increased (2 subjects [0.9%]), hepatic enzyme increased (2 subjects [0.9%]), and liver function test (LFT) abnormal (2 subjects [0.9%]).  
The majority of subjects (91.0% and 90.6% of subjects in the BCX7353 110 and 150 mg dose 
groups, respectively) had at least [ADDRESS_343597] frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (30.8%), headache (17.6%), abdominal pain (13.2%), and diarrhea (13.2%).  
 
Long term prior androgen use of ≥ [ADDRESS_343598] incidence of  liver -related  TEAEs, 
but not other types of TEAEs. Subjects who discontinued androgens in the 2 weeks prior to initiating  BCX7353 (n = 40)  experienced  liver -related  TEAEs in the investigations SOC more 
frequently than subjects who discontinued androgens ≥ 2 weeks before 
initiating  BCX7353 (n = 113) or those subjects  who had never used androgens (n = 74) . In thes e 
groups, ALT increased,  25.0% vs. 2.7% and  1.4%, respectively; AST increased 17.5% vs. 2.7% 
and 1.4%, respectively; hepatic enzyme increased, 2.5% vs.  0.9% and 0, respectively; LFT 
abnormal, 5.0% vs. 0 and 0; and transaminase increased, 2.5% vs. 0 and 0. 
 
Overall, 49.8% of subjects had at least 1 TEAE assessed as drug- related by [CONTACT_16032] (ie, 
TEAEs possibly, probably, or definitely related  to study drug). Most TEAEs were Grade 1 (mild) 
or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. Overall, 15.0% of subjects experienced a Grade [ADDRESS_343599] common Grade 3 or  Grade 4 TEAEs were HAE (attacks) (3.5%), ALT 
increased (2.6%), hepatic enzyme increased (0.9%), LFT abnormal (0.9%), and pneumonia 
(0.9%). All other Grade [ADDRESS_343600] each. Overall, long term prior 
androgen use of ≥ 5 years and discontinuation of androgens within 2 weeks of BCX7353 initiation was correlated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 or Grade  4 liver- related 
TEAEs.    
 
Overall, 13.2% of subjects experienced a treatment -emergent SAE.  Treatment -emergent  SAEs 
that occurred in > [ADDRESS_343601] were HAE attacks (12 subjects [5.3%]) and medical observation 
(3 subjects [1.3%]). Three subjects (1.3%) experienced 4 treatment emergent SAEs assessed by 
[CONTACT_281946]; G3  gastroenteritis and Grade 2 hepatic enzyme 
increased (n = 1), G3  abnormal LFT (n = 1), and G3  abdominal pain (n = 1). The  2 subjects 
with the treatment -emergent  SAEs of gastroenteritis, hepatic enzyme increased, and abnormal 
LFT discontinued study drug. No subjects experienced a TEAE that led to death.  
Overall, 27 subjects (11.9%) interrupted study drug due to TEAEs. The most common TEAE 
that led to study drug interruption was HAE (attack) in 5 subjects (2.2%). Overall, TEAEs in the 
GI SOC led to study drug interruption in the greatest number of subjects; 8 subjects (6.3%) treated with  BCX7353 150 mg and 2 subjects (2.0%) treated with BCX7353 110 mg. Overall, 
6 subjects (2.6%) discontinued study drug due to a GI TEAE; 2 subjects (2.0%) and 4 subjects (3.1%) in the BCX7353 110 and 150 mg dose groups, respectively.  
 
For this study, nonserious treatment- emergent rashes were considered EOSIs for   Investigator 
reporting purposes. Overall, 8 subjects (3.5%) had rash EOSIs assessed by [CONTACT_281947]- specific urticaria and brief epi[INVESTIGATOR_281897]. A total of [ADDRESS_343602] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 23 to BCX7353 and consistent with delayed-type drug hypersensitivity, i.e. a diffuse maculo-
papular rash with pruritus but no systemic or mucosal symptoms. These rashes were consistent 
with those reported in prior studies, resolving quickly with no reoccurrence with study drug continuation or re- initiation (if drug was held).  
 
GI events were considered AEs of interest; however, they were not considered EOSIs for  Investigator reporting purposes. Overall, 105 subjects (46.3%) expe rienced a GI abdominal 
TEAE and 6 subjects (2.6%) discontinued due to a GI abdominal event. The most common GI 
abdominal TEAEs were diarrhea (13.2%), abdominal pain (13.2%), and nausea (7.9%). No dose 
response was observed. Most events were Grade 1 or Grad e 2 in severity. Two subjects (0.9%) 
experienced [ADDRESS_343603] common abnormality was ALT increased. The majority of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities were Grade 1 or 2; however, 13 subjects (5.7%) 
experienced a treatment -emergent  Grade [ADDRESS_343604] dose of BCX7353; [ADDRESS_343605] stopped androgens < [ADDRESS_343606] had synthetic dysfunction or evidence of hepatitis. 
Subjects were mostly asymptomatic, although a few subjects had abdominal symptoms that 
overlapped with the GI symptoms reported with BCX7353 treatment; n o subject had signs or 
symptoms of acute hepatitis. The Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations in the 13 subjects were primarily 
laboratory abnormalities without clinical symptoms. All 13 subjects improved or 
recovered,  5 subjects while continuing on BCX7353; 2 subjects subsequently discontinued study 
drug for unrelated reasons (perceived lack of efficacy in both subjects). A total of 15 subjects had 
postbaseline ALT > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN; 2 subjects with nontreatment emergent 
ALT values). Of the subjects who had stopped androgens within the previous 2 weeks before initiating  BCX7353, the incidence of subjects with ALT > 3 × ULN was 32.5%. Of the subjects 
with ≥ 5 years of androgen use, the incidence of subjects with ALT > 3 × ULN was 13.0%. One subject had a bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN although no subject had a Grade [ADDRESS_343607] had a concurrent elevation in bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN and ALT or AST > 3 × ULN. No subject met the criteria for Hy’s law during the study.  
 
In summary, BCX7353 wa s safe and generally well tolerated with no new safety signals 
observed. 
Subjects treated with  BCX7353 110 or 150 mg QD had durably low attack rates, with no 
evidence for the development of tolerance to  BCX7353. After 1 month of treatment, the 73 
subjects in the BCX7353 150 mg dose group who received BCX7353 through Week 48 had a 
mean (SD) attack rate of 1.18 (1.40) attacks per month. The mean rate of attacks held relatively 
steady during Months 2 to 12: 1.01 (1.26) attacks per month in Month 6 and 0.81 (1.03) attack per month in Month 12.  
The proportion of days with angioedema symptoms was generally similar for both dose groups 
and declined over time: during Month 1 the median proportion of days with symptoms was 7.1%; during Month 6 the median proportion of days with symptoms was 3.6%; and during Month 12 the median proportion of days with symptoms was 0.0%.   
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343608] 24 weeks of study, 22 subjects (9.8%) treated with BCX7353 remained attack 
free, with slightly more subjects in the  BCX7353 150 mg group (11.2%) remaining attack free 
compared with the BCX7353 110 mg dose group (8.0%). During the first 48 weeks of study, 
8 subjects (5.0%) treated with BCX7353 remained attack free, with slightly more subjects in 
the BCX7353 150 mg group (5.8%) remaining attack free compared with the BCX7353 110 mg 
dose group (3.6%).  
A total of 28 of 227 subjects (12.3%) discontinued treatment in the first 48 weeks of the study 
due to perceived lack of efficacy, with fewer subjects discontinuing treatment in 
the BCX7353 150 mg dose group compared to the 110 mg dose group (11 [8.7%] vs. 17 [17.0%], respectively). Twenty of the 28 subjects who discontinued study drug due to a 
perceived lack of efficacy discontinued prior to Week 12. The proportions of subjects who 
discontinued BCX7353 due to a perceived lack of efficacy was higher for those subjects who had reported either that they had discontinued androgen use < [ADDRESS_343609] dose 
of BCX7353 (20.0%) or had used androgens for ≥ 10 years (18.2%), compared to subjects who 
had never used androgens (12.2%). Twelve of the 28 (42.9%) subjects  who 
discontinued BCX7353 due to a perceived lack of efficacy had used androgen therapy for ≥ [ADDRESS_343610] dose of BCX7353. Eight of the 28 (28.6%) subjects who 
discontinued BCX7353 due to a perceived lack of efficacy  and had discontinued androgen 
therapy < [ADDRESS_343611] dose of BCX7353.  
The median duration of an attack was shorter for subjects treated with  BCX7353 150 mg vs. 
110 mg (median of 17.7 vs. 28.0 hours). This difference was independent of attack location 
(ie, abdominal-only, peripheral-only, and mixed).   
Overall, subjects assessed about 34% of their attacks as negligible or mild in severity with approximately 60% of attacks resulti ng in no restriction or a slight restriction of daily activities. 
Overall, approximately 61% of attacks had no or a slight effect on the subject’s appearance. There were no notable differences between the dose groups.  
Of the  on-study adjusted attacks, 85.4% were treated with any medication and 81.6% with SOC-
Rx. The most commonly used SOC -Rx were Berinert  and Firazyr. There were no notable 
differences between the dose groups.   
Subject reported outcomes were assessed serially using the AE -QoL and TSQM questionnaires 
administered at study visits. MCID improvements (≥ 6 point improvement) in mean change from 
baseline AE -QoL total and all domain scores were observed at Week 4: an improvement of 8.9 
(19.0) and 11.2 (17.2) points from baseline in mean (SD) AE -QoL total score for the 110 and 
150 mg dose groups, respectively. The observed improvement in AE -QoL was durable, holding 
steady  or further improving at all subsequent assessments; for example, at Week 48, the mean 
(SD) change from baseline improvements in AE-QoL total score were 12.8 (16.0) and 14.7 
(17.8) points for the 110 and 150 mg dose groups, respectively. Greater than MCID  mean (SD) 
improvements in change from baseline were observed at Week 48 for the domains: functioning, 16.1 (26.5) point improvement; fatigue/mood, 9.3 (19.0) point improvement; fear/shame, 19.9 (22.2) point improvement; and nutrition, 9.4 (20.6) point improvement.  
The TSQM scores improved from baseline (assessment of the subject’s usual medication prior to 
starting  BCX7353) to Week 48 on BCX7353 with mean (SD) change from baseline 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 25 improvements of 20.5 (24.7) points in convenience, 7.7 (24.2) points in side effects, 7.2 (29.6) 
points in effectiveness, and 3.6 (28.8) points in global satisfaction.   
In summary, subjects had low rates of attacks during the first month of treatment with BCX7353 that were maintained or improved over the 48 weeks. Subjects treated with     
150 mg of BCX7353 had a median of 6.5% of study days with angioedema symptoms, assessed about 36% of their attacks as negligible or mild in severity, assessed approximately 64% of attacks as resulting in no restriction or a slight restriction of daily activities, and assessed 
approximately 63% of attacks as having no or a slight effect on appearance. Attacks we re 
generally shorter in duration for subjects treated with BCX7353 150 mg compared 
to BCX7353 110 mg, and BCX7353 150 mg QD also improved measures of QoL compared with 
baseline: at Week 48 a mean improvement > MCID in  AE-QoL total score and functioning, 
fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and nutrition domain scores was observed along with improvements 
in all TSQM scores.  
 
5.3. Data Monitoring Committee Review of Ongoing 
Studies  BCX7353 -302, BCX7353 -301 and BCX7353- 204 
Data from ongoing studies BCX7353-302 (Phase 3 study), BCX7353-301 (Phase 3 study) and 
the current study, BCX7353-204, are reviewed by [CONTACT_281936]7353 data monitoring committee 
(DMC) at protocol- specified intervals. The DMC may also be convened  if a new clinically 
significant safety signal emerges or at other times as requested.  
The latest data review was conducted on [ADDRESS_343612] of the world for prevention of angioedema 
attacks in HAE are oral androgens and parenteral C1-INH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In addition, the monoclonal 
antibody lanadelumab was recently approved as prophylactic therapy in some countries. While patient experience has improved with the expansion of approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_98234], an orphan 
disease, a 2013 survey of 245 [LOCATION_002] (US) physicians that treat HAE indicated that their 
perception is that only 40% of their patients are fully satisfied with current HAE treatments  
(Aygoren-Pursun, By[CONTACT_281948]. 2018) . Regular IV infusions of C1-INH for prophylactic use in 
HAE may lead to an increase in complications over time, such as thrombosis, infection, pain, and limited venous access (Shire  2018) . Even patients with HAE with no contraindications to 
androgens and who tolerate prophylactic androgens face long-term risks with continued 
treatment. Therefore, there remains a significant medical need to provide additional HAE 
treatment options that are efficacious, convenient, and well- tolerated.  
BCX7353 is an oral kallikrein inhibitor in development for prophylaxis of HAE Type I and II. 
BCX7353 has activi ty against plasma kallikrein at low nM concentrations that are attainable and 
sustained in humans following oral administration. In both the randomized, double blind, 24-week, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study (BCX7353-302) and the proof-of-concept, 28-day, 
placebo -controlled, Phase 2 study (BCX7353- 203), the rate of angioedema attacks in subjects 
randomized to BCX7353 was statistically significantly lower than in placebo subjects and BCX7353 was safe and generally well -tolerated. Subjects with HAE who have not previously

Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 26 received BCX7353 will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study when, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_14270] , they are expected to derive benefit from an oral treatment to prevent 
angioedema attacks.  
5.4.1. Rationale for Study Design  
This open-label safety study is designed to assess the long- term safety and effectiveness of 
1 dose level (150 mg QD) of BCX7353 in subjects who do not currently use prophylactic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281898]7353. This study offers subjects access to BCX7353 treatment for up to [ADDRESS_343613]. This study will provide additional 
information on the long-term safety and effectiveness of the planned dose (150 mg QD) in US subjects.  
While there are approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281899], including C1-INH infused intravenously or administered subcutaneously, the majority of patients 
globally are not being treated with prophylactic medications and the degree of individual benefit 
varies. Eligible subjects may enroll in the current study if the  Investigator assesses that they may 
benefit from daily administration of BCX7353.  
Acute attacks of angioedema will be treated in accordance with the subject’s normal standard of 
care. As appropriate, subjects will continue to use their prescribed acute attack medication to treat any acute attacks, as well as continue as needed with their approved prophylactic treatment for HAE attacks as prescribed under the medical management plan advised by [CONTACT_9682].  
Efficacy and safety data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies 
(BCX7353-302 and BCX7353-301) and accumulating safety data on subjects enrolled on earlier 
versions of the current study protocol (BCX7353-204) support long- term treatment with 
BCX7353 (Section 5.2).   At the writing of this version of the protocol, regulatory filings to both 
the US and Japan authorities have been completed towards the approval of BCX7353 for 
marketing. 
5.4.2. Rationale for Study Drug Doses and Regimens 
The BCX7353 dosage regimen selected for evaluation in this study is 150 mg BCX7353 
admin istered QD (equivalent to 175 mg QD [SN]).  
In Study BCX7353-203, the HAE attack rate was significantly lower vs. placebo in subjects who 
received daily doses of 125, 250, and 350 mg BCX7353 (SN) and the drug was well- tolerated. 
The plasma drug levels achieved at each dose were generally predictable and had an acceptable level of inter -subject variability.  
Two doses (150 and 110 mg QD) were studied in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 clinical trial (BCX7353 -302) 
and versions of the current study globally (BCX7353-204 Versions 1-5).  Study BCX7353-302, 
achieved its primary endpoint for both dose levels evaluated, with the 150 and 110 mg doses 
reducing HAE attacks by 44% (p < 0.001) and 30% (p = 0.024), respectively, vs. placebo. Orally administered BCX7353 was a safe, gener ally well- tolerated, and effective treatment for the 
prevention of HAE attacks in Part [ADDRESS_343614] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 27 Based on the results of BCX7353-302 of better effic acy and no increase in safety risk at the 
150 mg dose, the 150 mg dose will be assessed in the current study of BCX7353 for the 
prevention of attacks in HAE. 
5.4.3. Study Population Rationale  
The study will be limited to adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age of both sexes. Children <12 
years of age will be excluded from participation in BCX7353 clinical trials until the benefit- risk 
profile in adults and adolescents has been better characterized. Population PK modeling of PK 
data generated to date indicate that weight is a covariate on the bioavailability of BCX7353. 
Simulations of exposures by [CONTACT_281949] a weight of < 40 kg 
is associated with exposures considered significantly higher (ie, > 20%) than those generated from  an adult of [ADDRESS_343615] 40  kg. At a weight of 40 kg, simulated exposure 
was well within the efficacious exposures identified in Study BCX7353-203 that were well-tolerated; therefore, it is anticipated that exposure in adolescent subjects will not exceed 
safe and tolerable exposures in adults. 
In the ongoing BCX7353-[ADDRESS_343616] recently (ie, < 2 weeks prior to starting 
BCX7353) discontinued androgens (BCX7353 IB). Currently the physiological and HAE attack changes that may occur with androgen cessation are not well described. Since androgen use (both current and past) is prevalant in the global HAE community, this protocol will provide data 
to better characterize androgen discontinuation in HAE patients and allow the development of 
guidance for treaters and patients who wish to switch from androgens to BCX7353. In order to reduce the incidence of transaminase elevations on study, subjects will be required to have last used androgens at least [ADDRESS_343617] 50% of the subject population in this study. HAE affects both males and females, although the disease has a greater burden on females, with an increased 
frequency and severity of HAE attacks in women (Bork, Meng et al. 2006, Lumry, Castaldo et 
al. 2010) . Estrogen appears to worsen the disease, as evidenced by [CONTACT_281950]-containing therapy is initiated (Bouillet, Longhurst et al. 2008, Caballero, Farkas et al. 2012) . Due to the gender distribution of 
HAE and the influence of hormones on the frequency of attacks, it is considered important to 
include both male and female subjects in this clinical study to gain an assessment of potential safety and population PK differences.  
Although there is no evidence of embryofetal developmental toxicity with BCX7353 in 
reproductive toxicology studies, appropriate precautions are still warranted with respect to 
administering BCX7353 to women of reproductive age, in accordance with International Council 
for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Women of childbearing potential may be enrolled in this 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343618] 
(Section  8.2.1).  
Pregnant women will be excluded from participation in the current study. Additionally, any female subject who becomes pregnant on study will be required to immediately discontinue study drug, and will be followed through the end of the pregnancy.  
5.4.4. Rationale for Allowance and Restriction of Concomitant Medications for HAE 
All subjects must have access to appropriate treatments for the treatment of acute attacks  (ie, 
icatibant, plasma -derived C1-INH [any form]), ecallantide, recombinant C1- INH) . Each subject 
will continue to use their prescribed acute medication to treat any attacks, under the medical 
management plan advised by [CONTACT_9682], throughout the study. This is consistent with guidance documents that strongly support the position that all subjects with C1- INH deficiency 
should have access to medications for treating attacks ( Cicardi, Bork et al. 2012, Zuraw, Banerji 
et al. 20 13). 
While there are approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281900], 
including C1-INH infused intravenously, consensus recommendations do not exist for either a standard of care for prophylactic treatment or a definition of indications for prophylaxis. A guideline published on the management of HAE by [CONTACT_281951] ( Zuraw, 
Banerji et al. 2013) :  
‘The decision about when to use long- term prophylactic treatment ca nnot be made on rigid 
criteria but should reflect the needs of the individual patient. Decisions regarding which 
patients should be considered for long-term prophylaxis should take into account attack frequency, attack severity, comorbid conditions, access to emergent treatment, and patient experience and preference.’   
Subjects may receive prophylactic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, C1 -INH, tranexamic acid, lanadelumab).  
Investigators may make modifications to the dose and schedule of the prophylactic therapy, 
including tapering or discontinuation of dosing, according to the degree of benefit of daily oral 
BCX7353 treatment. Recommended strategies for switching to BCX7353 prophylaxis from another therapy are provided in Section 9.7. 
Androgen use, however, is prohibited within 28 days of the baseline visit and at any time during 
the study to reduce the incidence of transaminase elevations  (see Section  9.7.1).  
5.5. BCX7353 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
Given that BCX7353 is a small molecule kallikrein inhibitor with data available from completed 
Phase 1 single and multiple dose studies, a Phase 2 study in subjects with HAE, and two  ongoing 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies , there is an acceptably low risk of 
severe or serious adverse reactions. Potential risks and findings from nonclinical and clinical studies of BCX7353 are discussed in the Section 6 of the IB (Summary of Data and Guidance for 
the  Investigator ).  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 29 5.6. Benefits of Trial Participation  
Study subjects will receive regular medical care for the duration of the study. Subjects may 
experience a reduction in the number of attacks while receiving BCX7353. BCX7353 produced a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the rate of HAE attacks compared 
to placebo for the primary endpoint in the ITT population of Study BCX7353-302.  The development of BCX7353 may be of benefit to the wider community/patients with HAE.  
5.7. Overall Benefit-Risk Assessment  
The risks from daily oral administration of BCX7353 seen to date in both preclinical and clinical studies were primarily mild, monitorable, and reversible. Overall, the clinical efficacy and safety data support a favorable benefit risk profile for BCX7353.  In the 24- week, adequate, well -
controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_281901] I or II HAE, BCX7353 150 mg QD treatment for 24 weeks versus placebo resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in mont hly HAE attack rate, monthly rate of HAE attacks 
requiring acute rescue therapy, the monthly rate of moderate or severe HAE attacks, and the monthly rate of laryngeal HAE attacks. Results of sensitivity and subgroup analyses of the HAE attack rate were con sistent with those of the primary efficacy analysis. The safety data from 
controlled trials and long- term open -label studies is sufficient to assess the safety of BCX7353 in 
the proposed rare disease HAE population. Important potential risks are delayed- type 
hypersensitivity reactions (rash) and transaminase elevations. Hypersensitivity rash was 
identified as a signal early in development; few events were reported, and these were mild to 
moderate, self -limited, not dose dependent, and resolved with continued dosing without 
recurrence. Increases in ALT/AST were generally transient, asymptomatic, not dose dependent, 
and heavily confounded by [CONTACT_281952]. The overall benefit- risk balance is 
therefore considered to be acceptable.  
6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
6.1. Objectives  
6.1.1. Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of daily dosing of oral BCX7353 in 
subjects with HAE  
6.1.2. Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the effectiveness (ie, HAE attack frequency, severity, and disease activity over time) of BCX7353 during long- term administration  
• To evaluate QoL during long- term administration of BCX7353 
• To evaluate subject’s satisfaction with medication during long- term administration of 
BCX7353 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343619]’s satisfaction with the medication. Based on 
the final results from Part 1 of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy study 
(BCX7353-302), the dose of BCX7353 used in this study is 150 mg QD.  
Subjects may be enrolled once all eligibility criteria and study requirements are met. 
On-treatment study visits will occur at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96. An independent DMC 
has been reviewing the safety data from this study in concert with the accumulating safety information generated across the BCX7353 clinical development program. The DMC met at a 
frequency of  approximately every 12 weeks until a total of approximately 200 subjects across 
the Phase 3 Study, BCX7353-302, and the current study (BCX7353-204) completed [ADDRESS_343620] country globally. A formal meeting of the DMC members will not be required; however, if the data review identifies any concern, the DMC 
members may elect to hold a formal DMC meeting. In addition, the emergence of a new, 
clinically significant safety signal may prompt an ad hoc DMC review. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_343621]’s normal standard of 
care. Treatment for acute attacks of HAE will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Subjects will complete the angioedema quality of life questionnaire (AE- QoL) to assess 
health -related QoL and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) to 
assess their satisfaction with the study medication. Ad ditionally, subjects will be assessed if days 
were lost from school and/or work. 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessments of AEs, laboratory analyses 
(clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis), vital signs, ECGs, and physical 
examinations at the study visits indicated in the schedule of assessments (see  Table 3 ).

8.3.1. Subject Discontinuation from the Study  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary; a subject may withdraw consent to contribute 
additional study information at any point. A subject who withdraws consent or is discontinued 
from study drug (see Section 8.3.2 ) will be requested to attend an end- of-study visit to complete 
all end -of-study evaluations. S ubjects who discontinue the study but will continue to receive 
BCX7353 via another mechanism will have end -of-study assessments performed prior to 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343629]’s medical records (source documents) and the CRF. If 
the reason for subject withdrawal is not known, the subject must be contact[CONTACT_281954], and if so, this must be reported in accorda nce with the procedures 
outlined in Section 12. If at any point in the study, the clinic is unable to contact [CONTACT_281955], according to local clinic standards, the subject will be 
considered lost to follow-up.   
Once subjects have discontinued the study, the Sponsor will no longer provide treatment through the study. Following withdrawal from the study, a subject will be able to receive further 
treatment as recommended by [CONTACT_281956] d according to the accepted standard of 
care.  
8.3.2. Subject Discontinuation from Study Drug  
A subject will be permanently withdrawn from study drug for any of the following bulleted reasons, which will be recorded in the source documents and CRF. When medically feasible, the 
Medical Monitor must be consulted prior to subject discontinuation. In all cases, subjects who 
prematurely and permanently discontinue study drug should complete all scheduled procedures for the end- of-study visit outlined in Table 3 . 
• Emergence of any laboratory abnormality or AE that in the judgment of the  Investigator compromises the ability of the subject to continue study- specific 
procedures or it is considered not to be in the subject’s best interest due to an altered benefit -risk profile  
• Reoccurrence of treatment -emergent AST or ALT elevation > 5  × ULN (confirmed) 
if BCX7353 is restarted after meeting hold criteria as outlined in Section 12.2.2. 
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN combined with either laboratory 
abnormalities indicative of significant hepatic toxicity (ie, meeting Hy’s law, total bilirubin> 2 × ULN OR with an INR > 1.5) or with symptomatology of acute 
hepatitis (ie , severe fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain and 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia [> 5%])  
• Subsequent determination that inclusion/exclusion criteria were not met  
• Intercurrent illness or emergence of a new illness/medical condi tion that would, in the 
judgment of the  Investigator , affect assessments of clinical status to a significant 
degree  
• Subject noncompliance with study drug or to the protocol 
• Subjects with BCX7353- related Grade 3 or 4 rash as described by [CONTACT_12203] (DMID) criteria “skin- mucocutaneous” will be 
discontinued from study, if suspected to be due to BCX7353, and treated according to 
best medical practice. All subjects with a suspected drug rash should undergo specific rash evaluation as described in Section  11.1.12.  A Grade  [ADDRESS_343630]

Subjects will be instructed to maintain approximately the same daily dosing interval between 
study drug doses. If a subject forgets to take the study drug at the correct time, the dose may be 
taken later in the day; however, no more than [ADDRESS_343634] should resume their regular dosing schedule on the next day.  
Subjects will be instructed to bring all drug kits (including both unused and used kit bottles) and 
diaries with them for each study visit. Accountability and adherence will be reviewed at each clinic visit. Subjects do no t need to withhold any doses on clinic days or take a dose in the clinic, 
unless the clinic visit falls during the subject’s normal time of dosing.  
If a specialty pharmacy is used, specialty pharmacy staff may contact [CONTACT_281958]’s participation in the study.  
9.5. Study Drug Dose Modification  
No dose reductions are permitted.  
Study drug interruptions are discussed in Section 12.1.8. 
9.6. Study Drug (Investigational Medicinal Product) Accountability  
Accountability of study drug dispensed and returned (as applicable) will be performed at 
Baseline and at each study visit. Returned study drug bottles and/or kits must be retained and reviewed during monitoring visits by [CONTACT_70585] (CRA) (Section 14.2).  
The  Investigator /pharmacist/pharmacy must maintain accurate records of the disposition of all 
study drugs received from the Sponsor, issued to the subject (including date), and any drug 
destroyed. The Sponsor will supply a specific drug accountability form. At the end of the study, 
information describing study drug supplies (eg, kit numbers) and disposition of supplies for each subject must be provided, signed by [CONTACT_281959], and collected by [CONTACT_2689]. If 
any errors or irregularities i n any shipment of study medication to the site are discovered at any 
time, the Sponsor (and or designee) must be contact[CONTACT_15608]. 
At the end of the study or at other times as agreed by [CONTACT_281960], all study drug not dispensed or administered will either be collected and returned to the Sponsor or destroyed on 
site as dictated by [CONTACT_281961].

 43 10.3. Study  Visits 
Details for all study visits are found in Table 3: Schedule of Assessments. 
10.3.1. Screening Visit  
Written informed consent and assent (as applicable) must be obtained from each subject before 
initiation of any screening assessments or procedures. Each subject will receive a copy of the signed and dated study-specific informed consent form (ICF). Prospective subjects who have 
signed an ICF who are interested in participating in the study will then undergo assessments at a 
screening visit to determine eligibility (as applicable). Signing of the ICF may occur prior to the screening visit, which is defined as the visit where site-conducted screening procedures are performed.  
In the case of time limitations for conduct of the screening visit, a site is permitted to perform 
screening assessments over more than one screening visit.  
Subjects who discontinue androgen prophylaxis at the time of signing informed consent or at the screening visit will also have ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, GGT and total and direct bilirubin measured 2  weeks (+7  days) after androgen discontinuation.  
With Medical Monitor permission, screening may be extended for an additional 42 days (for a total of 70 days) for subjects transitioning from other prophylactic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including those that have AST or ALT elevations > 3  × the ULN at any pre-dose visit.  
Rescreening of ineligible subjects, where there is a reasonable expectation that the subject will become eligible, will be approved or denied on a case-by- case basis by [CONTACT_37956]. Retesting of specific assessments without entirely rescreening a subject may be permitted.  
Subjects who were screen failures on a BCX7353 study may be screened or rescreened for the current study where there is a reasonable expectation that the subject will be eligible.  
A screening failure CRF page will be comp leted for those subjects who do not proceed with 
study dosing, recording the reason for screen failure. 
10.3.2. Baseline Visit (Day 1) 
Subjects who meet all study eligibility criteria, and who agree to participate will be asked to 
return for a scheduled baseline visit (Day  1) within 28 days of the screening visit. Screening may 
be extended with Medical Monitor permission for subjects transitioning from other prophylactic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281909].  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria and HAE medical and medication history will be reviewed to ensure continued subject eligibility prior to dosing.  
After completion of all Baseline assessments as listed in Table 3: Schedule of Assessments, 
study drug should be dispensed (see Section  9.4).  
10.3.3. Week 4 Visit  
Subjects will return to the clinic during Week  4 (study Day 29 ± 2 days).  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343646]’s normal time of dosing.  
Subjects will be reminded to continue to fill out any HAE attacks in their diary and to bring their diary with them to all visits.  
 
10.3.4. Week 12, 24, 48, 72, and [ADDRESS_343647]. Study visits are planned to 
occur at Week  12 (Day 85 ± 2 days), Week  24 (Day 169 ± 6 days), Week  48 (Day 337 ± 6 days), 
Week  72 (Day 505 ± 6 days), and Week  96 (Day 673 ± 6 days).  
Subjects will be reminded to continue to fill out any HAE attacks in their diary and to bring their diary with them to all visits.  
10.3.5. End of Study Visit  
Subjects who discontinue study drug will return to the clinic 3 weeks (21 ± 3 days) after the date 
of their last dose for their end of study or withdrawal assessment. Subjects who discontinue study 
drug must undergo all study-related procedures outlined in Table [ADDRESS_343648] regularly scheduled visit.  
If an AE is ongoing at the end of study visit, additional clinic visit(s) or telephone contact(s) may be warranted (see Section  12.1.2).

The schedule of procedures and assessments to be conducted throughout the study are outlined in Table [ADDRESS_343649] of the procedures/ assessments provided below.  
Even if not provided by [CONTACT_16032], routine and appropriate preventative care such as 
mammograms, cervical and testicular cancer screenings, etc., should be obtained by [CONTACT_281965].  
11.1.  Investigator -Completed Assessments 
Demographic information, including year of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be captured for 
each subject participating in the study at the screening visit. Medical and medication history will 
be captured at the screening visit and updated at baseline.  
Contraceptive methods enabling eligibility will be captured in source documentation at the 
screening visit. Contraceptive methods and/or lifestyle should be reviewed throughout the study 
to ensure they rem ain appropriate for the subject.  
Additionally, subjects will be queried if time was lost from school and/or work, beginning at baseline and at each visit.

All questions on the medical history/medication questionnaire should be completed by [CONTACT_122696] (or designee) from historical source documentation when available, with subject input as necessary to complete the remaining questions. 
11.1.2. Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be conducted at screening. All subsequent physical 
examinations will be abbreviated (i.e., targeted or symptom- directed) to include, at a minimum, 
evaluation of any new signs or symptoms.  
Genitourinary and breast examinations may be omitted when not required by [CONTACT_281967].  
11.1.3. Weight/Body Mass Index

Qualified site personnel must review the ECGs and automated findings for gross abnormalities 
and to review any interval measurements of concern (absolute readings and for post- baseline 
ECGs, a change from baseline). For all ECGs, the cl inical interpretation of the ECG and 
calculated QTcF (if not automated by [CONTACT_281968]) should be recorded directly on a hard copy of the ECGs.

ECGs will be single assessments. ECG readings should be obtained prior to blood sampling.  An ECG should be repeated for a change from baseline in QTcF > 60 msec or a QTcF interval 
> 500 msec.  
11.1.5. Vital Signs

11.1.9. HAE Diagnostic Criteria  
Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of HAE Type I or II who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], are 
expected to benefit from an oral treatment for the prevention of angioedema attacks. A clinical diagnosis of HAE Type I or II is defined as:  
• A C1 esterase inhibitor (C1- INH) functional level below the assay lower limit of normal 
as assessed during the screening period by [CONTACT_281938]  
• Laboratory documentation of historical C1- INH functional level below the assay lower 
limit of normal OR  
• Subjects who currently use plasma derived or recombinant C1- INH based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281903]:  
o SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene mutation known or likely to be associated with HAE Type 1 or 
II as assessed during  the screening period OR  
o A confirmed family history of C1- INH deficiency  
To utilize a family history of C1 INH deficiency to establish an HAE diagnosis for eligibility, the 
Investigator should document this based on either the Investigator’s personal knowledge (ie, if a 
relative of the screening subject is also a patient of the same Investigator/practice) or interaction with medical staff of the treatment facility where the relative receives HAE care, who confirms 
the diagnosis. No historical laboratory documentation on the relative should be collected in the 
source documents. 
11.1.10. Other Laboratory Assessments  
All subjects will have a blood sample for HLA analysis drawn at baseline/Day  1 (or any other 
time point on study if not obtained at baseline). Samples will be sent to a central laboratory for 
analysis. The results will not be communicated back to the  Investigator or subjects because the results are not intended for diagnostic or prognostic purposes and will be used in a research related fashion only. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 49 11.1.11. Pharmacokinetics  
A blood sample for PK analyses will be drawn on adolescent subjects (≥12 to 17 years of age)  at 
Baseline and study visits through Week 12. The time of last study drug dose and time of PK 
blood draw will be recorded in the CRF.  
Instructions for collection, processing, storage, and shipment of PK samples will be provided to 
the clinical site in a separate document.  
11.1.12. Pharmacogenomic Testing  
For subjects who, are willing to participate and sign separate informed consent, possible exploratory pharm acogenomics testing  may be performed. Testing may be undertaken in one or 
more locus/loci if desired by [CONTACT_281970]. Samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis and results will not be returned to sites.  
11.1.13. Rash Assessment  
Because of the potential for a study drug-related rash, all sites should be prepared to report 
details of suspected drug rashes and provide photographs.  
Subjects should be medically evaluated for any diffuse maculopapular rash that could be drug- 
related.  Rashes that resolve rapi[INVESTIGATOR_281911] a protocol deviation. The site must enter the event into EDC as an AE (flagged as an EOSI) and inform the Sponsor Medical Monitor via the EOSI form of all BCX7353- related 
maculopapular rashes (Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  after assessment. If the rash is assessed as not 
maculopapular (eg, urticarial) or not related to BCX7353 (i.e., has a clear alternative etiology), then the rash is reported as an AE, treated per  Investigator judgement, and no further special assessment is required.  
The following assessments must be completed for all subjects with a diffuse maculopapular rash assessed as related to BCX7353 as soon as logistically possible:  
• Full dermatological exam to include the scope of the rash (location), vital signs, and 
mucosal examination. The notes documenting the examination should include 
detailed description of the rash; presence or absence of desquamation; presence or absence of blistering and if present, its extent; presence or absence of mucosal 
involvement and if present, its extent; and any other associated abnormal physical 
findings.  
• Vital signs including temperature 
• High resolution photographs taken to provide both detail regarding the rash (close-up) and details regarding the extent of the rash (whole body or body part). Cameras must be able to provide clear images taken in close proximity to the skin. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_281912] a ruler (centimeter) for scale. Every attempt to protect subject 
anonymity should be made. 
• All detailed clinical information regarding the rash, examination, tre atment and

Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343654] sub jects will not need further evaluation for appropriate diagnosis or treatment. However, 
if laboratory evaluations (i.e. blood safety assessment labs) are done, these should be performed 
through the central lab. If they are performed at a local lab, include a redacted copy of the results or enter the values on the EOSI report. If it is determined by [CONTACT_281971] a biopsy would be appropriate, a redacted copy of the pathology report as part of the EOSI reporting procedure should be sumbited. If the study site cannot perform a biopsy (if indicated) or any of the above mandatory assessments (i.e., photographs), then it is appropriate to refer the subject to a physician who can perform the assessments/biopsy (i.e., a dermatologist). If a non-study physician performs any of the assessments or biopsy, submit the redacted written consultation report. 
Dosing of BCX7353 may continue in subjects experiencing a Grade [ADDRESS_343655] and  Investigator agree. The EOSI form and  any additional information should be 
received by [CONTACT_21411] a timely manner for Sponsor review. The  Investigator’s intention 
regarding BCX7353 dosing (i.e., continuation, temporary interruption or discontinuation) should be clearly stated on the EOSI  form. The Sponsor may discuss the drug rash with the  Investigator 
if there are questions or concerns. 
11.2. Subject -Completed Assessments  
11.2.1. Patient -Reported Outcomes  
The disease -specific questionnaire, AE- QoL, and TSQM will each be administered once at 
baseline, at each visit through Week 96 (or end of treatment), and at the end -of-study visit.

12. ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING  
12.1. Adve rse Events  
AEs will be assessed and recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent through the appropriate follow -up period. Full details on recording and reporting AEs are provided in 
Section  12.1.2. 
12.1.1. Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject. No causal relationship with the study drug or with the clinical study itself is implied. An AE may be an unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the clinical study. Clinically relevant abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory findings (eg, requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or 
resulting in withdrawal from the study) are considered to be AEs. If the diagnostic procedure 
prompts no additional treatment, visits, or monitoring, it will not meet the definition of an adverse event.  
This in cludes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol- specified 
AE reporting period (see Section 12.1) , including medical triggers resulting in an 
HAE attack. Emotional stress will not be considered an AE unless it results in a medical diagnosis or requires medical treatment.  
• Findings from protocol-mandated interventions. This can include laboratory assessments performed in the course of the trial. AEs should only be reported if the 
abnormalities are changes from baseline and are clinically significant as described 
above. 
• Pre-existing medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_281972]-specified AE reporting period. When recording such events on an 
AE/SAE eCRF page, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (eg, “more frequent headaches”).  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 52 An adverse reaction is defined in Article 2(n) of Directive 2001/20/EC as follows: all untoward 
and unintended responses to a study drug/IMP related to any dose administered. The definition 
covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a ca usal relationship 
between the event and the study drug/IMP. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
For the purposes of this protocol, HAE attacks and their associated symptoms will not be defined 
as AEs, e ven if the subject requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. All HAE attacks and associated symptoms 
are reported in the subject diary and are a reflection of the disease under study. The events that 
may trigger a HAE attack such as an infection or trauma are considered A Es and should be 
reported as such. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281913]. These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281914]: 
• Perform a routine control screening for a preexisting illness or to diagnose a suspected illness. In the case of the latter, the symptomatology should be reported as an AE and amended if a diagnosis is confirmed. 
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical condition that has not changed (eg, a joint replacement for which the subject was on a waiting list). 
• Undergo medical observation due to HAE (eg, admission after a routine dental procedure in an HAE patient). 
• Undergo medical observation without the occurrence of an AE due to standard of care in the region or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Surgical procedures should not be reported as AEs. The condition for which the surgery is required should be reported as the AE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_113124](s) leading to these 
measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment. 
In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history.  
AEs are designated as “non -serious” or “serious.” 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is an AE/reaction that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (formal admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979]) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., there is a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343659]’s health or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. For this study, examples of such events may include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
In addition, the Sponsor considers events of abortion (spontaneous or induced), fetal demise, and 
still birth as SAEs for reporting purposes. 
Some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281915], as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] do not require reporting as SAEs. 
Overdose will be considered an SAE only if any of the seriousness criteria are met. Any clinical 
complication in association with the overdose should be repor ted as an AE or SAE (as 
applicable) along with the overdose (see Section  12.2.2).  Details of signs or symptoms, clinical 
management and outcome should be reported, if available. Overdose without associated signs or 
symptoms should not be recorded as AEs but should be recorded as protocol deviations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For this protocol, non- serious treatment- emergent maculopapular ras hes that are deemed related 
to BCX7353 will be considered EOSIs. This does not include other types of rashes such as 
urticaria or eczema. All treatment -emergent skin conditions should be reported as AEs but only 
maculopapular rashes deemed related to BCX73 [ADDRESS_343660] be reported to the Sponsor Medical Monitor as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. Management of BCX7353 drug-related rash is provided in 
Section  11.1.12. 
12.1.2. Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Reports of all AEs and SAEs, regardless of  Investigator attribution, are to be collected from the 
time of signing of the informed consent through to the last study visit (i.e., through the posttreatment end -of-study visit). All AEs and SAEs are to be reported on the AE CRF.  
AEs should be documented on CRFs as  Investigator s become aware of them. AEs are to be 
followed until the event resolves. If an event is ongoing at the End of Study visit, Grade 1 and 
2 events do not need to be followed if the event is deemed unlikely to be related or not related to 
study drug (see Section 12.1.3 for AE grading). For all Grade [ADDRESS_343661] is in a clinically stable condition with regards to the AE.  
The  Investigator shall report all SAEs immediately to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_281973] w ith the 
Medical Monitor (phone or email) and by [CONTACT_281974], and 
entering the event onto the AE CRF within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event (see 
Section  12.1.5) . The SAE report form is a detailed, written report on the SAE provided by [CONTACT_12066]. The  Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs observed during the 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 54 study until they are resolved, or are judged medically stable, or are otherwise medically 
explained. 
The  Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis based on the presenting 
signs and symptoms. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the 
individual sign/symptom. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must 
be recorded individually. Once a diagnosis is made during evaluation or treatment, the  Investigator will update the AE record with this diagnosis. The immediate and follow-up reports 
shall identify subjects by [CONTACT_281975]-risk profile of the study drug in clinical trial.  
12.1.3. Definition o f Severity  
All AEs will be assessed (graded) for severity and classified using the DMID criteria for grading AEs (Publish date November 2007, see Section 16.1) . Any AEs not covered by [CONTACT_281976] 1  of 4 clearly defined categories as follows:  
Mild:  (Grade 1): Transient or mild symptoms; no limitation in activity; no intervention required. The AE does not interfere with the participant’s normal functioning level. It may be an annoyance. 
Moderate:  (Grade 2): Symptom results in mild to moderate limitation in activity; no or minimal interventio n required. The AE produces some impairment of 
functioning, but it is not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
Severe:  (Grade 3): Symptom results in significant limitation in activity; medical intervention may be required. The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Life-
threatening:  (Grade 4): Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therapy required to prevent death, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]. 
Severity refers to the medical perspective of an event while seriousness reflects the outcome of the event (i .e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Events of mild severity can lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281916] e severe events such as a headache may not meet seriousness criteria.  
12.1.4. Definition of Relationship to Study Drug  
The  Investigator or medically qualified designee must review each AE and make the 
determination of relationship to study drug using the following guidelines: 
Not Related:  The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no temporal relationship exists between the study drug and the event. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 55 Unlikely:  The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from drug 
administration and is readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_243079]. 
Possibly Related:  There is some temporal relationship between t he event and the administration 
of the study drug and the event is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident. 
Probably Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, 
abates upon discontinuation of the drug, and cannot be reasonably explained 
by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.  
Definitely Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study 
drug, is confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_35648] 
(dechallenge), and reappears upon repeated exposure (rechallenge, if rechallenge is medically appropriate).  
The Sponsor may upgrade c ausality if deemed appropriate.  
12.1.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions  
Any SAE must be reported by [CONTACT_281977] 24 hours of the  Investigator’s awareness of the SAE. In 
addition, all SAEs must be recorded on the AE CRF in real time. All additional follow -up 
evaluations of the SAE must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon as they are available. The SAE report form s should be sent to the following email address: 
Phone (24 hours) +[PHONE_5847] 
Email: [EMAIL_5496] 
Immediate reporting should allow BioCryst to take the appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. Therefore, the initial report should be submitted by [CONTACT_281978] a very short period of time and under no circumstances should this period exceed [ADDRESS_343662] to determine whether the SAE requires a 
reassessment of the benefit -risk profile of the study drug in clinical trial, if the relevant 
informat ion was not already available and provided in the initial report. 
US-based  Investigators or designees at each site are responsible for submitting any 
investigational new drug (IND) safety report (initial and follow- up) (i .e., suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]) or other safety information (eg, revised IB) to the IRB and for retaining a copy in their files, unless otherwise instructed. 
European- based  Investigator s or designees at each site are responsible for retaining copi[INVESTIGATOR_281917] (initial and follow -up) and other safety information (eg, revised IB) in their files. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343663] or its designee will submit all S[LOCATION_003]R reports (initial and follow -up) or other safety 
information (eg, revised IB) to the required authorities. 
BioCr yst shall ensure that all relevant information about S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or 
life-threatening is recorded and reported as soon as possible to the competent authorities in all 
European Member States concerned, the US, and other countries as warranted as well as to the 
independent ethics committees (IECs), and in any case no later than seven (7) days after knowledge by [CONTACT_281979] a case, and that relevant follow-up information is subsequently 
communicated within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs shall be reported to the 
competent authorities concerned and to the IECs concerned as soon as possible but within a maximum of [ADDRESS_343664] or designee shall also inform all  Investigator s. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Events of Spe cial Interest  
Although not an SAE, all events of diffuse maculopapular rash assessed as related to BCX7353 regardless of severity, must be reported to the Sponsor Medical Monitor in writing via email 
using the SAE/EOSI report form after the  Investigator ’s assessment of the event. High 
resolution photographs must also be submitted as described in Section 11.1.12. In addition, the 
event must be recorde d on the AE CRF in real time. All additional follow -up evaluations of the 
event must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon as they are available. The SAE/EOSI report form should be sent to the following email address:  
Phone (24 hours) +[PHONE_5847] 
Email: [EMAIL_5496] 
This method of reporting will allow BioCryst to obtain more information than can be captured in the eCRF for this event. The report form will allow a full clinical description and information 
regarding the evaluation tha t cannot be documented in the EDC due to free text limitations to be 
shared with BioCryst. Therefore, the initial report and photographs should be submitted by [CONTACT_281980] a very short period of time.  
The follow-up report should contain new information about the clinical course, medical 
evaluation, additional photographs (if relevant), biopsy (if done), and laboratory results (if done). 
12.1.6. Pregnancy  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the course of the study should have study drug 
discontinued immediately  and must be followed through the end of the pregnancy. Male subjects 
whose partners become pregnant do not need to discontinue study drug. While pregnancy is not 
considered an AE, all cases of fetal drug exposure via the parent as a study participant (including 
partners of study participants) are to be reported immediately to BioCryst or its designee. 
Consent from pregnant partners of study participants will be obtained prior to reporting any details of the pregnancy. Information related to the pregnancy must be given on a “Pregnancy 
Confirmation and Outcome” form that will be provided by [CONTACT_281981]. Any AEs or SAEs experienced by a pregnant subject are to be reported as directed above in Section 
12.1.[ADDRESS_343665]’s pregnant partner should be reported on the Pregnancy Confirmation and Outcome form. All pregnancies must be followed to outcome which occurs 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 57 when an infant is delivered (live or still born), there is fetal demise, or there is an abortion 
(spontaneous or induced). Abortion (spontaneous or induced), fetal demise, and still birth along 
with congenital abnormalities in the newborn, should be reported as separate SAEs. 
12.1.7. Serious Breaches of Good Clinical Practice  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to notify the licensing authority of any serious breach of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) which is like ly to effect, to a significant degree, the safety or 
mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the study. All serious 
breaches will be notified to the relevant competent authority within [ADDRESS_343666] for recurrence of the AE as appropriate. In addition, other extenuating circumstances may lead to treatment interruptions such as vomiting during an abdominal HAE attack or 
required fasting for medical procedures; in these cases, study drug should be resumed once the 
extenuating circumstance is resolved.  
The Sponsor Medical Monitor should be notified in the event of a treatment interruption due to 
an AE. Any treatment interruption will be recorded in the CRF  and source documents, including 
the reason for the interruption. 
12.2. Toxicity Management  
The  Investigator (or qualified designee) will grade clinically significant events and lab oratory 
abnormalities according to that detailed in Section  12.1.3. Grade 3 and 4 clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities should be confirmed by [CONTACT_281982], unless such a delay is not consistent with good medical practice. 
In the event that a new safety signal emerges, a meeting of the DMC may be convened by [CONTACT_281983]. Based on the data 
presented, a decision will be made as to whether to halt the study, to continue dosing, or to continue dosing with provisions introduced into the protocol via substantial amendment. 
12.2.1. Rash  
Special evaluation of BCX7353 related maculopapular drug rash is required as per 
Section  11.1.12 and special reporting is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Management of rash should be based on best medical practice and address the subject’s presentation. If a subject experiences a Grade [ADDRESS_343667] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 58 [IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Administration for Grade [ADDRESS_343668] is considered to be deriving benefit. By 
[CONTACT_281984], this reaction would be described as pruritus and/or erythema (Grade 1) or a diffuse maculopapular rash and/or dry desquamation (Grade 2). In addition, subjects would have 
to be constitutionally well (no fever, no change in appetite, no malaise, etc.), have no mucosal 
involvement, no vesicles and have no evidence of any hypersensitivity involving the liver or kidney. If laboratory assessment is performed mild or moderate eosinophilia may be present but 
should not prevent continuation of study drug if all other criteria are met. Rash treatment should 
primarily address symptoms (i.e., antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_281918]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]). Oral corticosteroids should be avoided, as there is no evidence that ora l 
corticosteroids benefit patients with bland drug- related cutaneous reactions.  
If the subject’s rash does not improve, or worsens to include vesicles, wet desquamation or ulceration (Grade 3), then BCX7353 should be immediately discontinued. Subjects who remain on study drug should be followed closely until the rash resolves.  
12.2.2. Aminotransferase (ALT or AST) Elevation  
All baseline or treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations > 3 × ULN (ie, Grade 3 and above) 
should be confirmed within [ADDRESS_343669] as well as total 
bilirubin, ALP, prothrombin time /INR, and complete blood count for eosinophil levels. If 
subjects are asymptomatic with no other pertinent laboratory abnormality, study drug may be continued under close observation with every [ADDRESS_343670] be held if: 
• Either ALT or AST is > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• The ALT or AST reaches > 8 × ULN  
The subject should continue regular assessments as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_281985], AST, total bilirubin, ALP, prothrombin time/INR, and complete blood count for eosinophil levels until ALT and/or AST are < 3 × ULN. 
Provided specific criteria are met, the  Investigator and subject may elect to resume BCX7353 
dosing. All of the following criteria must be met for dosing to resume: 
• The subject is considered to have been deriving benefit from BCX7353 prior to holding 
study drug.  
• Transaminases return to ≤ 2 × ULN for subjects whose baseline transaminase levels were above the ULN, and ≤ ULN for those whose baseline transaminase levels were ≤ ULN.  
• Subjects have not initiated or restarted androgens during the period BCX7353 was held. 
• The subject agrees to continue every [ADDRESS_343671], total bilirubin, ALP, CBC (eosinophil levels) and prothrombin/INR until levels appear sta ble and 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 59 transaminase levels remain < 3 × ULN for at least [ADDRESS_343672] be permanently 
discontinued. 
12.2.3. Overdose  
To date there is no experience wi th overdose of oral BCX7353. Single doses of up to 1000 mg, 
7 days of dosing up to 500 mg/day, and 14 days of dosing with 350 mg/day revealed no 
clinically significant safety concerns in healthy subjects in Study BCX7353- 101. In 
Study BCX7353-102, multiple dosing with 350 mg BCX7353 for up to 9 days either following or current with single doses of CYP probe substrate drugs in healthy subjects overall did not reveal any new safety concerns. Safety data generated in Study  BCX7353-203, 28-day dosing 
with up to 350 mg/day, revealed no clinically significant safety concerns in subjects with HAE. Subsequently, subjects enrolled in BCX7353-106 were exposed to BCX7353 450 mg QD for 14 days without any unexpected AEs or increased AE severity. 
In the event that study personnel become aware of an overdose of study drug/IMP (≥ 150 mg per 
calendar day) that is associated with an AE, both the overdose and the resultant event should be reported as AEs. Overdose without any symptoms (i.e., AEs) does not need to be reported a s an 
AE. If overdose occurs with or without associated AEs, subjects should undergo clinical and laboratory monitoring as appropriate for their clinical condition and, if indicated, should receive clinically -indicated supportive therapy.  
Additional information about overdose as an AE or SAE is discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.3. Data Monitoring Committee  
Data from ongoing studies BCX7353-302 (Phase 3 study), BCX7353-301 (Phase 3 study) and the current study, BCX7353-204, are reviewed by [CONTACT_281936]7353 data monitoring committee 
(DMC). Since a total of over [ADDRESS_343673] country globally. A formal meeting of the DMC members 
will not be required; however, if the data review identifi es any concern, the DMC members may 
elect to hold a formal DMC meeting. Where possible, scheduled DMC meetings for this protocol 
may be aligned with those of other protocol(s). The DMC may also be convened if a new clinically significant safety signal emer ges or at other times as requested.  
The latest data review was conducted on [ADDRESS_343674] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 60 13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Sample Size Considerations  
No sample size calculations were conducted for this open-label, long-term safety study. 
Approximately 475 subjects may be enrolled in this study, with approximately 250 subjects 
planned to be enrolled in the US, to provide access to BCX7353 for additional subjects who, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14270] , are expected to benefit from treatment with an oral treatment for 
the prevention of angioedema attacks.  
13.2. Stratification  
Not applicable. 
13.3. Statistical Methods  
A detailed SAP will be developed to describe the methods of analyses and summaries, including all endpoints, time points, populations, missing data, etc. Deviations from the analyses outlined in the SAP will be described in the CSR.  
13.3.1. Analysis Populations 
The analysis populations are defined below. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screen Failures  
Subjects who give written informed consent but are not assigned to study treatment and are noted 
as screen failures in the CRF are considered screen failures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least 1  capsule of study drug. This 
population will be used for all analyses of accountability, demographics, BCX7353 drug concentrations, and safety. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intent -to-Treat Population 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects who are allocated to study drug. The 
ITT population will be used as the primary population for effectiveness analyses. Subjects will 
be analyzed based on the treatment to which they were allocated.  
13.3.2. General Considerations for Data Analysis 
In general, descriptive summaries will include n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and n and percent for categorical variables. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_22058] t group and by [CONTACT_15449]. 
All individual subject data will be listed as measured. All statistical summaries and analyses will be performed using SAS
® software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]). 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343675] disposition will be presented for all subjects. The number of subjects who completed 
through each study visit and those that discontinued from the study will be provided. The reasons for early discontinuation also will be presented. A tabulation of the number of subjects exposed 
to study drug and duration of exposure will also be presented. Treatment adherence, dose 
interruptions and reason for dose interruptions will be provided as summaries or listed as appropriate. 
13.3.5. Analysis of Safety Variables 
Safety endpoints that will be summarized, at a minimum by [CONTACT_1570], include the 
proportion of subjects 1) with TEAEs; 2)  who discontinue BCX7353 due to TEAEs; 3) wit h 
treatment -emergent SAEs; 4) with treatment- emergent Grade 3 or 4 AEs; 5) with 
treatment -emergent treatment -related AEs consistent with a drug rash as identified by [CONTACT_122696] (eg, maculopapular rash, papular rash identified as an EOSI), and 6) wit h 
treatment -emergent Grade 3 or  4 laboratory abnormalities.  
Time to discontinuation due to a TEAE, and time to development of drug- related rash will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. For those with a drug- related rash, clinical and 
laboratory findings will be summarized and the proportion of subjects who successfully continued therapy following onset of rash. 
AEs will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) PT and SOC. 
The occurrence of TEAEs will be summarized using MedDRA PT, SOC, and severity. Separate 
summaries of TEAEs, treatment-emergent SAEs, AEs considered to be related to study drug, and AEs leading to study drug interruption will be generated. All AEs will be listed for individual subjects showing both verbat im and preferred terms.  
Descriptive summaries for vital signs, weight, bedside ECG parameters, and clinical laboratory results will be presented. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the DMID Adult Toxicity Table (Publish Date: Draft, November 2007; Appendix 16.1).  
Any graded abnormality that occurs following the initiation of study drug and represents at least 1-grade increase from the baseline assessment is defined as treatment -emergent. The number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing treatment -emergent graded toxicities will be summarized . 
Laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to worst postbaseline assessments will be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects having elevations in liver enzyme abnormalities (ALT, AST, or bilirubin) in relation to fold above ULN will be summarized according to the FDA’s 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation on Drug-Induced Liver Injury Guida nce for Industry ( FDA 
2009) . 
Clinically significant abnormal morphological ECG findings will be summarized.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343676]’s change from baseline will be calculated as:  
∆ik= (QTcF for subject at time point k – Baseline QTcF)  
Where QTcF measurements will be the average of triplicate ECGs at baseline and single values at each time point.  
For routine ECGs, the number and proportion of subjects with QTcF ≤ 450, > 450 to ≤ 480, > 480 to ≤ 500, and > 500 msec; or changes of ≤ 30, > 30 to ≤ 60, or > 60 msec will be 
summarized.  
Physical examination findings will be listed.  
Concomitant medications and those discontinued during the study will be coded using the World 
Health Organization drug dictionary and summarized.  Subjects with medications changes prior 
to baseline may also be summarized.  
13.3.6. Analysis of Effectiveness Variables  
The following effectiveness endpoints will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_1570]: 
• Number and rate of HAE attacks  
• Durability of response  
• Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms days 
• Patient -reported outcomes: HAE disease- specific AE -QoL questionnaire scores and 
TSQM Global Satisfaction scores  
• Number of attacks requiring attack medication 
• Discontinuatio ns due to lack of efficacy (through 48 weeks only) 
• Disease severity  
All attacks recorded by [CONTACT_281953] a set of pre -defined rules prior to inclusion in effectiveness analyses. These rules, which wi ll be 
constructed in concert with HAE-treating physicians, will be outlined in the SAP. 
The attack rate will be calculated as the number of attacks per month (28 days) by [CONTACT_281986], adjusted for the total duration of treatment. The attack rate will be listed and 
summarized using all available data. The durability of response assessment will be based on 
attack rate trend over time. Alternatively, the attack rate change may also be assessed relative to recent HAE attack documentation. Summaries and/or comparisons of effectiveness endpoints 
may be performed for those who received concomitant C1-INH and those who did not.  
Additional related details of HAE attacks (e .g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281919]) and 
number of days lost from work and/or school due to attacks will be summarized and listed. 
Summaries may be produced separately for pre-[ADDRESS_343677] 
has completed the final study visit, t he data are cleaned, and the database has been authorized for 
analysis.  
13.3.8. Quality of Life Analyses 
Scores at each visit and change from baseline in the domain scores of the AE-QoL (function, fatigue, nutrition, and fear/shame) as well as the composite score will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
The change from baseline in TSQM Global Satisfaction scores as well as effectiveness, side 
effects, and convenience subscales will be summarized.  
13.3.9. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma samples for determination of BCX7353 concentrations are planned to be collected at 
Baseline and Weeks 4 and 12  for adolescent subjects only (≥12 to 17 years of age).  The 
resulting PK data may be pooled in a meta analysis to facilitate population PK  analyses.  
14. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
14.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
14.1.1. Regulatory Authority Approvals 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol; GCPs, including ICH of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human U se Guidelines (ICH E6); 
FDA/European Medicines Agency regulatory requirements and other national laws as applicable; and in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, the study will be conducted in compliance with a ll applicable local laws and regulatory requirements 
relevant to the use of new therapeutic agents.  
14.1.2. Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee Approvals 
Before initiation of the study at an investigational site, the protocol, the ICF, the subject information sheet (if applicable), and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted 
to the appropriate IRB/IEC. Written approval of the study must be obtained before the study center can be initiated or the IMP can be released to the  Investigator. Any necessary extensions 
or renewals of IRB/IEC approval must be obtained, in particular, for changes to the study such as 
modification of the protocol, the ICF, the written information provided to subjects, and/or other 
procedures. 
The IRB/IEC will be pr omptly provided any new information that may adversely affect the 
safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. On completion of the study, the IRB/IEC will 
be provided with a report of the outcome of the study. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-204 
 64 Written reports of clinical study status will be submitted to the IRB/IEC annually or more 
frequently if requested by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC. A final study notification will also be forwarded to the 
IRB/IEC after the study is completed or in the event of premature termination of the study in accordance w ith the applicable regulations. The study will be considered to be completed once 
the last subject completes their last study visit. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_281920]/IEC should be maintained in the study file. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_281921] (including termination) should be provided to BioCryst. 
14.1.3. Subject Informed Consent: Adults  
A signed ICF must be obtained from each subject prior to performing any study- related 
procedures. Each subject should be given both verbal and written information describing the 
nature and duration of the clinical study. The informed consent process should take place under 
conditions where the subject has adequate time to consider the risks and benefits associated with 
his/her participation in the study. Subjects will not be screened or treated until the subject has signed an approved ICF written in a language in which the subject is fluent.  
The ICF that is used must be approved both by [CONTACT_281987]/IEC. The ICF 
should be in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, and BioCryst policy. 
The  Investigator must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards of the trial and any discomfort it may entail. Subjects will be 
informed that they are free not to participate in the tr ial and that they may withdraw consent to 
participate at any time. They will be told that refusal to participate in the study will not prejudice future treatment. They will also be told that their records may be examined by [CONTACT_281988]. Subjects must be given the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the trial, consent should be appropriately recorded by [CONTACT_19720]’s dated signature. The subject should receive a signed and 
dated copy of the ICF. The original signed ICF should be retained in the study files. The  
Investigator shall maintain a log of all subjects who sign the I CF and indicate if the subject was 
enrolled into the study or reason for non- enrollment.  
In the event the subject is requested to undergo a skin biopsy due to rash, a separate informed consent will be required. Subjects with a Grade 1 or 2 rash remaining on study drug may undergo 
a biopsy, for which a separate informed consent will be obtained. 
14.1.4. Subjects Informed Consent: Adolescents  
Subject informed consent must be obtained from each parent/caregiver prior to performing any 
study- related procedures. Similar ly, assent will be obtained from subjects ≥ 12 years to 17 years  
of age prior to performing any study- related procedures. If the local requirements limit the age of 
assent, then assent will be obtained based on those requirements. Each parent/caregiver and  
subject should be given both verbal and written information describing the nature and duration of 
the clinical study. The informed consent and assent process should take place under conditions where the parent/caregiver has adequate time to consider the risks and benefits associated with his/her child’s participation in the study. Subjects will not be screened or treated until the parent/caregiver and subjects has signed an approved ICF and assent form written in a language in which the subject is fluent. The ICF and assent forms that are used must be approved both by

Version 9.[ADDRESS_343678] and by [CONTACT_3488]/IEC. The ICF and assent forms should be in accordance with 
the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, and BioCryst policy.    The  Investigator must explain to potential subjects and their parent/ caregiver the aims, methods, 
reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the trial and any discomfort it may entail. Each parent/caregiver will be informed that they are free for their child not to participate in the trial and that they may withdraw consent for their child to participate at any time. They will be told that refusal for their child to participate in the study will not prejudice future treatment. The y will also be told that their child’s records may be examined by [CONTACT_281990].  
Parents/caregivers and subjects must be given the opportunity to ask questions. After this 
explanation and before entry into the trial, consent and assent should be appropriately recorded 
by [CONTACT_281991]’s/caregiver’s and subject’s dated signature. The parent/ caregiver should receive a signed and dated copy of the ICF, and, if applicable, the assent. The original signed 
informed consent and assent, if applicable, should be retained in the study files. The  Investigator 
shall maintain a log of all su bjects for whom consent was signed and indicate if the subject was 
enrolled into the study or reason for non- enrollment.  
In the event the subject is requested to undergo a skin biopsy due to rash, a separate informed consent and assent form will be required. Subjects with a Grade 1 or 2 rash remaining on study drug may  undergo a biopsy, for which a separate informed consent and assent will be obtained. 
14.1.5.  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The  Investigator will provide timely reports regarding safety to his /her IRB/IEC as required.  
14.2. Study Monitoring  
During trial conduct, BioCryst or its designee will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. The monitors will review source documents to 
confirm that the data re corded on CRFs is accurate. The  Investigator and institution will allow 
BioCryst representatives, monitors, or its designees direct access to source documents to perform 
this verification.  
It is important that the Principal  Investigator (s) and their rele vant personnel are available during 
the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
14.3. Quality Assurance  
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_281922]/IEC, and/or by a quality 
assurance group for audits performed by [CONTACT_281992], or its designee, and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708]. 
It is important that the  Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

 66 14.4. Study Termination and Site Closure  
Overall, the Sponsor may suspend enrollment into the study, suspend treatment of ongoing 
subjects, or terminate the study to ensure that subjects’ safety and welfare are protected. The 
entire study, or individual sites, may be terminated for any of the following reasons: 
• changes in scientific knowledge that lead to a negative impact on the risk/benefit profile for subjects 
• request of BioCryst or competent public authorities / IRB / EC 
• if recruitment cannot be co mpleted in specified time frame  
• if the permit to manufacture or import IMP is revoked 
• if the study drug becomes commercially available 
BioCryst reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. After such a decision, the  Investigator must contact [CONTACT_281993]. As directed by [CONTACT_281992], all study materials must be collected and al l CRFs 
completed to the greatest extent possible. 
An individual trial center that is determined to be unsuitable by [CONTACT_2728], competent public 
authorities or EC may be terminated, without affecting the other trial sites.  
Except for those situations outlined in Section  8.3, no other formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_281923], parts of the trial or the entire trial, will be defined. Individual subjects will be 
discontinued from the study following the emergence of any laboratory abnormality or AE that 
in the judgment of the  Investigator compromises the ability to continue study- specific 
procedures or is considered not to be in the subject’s best interest. 
14.5. Records Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or BioCryst, the  Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, CRFs, and medical/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs, all CRFs, and 
detailed records of study drug accountability and treatment disposition. The records should be 
retained by [CONTACT_281994], whichever is longer. 
If the  Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the study 
records may be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another  Investigator, another 
institution, or to BioCryst. The  Investigator must obtain BioCryst’s written permission before 
disposing of any records and must notify BioCryst before transferring any records to another 
facility.  
All correspondence related to records retention, destruction or transfer of study documents should be sent directly to BioCryst study personnel, copying the email [EMAIL_5500].  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 9.[ADDRESS_343679]’s right to protection against invasion of privacy and secure 
maintenance of the confidential nature of their personal data. Only a subject identification 
number and subject identifiers permitted by [CONTACT_281995]. However, in compliance with federal regulations, BioCryst requires the  
Investigator to permit BioCryst’s representatives and, when necessary, repres entatives of the 
FDA or other regulatory authorities to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the 
study, maintaining pseudo-anonymity. 
All parties will abide by [CONTACT_281996],  including, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 
where this rule is applicable and the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation in the 
European Union, where applicable. A valid authorization and consent must meet the 
speci fications of the applicable laws and regulations relating to such personal data and health 
information. It is the responsibility of the  Investigator and institution to obtain such 
waiver/authorization in writing from the appropriate individual. HIPAA authorizations are required for US sites only. 
14.7. Study Publication  
All data generated from this study are the property of BioCryst and shall be held in strict confidence along with all information furnished by [CONTACT_281992]. Except as provided through written 
agreement between BioCryst, independent analysis and/or publication of these data by [CONTACT_281997]/her staff is not permitted without prior written consent of BioCryst. Such consent will not be withheld unreasonably. BioCryst is in agreem ent with the 
principle of full disclosure of clinical trial results.

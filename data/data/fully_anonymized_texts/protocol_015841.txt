    Assessment Period:   
The study drug will be administered in the morning of Day 1, Day 22, and Day [ADDRESS_52254] been comp leted. The subjects will stay at the clinical site until Day  4, Day 25, 
and Day 46 for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3, respectively. The subjects will be discharged after completion of all scheduled assessments. Outpatient visits will be performed as out lined in 
Table  4.  
 
Follow -up:  
A follow -up visit will be performed on Day 69 (±1 day)  
 
Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4) for further details . 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Treatment A: Oral Dose of cenobamate administered as a single 200 mg tablet on Day 1 under fas ted 
conditions  
Treatment B: Oral Dose of cenobamate administered as a single 200  mg/20  mL suspension on Day 1 
under fasted conditions  
Treatment C: Oral Dose of cenobamate administered as a single 200  mg/20  mL suspension on Day 1  
under fed conditions  
Evaluation : 
Pharmacokinetics :  
Serial blood samples for PK assessments will be sampled at various time points from Day  1, Day 22, 
and Day 43 starting at pre -dose through 456  hours (20  days) following oral administration of 
cenobamate tablets or  suspension (See Table  4). 
The PK samples may be used for additional exploratory PK and/or metabolite analyses.  
Descriptive statistics and graphs will be generated for plasma concentrations and PK parameters for 
each treatment.  
The formulation effect will be tested for: Cenobamate oral suspension administered under fed and 
fasting conditions and cenobamate oral tablet administered under fasting conditions. These analyses 
will be conducted separately on C max, AUC last and AUC ∞ using a mixed model on the log 
transformed data with treatment, sequence and period as fixed effects and subject within sequence as 
random effe ct. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) will be computed for:  
1. Cenobamate oral suspension administered under fasted conditions versus cenobamate oral 
tablet administered under fasting conditions  
2. Cenobamate  oral suspension administered under fed conditions versus cenobamate oral 
suspension administered under fasting conditions  
Additionally, for the above comparisons, the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) will 
be calculated. No formulation effe ct or food interaction will be concluded when the 90% CIs are 
within the reference range [0.80 – 1.25]. For each subject, the Wilcoxon signed- rank test will be used 
to test for differences in tmax.

    5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Cenobamate ( YKP3089) is a small molecule approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for the 
treatment of partial onset seizures (POS) in adult patients.  
Refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)[ADDRESS_52265] and slow inactivated state and persistent current of sodium channels and to 
be a positive alloste ric modulator of 6 GABA A ion channel subtypes (α1β2γ2, α2β3γ2, α3β3γ2, 
α4β3γ2, α5β3γ2 and α6β3γ2).  
Cenobamate has been assessed in a large number of  safety pharmacology and toxicology studies 
including single -dose toxicity, repeat -dose toxicity, cardiotoxicity, genetic toxicity, reproductive 
toxicity, and carcinogenicity in animals. Safety pharmacology studies showed that the doses that 
produced benef icial central nervous system (CNS) effects of cenobamate in animal models do 
not result in obvious negative effects on the CNS. No evidence of cardiovascular effects was observed by [CONTACT_49866]. There was no carcinogenic potential for cenobamate in transgenic rasH2 mice or Sprague Dawley rats.  
Cenobamate is extensively metabolized. The primary metabolic pathways are by [CONTACT_49867]2B7 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_15924]2B4, and by [CONTACT_49868]2E1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]2C19 and CYP3A4/5. 
5.1.2. Clinical Human Experience  
To date, approximately [ADDRESS_52266] recent version of the Investigator Brochure
1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
In humans, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cenobamate has bee n studied after both single dose and 
multiple dosing in healthy subjects. The PK of cenobamate in plasma appears to be non-proportional after single oral doses ranging from 5 to 750 mg and multiple dosing ranging from 
50 to 500 mg/day. Maximum plasma conce ntration of cenobamate was generally observed 
between [ADDRESS_52267] dosing and a longer terminal half -life was observed as the 
cenobamate dose was increased (approximately 30 hours at 5- 10 mg to approximately 76 hours 
at 750 mg). Steady state is gene rally achieved after 2 weeks of treatment with once daily dosing 
of cenobamate, and the accumulation of cenobamate in plasma over the 50 -300 mg dose range 
was approximately 5- fold based on total exposure (AUC).
2 
Cenobamate is extensively metabolized and primarily eliminated in the urine (88% of the dose).[ADDRESS_52268] variability of cenobamate in healthy subjects is relatively low (about 14% for C max and 4-
5% for AUCs). No pharmacokinetic difference was obser ved for cenobamate between Japanese 
and non- Japanese healthy subjects.  
Multiple drug- drug interaction (DDI) studies were performed in healthy subjects. The 
coadministration of carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], divalproex and oral contraceptives did not significantly 
modify t he PK of cenobamate whereas the coadministration of phenobarbital and phenytoin 
significantly decreased cenobamate plasma exposure (AUC) by [CONTACT_3450] 15% and 28%, 
respectively. The coadministration of cenobamate significantly decreased carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_49832] (AUC) by [CONTACT_3450] 25- 35%, and increased phenobarbital and phenytoin plasma 
exposures (AUC) by [CONTACT_3450] 37% and 84%, respectively. The coadministration of cenobamate with oral contraceptives did not significantly modify ethinylestradiol plasma 
exposure (AUC) but increased slightly the exposure to norethindrone by [CONTACT_3450] 37% for 
cenobamate oral doses up to 100 mg/day. 
After the administration of a CYP450 probe cocktail with cenobamate in healthy subjects, the 
results showed that  a 200 mg daily dose of cenobamate induced the activity of CYP2B6 and 
inhibited the activity of CYP2C19. For CYP3A, cenobamate exhibited a limited induction at 100 
mg/day whereas a more marked induction was observed at 200 mg/day. No significant effect of 
cenobamate was observed on CYP2C9 activity at 200 mg/day. 
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of cenobamate led to an increase in plasma exposure to 
cenobamate by 1.4- fold and 1.5- fold in mild and moderate renal impaired subjects, respectively. 
The ef fect of hepatic impairment on the PK of cenobamate led to an increase in plasma exposure 
to cenobamate by 1.[ADDRESS_52269] of sex or age is expected on the PK of cenobamate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety  
Cenobamate at oral doses of 100 mg and 200 mg/day was generally well tolerated with a 
predictable and consistent adverse event (AE) profile. Cenobamate at a dose of 400 mg/day required more frequent dose reductions because of  CNS related AEs and resulted in a higher 
frequency of discontinuations due to AEs. The median of the modal dose in the 400 mg arm of 
Study YKP3089C017 was 300 mg/day. Adverse events (AEs) resolved upon discontinuation of 
cenobamate.  
The most common advers e events (AEs) reported with cenobamate in adults were mild to 
moderate in severity. CNS -related AEs were dose dependent, with higher incidence reported at 
higher doses. Adverse reactions due to cenobamate may include somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, headache, diplopia, nausea, nystagmus, balance disorder, and gait ataxia. These adverse reactions 
were mild to moderate in severity and resolved spontaneously upon discontinuation of treatment. 
SAEs considered at least possibly related to cenobamate included drug reaction with eosinophilia 
and systemic reaction, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus (2 subjects), and suicidal 
ideation (2 subjects). A complete list of all SAEs during the cenobamate development program is 
available in the IB.
[ADDRESS_52270] common serious AEs (SAEs) were CNS related such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49833], ataxia and dizziness particularly at hi gher dosages. These serious 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 [ADDRESS_52271] been readily clinically identifiable. The general nature of these SAEs 
reflects an expected pattern in subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. 
Adverse events (AEs) of special interest that emerged during the cenobamate devel opment 
program include rash and hypersensitivity reactions (including three cases of DRESS syndrome) 
with elevations of hepatic enzymes. Drug- induced hypersensitivity reactions with or without 
multi organ involvement (allergic reactions which may be fatal)  including DRESS syndrome 
have been seen in patients taking cenobamate. DRESS which has occurred in <0.5% of clinical trial participants taking cenobamate stands for Drug Reaction (or Rash) with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms. This condition occurs usually in the first 8 weeks after initiation of treatment and rarely happens afterwards. In a large open label safety trial of 1339 subjects 
exposed to cenobamate at an initial dose of 12.5mg/day and titrated every two weeks to a 
maximum dose of 400mg /day no cases of DRESS were identified.  
Although two cases of highly elevated hepatic enzymes were identified, there were no cases that 
met the criteria for Hy’s Law and review of the cenobamate safety database revealed that the 
incidence of 3X 
upper l imit of no rmal (ULN)  elevation of alanine a minotransferase  (ALT ) did not 
meet the criteria for the Rezulin Rule. One of the subjects with highly elevated hepatic enzymes 
died of multi -organ failure with pancreatic, cardiac and pulmonary failure approximately one 
year after starting cenobamate and one month after initiating eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Final diagnosis

It is kn own that antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_49834]. Although isolated reports of suicidal thoughts and behavior 
have been reported in studies with cenobamate, the relationship between them and cenobamate 
has not been confirmed. Patients treated in cenobamate studies are monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.  
A complete list of all SAEs  during the cenobamate development program is included in the 
current version of the IB

subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. 
5.2. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
This Phase [ADDRESS_52272] benefit to the participating subjects. 
The results of two adequate and well -controlled studies demonstrated that 100, 200 and 400 
mg/day of cenobamate are effective for the treatment of partial onset seizures. The most common 
AEs were nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders. Adverse event s were consistent, 
predictable, and dose related. The primary safety issue identified was DRESS syndrome. Using a 
low starting dose and titration every two weeks appears to have mitigated this issue. 
Additionally, DRESS has not been reported in any cenobam ate single dose study to date. These 
safety issues are readily identifiable with a predictable course and resolved with discontinuation 
of cenobamate. Safety profile of cenobamate is comparable with other drugs in this class. 
Considering the measures taken to minimize risks to patients participating in clinical trials, the potential risks identified in association with cenobamate are justified by [CONTACT_49869][INVESTIGATOR_002]. 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 [ADDRESS_52273] any potential liver toxicity.  
The subjects in this clinical study will receive single oral doses of 200 mg of cenobamate at 3 
occasions in fasting or fed conditions administered as either a tablet or suspension formulation. 
Thus, the overall risk to the subjects enrolled in this study is deemed acceptable. Neve rtheless, 
the subjects will be closely monitored using frequent clinical laboratory investigations and a continuous observation of their well -being.  
5.3. Rationale for Present Study  
5.3.1. Study Design Rationale  
A new oral suspension formulation of cenobamate has rece ntly been developed and will be used 
to support the cenobamate pediatric clinical program. Since a suspension formulation has not 
been used in any clinical trials to date, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the suspension formulation 
will be investigated and com pared to tablet formulation. The relative BA assessment between 
these [ADDRESS_52274] on the PK of the suspension formulation will be evaluated in this study. These 2 
assessments with the suspension formulation will provide the needed information to use 
appropriately the oral suspension formulation in future clinical studies conducted in pediatric populations. 
5.3.2. Anticipated Pharmacokinetic Behavior 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Food Effect on Cenobamate  Suspension  
A previous clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers assessing the relative bioavailability of 
an oral tablet formulation of cenobamate administered in fasting and fed conditions showed no 
statistically significant difference in the pharma cokinetics of cenobamate between the fed and 
fasted populations. As such, it is expected that the disposition of cenobamate will be comparable 
with the suspension formulation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relative Bioavailability Between Cenobamate Suspension and Cenobamate 
Tablet  
The disposition of cenobamate has been previously studied after the administration of different 
oral formulations (capsule and tablet). No statistically significant differences were observed in 
the pharmacokinetics of cenobamate between these formulations. However, an oral suspension 
of cenobamate has not been tested in clinical studies to date. Therefore, the disposition of 
cenobamate as an oral liquid formulation is unknown.

    6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
6.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objectives of this study are to assess (1) the relative bioavailability of 200 mg of 
cenobamate given as an oral tablet vs 200 mg of cenobamate given as an oral suspension in 
fasting condition and (2) the effect of food on the bioavailability of a [ADDRESS_52275] as the data permits: 
• AUC
∞: The AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity  
• AUC last: AUC from time of dosing to the time of the last measurab le concentration, 
and  
• Cmax: Maximum plasma concentration  
6.3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary safety endpoints will be collected for each subject:  
• Physical examination (PE)  
• Adverse events (AEs)  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory safety tests including hematology 
6.3.3. Further Endpoints  
The following additional PK endpoints will be determined for each subject as the data permits:  
• t½: Terminal half -life 
• tmax: Time to maximum cenobamate plasma concentration  
• CL/F : Oral clearance  
• λz: Terminal rate constant  
• Vz/F: Apparent volume of distribution during terminal phase  
• Clast: Last observed cenobamate plasma concentration  
Additional PK parameters may be calculated as deemed appropriate. A complete list of all PK parameters will be provided in the Clinic al Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP) .

7.2. Number of Subjects  
A total of 24 ( 4 subjects per sequence) healthy female and male subjects, balanced by [CONTACT_49870]/ethnicity to the extent possible, will be included in the study.  
If needed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_49871], replacement subjects will be assigned to 
the same t reatment sequence as the subject they are replacing in order to have at least 20 subjects 
completing all three treatments.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
The study will contain the following treatment groups:  
• Treatment A:  200 mg cenobamate oral tablet under fasting condition  
• Treatment B:  200 mg cenobamate oral suspension under fasting condition  
• Treatment C:  200 mg cenobamate oral suspension under fed condition 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037

    7.3.1. Methods for Treatment Group Assignment  
After obtaining oral and written informed consent, subjects will be s creened according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 8.1 and Section  8.2). Prior to dosing on Day 1, subjects 
will be randomized to receive one of three treatment schemes as outlined in Table 3. The 
randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_49872]® software. One copy of the randomization list will be provided to the pharmacist for 
preparation of the appropriate treatment. Subjects withdra wn from the study retain their 
randomization number, if already given. New subjects must always be allotted a new 
randomization number. Once assigned, randomization numbers must not be reused within the 
study site. 
Subjects who drop- out for any reason or w ithdraw consent prior to dosing will be considered as 
screen failures. Such subjects will not receive a unique subject number. The Investigator will 
keep a screening log of all screen failure subjects, along with the reasons for their screen failure.  
7.3.2. Alloc ation of Subject Numbers  
Once a subject has signed the ICF, that subject will be assigned an 8- digit subject identification 
number (subject ID) e.g. 01001001. The first two digits is for country, the next [ADDRESS_52279] they are replacing + 100, 
e.g., replacement for [ADDRESS_52280].  
Subjects will be discontinued from the clinical study for any of the following reasons:  
• Females who are pregnant according to a positive pregnancy test, 
• Positive screening of alcohol and/or drugs of abuse, 
• If following the first dose , a subject develops any rash related to the study drug. 
Furthermore, participation in the clinical study could be discontinued by [CONTACT_49873]:  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
46 
    • Clinically significant abnormality on vital signs, clinical laboratory, or physical 
examination assessments, as assessed by [CONTACT_1719],  
• Rash or manifestation of hypersensitivity reaction such as lymphadenopathy, fever, or facial swelling related to the study dr ugs, 
• Noncompliance with the protocol requirements (e.g., blood collection deviations which may impact the PK profile),  
• The subject is uncooperative during the study, 
• Occurrence of intolerable adverse event (AE),  
• Lost to follow -up, 
• Unanticipated event which  could result in an inadequately characterized PK profile, 
such as missed blood draws, AE, or need to use concomitant medications. 
If a subject prematurely discontinues, or is discontinued from the study, the primary reason for the discontinuation will be obtained and recorded on the CRF.  
Replacement subjects may be added at SKLSI’s discretion, in agreement with the investigator. 
7.4.2. Pharmacokinetic Criteria for Adjustment or Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49836]- defined Pharmacokinetic criteria for adjusting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49837]. Subject 
termination will be governed by [CONTACT_49874], tolerability and Investigator discretion.  
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
SK Life Science, Inc.  (SKLSI) may te rminate the study at any time. For reasonable cause, either 
the Investigator or  the IRB may terminate the study as well. Conditions that may warrant 
termination include,  but are not limited to: 
• subjec t or investigator noncompliance,  
• unsatisfactory subject enrollment,  
• lack of adherence to protocol procedures,  
• lack of evaluable and/or comple te data,  
• potentially unac ceptable risk to study subjects, 
• decision to modify drug development plan,  
• decision by [CONTACT_28282].  
Written notification that includes the reason for the protocol termination is required.

 [ADDRESS_52281] of a balanced 
representation of genders and ethnic groups to the extent possible.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table 4), is essential and required for study conduct. Continued eligibility will be 
assessed upon entry into the clinic prior to the start of each visit.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eligibility criteria. The subject’s selected by [CONTACT_49875]. The investigator will maintain a screening log in order to record details of all 
screened subjects and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
Subjects may be re- screened only once within an appropriate time window in case of out of range

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Please refer to Table [ADDRESS_52316] i n the study shall be reported to the Medical Monitor, SK Life 
Science, Inc. (SKLSI), and  IQVIA  on the Pregnancy Reporting Form, faxing and emailing the 
form as per the Table of Contact ( Table 12 to Table 14) , within 24 hours of the knowledge of its 
occurrence by [CONTACT_18370] (for pregnancies occurring during the course of the 
study or immediately following the end of the study). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an 
AE, unless there is a s uspi[INVESTIGATOR_49846] a contraceptive medication. The Investigator must discuss with the medical 
monitor/Sponsor, in conjunction with the Institutional Board (IRB), whether or not it would be  
appropriate for the subject to continue in the study. Because of the possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been exposed to the investigational product through the parent and for the subject’s safety, the pregnancy will be followed up to determine i ts outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons sh ould not be reported as an AE or SAE. All reports of 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
The pregnancy will be recorded on a Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_49891]. Pregnancy follow -up will also be properly recorded to ensure quality 
and completeness of the data belonging to the investigational product and will include an 
assessment of the possible causal relation between the investigationa l product and any pregnancy 
outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Contraception for Female Subjects  
Sexually active female subjects of reproductive potential must use an approved method of 
contraception during the entire study and for [ADDRESS_52317] dose of study medication. Hormonal contraceptives alone will not be considered an adequate method of contraception.  
Women of childbearing/reproductive potential are defined as: Any female who has experienced menarche and does not meet the criteria for “Women Not of Childbearing Potential” (see below).  
Acceptable contraception methods include:  
• Hormonal contraception (f or at least 3 months prior to the Screening visit) in 
combination with a barrier method;  
• Intrauterine device (placement at least 3 months prior to the Screening visit); 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 64  
    
 • Diaphragm with spermicide;  
• Cervical cap;  
• Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation at leas t [ADDRESS_52318] 6 months prior to the Screening visit) with 
appropriate medical documentation;  
• Abstinence (however, if the subject becomes sexually active, one of the above methods must be utilized).  
Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]). Postmenopausal status is defined as absent menses for at least 12 months and confirmed serum 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) levels equal to or greater than 25.8 mIU/mL at the Screening 
visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Contraception for Male Subjects  
Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential may be enrolled if they are:  
• Surgically ste rile (vasectomy) with appropriate medical documentation;  
• Practicing true abstinence;  
• Using two adequate forms of highly effective contraception including condom with 
spermicide gel/foam/cream and one additional barrier method for subject’s female 
partner l ike hormonal contraception, occlusive cap (cervical cap or diaphragm) with 
spermicide or intrauterine device.  
Contraception methods (including abstinence) must be used by [CONTACT_49892] [ADDRESS_52319] agree to the contraceptive requirements.  
For male subjects with female partner(s) of non -childbearing potential (i.e., post-menopausal or 
post-surgical sterilization) for at least [ADDRESS_52320] all AEs observed, queried, or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_748]. 
Review of  concomitant medications will occur throughout the study. 
Should subjects choose to withdraw early from the study, they will be advised of the safety precautions that should be taken. The subjects that withdraw early from the study will be contact[CONTACT_49893] e personnel via phone as a follow -up one -week (± 2 days) post discharge or 
withdrawal date.  
Pregnancies identified during the study will be reported to SKLSI with 24 hours.

 12.2.1. Definition s of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE  is defined as any untoward m edical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical 
investigation . This AE  does not necessarily need to have  a causal relationship with the treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., a clinically significant 
abnorma l laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. 
An AE may be:  
• A new illness,  
• Worsening of a concomitant illness or a baseline event, 
• An effect of the study treatment; it could be an abnormal laboratory value as well as a 
significant shift from baseline within normal range which the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_49847].  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs . They are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
required surgery .  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the treatment period.  Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_49894](s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment .  In the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history.  
A suspected adverse reaction  (SAR)  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study treatment caused the adverse event . ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE . A suspect ed 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any AE caused by a study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE  or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in d eath,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires nonscheduled (not routine or planned) subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ 24 hours 
or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ 24 hours,  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substa ntial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions),  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, 
• Is an important medical event  defined as an event that does not fit one of the other 
outcomes but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes .  Examples include 
allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) requiring treatment in an 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 66  
    
 emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), or seizure/convulsion 
that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  The development of drug dependence or drug 
abuse would be other examples of important medical events.  
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome 
of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49848], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49849].  
• An Emergency Room visit is not considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for  seriousness should be regarded as  
non-serious AEs  
• A pre- existing condition  is one that is present at the start of the study .  A pre -
existing condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
• At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE. 
Detailed information about intensity, relationship to study drug, expectedne ss, serious criteria, 
follow -up and reporting of AEs and SAEs are provided in Section 12.2. 
Special attention must be given to findings and symptoms re lated to rash and/or hypersensitivity 
that might be linked to DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome. For details, see Section 12.5.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity Assessment  
The Investigator or the designated person will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE 
by [CONTACT_44745] a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s CRF.  In classification of AEs, the term “severe” is not the same as “serious”. Severity is a description of 
the intensity of a specific event. The term “serious” relates to a subject/event outcome or action 
criteria, usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or f unctioning. 
All adverse events will be graded according to the severity scale below. General descriptions of each severity grade may be found in Table 10  
Table  10: General Descriptions of Severity Scale  
Severity Scale  General Descriptions  
Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated; The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
daily activities.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 67  
    
 Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; The AE interferes with 
daily activities, but the subject is still able to function.  
Severe  Not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; The AE is incapacitating and requires 
medical intervention.  
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate evaluation of the severity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality Assessment  
An assessment should be made of the causal relationship of the adverse event to the study 
treatment, i.e., according to the following definitions in Table 11. 
Table  11: Definitions of Causality Assessment  
Causality 
Assessment  Definitions  
Unrelated  The event is occurring before dosing  
The event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_49895] a reasonable (poor) temporal relationship with drug 
treatment  
And/or the event is readily explained by t he subject’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_49896]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_49897], abates upon discontinuation 
of drug  
And/or event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.  
Definite  Distinct temporal relationsh ip with drug treatment, abates upon discontinuation of 
drug (de -challenge) and is confirmed by [CONTACT_49898] (re -challenge)  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related).  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationsh ip 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “related.”  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 68  
    
 If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considere d to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102]/subject and/or in response to an open question from the study personnel or reve aled by [CONTACT_49899]. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as AEs.  However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
disco ntinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs and SAEs will be collected from the from first administration of study 
drug through the follow up visit. The AE term should be reported in standard me dical 
terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_49900]  12.2.  An AE of severe intensity may 
not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur in a subject or a male subject’s partner, it must be reported and 
recorded on SKLSI’s pregnancy form.  Pregnancy in itself is not rega rded as an AE unless there 
is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital ab normality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions wi thout complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
12.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
12.5.1. Routine Reporting  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation of adverse events for each subject extends from the signing of the informed consent form until their last  visit including the follow -
up visit or early termination, whichever is longer.   
All events reported by [CONTACT_423], observed by [CONTACT_49885] (events, such as abnormal, clinically significant findings from physical examinations, ECG tracings, labora tory assessments, 
and vital sign measurements), or elicited by [CONTACT_49901]’s source document and reported as an adverse event and captured in the adverse 
events CRF. If necessary, every effort will be made to obt ain an adequate follow -up of the 
subjects. Should any subject choose to withdraw early from the study, they will be advised of the safety precautions to be taken.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 69  
    
 Early Termination and End of Study (EOS) visit assessments should be performed, including the  
following: medical history, vital signs, physical exam, safety and clinical laboratory tests, ECG, 
and adverse event/concomitant monitoring.  
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of each visit and before their departure from the clinical site.  Open -ended questions will be asked. 
Classification will be performed by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  with  the version specified by 
[CONTACT_49902] . 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of events) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe vomiting is known to 
result in dehydration, it i s sufficient to record only vomiting as SAE or AE in the CRF.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. 
12.5.2. Serious Adverse Reporting  
The Inves tigator or any other study center personnel’s knowledge will notify any SAEs including 
fatal or life -threatening to SK Life Science, Inc. (SKLSI) and their designee IQVIA on an SAE 
report form, without regard to causality, within [ADDRESS_52321].  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE, laboratory values received after the report, or hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_44458]) must be documented 
and an updated SAE report form should be forwarded to the Sponsor and their designee IQVIA within 24 hours of new/updated information.  All follow -up information must be reported as 
soon as the relevant informati on is available.  The notification of all SAE’s should be directed to 
the following Sponsor representatives  (Table 12 and Table 13) .

Method  Contact [CONTACT_49905] [ADDRESS_52322] be used for reporting  
DRESS=Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms; SAE=serious adverse event; SKLSI=SK Life Science, Inc.;  
At the time of the initial SAE report, the investigator should provide as much of the following 
information as possible:  
• Study identifier;  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 71  
    
 • Study site;  
• Subject numbe r; 
• A description of the event;  
• Date of onset;  
• Current Status;  
• Whether study drug was discontinued;  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious;  
• Investigator’s assessment of the association between the event and study drug. 
Any adverse event that is c onsidered serious will be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_49906]/or by [CONTACT_49907] 3 working days. Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening SAE 
will be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_49908] 24 hours.  
SKLSI will be respo nsible for evaluating the events for expedited reporting, and for reporting 
them to the applicable regulatory agencies.  
If reports of any new and unexpected AEs become available to SKLSI during the clinical portion 
of this study (related or not to the pres ent study), SKLSI must advise the clinical site, through its 
Principal Investigator, of those events.  
12.5.3. Rash/Hypersensitivity/DRESS Syndrome  
Drug -induced hypersensitivity reactions with or without multi organ involvement (allergic 
reactions which may be fatal) including DRESS syndrome have been seen in patients taking cenobamate. DRESS which has occurred in <1% of clinical trial participants taking cenobamate 
stands for Drug Reaction (or Rash) with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms. This condition 
occurs usually in the first 8 weeks after initiation of treatment and rarely happens afterwards.  
Symptoms of DRESS may include:  
• Rash;  
• Fever;  
• Inflammation of internal organs;  
• Lymphadenopathy;  
• Eosinophilia;  
• Thrombocytopenia.  
In order to ensure patient safety, and allo w early identification and rapid intervention in 
suspected DRESS cases, the following measures must be followed:  
• Any patient who reports a rash or is observed to have a rash should be carefully evaluated for a drug hypersensitivity syndrome; the evaluation should include hematology and chemistry blood tests. If a subject reports a rash by [CONTACT_756], an unscheduled visit should be performed promptly.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 72  
    
 • At the end of their study participation, all subjects must be informed to report any 
rash, hypersensitivity reaction or DRESS related symptoms to the investigative site as soon as they experience it. 
During Study Day 4 (prior to discharge from CRU) , subjects will be provided a safety card with 
the following hypersensitivity information and will be instructed to carry with them at all times:  
• Rash may occur and may progress to Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). 
• Rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, and swelling) may herald a s erious medical event and that the patient should report 
any such occurrence to the investigative site immediately.  
• Instructions on whom and where to call in the event a symptom arises and information that can be provided to an emergency room in the event t he subject 
cannot reach the investigator site.  
• Reminder to check skin daily for evidence of rash for the first four months of therapy  
At the end of their study participation, all subjects must be informed to report any rash, 
hypersensitivity reaction or DR ESS related symptoms to the investigative site as soon as they 
experience it.  
In addition, please remind all patients to call your office immediately if they experience any of 
the following symptoms:  
• Rash;  
• Fever;  
• Swollen lymph nodes in your neck;  
• Abdominal  or chest pain;  
• Puffy face or ankles;  
• Yellowing of skin or eyes. 
Investigators will be instructed to identify local specialists in dermatology, cardiology, nephrology and hepatology who can be call upon onto immediately to see the patient and manage their condition if  DRESS syndrome is suspected.  
The SK Life Science, Inc . (SKLSI) and their designee (see SAE Contact [CONTACT_49909]  12.5.2)  must be  notified immediately of any suspected cases of DRESS syndrome as an 
SAE.

 13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
This section presents a summary of the planned clinical pharmacology and safety analyses for 
this study.  
Safety statistical analysis deta ils will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for this 
study. Clinical pharmacology analysis details (including the definition of the PK population) will be provided in the Clinical Pharmacology Data Analysis Plan (CPAP).  
The Biostatistics De partment of the CRO or SKLSI will generate the SAP. The SKLSI Clinical 
Pharmacology Department will generate the CPAP. Both the SAP and CPAP will be finalized prior to clinical database lock. Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed  the 
study and all data have been entered in the clinical study database.  
Any deviation from the SAP and/or CPAP will be reported in the section “Changes in Planned Analysis” in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Statistical analyses will be performed using appropriate statistical software, such as SAS (Version 9.4 or above). PK parameters will be calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 8.1 or above).  
13.1.1. Sample Size and Power 
The number of subjects to be enrolled was chosen based on practical considerations and is considered sufficient for the study objectives. No formal sample size calculation was performed.  
13.1.2. Analysis Populations  
• Safety Population : All subjects who have received one dose of cenobamate   
• PK Population : All subjects who have received one dose of cenobamate and have 
sufficient quantifiable PK samples to calculate primary PK parameters appropriately. The final decision to include subjects in the PK population set took into consideration 
possible AEs affec ting the disposition of cenobamate (e.g., vomiting or diarrhea). 
Reasons supporting each decision will be clearly stated in the clinical study report. A 
sensitivity analysis may be performed if deemed necessary to support a subject’s exclusion or inclusion. 
13.1.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
This section will be further detailed in the CPAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
The PK parameters that will be derived from the cenobamate concentration versus time profiles, where data permit, are listed in  Table 16.  
The plasma PK parameters will be estimated using a non -compartmental approach. A linear -up, 
log-down approach will be used to estimate the area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve, and the terminal half -life will be estimated where appropriate.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037

Other PK parameters will be determined if deemed appropriate. Details of the PK analysis will 
be provided in the CPAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Formulation and Food Effect Analysis  
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare suspension vs. tablet formulations 
and suspension under fed vs. suspension under fasted conditions. PK parameter (C max, AUC last, 
and  AUC ∞) values will be log -transformed for all subjects included in the PK population set and 
the ratio and corresponding 90% CIs for the ratio of the test (suspension or fed) vs . reference 
(tablet or fasted) will be compared. An absence of effect will be concluded if the 90% CIs lie 
within the 80% -  125% predefined boundaries.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis on T max 
For each subject, the Wilcoxon signed- rank test will be used to test for differences in  tmax. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary and Presentation of PK Data and Parameters in the CSR  
Individual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling time point for cenobamate will be presented in listings and tables with descriptive summary statistics including mean, geometric  
mean, range, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV). Individual, mean and/or 
median concentrations per treatment group will be plotted versus time on semi -logarithmic 
scales.  
Summary statistics of PK parameters including mean, geometric mean, median, range, SD and 
CV will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].

 13.2. Other Statistical Analyses  
13.2.1. Efficacy Analysis  
No formal efficacy analysis will be performed.  
13.2.2. Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed through AEs, clinical laboratory, vi tal signs, and physical 
examination findings, and any other parameter that are relevant for safety assessment. Full 
details of the safety analysis to be performed will be included in the SAP. 
13.2.3. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). MedDRA terms will be used to summarize AEs by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that were started or 
worsened on or after the date of the first dose of study medication (Day 1) to the follow -up visit 
(Day 69).  
A listing of all individual AEs will be provided. Summary tables of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_3592], including a table containing the number of subjects experiencing AEs by [CONTACT_6490], and a table containing the number of subjects experiencing SAEs by [CONTACT_1570] (if 
applicable). Details of the  AE summary analyses  will be described in Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
13.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessment s 
All lab data will be displayed as International System of units (SI) and may be converted into 
other systems (e.g., [LOCATION_002] customary system [USCS or USC]) for reporting and 
processing purposes, as appropriate.  
Clinical laboratory data will be listed and accompanied by [CONTACT_49910] a summary listing of all data assessed by [CONTACT_49911]. Clinical laboratory data will also be summarized descriptive ly.  
13.2.5. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be listed, and presented descriptively, where applicable.

to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) guidel ines. On- site checking of the  eCRFs for 
completeness and clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of 
administrative matters will be performed.  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_49914]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_49915] a representative  of the Sponsor  (site monitor) who will review the eCRFs and source 
documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol 
design and regulatory requirements. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of S KLSI, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics Committee 
or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an SKLSI audit or inspection is to systematically and 
independently examine all study- related activities and documents to determine whether these 
activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according 
to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International  Conference on 
Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact [CONTACT_49916] a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
14.2.1. Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
SKLSI or designee will ensure secure access to and training on the EDC application, sufficient to 
permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the eCRFs for the subjects for which they 
are responsible.  
The eCRFs will be completed for each study subject. It is the Investigator’s responsi bility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should document the dates and detail s of study procedures, adverse 
events, other observations, and subject status. 
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected. An explanation should be provided for all missing da ta. 
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information, and the date and time of the correction. Investigators must provide through the EDC application formal approval of all the information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endor se the final submitted data for the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
SKLSI or designee will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival eCRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the Investigator’s study file.

2/Protocol GO28667, Version 9PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 9:
RATIONA LE
Protocol GO28667, Version 9, merges the global and Version 8 (Korea) protocols .
Protocol GO28667 , Version 9, encompasses the cumulative changes to the protocol that 
were made to Version 8 (Korea) along with changes specific to Version 9.
Changes specific to Version 9 include the extension of study duration and addition of the 
optional Re-Treatment/Crossover ( R/C) Substudy .  These changes , along with a 
rationale for each change, are summarized below:
An exploratory objective has been added to evaluate best overall response rate 
(ORR) to next anti -chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_093] (Section 2.7).
An optional R/CSubstudy has been added (Sections 2.8, 3.1, 3.1.3, 3.2, 3.3.7, 
[IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], 5.3.1, 6.12, 6 .12.1, 6.12.2, and Appendix 14) . At the 
interim analysis (now primary analysis), the study demonstrated that venetoclax and 
rituximab (venetoclax R)is superior to bendamustine and rituximab (BR) in 
patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.  The primary endpoint of investigator 
assessed progression -free survival (PFS)showed significant improvement with 
venetoclax R with a hazard ratio of 0.17 (95% CI:0.11, 0.25; p0.0001). Key 
secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS), ORR ,and complete response 
rate, also showed consistent clinically meaningful improvements (Seymour et al. 
2018) . Therefore, the Sponsor would now like to include a noptional R/C S ubstudy 
to allow:
–Eligible patients from Arm A ( venetoclax R)who have clinically progressed 
after finishing treatment , have not received new anti -CLL therapy , and are in 
need of treatment have the option to receive treatment with venetoclax R 
again (re- treatment) . This will allow the Sponsor to study the outcomes of 
patients who are re -treated with venetoclax R following prior venetoclax R 
treatment.
–Eligible patients from Arm B (BR) who have clinically progressed after finishing 
treatment, have not received new anti -CLL therapy, and are in need of 
treatment have the option to cross over and receive venetoclax R given the 
results of the primary analysis demonstrating superior outcome for
venetoclax Rtreatment .
The study duration is extended for an additional 45 months to allow for the collection 
of long -term data including safety, PFS, and OS.  At the primary read out, PFS and 
OS outcomes for patients in the venetoclax Rarm exceed original protocol 
expectations, thus requiring longer follow -up to enable estimation of a robust 
efficacy and median PFS (Sections 3.1 and [IP_ADDRESS] ,and Appendix 1).
The reporting ofsecondary malignancies has been extende dafter the reporting 
period to capture all events regardless of causality in order to satisfy health authority 
requirements (Sections 3.1, 5.3.1, and 6.12.2).
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
3/Protocol GO28667, Version 9The r ationale for biomarker assessments has been updated to include 
next-generation sequencing analysis (Section 3.3.5). These analys eswill provide a 
comprehensive characterization of g enomics to enable the understanding of disease 
pathobiology .
Information regarding continued access to venetoclax has been updated to align 
with [COMPANY_002] Global Policy (Section 4.3.4).
Sample collection for peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) samples has 
been extended until clinical progression because patients have demonstrated 
persistent MRD negativity and there is a need to better understand the MRD kinet ics 
over longer period of time (Appendix 1).
Additional changes to the protocol include:
To further strengthen safety monitoring for special situations that may or may not 
result in an adverse event, instructions have been added to Sections [IP_ADDRESS], 4.3.2 .2, 
[IP_ADDRESS]., 5.4,and 5.4.4 regarding the reporting of medication errors, accidental 
overdose, drug abuse, and drug misuse (Section [IP_ADDRESS] "Overdoses" has been 
deleted and subsequent sections re -numbered appropriately ; new language has 
been added in Section 5.4; and Section 5.4.4 has been included).
The reporting of the term “sudden death” has been updated to also require the 
presumed cause of death (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Event reporting for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26588] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Medical r esponsible has changed and contact [CONTACT_26704] 
(Sections 5.4.1, 5.4.2, [IP_ADDRESS], and 5.6).
The process for reviewing and handling protocol deviations has been updated per 
internal standard operating procedures (Section 9.2).
Changes to Version 8 (Korea) , along with a rationale for each change, are summarized 
below:
The description ofthe fixed sequence testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints in 
the statistical section of the protocol was streamlined and the details of the testing of 
secondary endpoints will be set out in the statistical analysis plan, in accordance 
with the international guideline on Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ICH E9).  
This amendment is implemented to allow for a change in the clinical prioritization of
the secondary efficacy endpoints to mirror the evolving relapsed/refractory CLL 
therapeutic and scientific landscape .
Minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency of the secondary 
efficacy endpoints. 
The sample list of prohibited and c autionary medications in Appendix 9 has been 
updated, incorporating the Food and Drug Administration ’s updated guidelines .
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This v ersion of the protocol represents 
cumulative changes from all previous amendments to the protocol.

Description of Study
This is an open -label, international, multicenter, randomized, phase III study to investigate the 
efficacy  and safety of venetoclax in combination with rituximab ( venetoclax R) compared with 
bendamustine in combination with rituxima b (BR) in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.
Approximately 370 patients will be recruited from approximately 150 centers in up to 
29countries and randomly  assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either venetoclax R (Arm A) or BR 
(Arm B).  Randomization wi ll be stratified according to the following factors:
17p deletion:  yes or no
Risk status:  high risk or low risk
High risk:  defined as harboring 17p deletion or no response to front -line 
chemotherapy -containing regimen or relapsed within 12 months after chemotherapy or 
within 24 months after chemoimmunotherapy
Low risk:  defined as relapse more than 12 months after chemotherapy or 24 months 
after che motherapy or chemoimmunotherapy
Geographic region:  [LOCATION_002]/Canada, Australia/New Zealand, W estern Eu rope, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, or Latin America
Patients randomized to Arm A (venetoclax R) will have a [ADDRESS_25994] not progresse d following the completion of the 6 cycles will continue 
to receive venetoclax until disease progression or for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1 
Day1.
Patients randomized to Arm B (BR) will receive [ADDRESS_25995] clinical and laboratory examinations and comput ed 
tomography (CT) scans according to international workshop on Chronic Ly mphocytic Leukemia 
(iwCLL) guidelines at screening and at the following timepoints (selected to mirror those used in 
current phase III CLL protocols [CLL10, CLL11]):
Clinical respons e assessment only on Day 1 of every cy cle of combination therapy
Full response assessment, including CT scans, at interim response assessment (within 
14days of Cy cle 4 Day 1)
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
17/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Clinical response assessment only at completion of combination therapy (4 weeks 7days 
after Day [ADDRESS_25996] c ycle of rituximab venetoclax [Arm A] or BR [Arm B] or Day [ADDRESS_25997] treatment cy cle in case of early termination)
Full response assessments, including CT scans, at 8 12weeks after combination therapy 
(defined as 8 12 weeks after Day 1 of Cy cle6 or 8 12weeks after Day [ADDRESS_25998] cy cle 
for early termination).
Following 6 cycles of combination therapy, patients in both arms will be followed clinically ever y 
3months through Year 3 from initiation of combination th erapy (Cycle 1 Day 1).  Patients will 
then be followed every [ADDRESS_25999].  At each follow -up visit, patients will be assessed for response/progression by 
[CONTACT_26712].  After PD, patients will enter survival follow- up and be followed for 
OS.  Information on new anti-CLL ther apy will also be collected at survival follow -up.  This 
survival follow -up may be conducted by [CONTACT_756].  If eligible, patients randomized to either 
Arm A or A rm B who have PD, are in need of therapy (per iwCLL), and have not received 
new anti -CLL therapy have the option to enter the R/C Substudy with venetoclax R.
At any time during the study when clinical or laboratory findings suggest that the response may 
have improved from stable disease (SD) to PR, or from PR to CR, imaging should be performed 
to confirm the response.  Imaging is not routinely required to determine progressive disease 
(PD), as objective evidence of PD is most often documented by [CONTACT_26713].  However, when PD cannot be documented by [CONTACT_26714], imaging is required to document PD detected by [CONTACT_26715].  A bone marrow biops y may also be conduct ed at any time during the 
study to confirm a CR.
A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26591] (CR PR) at 
the End of Combination Treatment Response Visit.  In addition, MRD samples in the peripheral 
blood are collected at baseline, within 14 days of C4D1 (interim assessment), completion of 
combination therapy/early treatment termination visit (if applicable), End of Combination 
Treatment Response Visit, and at the timepoints specified in Appendix 1 during the follow -up or 
at any visit during the follow -up where a patient has a response (PR or CR status).  Samples 
will be measured at a central laborator y.
After disease progressi on during the follow -up period , patients will be followed for OS and new 
anti-CLL therapy every 24 weeks until the end of study.  This follow -up may  be conducted by 
[CONTACT_756].
Patients who receive a new anti -CLL therapy any time during follow -up in the absence of PD will 
be followed on the same schedule of assessment (see protocol) for PD and then for OS.
Patients who discontinue all components of study therapy either prior to completion of planned 
therapy or prior to disease progression (e.g., for toxicity) will continue to be followed for MRD 
levels, PD, and OS (regardless of whether they subsequently receive new anti -CLL therapy).
An independent review of the responses of all patients will also be conducted to confirm the 
primary  PFS endpoint, including blinded review of clinical and laboratory findings as well as 
blinded radiology review of imaging a ssessments.
Re-Treatment /Crossover Substudy (Optional at Investigator’s Discretion)
If eligible, patients in either Arm A or Arm B who have progressed clinically , are in need of 
therapy (per iwCLL) and have not received new anti -CLL therapy have the optio n to enter the 
R/C Substudy:
Patients randomized to Arm A (venetoclax R) may receive re -treatment with 
venetoclax R.
Patients randomized to Arm B (BR) may cross over from the BR arm to receive 
venetoclax R treatment.
Patients entering the R/C Substudy w ill have a [ADDRESS_26000] day of each 28 -day 
cycle.  Patients will continue to take their daily dose of venetoclax during the rituximab

18/Protocol GO28667, Version 9cycles.  Patients who have not progressed following the completion of the 6 cycles will 
continue to receive venetoclax monotherapy until disease progression or for a maximum of 
2years from Cycle 1R/C Day 1 of the R/C Substudy.
An EOCTR -R/C Visit will be scheduled 12 weeks after Cycle 6R/C Day [ADDRESS_26001].  After the EOCTR -R/C Visit, patients who have not 
progressed will be followed cli nically every 24 weeks (Follow -Up R/C Visits).  Follow -Up R/C 
Visits will continue until completion of venetoclax treatment at 2 years from Cycle 1R/C 
Day1 (Completion of Venetoclax Treatment Response in the Re -treatment/Crossover 
Substudy[COVTR -R/C] Visit) or PD, whichever occurs first.  If patients discontinue early 
due to toxicity or at disease progression, EOCTR -R/C Visit will b e scheduled immediately.  
After the COVTR -R/C Visit or disease progression, patients should be followed for OS, PD (if 
not progressed already), and new anti -CLL therapy.  These Survival Follow Up Visits will be 
captured every 24 weeks until the end of stud y and may be conducted by [CONTACT_756].
A full tumor assessment is required at Screening -R/C and EOCTR -R/C Visits by [CONTACT_26716], bone marrow evaluation 
and CT scans according to iwCLL guidelines.  The EOCTR -R/C Visit is to be scheduled 
12weeks ( 7 days) after Cycle 6R/C Day 1. Following the EOCTR -R/C Visit, patients will 
be followed clinically every 24 weeks in Follow- Up R/C Visits until the COVTR -R/C Visit.  
Patients will also have a clinical response assessment at the COVTR -R/C Visit to be 
scheduled at the completion of venetoclax monotherapy (i.e., 2 years from Cycle 1R/C Day 1).  
If patients discontinue prior to completion of venetoclax treatment, COVTR -R/C Visit will be 
scheduled immediately.  Add itional response assessments may be performed according to 
institutional guidelines and recorded in eCRFs.  Additional CT scan evaluations should be 
performed during Follow -Up R/C or COVTR -R/C Visits to confirm a suspected change in 
response status, that i s, SD to PR or PR to CR/CRi.  If a patient’s response improves to a CR 
or CRi during Follow -Up R/C or COVTR -R/C Visits, a bone morrow biopsy must be 
performed to confirm the CR.

25/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the study 
according to institutional standards, including the use of growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin) if 
clinically indicated.  Granulocyte colony -stimula ting factor (G -CSF) may be administered as 
primary  prophylaxis in each cy cle of therapy, as per the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO) guidelines or each site’s institutional standards.
Anti-emetic therapy may be instituted for any patient if cli nically indicated.  Bendamustine has a 
moderate risk of emesis.  It is recommended that bendamustine infusions be administered 
following premedication with a serotonin ( 5-HT3) antagonist (i.e., dolaset ron, ondansetron, etc.) 
or as per institutional practic e.
Systemic steroid therapy will not be allowed either during or within [ADDRESS_26021] dose 
of study treatment with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), single infusions of hydrocortisone prior to 
rituximab infusions, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], or replacement corticosteroid therapy for an inherited or 
acquired deficiency.
Premedication before rituximab infusion:
Oral acetaminophen/paracetamol (650 1000 mg) at least 30 minutes prior to the start of 
infusion (mandator y for all infusions)
Antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (25 50 mg) approximately [ADDRESS_26022] infusion for all subsequent infusions unless previous antibody infusions did 
not result in an IRR NCICTCAE Grade 1 and there was no interruption to the infusion.
A single dose of hydrocortisone (up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) 
may also be administered with rituximab if this is the usual practice at the site.
Prop hylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
Clinical data from CLL patients treated to date with venetoclax suggest that patients with 
baseline ly mph nodes 5cm diameter are at a greater risk for TLS than those with baseline 
lymph nodes less than 5 cm.  In addition, the data showed that creatinine clearance of 
80mL/min at screening was a secondary risk factor for TLS.  On the basis of the data review 
perfo rmed by [CONTACT_26721], the following are three TLS risk categories identified:
1.TLS l ow-risk category : the presence of all measurable ly mph nodes with the largest 
diam eter5cm by [CONTACT_26722] 25109/L
2.TLS medium-risk category : the presence of all measurable ly mph nodes with the largest 
diam eter5cm and 10cm by  [CONTACT_26723] 25109/L
3.TLS high-risk category : the presence of any ly mph node with the largest diameter 10cm 
by [CONTACT_26724] 25109/L AND a measurable ly mph node with the largest diameter 5cm by 
[CONTACT_26725] c ategorized in a TLS risk 
categor y as described above.
Initial Doses:  [ADDRESS_26023] doses of venetoclax :

25109/L AND a measurable ly mph node with the largest diameter 5cm but less than 
10cm by  [CONTACT_26729] a re-evaluation of their TLS risk category based on 
their most recent ALC for dose increases above 50 mg.  Based on those results, one of the 
following two options may be implemented:
If the patient’s ALC decreases to 25×109/L, the patient ma y be categorized as TLS 
medium -risk and follow the management guidelines for the TLS medium -risk category for 
subsequent dose increases (to 100, 200, 400 mg) of venetoclax during the Ramp -Up Period.
If the patient’s ALC remains 25109/L, the patient will re main in the TLS high -risk category 
and continues to follow management guidelines for TLS high -risk patients for subsequent dose 
increases of venetoclax during the Ramp -Up Period.  Re -assessment of the patient’s TLS risk

Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
Efficacy
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is investigator -assessed PFS, defined as the time from 
randomization to the first occurrence of progression or relapse (determined using standard 
iwCLL guide lines), or death from any cause, whichever comes first.  For patients who have not 
progressed, relapsed, or died at the time of analysis, PFS will be censored on the date of the 
last disease assessment.  If no disease assessments were performed after the b aseline visit, 
PFS will be censored at the time of randomization [ADDRESS_26042] (0.05 significance 
level, appropriately adjusted for an interim analysis) stratified by 17p deletion status (yes or no), 
risk status (high or low risk) ,and geographic region ([LOCATION_002]/Canada, Australia/New 
Zealand, W estern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, or Latin America).  If the null 
hypothesis is rejected and the observed hazard ratio is favorable for the venet oclax R 
combination, then it is shown that venetoclax R has significantly longer PFS than BR.
If the study meets its primary endpoint of prolonging PFS assessed by [CONTACT_26730] , then formal statistical test sof specific key secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
performed. To adjust for multiple testing of the primary  and key secondar y efficacy endpoints, 
thereby [CONTACT_26731] I error rate at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, a fixed 
sequence testing pr ocedure will be used.  Additional secondary endpoints will not be tested formally. 
Further details of the fixed sequence testing will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan .
Secondary efficacy outcome measures include:
Investigator -assessed PFS in patients with 17p deletion per central laboratory FISH test
IRC-assessed PFS in patients with 17p deletion per central laboratory FISH test
Investigator -assessed best OR rate, CR, CRi, nPR, and PR rates
IRC-assessed best OR rate, CR, CRi, nPR, and PR rates 
OR, CR, CRi, nPR, and PR rates at end of combination treatment response visit as
assessed by [CONTACT_093]
OR, CR, CRi, nPR, and PR rates at end of combination treatment response visit, as 
determined by [CONTACT_26732]
OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  
Patients who were not reported as having died at the time of analysis will be censored at 
the date when they were last known to be alive as d ocumented by [CONTACT_093].
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
31/Protocol GO28667, Version 9EFS,defined as the time between date of randomization and the date of disease 
progression/relapse, death, or start of a new anti -CLL treatment. If the specified event (disease 
progression/relapse, death, start of a new anti -CLL treatment) does not occur, patients will be 
censored at the date of last tumor assessment.  For patients without an event who have not had post -
baseline tumor assessments, EFS will be censored at the time of randomization.
DOR ,defined for patients with a best OR of CR, CRi, nPR, or PR as the time from first 
occurrence of a documented CR or PR to disease progression/relapse as assessed by [CONTACT_26733]. For patients achieving a response who have not progressed, 
relapsed, or d ied at the time of analysis, DOR will be censored on the date of last response assessment.  
Patients who have never had responded will not be included in this analysis.
TTNT ,defined as the time from randomization to start of new non -protocol anti-CLL therapy
or death from any  cause. For patients who have not received the next anti -CLL treatment or died 
at the time of analysis, TTNT will be censored at the date when the patient was last known to be alive 
without having received additional anti -lymphoma tre atment.
MRD response rate (determined as the proportion of patients with MRD negativity) at End 
of Combination Treatment Response Visit as measured at a central laborator y on peripheral 
blood and/or bone marrow samples 
Time-to-event endpoints such as OS, EFS, and TTNT will be analyzed using the same 
statistical methods described for the primary  analysis of PFS.
Time-to-event analysis of DOR will incorporate data only from the subset of patients in both 
treatment arms that achieved a CR, CRi, nPR, or PR status.  As this a nonrandomized 
comparison, a formal statistical test will not be conducted, and the results will only be 
summarized by [CONTACT_26734].
Response rates in the treatment groups will be compared using str atified 
Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) tests.  Stratification factors are identical to those used for the 
primary  endpoint.  Rates and 95% confidence intervals will be reported for each treatment 
group.
Safety
The safety  analyses will include all randomize d patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment ( venetoclax , rituximab, or bendamustine), with patients grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.
Treatment exposure will be summarized, including the number of cy cles received by [CONTACT_26735] h 
patient, and the cumulative dose will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].
Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) thesaurus terms.  All adverse events occurring during or after the first
treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_26736].  In addition, all serious 
adverse events will be summarized.
Deaths reported during the study treatment period and those reported after treatment 
completion/discontinuation will be summari zed by [CONTACT_2939].
Adverse events leading to early treatment discontinuation and early study withdrawal will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_26737].
Laboratory data with values outside of the normal ranges will be identified.  Additionally, select 
laborator y data will be summarized by [CONTACT_26738].  Of note, 
abnormal laboratory data that are clinically significant will be reported as adverse events and 
summarized in the adverse event tables.

Pharmacodynamics
The exploratory pharmacodynamic biomarker analyses will include patients with at least one 
predose and/or one post- dose biomarker assessment, with patients grouped according to the 
treatment actually r eceived.
Blood samples for biomarker assessments will be assayed using analytically qualified methods 
(e.g., immunohistochemistry, ELISA, quantitative real -time poly merase chain reaction, and 
fluorescence -activated cell sorting).
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
32/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Pharmacokinetics
Individua l plasma concentrations of venetoclax will be tabulated after appropriate groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
summarized (e.g., mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and 
maximum), and plotted. 
Population PK methods will be used to characterize the ph armacokinetics of venetoclax in this 
study in conjunction with appropriate historical data.  Apparent clearance, apparent volume of 
distribution, and other appropriate PK parameters of venetoclax may be calculated and 
summarized as data allow.
Potential co rrelations of exposure with dose, demographics, pharmacody namic variables, safety, 
and efficacy  outcomes may be explored as warranted by [CONTACT_26739].   The results from the 
population PK analysis may be reported separately from the Clinical Study Report.
At the discretion of the Sponsor, all analyses may be extended to include relevant 
biotransformation products of venetoclax.
Patient -Reported Outcomes
Scoring for the MDASI, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC QLQ -CLL16 questionnaires will be 
based on their corresponding user manuals.  For the MDASI, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC 
QLQ -CLL16 scales with more than 50% of the constituent items completed, a pro -rated score 
will be computed consistent with the scoring manuals and validation papers.  For subscales with 
less than 50% o f the items completed, the subscale will be considered as missing.
Summary  statistics of the MDASI, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC QLQ -CLL16 scales and their 
changes from baseline will be calculated at each assessment timepoint for both study arms.  
Disease -related sy mptom progression will be measured by [CONTACT_26740] -C30 and EORTC 
QLQ -CLL questionnaires.  Time -to-event Kaplan -Meier analysis on CLL s ymptoms will be used 
to demonstrate the time from first treatment to worsening in disease -related sy mptoms.  An 
event is a change in s ymptom score by [ADDRESS_26043] to PFS are based on the 
following assumptions:
Two-sided log -rank test at the 0.05 level of significance
80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) for venetoclax R versus B R of 0.66, 
corresponding to an approximate median improvement of 15.2 months to 23 months 
(34% reduction in risk of a PFS event)
Exponential distribution of PFS
An annual dropout rate of 5%
One interim analysis for efficacy
With these assumptions, 186 PFS events are required to achieve 80% power for the primary 
analysis of PFS in all patients for detecting a trend in favor of venetoclax R arm over BR arm 
(HR 0.66).  In total, it is planned to enroll approximately 370patients across 2 arms, 
randomized with 1:1ratio.  It is expected that, after a [ADDRESS_26044] occurred in both treatment arms combined (75% of the 186 events required for the 
final primary  efficacy analysis) .

38/Protocol GO28667, Version 91. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND ON CHRONI C LYMPHOCYTIC LE[LOCATION_006]EM IA
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common of the chronic leukemias, 
comprising 30% of all adult leukemias, with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years.  CLL 
is a clonal disease of unknown etiology, characterized by [CONTACT_26742], lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow.
Morphologically, CLL cells are relatively mature appearing but immunologically 
incompetent.  About 95% of CLL is of B -cell origin (B -CLL) with a characteristic 
phenotype (CD5 , CD23 ; weak surface expression of CD19, CD20, and CD79b; and 
IgM-or IgD -restricted).  Chromosomal abnormalities of the leukemia cells are found in 
80% of cases, with the most common being deletion 13q14 (incidence 55%), 
deletion 11q- (18%), trisomy 12 (16%), and deletion 17p (7%) ( Döhner et al. 2000 ).
More than 50% of CLL patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis and require no treatment.  
Symptoms appear as the disease progresses.  Treatment is initiated when a patient’s 
disease becomes symptomatic or progressive as defined by [CONTACT_26743] (iwCLL)’s updated guidelines for diagnosis and 
treatment of CLL ( Hallek et al. 2008 ).
Response rates to initial treatment are high, but relapsed or refractory disease is often 
characterized by [CONTACT_26744] (i.e., fludarabine or alkylating agents).  
Relapsed disease is associated with a median survival between 15 and 44 months 
andis dependent of CLL risk status, time to relapse, and choice of regimen 
(Lamanna etal. 2006 ;Wierda et al. 2010 ; Badoux et al. 2011 ;Fischer et al. 2011 ).  
Rituximab is approved for the treatment of both pr eviously treated and previously 
untreated CLL in combination with chemotherapy in Europe and with fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide (FC) in the [LOCATION_002].  Besides the regimen of FC and rituximab 
(FCR), the combination regimen approved in the [LOCATION_002], one of the more 
commonly used and active regimens in relapsed CLL is the combination of 
bendamustine and rituximab (BR).  The BR regimen was demonstrated to have 
meaningful clinical activity in relapsed/refractory CLL patients with an observed overall
response (OR) rate of 59% and a median progression- free survival (PFS) of 
15.2 months ( Fischer et al. 2011).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_26607], CLL remains incurable; therefore, there is a need f or the 
development of new treatments that could improve both response rate and the survival 
of these patients.
1.2 BACKGROUND ON VENETOCLA X (GDC- 0199 )
1.2.[ADDRESS_26047] identified in follicular lymphoma (FL), where the t(14;18) 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
39/Protocol GO28667, Version 9chromosomal translocation results in significant overexpression of Bcl -2 protein in 
Bcells.  The Bcl -2 family of genes encodes a group of closely related proteins that 
exhibit pro -or anti -apoptotic activity and share up to four Bcl -2 homology domains 
(Korsmeyer 1999 ; Cory and Adams 2002; Borner 2003 ; Cory et al. 2003 ).  Bcl -2 
overexpression is a major contributor to the pathogenesis o f several lymphoid 
malignancies and is overexpressed in acute and chronic leukemias.
In CLL cells, the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR15a and miR16 -1 that negatively regulate the 
transcription of Bcl -2 are deleted or down -regulated, resulting in uncontrolled expres sion 
of Bcl-2 (Calin et al. 2008 ).  Although Bcl -2 exp ression levels are variable across 
patients, high expression of Bcl -2 (compared with normal white blood cells) is observed 
in CLL cells in 95% of CLL patients (unpublished data from Phase II study of 
ABT4710n [navitoclax]).
Bcl-[ADDRESS_26048] them into apoptosis 
(DelGaizo Moore etal.2007 ;DelGaizo Moore and Letai 2008 ).  Nonclinical data in 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cell lines support a model analogous to CLL, where 
higher levels of Bcl -2 expression correlate strongly with greater sensitivity to venetoclax
(unpublished data, Abbott Inc.).  CLL and many NHL cells are therefore dependent on 
high levels of Bcl -2 for survival, making them potentially attractive targets for venetoclax .  
Furthermore, this sensitivity to Bcl -2 inhibition may provide the possibility for a 
chemotherapy -sparing option for CLL patients.
1.2.2 Venetoclax
[IP_ADDRESS] Venetoclax Nonclinical Activity and Pharmacokinetic Profile
Venetoclax (synonymous with GDC- 0199 and ABT-199 and referred to as venetoclax
throughout the protocol) is a highly selective, orally available small- molecule Bcl -2 family 
protein inhibitor that binds with high affinity (dissociation constant [Ki] 0.10 nM) to Bcl -2 
and with lower affinity to other Bcl -2 family proteins Bcl -XLand Bcl -w (480-fold and 
2000 -fold lower affinity than to Bcl -2, respectively).  Overexpression of anti -apoptotic 
Bcl-[ADDRESS_26049] a panel of lymphoma 
and leukemia cells including B -cell FLs, mantle cell lymphomas, diffuse large B -cell 
lymphomas (DLBCLs), and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs).  Venetoclax wasespecially 
potent against cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl -2.  Leukemi a and lymphoma cell 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
40/Protocol GO28667, Version 9lines bearing the t(14;18) translocation were significantly more sensitive to venetoclax
than were wild -type cell lines.
Venetoclax inhibited subcutaneous murine xenograft growth of human tumor cell lines 
derived from acute lymphoblasti c leukemia (ALL) and NHL.
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of venetoclax was evaluated in multiple animal species.  
In mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs, low plasma clearance and low volumes of distribution 
characterized the venetoclax PK profile.  Half -lives ranged from 2.[ADDRESS_26050] on the oral bioavailability in dogs.
Venetoclax demonstrated high protein binding to human, rat, dog, and monkey plasma 
proteins ( 99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, 
heart, lungs, small intestine, and white fat, but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, 
muscle, and bone.  Liver metabolism was the major route of elimination with biliary 
excretion of the parent drug playing the sec ondary role in rats.  Venetoclax showed 
moderate metabolic stability in in vitro hepatic systems across species tested, except for 
low to moderate stability in dog hepatocytes.
In vitro, venetoclax is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 . Thus, co -administration of venetoclax 
with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 is predicted to cause a significant increase in the 
exposure of venetoclax.  At clinically relevant concentrations for the 400 mg once daily 
(QD) dose regimen, venetoclax and M27 are not predicted to inhibit or ind uce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4.  Venetoclax is a 
substrate for P -glycoprotein 1 (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).  
Active uptake of venetoclax or it’s major human metabolite(M27) was not observed in 
cells ov erexpressing organic anion transporter protein 1B1 (OATP1B1), organic anion 
transporter protein 1B3 (OATP1B3), or organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), indicating 
that venetoclax is not a substrate for those transporters in vitro.  Venetoclax is a P -gp, 
BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro.   
M27 are not predicted to inhibit or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4.
See the Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed discussion of the nonclinical 
activity of venetoclax .
[IP_ADDRESS] Veneto clax Nonclinical Toxicology
Venetoclax hasbeen assessed in repeated -dose general toxicology studies and in 
genetic, developmental/reproductive, and safety pharmacology studies.
Repeated- dose oral toxicity studies with venetoclax were conducted in mice and dogs.  
GLP-compliant definitive toxicity studies consisted of IND -enabling studies in mice and 
dogs with 4 weeks of dosing followed by a 4- week (dose -free) recovery period; a 2 -week 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
41/Protocol GO28667, Version 9toxicity study in dogs that focused on lymphocyte recovery over an extend ed (18 weeks) 
recovery period; and chronic toxicity studies in mice (6 months) and dogs (9 months).  
No recovery periods were included in the chronic toxicity studies.  The maximum 
venetoclax plasma exposures (mean AUC0 -24 h) achieved in the 4 -week studies were 
92 µg hr/mL (at 600 mg/kg/day) in mice and 572 µg hr/mL (at 150 mg/kg/day) in dogs.  
In the chronic toxicity studies, AUCs reached 34.1 µh h/mL (at 300 mg/kg/day) in mice 
and85.6 µhh/mL (at 20 mg/kg/day) in dogs .  In addition, repeat -dose toxicity studies 
(with no recovery periods) were conducted in wild -type variants of the Tg.rasH2 mouse 
strain and in Sprague- Dawley rats to select dosages for possible carcinogenicity 
assessments.
The primary toxicities associated with venetoclax administration inc luded effects on the 
hematologic system (decreased lymphocytes and erythrocytes) in mice , rats, and dogs; 
the male dog reproductive system (testicular germ cell depletion); and embryofetal 
toxicity in mice.
Venetoclax produced robust , generally dose -relate ddecreases in lymphocytes in the 
peripheral blood (up to 75% in mice, 64% in rats, and 81% in dogs) and in 
lymphoid tissues.  In dogs, the recovery of lymphocyte counts (total lymphocytes, 
CD4and CD8 Tcells and mature B cells) was prolonged, requiring up to [ADDRESS_26051] sensitive lymphocyte 
subtype based on the magnitude of decrease and/or the length of time required for 
recovery (i.e., 25% 111% of individual baseline; mean reversal to 54% of baseline 
average).  T cell subsets reversed more readily and showed more dose -dependence in 
recovery time and extent.  Decreases of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues were 
reversible in mice and reversible to partially reversible in dogs.  Venetoclax -related
decreases in lymphocytes in blood and lymphoid tissues are considered 
pharmacologically -mediated and non- adverse.
In the [ADDRESS_26052] dosages administered, decreases in hemoglobin reached 21% in mice at 
600mg/kg/d ay and 23% in dogs at 150 mg/kg/day and were considered to be adverse 
based on a criterion of -20% decrease.  In rats, decreases in hemoglobin were more 
severe than in mice and dogs at comparable exposures and reached  30% to 49% at 
150 mg/kg/day.  Hematologic parameters (lymphocyte counts and RBC mass) are 
readily monitored in clinical study subjects.
No effects of venetoclax have been identified in female reproductive tissues in mice or 
dogs in general toxicology studies.  However, in dogs, venetoc laxproduced adverse, 
non-reversible, non -dose -related microscopic findings of testicular germ cell depletion at 
all dosages tested; there were no testicular effects in mice or rats.  The translatability of 
the testicular findings in dogs to humans is unknown, but this change may be related to 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
42/Protocol GO28667, Version 9venetoclax pharmacology, as one or more members of the Bcl -2 family of proteins play a 
role in spermatogenesis ( Olderied etal.2001 ; Sugiyama et al. 2001 ; Yan et al. 2003).
Venetoclax resulted in increased postimplantation loss and decreased fetal body weights 
in the mouse embryofetal development study at the highest dosage administered 
(150 mg/kg/day); the no -observed -adverse- effect level (NOAEL) was define d at the 
mid-dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  Venetoclax wasnot teratogenic, and there were no other 
effects on development or fertility.
Venetoclax produced loss of hair pi[INVESTIGATOR_26608] (reversibility has not been 
assessed).  Evidence from Bcl-2 knockout mous e (Bcl -2 -/-) studies indicates that hair 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_26609] -2 functional loss, 
and occurs due to loss of hair follicle melanocytes dependent on Bcl -2 for survival.  A 
dedicated physical examination of the skin and extensive ophthalmic examinations 
determined that pi[INVESTIGATOR_26610] (particularly, the iris and fundus) 
of the dog appears unaffected and was confirmed by [CONTACT_26745] .
Other effects of venetoclax included single cell necr osis in various epi[INVESTIGATOR_26611] (i.e., gallbladder, stomach, exocrine pancreas, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612]).   These changes 
were minimal except for non dose- dependent, minimal to mild, single -cell necrosis in the 
pylorus of the stomach at 2 mg/kg/day in the 9 -month study.  After 4 weeks of dosing 
and a 4 -week recovery period, reversibility was observed in the gallbladder and exocrine 
pancreas, but minimal, single -cell necrosis was still present in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_26613] (potentially related to the testicular effects) and in the stomach.  Single- cell 
necrosis was considered not to be adverse due to its minimal- to-mild magnitude and 
because no loss of mucosal integrity was observed microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897].   
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genet ic toxicity of venetoclax .
Venetoclax wastested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays and produced no 
effects in CNS/neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_26614] 
600mg/kg.  In dogs, mild reductions in cardiac contractility and cardiac output were 
observed at plasma concentrations of 16 µg/mL; these concentrations exceeded the 
concentration of venetoclax in humans (3.39 µg/mL at the 900- mg dose).  No effects on 
blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG parameters were observed in dogs at a maximum 
drug concentration of 46 µg/mL.
See the Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Venetoclax Clinical Experience
As of [ADDRESS_26053] enrolled 160 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/small

43/Protocol GO28667, Version 9patients in M13 -982, 8 patients in GP28331, and 2 patients in GO28440).  The 
firstin-human venetoclax monotherapy dose -escalation study (Study M12-175) is 
ongoing in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and NHL.  Study M13-365 
(venetoclax in combinati on with rituximab in relapsed/refractory CLL), Study M13 -982 
(venetoclax monotherapy in relapsed/refractory CLL harboring 17p deletion), 
Study GP28331 ( venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab), and Study GO28440 
(venetoclax in combination with bendamus tine plus rituximab) are also ongoing.  
Preliminary safety, PK, and efficacy data are summarized below on the basis of data 
cutoff dates of 3 February 2014 for safety listings (see the Venetoclax Investigator's 
Brochure for details on clinical studies).  D ose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessments are 
available for patients enrolled in Study M12-175 (through Cohort 8 with a target 
venetoclax dose of 1200 mg) and in Study M13-365 (through Cohort 5 with a target 
venetoclax dose of 600 mg).
Study M12 -175 includes relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL and NHL patients with measurable 
disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 1, and 
adequate marrow function who are enrolled in Arm A (CLL/SLL) or Arm B (NHL).  
Patients receive a single dose of venetoclax onDay 7 followed by [CONTACT_26746] 1 until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.
Study M13 -365 includes relapsed/refractory CLL patients with measurable disease, 
ECOG Performance Status 1, and adequate bone marrow fu nction.  Patients received 
venetoclax starting at 50 mg/day and were dose- escalated to the target cohort dose of 
venetoclax over 3 weeks followed by [CONTACT_26747].  Rituximab was a dministered starting on Week 4 
Day1 at 375 mg/m2(the dose could be split over Cycle 1 Days 1 and 2 at the discretion 
of the investigator) followed by [CONTACT_26748] 500 mg/m2on 
Day1 of Weeks5, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. 
Study M13 -982 includes relapsed or refractory CLL patients harboring the 17p deletion.  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy 
in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL harboring the 17p13 (TP53 locus) deletion 
(17p deletion).  Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_26749].  The secondary objectives are to 
evaluate the CR, partial response PR, duration of response (DOR), PFS, time to 
progression , overall survival (OS) and percent of patients who move on to stem cell 
transplant.  Patients will receive venetoclax orally QD continuously.  To mitigate the risk 
for TLS, a lead -in period (up to 5 weeks) is employed to evaluate a step -wise dose 
escalation.  Patients start with [ADDRESS_26054] to 100 mg, then 200 mg, then 
400 mg (or additional lead -in steps to designated 400 -mg dose), as tolerated.  A lower 
starting dose and/or modification to the lead -in regimen may be implemented for 
individuals at particularly high risk for TLS.

44/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Study GP28331 is an open- label, dose -finding and safety study of venetoclax in 
combination with obinutuzumab in relapsed/refractory and previously untreated CLL 
patients.  
Venetoclax is administered in escalating doses over 2 to 5 weeks with target 
doses of venetoclax ranging from 100 mg/day to 600 mg/day.  Patients receive 6 cycles 
of obinutuzumab (28 -day cycles).  Obinutuzumab infusions occur on Days 1, 2, 8 and 15 
of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6.  Following completion of 6 cycles of 
combination therapy, patients will continue on venetoclax as a single agent at the target 
venetoclax dose to which they were assigned until disease progression or end of study 
(whichever occurs first).  Following completion of the dose- finding stage in each patient 
population (relapsed/refractory and previously untreated CLL), a dose and schedule will 
be selected for use in the expansion stage of the study.  The expansion stage for each 
patient population will have at least 14 patients.
Study GO28440 is an open- label, dose -finding and safety study of venetoclax in 
combination with BR in relapsed/refractory and previously untreated patients with CLL.  
Venetoclax is administered in escalating doses over 2 to 5 weeks with target doses of 
venetoclax ranging from 100 mg/day to 600 mg/day.  Rituximab is administered IV once 
every 28 -day cycle for up to 6 cycles.  The initial dose is 375 mg/m2in Cycle 1, followed 
by 500 mg/m2in Cycles 2 to 6.  Bendamustine is administered IV at 70 mg/m2for 2 
consecutive days of each 28- day cycle for 6 cycles in patients with relapsed/refractory 
CLL, and at 90 mg/m2in previously untreated patients with CLL.  Following completion of 
6 cycles of combination therapy, patients will continue on venetoclax as a single agent at 
the target venetoclax dose to which they were assigned until disease progression or end 
of study (whi chever occurs first). Following completion of the dose -finding stage in each 
patient population (relapsed/refractory and previously untreated CLL), a dose and 
schedule will be selected for use in the expansion stage of the study.  The expansion 
stage for e ach patient population will have at least 14 patients.

46/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Study M13 -365
As of 3 February 2014, preliminary safety results are available for 38 patients enrolled in 
Study M13-365.  Six patients were enrolled in Cohort 1 (designated venetoclax cohort 
dose of 200 mg), 10 patients were enrolled in Cohort 2 (designated venetoclax cohort 
dose of 300 mg), 7 patients were enrolled in each of Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 (designated 
venetoclax cohort doses of 400, 500, and 600 mg, respectively).  Most patients (94.7%) 
reported at least one treatment -emergent adverse event.  The most common adverse 
events were neutropenia (50%), nausea (42.1%), diarrhea and headache (28.9% each), 
cough ( 26.3%), and thrombocytopenia, fatigue, pyrexia, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348] (23.7% each).  
Twenty-seven patients (71.1%) were reported to have Grade [ADDRESS_26057] commonly reported Grade 3 adverse events occurring in more than 2 patients 
were neutropenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (18.4%), and anemia (10.5%).  Serious 
adverse events were reported in 14 patients (36.8%).  TLS was reported in 2 patients 
(5.3%), and each of the following events was reported in 1 patient (2.6%) each:  febrile 
neutropenia, histiocytosis hematophagic, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, non -cardiac 
chest pain, pyrexia, bronchitis bacterial, influenza, lung infection, pneumonia hemophilus, 
rotavirus infection, infusion- related reaction (IRR) , hyperkalemia, lymphoma 
transformation, Richter's syndrome, and pulmonary mass.  Both events of TLS and 
individual events of bronchitis bacterial, pneumonia hemophilus, rotavirus infection, and 
hyperkalemia were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being relate d to 
venetoclax .
As described above, 1 patient experienced a serious adverse event of hyperkalemia in a 
setting of TLS that resulted in study discontinuation and death (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ).  
Two additional patients experienced adverse events that resulted in discontinuation of 
venetoclax (lymphoma transformation and Richter’s syndrome).  
See the Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure for more details on these patients.
Study GP28331
In Study GP28331, [ADDRESS_26058] commonly reported adverse 
events related to venetoclax were diarrhea and IRR (in 3 patients each; 37.5%) and 
hyperphosphatemia, anemia, flatulence, pollakiuria, and fatigue (in 2 patients each; 
25.0%).  Hyperphosphatemia was reported as a serious event in the setting of laboratory 
TLS that occurred after the third dose of venetoclax in apatient who had not received 
obinutuzumab.  The event resolved with IV hydration and discontinuation of study 
therapy.

Two patients have been enrolled in the study and had data available.  Study enrollment 
is continuing.  No tr eatment -emergent adverse events have been reported in the 
2enrolled patients.
See the Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure for more details on these studies.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_26059] 3 patients with 
CLL following a single dose of venetoclax of 100200mg.  W ithin 24 hours, dramatic 
reductions in lymphocyte count ( 95%) were observed in the 2 patients with 
pretreatment lymphocytosis, and laboratory TLS dev eloped in all 3 patients (per 
Cairo- Bishop Criteria [see Cairo and Bisho p 2004 ]; see the Venetoclax Investigator’s 
Brochure for details regarding these patients).  The TLS resolved without clinical 
complications in all 3 patients, and the patients were able to commence daily dosing of 
venetoclax at reduced doses (50 100mg) within 7 days and later escalated to the target 
cohort dose of 200 mg.
Subsequently, changes to the venetoclax dose and schedule were implemented to 
obtain a more gradual tumor response and reduce the risk of TLS.  The initial venetoclax
dose was reduced t o 50 mg (with the option of administering doses less than 50 mg in 
patients with bulky disease and lymphocytosis), and 2 [ADDRESS_26060] 
been mandated in all patients.  In the subsequent seven cohorts, 53 patients with 
CLL/SLL were enrolled.  In Cohort 2, 1 of 6 patients showed only laboratory (chemical) 
changes in potassium a nd phosphate.  The electrolyte changes were not considered 
clinically significant, and the patient received venetoclax without delay or dose reduction 
and without clinical sequelae.  In Cohort 4, a serious adverse event of clinical TLS 
(considered related to venetoclax ) was reported after the initial dose of [ADDRESS_26061] dose of 
1200 mg, elevated laboratory values consistent with laboratory TLS as well as an 

Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
48/Protocol GO28667, Version 9increase in creatinine were observed.  The patient received a second dose of 1200 mg 
venetoclax the following day, and subsequently that night the patient was found dead at 
home.  No autopsy was performed and the cause of death cannot be confirmed.
Following the two fatal events in , the dose of venetoclax was reduced in 
all active patients to 600 mg or less.  Overall, six DLTs of TLS and two DLTs of fatalities 
in the setting of TLS were reported in the venetoclax clinical program (Arm A of 
Study M12-175 and Study M13-365).  Details of these events are provided in the 
Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure.  Based on data of 77 CLL/SLL patients treated in 
the program up to that point, protocol amendments were then implemented in patients 
with CLL/SLL to include:
Modified venetoclax dosing regimens (i.e., a reduction in the starting dose to 20 mg, 
implementa tion of a more gradual 5 -step dose ramp- up of 20, 50, 100, and 200 mg 
up to the final dose) and with a maximum dose of 600 mg allowed. 
Guidance regarding identification of TLS risk categories:
TLS low -risk:  All measurable lymph nodes with the largest dia meter 5cm 
AND 25 109/L absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 
TLS medium -risk:  Any measurable lymph node with the largest diameter 
5cm and 10 cm OR 25109/L ALC
TLS high -risk:  Any measurable lymph node with the largest diameter 10cm 
OR 25109/L ALC AND any measurable lymph node with the largest diameter 
≥5 cm but 10 cm
Enhanced TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures 
Clinical hold was released in May [ADDRESS_26062] to TLS has now been further characterized 
in 58 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL treated with venetoclax andwho 
completed the monotherapy ramp- up period with the above TLS measures in place (data 
cutoff date 17 January 2014).  
There was a marked reduction in severity and frequency of TLS per Cairo -Bishop 
(Cairo and Bishop 2004) and Howard definitions ( Howard et al. 2011 ) in the analysis for 
these 58 patients with CLL/SLL who received venetoclax using the mentioned TLS 
prophylaxis and monitoring measures as compared wit h the findings in the 77 patients 
with CLL/SLL in the previous analysis.
None of the 58 patients experienced any serious (including fatal) or nonserious event of 
clinical TLS (CTLS) or laboratory TLS (LTLS) or had study treatment discontinued 
because of TL S.  Eight patients (13.8%) were determined to have LTLS (per 
Cairo- Bishop definition) after medical adjudication:  none in 13 low -risk patients, 5 in 

Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
49/Protocol GO28667, Version 919medium -risk patients (26.3%), and 3 in 26 high -risk patients (11.5%).  Three of the 
8patients had a nonserious Grade 1 adverse event related to an electrolyte change; no 
adverse event was reported in the other 5 patients.  One additional high -risk patient had 
a serious adverse Grade 2 event of cytokine release syndrome considered to be in the 
TLS setting w ith no electrolyte changes.  These findings differ from those in the previous 
analysis (N 77) where 3 high -risk patients (3.9%) experienced CTLS and 16 patients 
(20.8%) experienced LTLS (6 in 27 medium -risk patients [22.2%] and 10 in 25 high -risk 
patient s [40.0%]).  W hen using the Howard definition for TLS ( Howard etal. 2011 ), 
which requires both electrolyte changes to be outside the Cairo -Bishop thresholds, none 
of the 58 patients experienced CTLS or LTLS, whereas 3 (3.9%) and 7 (9.1%) patients 
experienced CTLS and LTLS, respectively, among the 77 patients with CLL/SLL in the 
previous analysis. 
Moreover, co nsistent with the previous analysis, the risk of TLS with venetoclax in 
patients with CLL/SLL is characterized as highest when initiating venetoclax dosing and 
with a higher initial dose of venetoclax aswell as higher in patients with a large tumor 
burden.
In addition, there were no adverse events of TLS identified in the period after completion 
of the ramp -up when patients received venetoclax monotherapy at the target dose or 
were dosed with combination agents in all ongoing clinical studies evaluating venetoclax
in patients with CLL/SLL.
On the basis of the recent analysis, further modifications to the TLS prophylaxis 
measures for patients with CLL are done in this protocol amendment (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
More details of TLS events associated with venetoclax are provided in the Venetoclax
Investigator’s Brochure.

Study M12 -175
Preliminary ef ficacy data for the patients in the CLL/SLL arm of Study M12 -175 are 
available as of 17 January 2014.  A total of 93 patients were enrolled, with a median time 
on study of 6.1 months (range:  0 27 months).  Twenty -three patients (24%) had CLL 
with 17p13 (T P53 locus) deletion (17p deletion), 55 subjects (59%) had 
fludarabine -refractory CLL, and 32 of the 42 patients with available status had 
unmutated IGHV.  The median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 4 (range:  1 11).
Seventy patients were evaluable for overall response based on the 2008 updated 
International W orkshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria.  The OR rate
(complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi] PR) was 
76% (53 of 70 evaluable patients), with CR/CRi in 14 patients (20%) and PR in 
39patients (56%).  This included 17 of 23 patients with unmutated IGHV (74% OR rate, 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
50/Protocol GO28667, Version 9with 4 CR/CRi), 15 of 21 patients with 17p deletion (71% OR rate, with 3 CR/CRi), and 
29 of 39 patients with fludarabine -refractory CLL (74% OR rate, 6CR/CRi).
The median DOR was 20.5 months [95% CI; 13.8, -] for the 53 responding patients.  At 
12 months, 91% of patients with CR and 67% of patients with PR remained progression -
free.  Of the 14 subjects with CR/CRi, 9 were evaluated in local labora tories by [CONTACT_26750] ( MRD ); [ADDRESS_26063] negative and of these, 
2were IGHV unmutated, 4 were fludarabine -refractory, and 1 had 17p deletion.
Study M13 -365
Preliminary efficacy data for Study M13 -365 are available as of 17 Ja nuary 2014.  A total 
of 37 patients were enrolled, with a median time on study of 4.8 months (range:  0 to 
15.2 months).  Nine patients (24%) had 17p deletion, 9 patients (24%) had fludarabine -
refractory CLL, and 9 (24%) had rituximab -refractory CLL.  The median number of prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 2 (range:  1 to 5).  A total of 18 patients who completed combination 
therapy or discontinued prior to completion were eval uable for ORrate.  The ORrate 
(CR/CRi PR) was 78% (14 of 18 patients), with 7 (39%) patients achieving CR/CRi and 
7 (39%) achieving PR.  MRD was evaluated by [CONTACT_26751] 6 of 7 subjects with 
CR; [ADDRESS_26064] unconfirmed PR, and 6 were 
not yet evaluable for response.

Preliminary PK results are available from 53 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL 
from Study M12-175.  The plasma concentration time profiles of venetoclax in CLL/SLL 
patients are presented in Figure 1following multiple doses of venetoclax atDay7 
(single dose) and Week6 Day 1.

52/Protocol GO28667, Version 9CLL cells collected 6 8hours after initial dosing of vene toclax show increased 
Annexin -BB staining and caspase -3 activation ( Roberts et al. 2012), consistent with a 
mechanism of action based on Bcl -2 inhibition.
1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_26616], a significant number of 
patients experience relapsed disease that is associated with progressively shorter 
durations of response to therapy.  Patients with disease tha t is refractory to upfront 
treatment are at a similar disadvantage.  The only potentially curative strategy for CLL is 
an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for which the majority of patients 
with CLL are not eligible secondary to age or co morbid conditions.  Improved treatment 
options are therefore critically important for this population.
Rituximab has been shown to be an effective treatment for low -grade, CD20- positive 
B-cell malignancies and is commonly used both as a single agent and in combination 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal 
antibody that binds to CD20, a hydrophobic, transmembrane protein that is present on 
the cell surface of pre B lymphocytes and mature B lymphocytes but not on 
hemato poietic stem cells, pro- B cells, normal plasma cells, or other normal tissue .  In 
particular, CD20 is present on malignant B lymphocytes in the majority of patients with 
mature B -cell lymphomas and leukemias.  The binding of rituximab to CD20 on 
Blymphocy tes eliminates these cells via a number of different possible mechanisms, 
including antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement -dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC), and induction of apoptosis (Maloney et al. 2002 ).
Single- agent activity of rituximab with the use of a standard NHL dose has been 
marginal in CLL patients ( Nguyen et al. 1999).  However, in the past decade, more 
intensive doses and schedules of rituximab have been explored and demonstrated a 
good safety profile and significant activity in CLL ( By[CONTACT_26752] 2003; Hainsworth et al. 2003; 
Ferrajoli et al. 2011 ).
Studies i n Bcell CLL patients treated with rituximab have shown a correlation with 
caspase activation and the depletion of B lymphocytes, linking efficacy of this agent to 
activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway ( By[CONTACT_26753]. 2002 ).  In vitro, 
rituximab- resistant lymphoma clones have recently been shown to up -regulate 
pro-survival Bcl -2 family members relative to wild -type cells and to exhibit a higher 
degree of resistance to numerous chemotherapeutic agents.  Cutaneous Bcell 
lymphoma samples obtained after clinical relapse from rituximab treatment also 
exhibited a strong up -regulation of Bcl -2 compared with those before therapy, potentially 
linking anti -apoptotic Bcl -2 proteins to therapy resistance ( Wobser et al. 2007).  These 
data suggest that by [CONTACT_26754], a Bcl -[ADDRESS_26065] 
synergistically with rituximab in a variety of settings.
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
53/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Venetoclax inhibits subcutaneous xenograft growth of human tumor cell lines derived 
from ALL and NHL and is highly efficacious with use of various doses and regi mens.  
Venetoclax enhanced the activity of a broad variety of chemotherapeutic agents 
(e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP]; BR; and 
bortezomib) in other human hematological models (see the Venetoclax Investigator’s 
Broch ure).
In a xenograft model of NHL (DoHH -2), venetoclax dosed as monotherapy caused 
significant tumor growth delay compared with the vehicle.  Combining rituximab with 
venetoclax resulted in significantly (p 0.001) improved tumor inhibition compared with 
venetoclax dosed as monotherapy ( Genentech Report No. 10/974 ).
The unique mechanism of action of venetoclax suggests that it may represent a novel 
approach to targeting CLL.  To date, the efficacy data from the single -agent Phase I 
dose- escalation Study M12-[ADDRESS_26066] that the majority of patients respond to 
treatment with venetoclax .  Furthermore, combining venetoclax with rituximab in a 
chemotherapy -free regimen may be a more tolerable therapy for this generally older 
population.
Because TLS is a special concern in patients treated with venetoclax , intense monitoring 
requirements (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26617]) have 
been incorporated into this protocol; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] (which includes a description of 
patients at low, medium, and high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26618] ), as well as Appendix 1and Appendix 11for monitoring guidelines.
Details regarding the safety monitoring plan for other potential risks associated with 
venetoclax are described in Section 5.  Although the clinical experience with venetoclax
in humans is limited, the safety data available to date suggest that toxicity with repeated 
dosing is acceptable.
Bendamus tine and rituximab were selected as the comparator arm for this study 
because they are considered an efficacious regimen for relapsed CLL, as described in a 
Phase II trial of relapsed/refractory patients; specifically, patients were treated with 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26619]- agent chemotherapy and multi -agent 
chemoimmunotherapy ( Fischer et al. 2011).  There is no uniform opi[INVESTIGATOR_26620]/refractory CLL; however, BR is c onsidered a reasonable option per the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the European Society for 
Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines ( Appendix 8), and a recent international 
consensus statement ( Cheson etal.2010 ).  The limitations of BR include the toxicities of 
myelosuppression and infections ( Fischer et al. 2011).
Since relapsed/refractory CLL represents an incurable disease for the majority of 
patients, there exists a need to introduce new agents that may improve clinical outcomes.  
The mechanism of action of venetoclax along with the available n onclinical and Phase I 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
54/Protocol GO28667, Version 9data suggest that venetoclax may represent a more effective treatment option than 
current standard regimens.  A treatment regimen that is demonstrated in a Phase III 
setting to provide a clinically meaningful increase in PFS with similar or reduced toxicity 
compared with BR would be cons idered by [CONTACT_26755] a clinically beneficial 
option for patients.  The precautionary safety measures including the enhanced TLS risk 
mitigation processes in place and regular monitoring of safety in the study by [CONTACT_26756] (iDMC) and by [CONTACT_26757].  In conclusion, 
it is considered that the potential for benefit -risk ratio for this study is favorable.

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY
This is an open -label, international, multicenter, randomized, Phase III study to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with rituximab 
(venetoclax R) compared with bendamustine in combination with rituximab (BR) in 
patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.
Approximately 370 patients will be recruited from approximately 150 centers in up to 
29countries and randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either venetoclax R (Arm A) 
or BR (Arm B).  Randomization will be stratifi ed according to the following factors:
17p deletion:  yes or no
Risk status:  high risk or low risk
High risk:  defined as harboring 17p deletion or no response to front -line 
chemotherapy -containing regimen or relapsed within 12 months after 
chemotherapy or within 24 months after chemoimmunotherapy
Low risk:  defined as relapse more than 12 months after chemotherapy or 
24months after che motherapy or chemoimmunotherapy
Geographic region:  [LOCATION_002]/Canada, Australia/New Zealand, W estern Europe, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, or Latin America
Patients randomized to Arm A (venetoclax R) (see Figure 2)will have a 5 -week 
venetoclax dose ramp -up period to reach the target dose of 400 mg daily.  Following the 
venetoclax ramp -up period, patients will receive 6 cycles of rituximab consisting o f a

Following 6 cycles of combination therapy, patients in both arms will be followed 
clinically every 3 months through Year 3 from initiation of combination therapy (Cycle 1 
Day1).  Patients will then be followed every [ADDRESS_26073].  At each follow -up visit, patients will be assessed 
for response/progression by [CONTACT_26712].  Af ter PD, patients will enter 
survival follow -up and be followed for OS .Information on new anti-CLL ther apy will 
also be collected at survival f ollow -up.  This survival f ollow -up may be conducted by 
[CONTACT_756].  If eligible, patients randomized to either Arm A or Arm B who have PD , are 
in need of therapy (per iwCLL) ,and have not received new anti -CLL therapy have the 
option to enter the R/C Substudy with venetoclax R(see Section 3.1.3).
Atany time during the study when clinical or laboratory findings suggest that the 
response may have improved from stable disease (SD) to PR or from PR to CR, imaging
should be performed to confirm the response.  Sites are allowed to do imaging any 
time during the treatment period to confirm a CR.  Imaging is not routinely required to 
determine PD because objective evidence of PD is most often documented by 
[CONTACT_26758].  However, when PD cannot be 
documented by [CONTACT_26759], imaging is required 
todocument PD detected by [CONTACT_26760].  A bone marrow biopsy may also be conducted at any tim e during the study 
to confirm a CR.

R/C Substudy Design
Patients entering the R/C Substudy will have a 5 -week venetoclax dose ramp- up period 
to reach the target dose of 400 mg QD (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) .  Following the venetoclax
ramp -up period, patients will receive [ADDRESS_26085] not progressed 
following the completion of the 6 cycles will continue to receive venetoclax
monotherapy until disease progression or for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1R/C
Day 1 of the R/C Substudy .
An EOCTR -R/C Visit will be scheduled 12 weeks after Cycle 6 R/C Day [ADDRESS_26086] .  After the EOCTR -R/C Visit, patients who have 
not progressed will be followed clinically every 24 weeks (Foll ow-UpR/C Visits).  
Follow -UpR/C Visits will continue until completion of venetoclax treatment at 2 years 
from Cycle 1 R/C Day1 (Completion of Venetoclax Treatment Response in the 
Re-treatment/Crossover Substudy[ COVTR -R/C]Visit) or PD, whichever occurs first.  
If patients discontinue early due to toxicity or at disease progression, EOCTR -R/C
Visit will be scheduled immediately.  After the COVTR- R/C Visitor disease 
progression, patients should be followed for OS, PD (if not progressed already) ,and 
new anti -CLL therapy . These Survival Follow Up Visits will be captured every 
24weeks until the end of study and may be conducted by [CONTACT_756].

3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for Combination Therapy  (Experimental Group)
Rituximab has been shown to be an effective treatment for low -grade, CD20- positive 
B-cell malignancies and is commonly used both as a single agent and in combination 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy ( Maloney et al. 2002 ; Cheson 2006 ).
Although the exact mechanism of action of rituximab remains unclear, it is known to 
induce cell death through several pathways, including CDC, ADCC, and apoptosis
(Maloney et al. 2002 ).  In vitro, rituximab -resistant lymphoma clones have been shown to 
up-regulate pro -survival Bcl -2 family members relative to wild -type cells and to exhibit a 
higher degree of resistanc e to numerous chemotherapeutic agents.  Cutaneous B cell 
lymphoma samples obtained after clinical relapse from rituximab treatment also 
exhibited a strong up -regulation of Bcl -2 compared with those before therapy, potentially 
linking anti -apoptotic Bcl -2 proteins to therapy resistance ( Wobser at al. 2007).  These 
data suggest that by [CONTACT_26754], a Bcl -[ADDRESS_26090] 
synergistically with rituximab in a variety of settings.
In a xenograft model of NHL (DoHH -2), venetoclax dosed as monotherapy caused 
significant tumor growth delay compared with the vehicle.  Combining rituximab and 
bendamustine with venetoclax resulted in significantly improved tumor inhibition 
compared with rituximab and bendamustine alone ( Souers et al. 2013).  Therefore, this 
combination may hold promise in the treatment of CD20 -positive lymphoid malignancies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Venetoclax Dosage
Venetoclax dosing for this study was based on the experience from the single -agent 
Phase I dose -escalation Study M12-175 examining single
-agent venetoclax in relapsed 
and refractory CLL patients.  That study established a ramp -up schedule over several 
weeks in order to safely administer venetoclax , reducing the risk for TLS by [CONTACT_26763] (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
65/Protocol GO28667, Version 9gradually reducing the leukemia cell burden prior to administration of the full target dose.  
The starting dose of venetocl axis 20 mg.  In M12- 175, the absence of laboratory 
evidence of TLS, the 20- mg dose is followed by 50 mg venetoclax QD for 1 week, 
followed by [CONTACT_26764] a maximum dose of 600 mg.  However, 
the dose to be used in combination with ri tuximab and other agents has been 
determined to be 400 mg for CLL .  Preliminary data from Study M12-175 show that the 
400mg venetoclax dose as a single agent results in exposure that causes 80% 
reduction in lymphocyte counts, tumor size, and bone marrow infiltrates in most patients .  
These results were considered in selecting the dose for this study .  
Based on recent analysis of 58 patients enrolled in different venetoclax trials and as part 
of modifications to the tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis measu res, starting dosing with 
20mg every day for 1 week for all patients is chosen (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Rituximab Dosa ge
The approved body surface area (BSA) adjusted dosing regimen of rituximab in 
combination with chemotherapy for front -line or relapsed CLL will be used in this study :  
375mg/m2at Cycle 1 followed by 500 mg/m2at Cycles 26 at intervals of 4 weeks.   
Evaluation of a potential PK interaction from the combination of venetoclax and rituximab
is incorporated into the PK assessment plan in an ongoing study (M13 -365).
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Duration of Therapy
The number of cycles of dosing (6 28-day cycles) is designed to provide a duration of 
treatment consistent with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26624].  Patients randomized to Arm A (venetoclax R) who have 
not had disease progression af ter [ADDRESS_26091] been seen to improve over time as treatment continues without a fixed 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]; thus, early termination of venetoclax treatment may prevent patients from 
reaching their maximal response.  Treatment to progression is being evaluated in the 
Phase I studies of venetoclax ; so far, no evidence of unexpected late toxicities has 
emerged from continued treatment with venetoclax beyond 6months.
3.3.2 Rationale for Control Group
BR is considered a relevant comparator arm, because other available recommended 
and/or approved th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_26625] 
(e.g., FCR, allogeneic stem cell transplantation [ASCT], high -dose steroid combinations, 
and alemtuzumab) or have limited effectiveness (e.g., ofatumumab, rituximab 
monotherapy, or chlorambuc il) (Eichho rst et al. 2011 ).  Furthermore, BR is 
recommended as a second- line therapy for fit or elderly patients experiencing short 
durations of initial treatment response.  In a Phase II trial examining the efficacy of BR 
inrelapsed/refractory CLL, median OS was 3 4months and median PFS was 15 months 
(Fischer et al. 2011 ).  Alemtuzumab is recommended for treatment of patients with the 
17p deletion per the NCCN Practice Guidelines in Oncology (v3. 2012); however, it 
hasbeen withdrawn from commercial availability in the [LOCATION_002] and the 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
66/Protocol GO28667, Version 9European Union and will be available only under a compassionate use program for 
appropriate patients.  Moreover, alemtuzumab is less effective for eradication o f bulky 
disease ( Fiegl et al. 2006 ;Keating et al. 2002).  Although response rate to BR in 
relapsed CLL with the 17p deletion is low, more effective alternatives are not universally 
available.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for BR Dosage
Two Phase II single -arm studies have investigated BR in the previously untreated and in 
the relapsed/refractory CLL settings.  In the previously untreated CLL study, 
bendamustine was dosed for 6 cycles at 90 mg/m2on Days 1 and 2 in combination with 
rituximab administered at 375 mg/m2for the first cycle and 500 mg/m2for Cycles 26
(Fischer et al. 2009 ).  Preliminary results indicate an OR rate of 91%, with 33% CR rate.
In the relapsed/refractory CLL study, bendamustine was dosed for 6 cycles at 70 mg/m2
on Days 1 and 2 when combined with rituximab administered at 375 mg/m2for the first 
cycle and 500 mg/m2for Cycles 2 6 (Fischer et al. 2011 ).  In that study with [ADDRESS_26092] common Grade 3/4 adverse events observed included neutropenia (23%), 
thrombocytopenia (28%), and anemia (17%).  Grade 3 infections occurred in 13% of 
patients; dose reductions were required in 37% of patients, and 23% and 44% of 
patients did not receive at least [ADDRESS_26093] meaningful clinical activity with an OR rate of 59% and PFS of 15 months.
In the Phase II study in relapsed/refractory CLL, rituximab was dosed at 375 mg/m2for 
the first cycle and at 500 mg/m2during Cycles 26 (Fischer et al. 2011 ).  Because this 
schedule resulted in meaningful clinical activity, the same schedule will be used in the 
BR arm for this study.
BR che moimmunotherapy has been shown to be associated with toxicity 
(e.g., myelosuppression) that can necessitate dose delays, dose reductions, and early 
discontinuation in patients with NHL and CLL ( Fischer et al. 2011 ).  Consensus 
recommendations for bendamustine dose are 70 mg/m2in relapsed/refractory patients 
either as a single agent or in combination with rituximab ( Cheson et al. 2010 ).  Patients 
participating in this study will be treated according to this recommendation and will 
therefore receive 70 mg/m2bendamustine on Days 1 and 2 of the cycle for 6 cycles.
3.3.3 Rationale for Patient Population
Survival in CLL patients is highly variable, ranging from less than 2 years to 20 years or 
more ( Binet et al. 1981 ).  Intermediate -risk (Rai Stages I and II) patients, who account 
for 61% of all CLL patients, have a median survival of 7 9years.  High -risk (Rai 
Stages III and IV) patients, who account for 8% of all CLL patients, have a median 
survival of 5 years.
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
67/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Treatment is usually initiated when the patient becomes symptomatic or progresses to 
late-stage CLL.  First -line treatment of CLL has evolved from single -agent therapy to 
combination chemoimmunotherapy ( Keating et al. 1993; Johnson et al. 1996; 
Raietal.2000 ;Leporrier et al. 2001 ;Eichhorst et al. 2006; Catovsky et al. 2007;
Flinn etal. 2007 ;Hillmen et al. 2007 ;Hallek et al. 2010 ).  The choice of front -line therapy 
is guided by [CONTACT_26765], comorbidity, and Performance Status.  The lack of a standard 
regimen for front -line patients results in a heterogeneous population of second- line 
patients that has been documented in other studies in the relapsed/refractory setting 
(Fischer et al. 2011 ).
For relapsed patients, single- and multi -agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26626], but relapsed
disease is associated with a median survival between 15 and 44 months and is highly 
dependent on CLL risk status and choice of regimen ( Lamanna et al. 2006 ; 
Wierda etal.2010 ;Fischer et al. 2011).  Furthermore, the NCCN and ESMO guidelines 
list several options for treatment of relapsed patients (see Appendix 8), which take into 
account the duration of initial response because response duration has been shown to 
be prognostic of long -term outcome ( Tam et al. 2008 ).  ASCT is the only potentially 
curative treatment option for CLL patients; however, transplantation is app ropriate only 
for a small number of younger patients and is associated with high morbidity and 
mortality.
In this study, eligible patients must have been treated with at least one but no more than 
three previous lines of therapy (a line of therapy is defin ed as completing 2 cycles of 
treatment for a given line of therapy) including at least one prior standard 
chemotherapy -containing regimen according to current guidelines.  Multiple standard 
and experimental treatments are available for CLL and vary by [CONTACT_26766].  
Therefore, relapsed/refractory CLL patients represent a heterogeneous group especially 
as the number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26627].  In the present study, the number of previous 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26628].
Data from clinical trials of fit individuals treated with FCR chemotherapy in the front -line 
setting have demonstrated long -term durable responses ( Tam et al. 2008 ;
Hallek etal.2010 ).  As previously noted, similar responses for relapsed/refractory 
patients have not been observed.  Therefore, novel approaches are needed to improve 
the outcome of this subset of CLL patients.
In almost all cases, CLL remains an incurable disease.  Moreov er, treatment options are 
limited in the largely elderly patient population.  A chemotherapy -free regimen 
(e.g.,venetoclax R) may have fewer side effects and represent a novel strategy for 
improving response rates and the morbidity and mortality of pati ents with 
relapsed/refractory CLL.
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
68/Protocol GO28667, Version 93.3.4 Rationale for Including Patients with 17p Deletion
CLL patients with the 17p deletion (resulting in loss of the p53 tumor suppressor allele) 
have a poor prognosis characterized by [CONTACT_26767] -line and 
subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Defects in p53 are found in approximately 10% 15% of CLL 
patients requiring front -line therapy ( Pettitt et al. 2012).  Among patients with 
chemotherapy -refractory CLL, the frequency increases to almost 50% ( Zenz et al. 2009 ).
There are currently no treatments approved specifically to meet the need of the 
17pdeletion population.  For relapsed/refractory 17p deletion patients ineligible for 
allogeneic transplant or clinical trial, outcomes following standard therapy are 
significantly worse than for patients without abnormalities at 17p ( Pettitt et al. 2012 ).
Among patients with relapsed CLL treated with FCR, those with the 17p deletion showed 
poorer outcomes than the overall study population.  PFS and OS were 5 months and 
10months, respectively, in patients with 17p deletion, compared with 21 months and 
47months in the entire cohort.  The corresponding response rates were also lower in 
patients wit h the 17p deletion ( Badoux et al. 2011 ).
Pettitt et al. ( 2012 )recently described the outcome of patients with the 17p deletion 
treated in the front -line setting or at relapse with alemtuzuma b.  Among the 22 relapsed 
patients, an OR rate of 77% was observed with a median PFS of 6.5 months 
(Pettitt etal.2012 ).  However, alemtuzumab and other approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26629] d with significant toxicity, limiting their use in older populations.
The mechanism of action of venetoclax is independent of the TP53 pathway.  Early 
results from the ongoing single -agent Phase I dose -escalation Study M12-[ADDRESS_26094] 
demonstrated activity in 14 of 16 relapsed/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion.  
These encouraging preliminary data indicate that venetoclax may be beneficial in this 
unique high- risk patient population and may also represent a less toxic option when 
venetoclax is used in combination with rituximab.
3.3.5 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
Venetoclax inhibits the ability of cancer cells to evade cell death, or apoptosis, by 
[CONTACT_26768] -apoptotic protein Bcl -2 (Korsmeyer 1999 ; 
Cory andAdams 2002; Borner 2003 ; Cory et al. 2003).  Nonclinical studies have 
demonstrated a pattern of response to venetoclax based on the levels of Bcl -2 family 
proteins. High levels of Bcl -2 and low levels of Mcl -1 are generally predictive of 
response to this drug in vitro (unpublished data, Genentech, Inc.).  In addition, high 
levels of at least one pro -apoptotic “sensor” such as Noxa or Bim are required.  
Furthermore, n onclinical studies have suggested that acquired rituximab resistance may 
occur as a result of the up -regulation of Bcl 2 ( By[CONTACT_26753]. 2002 ).  Measurement of 
relevant RNAs, miRNAs, tumor -associated DNA alterations (su ch as p53 and Notch1 
mutations), and proteins (including those in the Bcl -2 family) in CLL cells will be 
examined pretreatment, during treatment, and at the time of progression for putative

69/Protocol GO28667, Version 9stratification markers and correlation with efficacy. Genomics is increasingly informing 
researchers 'understanding of disease pathobiology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS ) 
assays, including whole exome sequencing (WES) that provides a comprehensive 
characterization of the exome, and RNA sequencing ( RNA -seq),which provides a 
comprehensive characterization of the transcriptome, along with clinical data collected 
in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26630]. 
Exploratory biomarker research may include, but will not be limited to ,analysis of 
genes or gene signatures associated with apoptosis and cell survival and may involve 
extraction of DNA and/or RNA, analysis of somatic mutations, and use of WES, 
RNA -seq, or NGS. Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26631]/or peripheral blood samples will be 
analyzed through use of NGS approaches (WES and RNA -seq) to identify somatic 
mutations and/or gene expression signatures that are predictive of response to study 
drugs, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are associated 
with acquired resistance to study drug, or can increase the knowledge and 
understanding of disease biology. In addition, blood samples will be collected to 
determine in vitro sensitivity of CLL cells to venetoclax (EC 50) to evaluate whether 
response to venetoclax can be predicted in vitro.  These studies will help to identify 
responsive patient populations and to develop better therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26632].  
Because these biomarkers may also have prognostic value, their potential association 
with disease progression will also be explored.
3.3.[ADDRESS_26095] function and, subsequently, 
HRQoL.  If the expected clinical benefit of venetoclax R is observed in the trial, there is 
reason to believe that patients might observe an accompanying improvement in distinct 
key symptoms of the disease (i.e., reduction in fatigue, reduction in nodular pain, and 
decrease in night sweats).  PROs will be used to capture t he patients’ report of these 
symptom changes and detect change in disease symptoms.  Specifically, with PFS 
being a primary clinical endpoint, understanding the time to disease progression through 
PROs and what patients gain from disease symptoms during this time can be used to 
support PFS.
To comprehensively characterize treatment -related side effects between the two study 
arms, PROs will be used to evaluate common treatment -related side effects.  It is hoped 
that the novel treatment approach of venetoclax R will have a reduced side- effect 
profile and improved tolerability compared with traditional chemotherapy and result in an 
improvement in HRQoL and functioning for patients with CLL while undergoing treatment.  
The reduction in both disease symptoms and treatment -related side effects combined 
with a subsequent improvement in HRQoL might serve to reduce health economic 
impact for these patients.

70/Protocol GO28667, Version 93.3.7 Rationale for Re-Treatment/Crossover Substudy
The interim analysis (now primary analysis )of this study demonstrated that 
venetoclax Ris superior to BRin patients with relapsed/refractory CLL .  The primary 
endpoint of investigator assessed PFS showed significant improvement with 
venetoclax R,with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.17 (95% CI :0.11, 0.25; p <0.0001). Key 
secondary endpoints, including OS, ORR ,and CR rate, also showed consistent
clinically meaningful improvements (Seymour et al. 2018) .  As the outcomes 
demonstrated with venetoclax R are significantly superior to standard of care ( BR),
crossover and re -treatment will be allowed in the newly added R/C Substudy.  The 
Sponsor would now like to amend the study to investigate response in patients in Arm 
A who are re-treat ed with venetoclax R after progression. This is supported by [CONTACT_26769] 
M13 -[ADDRESS_26096] responded to re -treatment with 
venetoclax ( Seymour et al. 2017 )and had durable responses .  In addition, patients in 
Arm B (BR) who have progressed and are in need of further line treatment will be given 
the option to cross over and receive venetoclax R,which has demonstrated impro ved 
clinical outcome for patients.

[IP_ADDRESS] Venetoclax
Following an initial venetoclax ramp -up period (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ), patients 
randomized to Arm A (venetoclax R) will take venetoclax 400mg daily orally in 
combinati on with rituximab administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 28 -day cycle 
for6cycles.  After completion of combination therapy, patients will continue to take 
venetoclax 400mg daily orally as monotherapy until disease progression or for a 
maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1 Day 1.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Venetoclax Ramp -Up Period
To mitigate potential serious complications of TLS, patients will require close clinical and 
laboratory monitoring during the venetoclax ramp- up period.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details of the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring guidelines.
Allpatients randomized to Arm A will start the study by [CONTACT_26777] [ADDRESS_26110] 7 days.  Patients who demonstrate evidence of electrolyte abnormalities 
suggestive of TLS during the 24 hours following the initial 20 -mg dose will receive 
appropriate treatment to resolution prior to receiving their next daily dose of venetoclax
(see Appendix 11for Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte 
Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome).
Venetoclax dose increases will then occur weekly, starting with 50 mg/day for 1 week 
followed by 100 mg/day for 1 week, 200 mg/day for 1 week, and the final dose of

[IP_ADDRESS] Rituximab
Rituximab will be administered to patients in both treatment arms at 375 mg/m2IV on 
Day1 of Cycle 1 followed by 500 mg/m2on Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 6 (total of six 
infusions of rituximab).  
For patients in Arm A (venetoclax R):  On days when venetoclax and rituximab are 
given, venetoclax will be taken at least 30 minutes prior to starting the rituximab infusion.
For patients in Arm B (BR):  On days when rituximab and bendamustine are to be 
administered, rituximab can be admin istered before or after bendamustine.  For Korean 
sites, rituximab should be administered before bendamustine.  There should be 
30minutes be tween administering the two agents.
The patient’s BSA calculated at screening should be used to calculate the dose of 
rituximab throughout the study unless the patient’s weight increases or decreases by 
10% from screening.  In obese patients, there is no cap on BSA, and actual body 
weight, not adjusted weight, is recommended.  Nonetheless, empi[INVESTIGATOR_26635] (obesity defined as body mass index 30 as measured in

During the treatment p eriod, rituximab must be administered to patients in a clinical 
(inpatient or outpatient) setting.  Rituxan should be administered only by a healthcare 
professional with appropriate medical support to manage severe infusion reactions that 
can be fatal if t hey occur.
Rituximab should be administered as a slow IV infusion through a dedicated line.  
IVinfusion pumps (such as the Braun Infusomat Space) should be used to control the 
infusion rate of rituximab.  Administration sets with polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, or

4.4.1 Permitted Therapy
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
drugs, herbal/homeopathic remedies, nutritional sup plements) used by a patient from 
28days prior to the initiation of study treatment through the end of treatment.   All 
concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
Concomitant Medications eCRF.
Patients who use oral co ntraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, or other 
maintenance therapy should continue their use for the duration of the study or at least 
30days after the last dose of study drug or 1year after the last dose of rituximab, 
whichever is longer.
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout 
thestudy according to institutional standards, including the use of growth factors 
(e.g., erythropoietin) if clinically indicated.  G -CSF may be administered as primary 
prophylaxis in each cycle of therapy, per the ASCO guidelines ( Smith et al. 2006 ) or 
each site’s institutional standards.
Anti-emetic therapy may be instituted for any patient if clinically indicated.  
Bendamustine has a moderate risk of emesis ( Cheson et al. 2010 ).  It is recommended 
that bendamustine infusions be administered following premedication with a serotonin 
(5-HT3) antagonist (i.e., dolasetron , ondansetron, etc.) or per institutional practice.
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedication befor e Rituximab
Premedication may attenuate IRRs.  The following premedication is required prior to 
rituximab therapy: 
Acetaminophen (650 1000 mg) at least 30 minutes prior to the start of all infusions
Diphenhydramine (25 50mg) approximately [ADDRESS_26118] 
infusion and mandatory for all subsequent infusions unless previous antibody 
infusions did not result in an IRR greater than NCI CTCAE Grade 1 and there was 
no interruption to the infusion.  (Another suitable antihistamine is al so acceptable 
and must follow the preceding guidelines.)
A single dose of hydrocortisone (up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of 
methylprednisolone) may also be administered with rituximab if this is the usual practice 
at the site. 
Because transient hypot ension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration 
should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications for 12 hours prior to 
rituximab infusion.

TLS is a risk for patients with CLL who are t reated with high cell-killing agents.  Clinical 
data from CLL patients treated to date with venetoclax suggest that patients with 
baseline lymph nodes 5cm diameter are at a greater risk for TLS than those with 
baseline lymph nodes 5cm.  In addition, the data showed that creatinine clearance of 
80mL/min at screening was a secondary risk factor for TLS.  A detailed description of 
risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26637]’s Brochure.  The section below describes the management 
of patients throughout dosing (as described in Section 4.3.2 ) based on their ris k factors

On the basis of the data review performed by [CONTACT_26721], the following are three TLS
risk categories identified:
1.TLS l ow-risk: the presence of all measurable lymph nodes with the largest diameter 
5cm by [CONTACT_26780] 25109/L
2.TLS medium -risk: the presence of all measurable lymph nodes with the largest 
diameter 5cm and 10cm by [CONTACT_26781] 25109/L
3.TLS high-risk:  the presence of any lymph node with the largest diameter 10cm by

Patients classified as TLS high -risk at screening due to an absolute lymphocyte count 
25109/L AND a measurable lymph nod e with the largest diameter 5cm but less 
than [ADDRESS_26139] recent ALC for dose increases above 50 mg.  Based on 
those results, one of the following two options ma y be implemented:
If the patient’s ALC decreases to 25×109/L, the patient may be categorized as 
TLS medium -risk and follow the management guidelines for the TLS medium -risk 
category for subsequent dose increases (to 100, 200, 400 mg) of venetoclax during 
the Ramp- Up Period.
If the patient’s ALC remains 25109/L, the patient will remain in the TLS high -risk 
category and continues to follow management guidelines for TLS high -risk patients 
for subsequent dose increases of venetoclax during the Ramp -UpPeriod.  
Re-assessment of the patient’s TLS risk category can occur prior to each 
subsequent dose increase.

4.5.1 Description of Study  Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  and Demographic Data
Medical history include s clinically significant diseases, cancer history (including prior 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), smoking history, and all medications (e.g., 
prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by [CONTACT_3433] e patient within 14 days prior to the screening visit.
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should 
be recorded on the Medical History/Surgical History eCRF.  As part of tumor assessment, 
physica l examinations should also include the evaluation of the presence and degree of 
enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.
Targeted physical examinations should be limited to systems of primary relevance that 
is, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], tho se associated with symptoms, and those associated 
with tumor assessment (lymph nodes, liver, and spleen).
Changes from baseline abnormalities at subsequent visits should be recorded in patient 
notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities sh ould be recorded as 
adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Height is to be recorded at screening only.  W eight is to be recorded in the standing 
position (if possible); please see Appendix 1.
BSA will be calculated by [CONTACT_26789] ( 1987 ) or site standard formula, as 
follows:
BSA (m2) = {[Height (cm) Weight(kg)]/3600}½
BSA calculated at screening should be used to calculate the dose of rituximab and of 
bendamustine throughout the study unless the patient’s weight increases or decreases 
by 10% from screening.  In obese patients, there is no BSA cap and actual body weigh t, 
not adjusted weight, is recommended.  Nonetheless, empi[INVESTIGATOR_26635] (obesity defined as body mass index 30kg/m2).
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs and ECOG Performance Status
Vital signs will include measurements of temperature, heart rate, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure after the patient has been in a seated position for 5 minutes.
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
99/Protocol GO28667, Version 9ECOG Performance Status (see Appendix 7) will be recorded for patients at screening 
and at subsequent visits as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1).
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram
Twelve-lead resting ECGs will be obtained at screening and at subsequent visits, as 
clinically indicated.
Digital ECG recordings must be obtained at each specified timepoint.  ECGs for each 
patient should be obtained from the same machine whenever possible.  To minimize 
variability, it is important that patients be in a resting position for 10minutes prior to 
each ECG evaluation.  Body position should be consistently maintained for each ECG 
evaluation to prevent changes in heart rate.  Environmental distractions (e.g., television, 
radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre -ECG resting period and during 
ECG recording.  ECGs should be performed prior to any scheduled vital sign 
measurements and blood draws.
For safety mon itoring purposes, the investigator or designee must review, sign, and date 
all ECG tracings.  Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_26650]'s

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction
Baseline ass essment of ejection fraction will be made at screening by [CONTACT_26790] -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan.  Subsequent evaluations of left 
ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) will be made as clinically indicated for patients who 
develop signs of cardiac compromise.  The decision to enroll a patient with significant 
cardiac disease in the study will be made by [CONTACT_26791].
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor and Response Evaluations
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re -asses sed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_26792], imaging studies, laboratory results, and bone 
marrow examinations, using iwCLL response criteria for CLL ( Hallek et al. 2008 ) (see
Appendix 10).
All patients must have clinical response assessments (including targeted physical 
examination and laboratory examinations) at screening, Day 1 of every cycle during the 
combination therapy, at interim response assessment (within 14 days of Cycle 4 Day 1), 
after combination therapy (defined as [ADDRESS_26155] cycle for early termination), and at 2 3months after Day [ADDRESS_26156] scans (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] if CT is 
contraindicated) of the neck (if clinically indicated), chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV 
and oral contrast at screening, interim response assessment (within 14days of Cycle 4

100/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Day1) and 2 3months after completion of combination therapy (or [ADDRESS_26157] cycle for early termination).  A follow -up scan must also be performed for 
patients who meet all clinical and laboratory criteria for an in itial CR or PR at subsequent 
assessment timepoints.   Sites can do imaging to confirm a PR or CR at any time during 
the study.   The method of imaging should be consistent for each patient at subsequent 
timepoints.
Patients who have not progressed after the [ADDRESS_26158].  Assessments will be based on hematological status and 
targeted physical examination.  Additional imaging evaluations should be performed to 
confirm a suspected change in response status, that is, SD to PR or PR to CR/CRi.  If a 
patient’s response improves to a CR or CRi during further follow -up, bone marrow 
examination must be performed to con firm the CR.
If at any time during the study, a patient exhibits clinical signs of possible disease 
progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen, or lymph nodes on 
physical examination) in the absence of laboratory or histopathologic changes meeting 
the criteria for PD, then additional assessments including imaging studies and/or bone 
marrow examination (in setting of new cytopenias) must be performed within [ADDRESS_26159] achieved

101/Protocol GO28667, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory  Assessments
For laboratory samples drawn on days on study treatment, “before dosing” laboratory 
samples should be drawn within 0 4hours before the dose.  Other laboratory samples 
occurring on the same day should be obtained within a 15‑minute window of any 
scheduled time. Any laboratory tests occurring at time intervals greater than or equal to 
24hours after d ose should be obtained within a 2‑hour window of the scheduled time.
Local Laboratory  Assessments
Samples for the following standard laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local 
laboratory for analysis:
17p deletion by [CONTACT_26793] (the resul ts will be used to determine 17p deletion 
status as positive or negative for study enrollment).  Results from a prior positive 
laboratory test may be used if available or from a negative test if testing was done 
within [ADDRESS_26161] may be used by [CONTACT_26794]. 
Hematology:  complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, W BC), 
platelet count, ANC, ALC, and percent or absolute differential c ounts (neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells)

(when BUN not available) , creatinine, calcium, ma gnesium, phosphorus, total 
bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and uric acid  
Please note that at room temperature, rasburicase causes enzymatic 
degradation of the uric acid in blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting 
in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The following special 
sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid exvivo uric acid 
degradation in samples collected after treatment with rasburicase:
Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma. 
Blood must be collected into prechilled tubes containing heparin 
anticoagulant.  Immediately  immerse plasma sample
s for uric acid 
measurement in an ice water bath.
Plasma samples must be prepared by [CONTACT_26795] a precooled 
centrifuge (4°C).
Finally, the plasma must be maintained in an ice water bath and analyzed 
for uric acid within 4 hours of collection.
Viral serology and detection:
Hepatitis B (HBsAg and HBcAb)

[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -Reported Outcomes
PRO data will be elicited from the patients in this study to more fully characterize the 
clinical profile of venetoclax .  The PRO instruments, translated as required in t he local 
language, will be distributed by [CONTACT_26801].  To ensure instrument validity and 
that data standards meet health authority requirements, PRO questio nnaires on paper 
(EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC CLL -16, and EQ -5D) should be self -administered at the 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
103/Protocol GO28667, Version 9investigational site prior to the completion of other study assessments and the 
administration of study treatment.  For the MDASI questionnaire, an interactive voi ce 
response solution (IVRx) will be used to capture PRO questionnaire data.  The data will 
be transmitted to a centralized database at the IVRx vendor.  The data can be accessed 
by [CONTACT_26802] W orldwide W eb.
The MDASI (Cleeland et al. 2000) is a cancer related multi -symptom, valid, and reliable 
self-report questionnaire for clinical and research use.  It consists of 19 items over two 
scales that assess symptom severity and symptom interference with different aspects of 
a pat ient’s life.  Thirteen items (i.e., pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distressed, 
shortness of breath, remembering things, lack of appetite, drowsy, dry mouth, sad, 
vomiting, and numbness or tingling) ask patients to rate how severe the symptoms were
when “at their worst” in the last [ADDRESS_26162] interfered with six areas of function (i.e., general activity, 
walking, work, mood, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life) in the last 
24 hours.  Additionally, the MDASI contains tumor -specific modules to assess 
disease- specific symptoms.  For this study, to specifically assess CLL symptoms and 
treatment side -effects, patients will rate six additional symptoms (night sweats, fev ers 
and chills, lymph node swelling, diarrhea, bruising easy or bleeding, and constipation).  
The MDASI items are rated from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating that the symptom is either not 
present or does not interfere with the patient’s activities and 10 indica ting that the 
symptom is “as bad as you can imagine” or “interfered completely” with the patient’s life.  
The MDASI takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.  The MDASI assessment will be 
conducted using IVRx at the specified timepoints in Appendix 1.
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a validated and reliable self -report measure ( Fayers et al. 1999 ) 
consisting of 30 questions incorporated into five functional scales (physical, rol e, 
cognitive, emotional, and social scales), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, 
and vomiting scales), and a global health status/global quality -of-life scale.  The 
remaining single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and 
diarrhea) assess the additional symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_26803].  The EORTC QLQ -CLL16 module is designed 
for patients with Stage 0 to Stage 4 CLL.  It is composed of 16 questions that address 
five domains of HRQoL important in CLL.  There are three multi -item scales on fatigue 
(two items), treatment side- effects and disease symptoms (eight items), and infection 
(four items), and two single- item scales on social activities and future health worr ies.  
The EORTC QLQ -CLL16 module is specific to CLL and is administered in addition to the 
core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -C30).  The EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -CLL16 
questionnaires take 10 15minutes to complete altogether.  A baseline assessment 
(prior to any s tudy treatment) as well as subsequent assessements should be conducted 
as specified in Appendix 1.
The EQ -5D questionnaire is a generic, preference -based health utility measure with 
questions about mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
104/Protocol GO28667, Version 9anxiety/depression that are used to build a composite of the patient’s health status.  The 
EQ-5D will be utilized in this study for economic modeling.  The EQ -5D questionnaire 
takes 5 minutes or less to complete and should be completed at the same visits as the 
EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -CLL16.
[IP_ADDRESS] Samples for [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository
Overview  of the [COMPANY_002] Cl inical Repository
The [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository (RCR) is a centrally administered group of facilities for 
the long -term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, 
and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).   The collection and 
analysis of RCR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical 
agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug 
therapy for patients in the future.
Specimens for the RCR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RCR specimens will be used to achieve the 
following objectives:
To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression

Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
105/Protocol GO28667, Version 9For all samples, dates of consent and specimen collection should be recorded on the 
associated RCR page of the eCRF.  For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and 
shipment instructions, see the Sample Handling and Logistics Manual.  
RCR spe cimens will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the date of final closure of 
the associated clinical database.  The RCR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.
Confidentialit y
Given the sensitive nature of genetic data, [COMPANY_002] has implemented additional processes 
to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens and associated data.  Upon receipt 
by [CONTACT_25736], each specimen is "double -coded" by [CONTACT_26805] a new independent number.  Data generated from the use of these 
specimens and all clinical data transferred from the clinical database and considered 
relevant are also labeled with this same independent number.  A "linking key" between 
the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure 
database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is 
monitored by [CONTACT_25738].  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linki ng key are 
documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other 
reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee 
and [COMPANY_002]'s Legal Department, as applicable.
Data generated from RCR specimen s must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_25735], and [COMPANY_002] monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.
Patient medical information associated with RCR specimens is confidential a nd may only 
be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], 
unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].
Data derived from RCR specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using RCR specimens will be available in 
accordance with the effective Roc he policy on study data publication.
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RCR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property 
of [COMPANY_002], except where agreed otherwise.

106/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Consent to Participate in the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RCR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_20030] a patient's agreement to provide optional RCR specimens.  
Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_26806].
In the event of an RCR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research.
Withdrawal from the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository
Patients who give consent to provide RCR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
specimens from the RCR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw 
consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Medical 
Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes using the RCR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if 
the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample 
Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on 
how to withdr aw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient's withdrawal from 
study GO28667 does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RCR.  
Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from 
study GO28667.
Monitor ing and Oversight
RCR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as w ell as 
adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the 
Informed Consent Form.  [COMPANY_002] monitors and auditors will have direct access to 
appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RCR for the purpos es 
of verifying the data provided to [COMPANY_002].  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC 
review, and health authority inspections by [CONTACT_26807].

An EOCTR -R/C Visit will be scheduled 12 we eks after Cycle 6 R/C Day [ADDRESS_26166].  After the EOCTR -R/C Visit, patients who have 
not progressed will be foll owed clinically every 24 weeks atFollow -UpR/C Visits until 
the COVTR -R/C Visit.  The COVTR -R/C Visit will be scheduled at the completion of 
venetoclax treatment at 2 years from Cycle 1 R/C Day1 or at disease progression, 
whichever occurs first .  If patien ts discontinue early due to toxicity or at disease 
progression, EOCTR -R/C Visit will be scheduled immediately.  After the COVTR -R/C
Visit or disease progression ,patients should be followed for OS ,PD (if not progressed 
already) ,and new anti -CLL therapy . These Survival Follow Up Visits will be captured 
every 24 weeks until the end of and may be conducted by [CONTACT_756].
A full tumor assessment is required at Screening -R/C and EOCTR -R/C Visits by [CONTACT_26809] , bone marrow 
evaluation and CT scans according to iwCLL guidelines ( Hallek et al. 2008 ).  The 
EOCTR -R/C Visit is to be scheduled 12 weeks ( 7 days) after Cycle 6R/C Day 1. 
Following the EOCTR -R/C Visit, patients will be followed clinically every 24 weeks in 
Follow -UpR/C Visits until the COVTR -R/C Visit. Patients will also have a clinical 
response assessment at the COVTR -RC Visit to be scheduled at the completion of 
venetoc lax monotherapy (i.e., 2 years from Cycle 1 R/C Day 1).   If patients discontinue 
early during venetoclax monotherapy , COVTR- R/C Visit will be scheduled immediately.
Additional response assessments may be performed according to institutional 
guidelines and recorded in eCRFs .  Additional CT -scan evaluations should be 
performed during Follow -Up R/C or COVTR -R/C Visits to confirm a suspected change 
in response status, that is, SD to PR or PR to CR/CRi.  If a patient’s response

Investigator or Sponsors determine it is in the best interest of the patient
Patient non -compliance.
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation from Study  Drug/Treatment
Patients must discontinue study treatment ( venetoclax , bendamustine , rituximab) if they 
experience any of the following:
Pregnancy
Disease progression
Patients who experience toxicity that ca n be clearly attributed to any particular study 
drug treatment may discontinue treatment with the specific agent if the toxicity is not 
tolerable and mitigating strategies are not available or successful.  If toxicity cannot be 
clearly attributed to a sing le agent and is considered possibly related to the combination 
treatment, treatment with multiple agents should be discontinued.  Patients who 
discontinue treatment for reasons other than PD should remain on study and continue to 
have disease assessments p er protocol.
Patients in Arm A must discontinue venetoclax permanently if they experience any 
dose delay of 4weeks (except for hepatitis B reactivation) after the last dose (see 
Section 5.1.5 , Table 3 ).  Patients who discontinue venetoclax for reasons other than 
disease progression should remain on the study and continue to have disease

110/Protocol GO28667, Version 9assessments per protocol.  Patients in Arm A who discontinue venetoclax for any reason 
should also discontinue rituximab, although they are to continue evaluation per protocol.  
Patients in Arm A who discontinue rituximab therapy for toxicity (including anaphylaxis) 
may continue treatment with single -agent venetoclax after a discussion between the 
investigator and the Medical Monitor .
Patients in Arm B who experience an anaphylactic reaction must discontinue treatment 
with the offending agent (see Section 5.1.5 for guidelines on discontinuation of rituximab 
or dose reduction/modification and discontinuation of bendamustine).  Patients in Arm B 
who discontinue rituximab for toxicity may be eligible to continue monotherapy with 
single -agent bendamustine after a discussion between the investigator and the Medical 
Monitor .
Patients who discontinue study drug/treatment prematurely will be asked to return to the

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
5.1.1 Risks Associated with Venetoclax
Phase I/II experience with venetoclax has demonstrated that it is generally well tolerated 
and toxicities appear to be mostly manageable and/or reversible; however, clinical 
experience is limited, with 160 patients with CLL/SLL t reated with single- agent 
venetoclax (study M12 -175) or in combination with other agents as of 3 February 2014.  
Please see the Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure for more information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
To date, the principal adverse reaction associated with venetoclax in the ongoing
single -agent Phase I dose -escalation study M12- 175 has been TLS (primarily but not 
exclusively related to the first dose), and therefore the study has been modified to 
implement a ramp- up dosing scheme and rigorous TLS prophy laxis (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Experience from study M12- 175 has been used to develop a dosing schedule starting at 
20mg/day that is incrementally increased to the target dose for each cohort.  Doses that 
have been safely administered to date from Phase I studies will be used in this study.
TLS, including cases leading to clinical sequelae and death, has been observed at a 
dose of [ADDRESS_26169] 72 hours 
prior to starting venetoclax treatment.  Laboratory testing is required after initial dosing to 
monitor for metabolic changes and will be used to assess the need for more intensive 
monitoring and treatment of metabolic abnormalities caused by [CONTACT_26810].  Please 
see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] for venetoclax dosing instructions and the TLS 
prophylaxis and monitoring plans, respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytopenia
Effects on lymphocyte numbers are expected based on the mechanism of action, and 
modest reductions in neutrophils have been observed with venetoclax therapy in 
patients.  Thrombocytopenia and anemia have been reported with venetoclax in the
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
112/Protocol GO28667, Version 9ongoing single -agent Phase I dose -escalation Study M12-175 and M13 -365 that is being 
conducted in heavily pretreated CLL patients.  In certain cases, the condition was 
preexisting.  In this study, blood counts will be monitored closely throughout treatment 
(see the Schedule of Assessments, Appendix 1).  Growth factors are permitted 
according to local practice, and patients will be monitored and treated promptly in case 
of infections.  Dose interruptions or reductions will be allowed based on toxicity.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infectious Complications
Infections of various t ypes have occurred in patients in the ongoing single -agent Phase I 
dose- escalation study M12- 175.  CLL itself is associated with impaired immune function 
and increased infections, and it is unclear whether or how much the incidence could be 
increased due to venetoclax treatment .  Patients in this study will be closely monitored 
for infections and prompt therapy will be instituted, as necessary.  Patients are allowed 
to receive concomitant prophylactic anti -infective therapy at the investigator’s discretion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Effects on Cardiac Function
Nonclinical studies demonstrated decreases in cardiac function of (contractility and 
cardiac output) approximately 20% in healthy laboratory animals .  No patterns of 
adverse events indicating changes in cardiac function have be en reported in clinical 
studies to date.  However, the number of patients exposed and the duration of exposure 
is still relatively low.  Patients enrolled in this trial are required to have ECGs and 
assessments of LVEF at baseline and as clinically indicat ed afterwards.
[IP_ADDRESS] Effects on Fertility
There is a potential for decreased spermatogenesis.  Male patients considering 
preservation of fertility should bank sperm before treatment with venetoclax and should 
agree to refrain from donating sperm during the treat ment period and for at least [ADDRESS_26170] dose of venetoclax .  Long -term effects of venetoclax on female
reproductive potential are unknown.
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Drugdrug interactions may occur with venetoclax .  Please refer to Section 4.4.2 for 
prohibited and cautionary medications .
5.1.2 Risks A ssociated with Rituximab Therapy
Please see the prescribing information for r ituximab for full information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Reactions
Patients treated with rituximab are at risk for IRRs.  Fatal infusion reactions within 
24hours of rituximab infusion can occur; approximately 80% of fatal reactions occurred 
with the first infusion .  Severe reactions to rituximab typi[INVESTIGATOR_26654] 30 120minutes.  Rituximab -induced infusion reactions and 
sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
113/Protocol GO28667, Version 9pulmonary infiltrates, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, 
ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, anaphylactoid events, or death.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome 
Patients treated with rituximab may be at risk for TLS.  With rituximab treatment, acute 
renal f ailure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperuricemia, or hypophosphatemia from 
tumor lysis, some fatal, can occur within 12 24hours after the first infusion of rituximab 
in patients with NHL.  A high number of circulating malignant cells ( 25,000/mm3) or 
high tumor burden confers a greater risk of TLS.  Patients treated with venetoclax
(Arm A) will receive prophylaxis as described above and in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Patients 
randomized to Arm B (BR) who develop evidence of TLS should be treated as clinically 
indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation
Hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death can occur in 
patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The median time to 
diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately [ADDRESS_26171] dose.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg -positive) viral infection are at risk for 
reactivation and will be excluded from the study.  Patients with evidence of prior 
hepatitis B exposure or who are carriers (defined as HBsAg -negative and 
HBcAb -positive) are at a lower risk for reactivation.  In a study of 51 hepatitis B carriers 
with DLBCL who received rituximab, 12% of patients developed evidence of reactivation 
(Skrabs et al. 2002).
Screen all patients for HBV infection by [CONTACT_26811]- HBcAb.  Patients 
with occult or prior hepatitis B infection (defined a s positive total HBcAb and negative 
HBsAg) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable when conducted at a central 
laboratory .  These patients must be willing to undergo monthly HBV DNA testing during 
therapy and for at least [ADDRESS_26172] 10 IU/mL.
If the HBV -DNA assay becomes positive and is above the W orld Hea lth Organization’s 
(WHO) cutoff of 100 IU/mL, treatment with venetoclax or Rvenetoclax will be held and 
the patient should be treated (for at least [ADDRESS_26173] dose of treatment drug) 
with an appropriate nucleoside analogue and immediately ref erred to a 
gastroenterologist or heptologist for management.  Patients may resume venetoclax or 
venetoclax Ronce HBV -DNA levels have decreased to undetectable levels 
(29IU/mL). 
If the HBV -DNA assay becomes detectable and is 29 100 IU/mL, the patient should be 
re-tested within 2 weeks.  If theassay is still positive, treatment with venetoclax or 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
114/Protocol GO28667, Version 9venetoclax Rwillbe held and the patient should be treated with an appropriate 
nucleoside analogue (for at least [ADDRESS_26174] dose of study treatme nt) and 
immediately referred to a gastroenterologist or heptologist for management.  Patients 
may resume treatment once the HBV -DNA levels decrease to undetectable levels.  At 
the discretion of the investigator, patients may start nucleoside analogue and b e referred 
to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist while the second test in pending.
If a patient’s HBV -DNA level exceeds 100 IU/mL while the patient is receiving anti- viral 
medication, treatment will be discontinued (see Section 5.1.5 , Table 4 ).
HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months following completion of rituximab 
therapy.  In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on rituximab, immediately 
discontinue rituximab and any concomitant chemotherapy and institute appropriate 
treatment (see Section 5.1.5 and Table 4 ).  Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of 
resuming rituximab in patients who develop HBV reactivation.
Patients who demonstrate evidence of reactivation while receiving an appropriate 
anti-viral therapy will discontinue study treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
Rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) have also been 
reported in patients treated with rituximab alone or in combination with other 
immunosuppressive medications ( Goldberg et al. 2002 ;Calabrese et al. 2007 ;
Carson etal. 2009 ).  In a review of [ADDRESS_26175] cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of the 
patients’ last infusion of rituximab.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Toxi city
Angina and cardiac arrhythmias have occurred with rituximab treatment and can be life 
threatening.  To evaluate baseline risks, patients will be required to undergo 
assessments of LVEF prior to enrolling in this study.  Clinical evidence of cardiac 
decompensation will be evaluated and managed by [CONTACT_1963].  The decision 
to continue a patient on study after developi[INVESTIGATOR_26655].
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection
Serious infections, including fatal bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections, 
can occur during and up to 1 year following completion of rituximab -based therapy.  New 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
115/Protocol GO28667, Version 9or reactivated viral infections include cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, 
parvovirus B19, Varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and C.
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions
Severe reactions, including fatal mucocutaneous reactions, can occur in patients 
receiving rituximab.  These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, 
Stevens -Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN).  The onset of these reactions in patients treated with 
rituximab has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Bow el Obst ruction and Perforation
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can 
occur in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  In 
post-marketing reports of rituximab, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal 
perforation was 6 days (range, 1 77days) in patients with NHL.
5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Bendamustine
For bendamustine safety monitoring, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for monitoring plans and 
instructions for dose delay and modification of bendamustine.  Please see the 
prescribing information for bendamustine for full information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Myelosuppression
Patients treated with bendamustine are likely to experience myelosuppression.  Patients 
who experience Grade [ADDRESS_26176] Grade 2.  The use of myeloid growth 
factors for the primary and second ary prevention of febrile neutropenia is permitted.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infection
Infection, including pneumonia and sepsis, has been reported.  Patients with 
myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine are more susceptible to 
infections.  The study physician will treat patients with clinical evidence of infection 
appropriately.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for monitoring plans and instructions for dose delay 
and modification of bendamustine.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions
Infusion reactions to bendamustine have occurred commonly in clinical trials.  Symptoms 
include fever, chills, pruritus, and rash.  In rare instances, severe anaphylaxis and 
anaphylactoid reactions have occurred.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
TLS has been reported in association with bendamustine.  Preventive measures include 
maintaining adequate volume status and close monitoring of blood chemistry, 
particularly potassium and uric acid levels.  Allopurinol has also been used during the 
beginning of bendamustine therapy.  However, there may be an increased risk of severe 
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
116/Protocol GO28667, Version 9skin toxicity when bendamustine and allopurinol are administered concomitantly.  
Allopurinol may be held on days of bendamustine administrat ion.  Patients randomized 
to Arm B (BR) who develop evidence of TLS should be treated as clinically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cutaneous Reactions
A number of skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine treatment, including 
rash, toxic skin reactions, and bullous exanthema.  In a study of bendamustine in 
combination with rituximab, one case of TEN occurred.  TEN has been reported for 
rituximab.  Cases of Stevens -Johnson syndrome and TEN, some fatal, have been 
reported when bendamustine was administered concomitantl y with allopurinol and other 
medications known to cause these syndromes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Long -Term Stem -Cell Toxicity
Premalignant and malignant diseases, including MDS, myeloproliferative disorders, AML, 
and bronchial carcinoma, have developed in patients treated with be ndamustine.
[IP_ADDRESS] Extravasation of Bendamustine
Erythema, marked swelling, and pain from bendamustine extravasation have resulted in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
[IP_ADDRESS] Transfusion -Associated Graft versus Host Disease
Rare cases of transfusion -associated graft versus host disease have been reported 
following treatment of low -grade B -cell malignancies with purine analogues 
(i.e., fludarabine or cladribine).  The situation with newer purine antagonists such as 
bendamustine is unclear.  Transfusions, if required, should be performed a ccording to 
national guidelines.
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Certain medications may interact with bendamustine.  Caution should be used or 
alternative treatments should be considered if concomitant treatment with CYP1A2 
inhibitors or inducers is needed.  Please see Appendix 9for a list of medications that are 
to be excluded or used with caution in patients receiving bendamustine or veneto clax.
5.1.4 Risks A ssociat ed with Venetoclax and Rituximab Combination 
Therapy
Preliminary safety (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ) and activity (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3) data from 
the ongoing Study M13 -365 venetoclax Rsupports the risk/benefit assessment for 
combination therapy.  Common hematological and GI toxicities appear to be tolerable 
and were adequately managed.  These common toxicities did not result in any st udy 
discontinuation.

117/Protocol GO28667, Version 95.1.[ADDRESS_26177] criteria used for solid tumors are difficult to be applied 
directly; many patients would be considered to have Grade 24 hematologic toxicity at 
presentation.
As a consequence, dose modification decisions for patients with cytopenia (below the 
lower limit of the normal range) at baseline will be based on the National Cancer 
Institute Working Group ( NCI-WG) CLL grading scale (see Appendix 12).  For patients 
with a normal neutrophil count, platelet count, and/or hemoglobin value at baseline, the 
NCICTCAE, v4.0 will be used.

5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any pot ential alternative causes to determine whether or 
not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or 
"no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration:
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar tre atments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment related factors that are known to be assoc iated with the 
occurrence of the event

5.3.[ADDRESS_26192] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
Infusion -Related Reactions
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after rituximab and/or bendamustine 
infusion and that are judged to be related to the respective infusion should be captured 
as a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms (e. g. “infusion -related reaction” 
or “injection -site reaction” or “anaphylactic reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If 
possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  If a patient experiences 
both a local and systemic reaction to the same dos e of study drug, each reaction should 
be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF as individual signs and symptoms 
rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or infusion reaction.
Other A dverse Events
For all other adverse events, a diagnosis (if kn own) should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a 
constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously 
reported adverse events based on sig ns and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that 
corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary  to Oth er Events
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  However, medically significant adve rse events 
occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded 
as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting or diarrhea results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a 
healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF
If vomiting or diarrhea results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
129/Protocol GO28667, Version 9If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF
If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF
If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF
All adverse event s should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient eval uation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the 
severity should be updated to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event 
worsens.  If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to 
reflect this .
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
In this study, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events.  Hematologic 
parameters should be evaluated as described in Table 3 and Table 4 and in 
Appe ndix 12.  G -CSF used as prophylaxis would not be considered an adverse event 
but should be reported as a concomitant medication.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.

130/Protocol GO28667, Version 9If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., 
alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndr ome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated 
potassium" as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormali ty can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”
Observations of the s ame clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_26816]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sig n abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded 
onthe Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver inj ury.  
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
131/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsors immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a non -serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed 
by [CONTACT_26817]/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All other deaths during the adverse event 
reporting period , regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  An 
independent monitoring committee will monitor the frequency of deaths from all causes.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
During follow -upvisits occuring after the adverse event reporting period , deaths 
attributed to progression of CLL should be recorded only on the Study Completion/Early
Discontinuation eCRF .
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the Medical History/Surgical History.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., 
“more frequent headaches”).
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
132/Protocol GO28667, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of CLL
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease (such as transformation to more aggressive histology) should notbe 
recorded as adverse events.  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data 
only.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it 
should be reported as an adverse event.

below.
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678]
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26665] (e.g., for monitoring for potential 
TLS)
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26666] n elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease
The patient has not suffered an adverse event
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26667] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26668] o f care.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -Reported Outcome Data
Paper or electronic questionnaires may be used for this study.  In the event paper is 
used, instructions on the PRO questionnaires will include a disclaimer to let patients 
know that the site staff will not be reviewi ng the answers to the questionnaire and 
therefore patients should alert the site staff about any problems they are having.  Site 
staff will review PRO questionnaires for completeness ONLY.  If it is noted that the 
patient has written any words on the PRO instrument that is not a predefined response 
(e.g., comments in the margin of the questionnaire or comments in an open text field), 
site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event 
have been met and will docume nt the outcome of this assessment in the patient's

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 28days after the last 
dose of study drug (or within [ADDRESS_26198] dose of rituximab).  A Pregnancy Report 
eCRF should be completed by [CONTACT_26819] (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via the EDC system.  A preg nancy report 
will automatically be generated and sent to [COMPANY_013]/[COMPANY_002] Safety Management.  
Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should 
discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregn ancy 
and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until 

Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
135/Protocol GO28667, Version 9conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the 
pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the 
pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form and fax cover sheet should be completed and faxed faxed directly to IQVIA
([COMPANY_013]/[COMPANY_002] Safety Management designee )immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours

In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, follow reporting instructions provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Abortions
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the 
Sponsors consider spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events), recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies/Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient or female partner 
of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse 
event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsors immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
136/Protocol GO28667, Version 95.4.4 Reporting Requirements for Cases of Overdose, Medication 
Error, Drug Abuse, or Drug Misuse
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
(hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations"), are defined as follows:
 Acci dental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is 
higher than the assigned dose
 Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is 
higher than the assigned dose}
 Medication error:  accidental deviati on in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
 Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or 
dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological har m
 Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not 
qualify as drug abuse
In cases where drug is to be self administered by [CONTACT_102], drug misuse 
could involve the drug being administered to someone other than the patient .
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  All special situations associated with venetoclax , rituximab, and bendamustine , 
regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after 
learning of the event).  Special situations should be recorded as described below:
 Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the even t 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intentional overdose" as the event

During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medica l record to facilitate source data 
verification.  If, after follow -up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be follow ed until pregnancy outcome.  
If the EDC system is not available at the time of pregnancy outcome, follow reporting 
instructions provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

5.[ADDRESS_26202] -STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS
The Sponsor should be notified if th e investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ) if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment. All 
grades of second primar y malignancies (serious and non -serious) should be reported 
during and after the end of adverse event reporting period.
The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee on the 
Adverse Event eCRF. If the Adverse Event eCRF is no longer available, the investigator 
should report the event directly to IQVIA ([COMPANY_013]/[COMPANY_002] Safety Management or 
designee) using the paper Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet 
(see "Protocol Administrative and Contact [CONTACT_7171] & List of Investigators").

Venetoclax Investigator's Brochure
Local prescribing information for rituximab
Local prescribing information for bendamustine
The Sponsors will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event

are based on the following assumptions:
Two-sided log- rank test at the 0.05 level of significance
80% power to detect a nHR for venetoclax R versus BR of 0.66, corresponding to 
an approximate median improvement of 15.2 months to 23 months (34% reduction 
in risk of a PFS event)
Exponential distribution of PFS
An annual dropout rate of 5%
One interim analysis for efficacy
With these assumptions, 186 PFS events are required to achieve 80% power for the 
primary analysis of PFS in all patients for detecting a trend in favor of venetoclax R 
arm over BR arm (HR 0.66).  In total, it is planned to enroll approximately 370patients 
across 2 arms, randomized with 1:1ratio.  It is ex pected that, after a [ADDRESS_26207] occurred in both treatment arms combined (75% of the [ADDRESS_26208] of the study.

and rituximab combination (BR; Arm B), as follows:
H0: PFS venetoclax R= PFS BR
versus
H1: PFS venetoclax R≠PFS BR
Treatment comparison will be made using a two -sided stratified log -rank test 
(0.05 significance level, appropriately adjusted for an interim analysis) stratified by 
17pdeletion status (yes or no), risk status (high or low risk) , and geographic region 
([LOCATION_002]/Canada, Australia/New Zealand, W estern Europe, Central and Eastern 
Europe, Asia , or Latin America).  If the null hypothesis is rejected and the observed HR 
is favorable for the venetoclax R combination, then it is shown that venetoclax R has
a statistically significantly longer PFS than BR.  The Kaplan Meier curve will provide a 
visual description of the differences across treatment arms.  Estimates of the treatment 
effect will be expressed as HRs through use of a stratified Cox proportional -hazards 
analysis, including 95% confidence intervals.
The following sensitivity analyses for PFS will also be performed:

treated with venetoclax R versus BR using the MDASI questionnaire
To evaluate changes from baseline disease -related symptom scores using the 
MDASI and EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -CLL16 questionnaires
To evaluate time to disease -related symptom progression using EORTC QLQ -C30 
and QLQ -CLL16
To evaluate interference of treatment and disease -related symptoms on QoL using 
the MDASI questionnaire
Scoring for the MDASI, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC QLQ -CLL16 questio nnaires will 
be based on their corresponding user manuals ( Fayers et al. 1999 ;Cleeland et al.2000 ).  
Venetoclax (GDC- 0199 )—F.Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
145/Protocol GO28667, Version 9For the MDASI, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC QLQ -CLL16 scales with more than 50% 
of the constituent items completed, a pro -rated score will be computed consistent with 
the scoring manuals and validation papers.  For subscales with less than 50% of the 
items completed, the subscale will be considered as missing. 
Summary statistics of the MDASI, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC QLQ -CLL16 scales 
and their changes from baseline will be calculated at each assessment timepoint for both 
study arms.  Analysis details of these patient -reported outcomes will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.
Disease -related symptom progression will be measured by [CONTACT_26740] -C30 and

hVital signs will include measurements of temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  Vital signs should be collected at all times of chemistry blood draws.
iComplete physical examination is required at screening; targeted physical examination for all subsequent visits.  Complete ph ysical exami nation includes all systems of the body 
as described in the body of the protocol.  Targeted physical examinations should be limited to systems of clinical relevance (i.e., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], lymphatics [including 
spleen], and gastrointestinal [in cluding liver], and those associated with clinical signs/symptoms). 
jAssessment of LVEF by [CONTACT_26836] (MUGA) scan after screening is at the discretion of the investigator. 
kAll patients must have clinical response assessments (including targeted physical examination and laboratory examinations) at interim response assessment (within 14 days of 
Cycle 4 Day 1), and [ADDRESS_26235] scan (or MRI if CT is contr aindicated) of the neck (if indicated), chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis with IV and oral contrast.  A follow -up scan must also be performed at the interim response assessment (within 14 days of Cycle 4 Day 1) visit and for final response 
assessment following co mpletion of combination therapy or early termination (2 3months after Day [ADDRESS_26236] treatment cycle).  Targeted physical examination and laboratory 
examinations should be repeated to confirm that patients are still in response prior to confirmatory CT or MRI scan.  Imaging evaluations at subsequent study visits are only 
required to confirm a new response (i.e., to confirm a new PR or CR) .  Imaging evaluations must be performed within 2 weeks for patients who meet the clinical criteria for PD (i.e., 
increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen, or lymph nodes on physical examination) in the absence of laboratory or histo pathologic criteria for PD.  MRI scans of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be used inste ad of CT scans in patients for whom CT scans with contrast are contraindicated (i.e., patients with 
contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance ).  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_26237] should be 
performed by [CONTACT_2363] a 5 -mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm; this specification applies to the tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  If MRIs are used instead of CT scans, 
MRIs should be used consistently throughout the study.
lA bon e marrow examination must be performed at screening.  For those patients who have achieved a CR or cytopenic CR (including a CT scan indicating a possible CR), a bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26674] 8 weeks following the initial clinical assessment of CR.   If the CR occurs at the interim response assessment 
visit, the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26675] 6 (at least 8 weeks following the interim response assessment visit).   If the bone 
marrow examination confirms a CR, then a repeat bone marrow at the end of combination response visit is not needed.  Otherwis e, a subsequent bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26676] a new CR.

nRequired for all women of reproductive potential (see inclusion criteria).
oHBsAg, IgG anti -HBcAb, and Hep C Ab serology (also HCV RNA by [CONTACT_26837]) required.
pFor hepatitis B core antibody –positive patients, the HBV DNA titer needs to be determined using real -time PCR monthly until at least [ADDRESS_26238] rituximab dose.  Note 
that during the venetoclax monother apy/follow -up period, HBV DNA titer should be performed monthly and the results reviewed by [CONTACT_1719].  The patient does 
not need to have any other procedures besides this laboratory test between the 12 -week follow -up visits unless clini cally indicated.

hVital signs will include measurements of temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
iComplete physical examination is required at screening; targeted physical examination for all subsequent visits.  Complete ph ysical examination includes all systems of the body as 
described in the body of the protocol.  Targeted physical examinations shoul d be limited to systems of clinical relevance (i.e., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], lymphatics [including 
spleen], and gastrointestinal [including liver], and those associated with clinical signs/symptoms).  
jAll patients must have clinical response assessments (including targeted physical examination and laboratory examinations ) at interim response assessment ( within 14 days of Cycle 
4 Day 1), and [ADDRESS_26248] scan (or MRI if CT is contr aindicated) of the neck (if indicated), chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
with IV and oral contrast.  A follow -up scan must also be performed at the interim response assessment (within 14 days of Cycle 4 Day 1) visit and for final response assessment 
following co mpletion of combination therapy or early termination (2 3months after Day [ADDRESS_26249] treatment cycle).  Targeted physical examination and laboratory examinations 
should be repeated to confirm that patients are still in response prior to confirmatory CT or MRI scan.  Imaging evaluations at subsequent study visits are only required to confirm a 
new response.  Imaging evaluations must be performed within 2 weeks for patients who meet the clinical criteria for PD (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of l iver, spleen, or 
lymph nodes on physical examination) in the absence of laboratory or histopathologic criteria for PD.  MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of 
the chest may be used instead of CT scans in patients for who m CT scans with contrast are contraindicated (i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance ).  
Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_26250] should be performed by [CONTACT_2363] a 5-mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm; this specification applies to the tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  If MRIs are used instead of CT scans, MRIs should be used consistently throughout the study.

COMMONLY USED CYP1A 2INHIBITORS AND INDUC ERS (DRUGS, FOODS, 
OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICA TIONS AND SUPPLEMENTS)
Based on the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_26690], no formal clinical assessments of 
pharmacokinetic drug drug interactions between bendamustine and other drugs have 
been conducted.  Bendamustine's active metabolites, gamma -hydroxy bendamustine 
(M3) and N -desmethyl -bendamustine (M4), are formed via cytochrome P450 CYP1A2.  
Inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, c iprofloxacin) have potential to increase plasma 
concentrations of bendamustine and decrease plasma concentrations of active 
metabolites.  Inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., omeprazole, smoking) have potential to 
decrease plasma concentrations of bendamustine and in crease plasma concentrations 
of its active metabolites.
The medications listed below are not contraindicated; however, caution should be used 
or alternative treatments with medications that are not CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers 
should be considered if concomitant treatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers is 
needed for your patient's medical condition.  This list is not exhaustive.

SELECTION OF TA RGET LESIONS IN IMA GING OR INDICA TOR LESIONS IN 
PE
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes or tum or masses as well as 6 extra -nodal lesions 
selected according to all of the following:
Clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions at baseline
All nodal lesions must measure
1.5cm in greatest transverse diameter (GTD) regardless of short axis 
measurement
All extranodal lesions must measure 10mm in the GTD
Extranodal lesions within the liver or spleen must be at least 1.0 cm in two 
perpendicular dimensions
If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body.
Should inclu de mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these 
sites are involved.
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that used 
fornodal disease. 
SELECTION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS IN IM AGING OR INDICATOR 
LESIONS IN PE
Allof the sites of disease present at baseline and not classified as target lesions will be 
classified as non -target lesions, including any measurable lesions that were not chosen 
as target lesions.  Examples of non -target lesions include:
Abnromal (according to the same size criteria as target lesion) measurable lesions 
beyond the maximum number of target)
All bone lesions, irrespective of the modality used to assess them
Lymphangitis of the skin or lung
Cystic lesions
Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (i n CT only)
Measurable lesions beyond the maximum number of six
Groups of lesions that are small and numerous

194/Protocol GO28667, Version 9Pleural/pericardial effusions and/or ascites
Effusions , ascites or other fluid collections will be followed as non -target lesions.
Existing effusions/ascites :  Effusions, ascites or other fluid collections will be 
followed as non- target lesions.  At each time point, radiologists will check for the 
presence or absence of effusions/ascites.  If there is a significant volume 
increase in the absence of a benign etiology, progression can be assessed.
New effusions/ascites :  Significant new effusions, ascites or other fluid 
collections, which are radiographically suggestive of malignancy should be 
recorded as new lesions.
Non-target lesions will be qualitatively assessed at each subsequent timepoint to check 
if they are still abnormal or normalized.
REPORTING CONVENTION S
UNA BLE TO EVA LUATE (UE) LESION CA TEGORY
This category is reserved for target and non- target lesions that are deemed unevaluable 
because 1) subsequent (post -baseline) exams had not been performed, 2) lesions could 
not be evaluated due to poor radiographic technique or poorly defined margins, or 3) 
lesions identified at baseline were not at a subsequent time point .
Examples of UE les ions are a lung lesion in the hilum obstructing the bronchus and 
causing atelectasis of the lobe, or a hypodense liver lesion that becomes surrounded by 
[CONTACT_26849].  In both examples the boundaries of the lesion can be difficult to 
distinguish.  Ev ery effort should be made to assign measurements to lesions that 
develop less distinct margins because they become much smaller.  Another example is 
the instance when lesions identified at baseline were not imaged at a subsequent time 
point unless the lesi ons are not imaged because of complete resolution.  Lesions that 
cannot be measured or evaluated will be classified for that time point as UE.
If a target lesion is classified as UE post -baseline, the SPD/area (whichever applies) of 
the target lesions cann ot accurately be determined for that time point a response of CR, 
PR, or SD cannot be assigned for that time point and the response assessment will be 
UE unless unequivocal progression is determined on the basis of non -target or new 
lesions, or the evaluable target lesions.
PD can be determined without evaluation of all sites of disease based on the GTD, area 
or SPD for target lesions, evaluation of unequivocal progression in non -target lesions or 
observation of a new lesion within the available radiographi c orclinical assessments.

LESION CA TEGORY
Any target lesion findings identified on baseline images, which at a subsequent time 
point decreases in size to 5 mm in any dimension, should be categorized as TSTM.  
The lesion, node or mass should be assigned measurements of 5 mm5mm (for the 
GTD and the short axis) on the Source Document for the purpose of calculating the area.  
If that lesion increases in size to 5mm in any dimension afterwards, its true size (GTD 
and short axis) should be recorded.  The purpose of the assigned value for the 
measurement is the acknowledgment that small findings are not accurately measured.
COMPLETE RESPONSE
Complete response (CR) requires all of the following crit eria as assessed no earlier than 
2 months after completion of therapy: 
Peripheral blood lymphocytes (evaluated by [CONTACT_26850]) below 
4109/L (4000/ L)
Absence of lymphadenopathy (nodes [ADDRESS_26273] diameter or any extra 
nodal disease) by [CONTACT_26851]
No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by [CONTACT_26852]
Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms (B symptoms)
Blood counts above the following v alues
Neutrophils 1.5109/L (1500/ L) (without growth factors)
Platelets 100109/L (100 000/L) (without platelet transfusion or growth 
factors)
Hemoglobin 110 g/L (11 g/dL) (without blood transfusions or erythropoietin)
Bone marrow at least norm ocellular for age, with 30% of nucleated cells being 
lymphocytes.  Lymphoid nodules should be absent. Bone -marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26693] [ADDRESS_26274] treatment when clinical and 
laboratory results listed above demonstrate that a CR/cytopenic CR has been 
achieved.  If the bone marrow is hypocellular, a repeat determination should be 
made in [ADDRESS_26275] recovered.  A marrow 
biopsy should be compared with a pretreatment marrow if available.  Patients who 
are otherwise in a CR, but whose bone marrow nodules can be identified 
histologically, should be considered to be in partial response (PR [nodal PR]).  
Immunohistochemistry should be performed to define whether these nodules are 
composed primarily of T cells or lymphocytes other than or chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) cells.

196/Protocol GO28667, Version 9COMPLETE RESPONSE WI TH INCOMPLETE BONE M ARROW RECOVERY
For patients who fulfill the criteria for CR (including bone marrow), but who have 
persistent cytopenia, the marrow evaluation described above should be performed with 
scrutiny and should not show any clonal infiltrate.
NODUL AR P ARTI AL RESPONSE ( nPR)
In some cases, lymphoid nodules can be found, which often reflect residual disease.  
These nodules should be recorded as “nodular PR.”  Moreover, immunohistochemistry 
should be performed to define whether these nodules are composed primarily of T cells 
or lymphocytes other than CLL cells or of CLL cells. 
PARTIAL RESPONSE
To be considered PR, patients must exhibit the follow ing features for at least [ADDRESS_26276] be met:
  50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from the pretreatment value.
  50% reduction in lymphadenopathy (sum of longest diameter of the [ADDRESS_26277] 
lymph nodes by [CONTACT_26853] 50% reduction in the sum of product of 
diameter of [ADDRESS_26278] lymph nodes measured by [CONTACT_20420] [CT] scan).  
There should be no increase in any node and no new enlarged lymph node.  In 
small lymph nodes ( 2cm in diameter), an increase of less than 25% is not 
considered to be significant.
  50% reduction of liver and/or spleen enlargement if enlarged at baseline as 
assessed by [CONTACT_5292].
In addition, at least one of the following criteria must be met:
Neutrophils 1.5109/L (1500/ L) (without growth factors) or 50% of pretreatment 
value
Platelets 100109/L (100 000/L) (without platelet transfusion or growth factors) 
or 50% of pretreatment value
Hemoglobin 110 g/L (11 g/dL) (without blood transfusions or erythropoietin) or

Progressive disease (PD) during or after therapy will be characterized by [CONTACT_9655]:
  50% increase in the absolute num ber of circulating lymphocytes to at least 
5109/L.  
During combination treatment, the increase should be assessed against Cycle 1, 
Day1 (precycle) lymphocyte count and not -cycle lymphocyte counts, which may 
not be stable.
After treatment, the increase should be assessed against the lowest lymphocyte 
count assessed at the first follow -up visit after the end of combination treatment.

new extra -nodal l esion (regardless of size)
  50% increase in the longest diameter of any previous site of lymphadenopathy
  50% increase in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen as determined by

cSee Section 5.3.1 for details on adverse event reporting .
dVital signs will include measu rements of temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  Vital signs should be collected at all times 
of chemistry blood draws.
eComplete physical examination is required at Screening -R/C; targeted physical examination for all subsequen t visits.  Complete physical 
examination includes all systems of the body as described in the body of the protocol.  Targeted physical examinations should be limited to 
systems of clinical relevance (i.e., cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], lymphatics [including spleen], and gastrointestinal [including liver], and those 
associated with clinical signs/symptoms). 
fAssessment of LVEF by [CONTACT_26836] (MUGA) scan after Baseline is at the discretion of the investigator. An 
ECG is re quired at Screening -R/C only as clinically indicated.
gIncludes complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count), platelet count, absolut e neutrophil count, 
absolute lymphocyte count, and percent or absolute diff erential counts (e.g., segmented neutrophils, bands, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, 
basophils, and other cells).
hIncludes sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen or urea (when BUN not available), creatinine, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid.  All 
scheduled blood draws may be drawn up to 72 hours prior to the next planned evaluation.
iSerum hematology and chemis tries should be drawn at the specific timepoints as described in detail in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
jConsists of specific gravity, pH, blood, protein, glucose, ketones, and microscopic examination (sediment, RBCs, W BCs, casts, crystals, epi[INVESTIGATOR_15129], and bacteria).
kAll patients must have a clinical response assessment (including targeted physical examination and laboratory examinations) a t the EOCTR -R/C, 
Follow -Up R/C, and COVTR -R/C Visits.  All patients must have a Screening -R/C CT scan (or MRI if CT is contraindicated) of the neck (if indicated), 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV and oral contrast.  A follow -up scan must also be perform ed at the EOCTR -R/C Visit.  Targeted physical 
examination and laboratory examinations should be repeated to confirm that patients are still in response prior to confirmato ry CT or MRI scan.  
MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with a non-contrast C T scan of the chest may be used instead of CT scans in patients for whom CT 
scans with contrast are contraindicated (i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance).  Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_26295] should be performed by [CONTACT_2363] a 5 -mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm; this specification applies to the tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  If MRIs are used instead of CT scans, MRIs should be used

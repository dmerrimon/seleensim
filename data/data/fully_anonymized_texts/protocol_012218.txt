Study Design  This is a first -in-human study of VX -445. The study includes 6  parts. Parts  A, B, and 
C will be conducted in healthy subjects. Parts  D, E, and F will be conducted in 
subjects with CF. Part  F is an optional part of the study  that may be conducted at the 
sponsor’s discretion . 
Parts A, B, and C (Healthy Subjects)  
Parts A, B, and C are randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single - and 
multiple-dose parts in healthy subjects of this first -in-human study of VX -445. Part A 
also includes an evaluation of the effect of food on VX -445 PK and an evaluation of 
absolute BA. Part  C doses VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA.  
Approximately 8  subjects in each cohort of Part  A (except Cohort  A7) and Part  B will 
be randomized 3:[ADDRESS_588098] on the tablet and the absolute BA.  
The decision to initiate successive cohorts and dose selection will  be based on safety, 
tolerability, and available PK data from preceding cohort(s). In Parts  A and B, [ADDRESS_588099] and absolute BA.  

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 8 of 114 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Cohorts A1 through A6 : VX-445 or placebo will be administered in the morning of 
Day 1. Dosing will be staggered in Cohort  A1 so that 2  subjects are dosed (1  with 
VX-445 and 1  with placebo) at least [ADDRESS_588100] 6 -day washouts 
between dosing occasions. VX -445 doses include 2  single oral doses of tablet (dose to 
be determined [TBD], pending PK data from previous Part  A cohorts, but will not 
exceed the highest dose that was safe and well tolerated) and a single IV dose (the 
planned dose is [ADDRESS_588101] exposure that was safe and 
well tolerated). If the IV formulation or the data supporting the use of the IV 
formulation are not available, then the third dosing period, in whic h subjects receive 
the IV dose, will not be conducted.  
Part B may be initiated while Part  A is ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, 
and PK data. The total daily dose in the starting cohort (Cohort  B1) will be at least 
1 dose level below the highes t Part A dose for which safety, tolerability, and PK 
results are available and that is safe and well tolerated.  
Part C may be initiated while Parts  A and B are ongoing after review of safety, 
tolerability, and PK data. The VX-445 starting dose (Cohort  C1) will be at least 
[ADDRESS_588102] Part  B dose for which safety and tolerability results are 
available and supportive. The dosage of TEZ/IVA in the TC will be TEZ 100  mg 
once per day (qd)/IVA 150  mg every 12  hours (q12h).  
Dosing will be stagge red in Cohort  C1, with 2 subjects dosed (1  with VX-445 in TC 
with TEZ/IVA and 1  with triple placebo)  at least 24  hours before the remaining 
6 subjects. Staggering at higher doses may be conducted if deemed necessary based 
on review of emerging safety data.  
Parts D, E, and F (Subjects With CF) 
Part D, which is comprised of Parts  D1 and D2, is randomized, double -blind, 
placebo-controlled , and evaluates VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF 
(F/MF genotypes).  
Part E is randomized, double -blind, TEZ/IVA -controlled , and evaluates VX -445 in 
TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF (F/F genotype).  
Part F, an optional part of the study  which will be conducted  at the sponsor’s 
discretion , is randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, and evaluates VX -445 in 
TC with TEZ and VX-561 in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes).  
Part D may be initiated while Parts  A, B, and C are ongoing after review of safety, 
tolerability, and PK data. After all Part  D1 subjects complete the Day  15 Visit, a 
blinded review of all availabl e safety and PK data will be conducted by [CONTACT_460390](s). Dosing in Parts  D2, E, and F  will start after this 
review, if supported by [CONTACT_460391].  
VX-445 will be dosed qd.  
Part D1 has 1 VX -445 dose level (mid: 100  mg qd). Part D2 has 3 VX-445 dose 
levels (low: 50  mg qd; mid: 100  mg qd; high: 200  mg qd). The TC -high dose of 
VX-[ADDRESS_588103] dose 
used in Part  D2 (200 mg qd). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66763] 1 in Parts D2, E, and F. Randomization 
will not be stratified in Part  D1 because of the small number of subjects in that Part

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the average treatment effects through Day  29, for 
all within -group and between -group comparisons will be estimated within MMRM.  
The safety analysis will be descriptive only.  
  
Interim Analyses  Parts A, B, and C : An interim analysi s (IA) may be performed after the Safety 
Follow-up Visit for all Part  C subjects has been completed.   
Parts D, E, and F : IAs for each part (D 1, D2, E, and F) may be performed after  at 
least 50% of subjects in the part have completed the Day  15 Visit.  
  
IDMC Reviews  Parts D, E, and F:  An independent monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety 
reviews of study data.  The IDMC Chair will review available safety and PK data from 
Parts A, B, and C of the study prior to commencement of dosing in Part  D1 to 
determine if it is appropriate to proceed with the study.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 
70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 32,000  in the EU).3 Based 
on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan diseas e.4,5  
CF is caused by [CONTACT_460394]/or function of the CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance 
regulator) protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_460359], and secretion and pH balance in sweat 
glands and multiple organs, including the lungs, pancrea
s, and other gastrointestinal organs. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_460360], the predicted median 
age of survival for a person with CF is approximately [ADDRESS_588153] common disease-causing CFTR mutation, 
F508del-CFTR , accounts for 70% of the identified alleles in patients with CF; nearly half of all 
people with CF are homozygous for F508del. 
Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by [CONTACT_460395], 
[ADDRESS_588154] been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or 
function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate 
cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. 
Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell 
surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount
 of residual CFTR channel activity in 
the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the 
patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease 
in patients with CF.  
The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products 
that were developed by [CONTACT_139369] (Vertex) and approved for the 
treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco®) and lumacaftor (LUM) in 
combination with IVA (Orkambi®). Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients 
with specific CFTR genotypes. Tezacaftor (TEZ; VX-661), like LUM, is a first-generation CFTR 
corrector that improves the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein, resulting in 
an increase in the quantity of F508del-C
FTR protein at the cell surface. IVA increases the 
open-channel probability of the F508del-CFTR protein that has been delivered to the cell surface 
by [CONTACT_460396], thereby [CONTACT_460397]. The combined effect of TEZ and IVA is 
increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface. 
VX-[ADDRESS_588155] of TEZ. The CFTR 
protein delivered to the cell surface by [CONTACT_94273]-445 alone or in combination with TEZ 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 40 of 114 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  (VX-445/TEZ) was potentiated by [CONTACT_312101].11 In human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells studied in 
vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) increased 
CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual combinations (VX-445/TEZ, VX-445/IVA, 
and TEZ/IVA) or individual (VX-445, TE
Z, and IVA) regimens.11  
VX-561 (also known as CTP-656 or C-[ZIP_CODE]) is a deuterated isotope of IVA with a specific 
pattern of [ADDRESS_588156] shown that VX-561 had a reduced rate of clearance, increased exposure, greater plasma 
levels at 24 hours, and a longer half-lif
e compared to IVA, thereby [CONTACT_460398].12 
5.2 Rationale for the Present Study 
Results from nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicology studies of 
VX-445 alone and in combination with TEZ/IVA, and the unmet medical need for new 
treatments for CF, support the clinical development of VX-[ADDRESS_588157] clinical study of VX-445 and is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
PK of VX-445 as monotherapy and in TC with TEZ/IVA in healthy subjects (Parts A, B, and C), 
as well as the safety and eff
icacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who have 
F/MF ( F508del/minimal function) or F/F genotypes (Parts D and E, respectively). Additionally, 
the safety and efficac
y of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 will be evaluated in subjects with 
F/MF genotypes in Part F, if the sponsor chooses to conduct this optional part of the study.

[ADDRESS_588172]- in-human study of VX-445. Approximately 224 subjects will be enrolled: 
120 healthy subjects (Parts A, B, and C) and 104 subjects with CF (Parts D, E, and F). Part F is 
an optional part of the study, which will be conducted a
t the sponsor’s discretion.  
No subject will be allowed to randomize to more than [ADDRESS_588173] of food on VX-445 PK a
nd an evaluation of absolute BA. Part C doses 
VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA. 
There is no pre-specified ratio of males to females, but reasonable effort will be made to enroll 
females of non-childbearing potential in all dosing cohorts.  
Parts A, B, and C (Healthy Subjects) 
A schematic of the study design for Parts A, B, and C is shown in Table 9-1.  
Number of Cohorts 
In Parts A and B, 6 dose escalation cohorts are planned, although fewer than 6 or up to 
2 additional cohorts may be enrolled in each part, based on data from previous cohorts. The 
additional cohorts will follow the corresponding schedule of assessments. In Part C, 2 cohorts are 
planned, while fewer or up to 2 additional cohorts each ma
y be enrolled based on data from 
previous cohorts. The decision to initiate
 successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on 
safety, tolerability, and available PK data from preceding cohort(s). Refer to Section 9.7.1 for 
dose escalation criteria and S
ection 9.8.1 for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. 
Staggering of Dosing 
In Cohort A1 (f
irst single dose cohort) and in Cohort C1 (first TC cohort), dosing will be 
staggered so that 2 subjects are dosed (Cohort
 A1: 1 with VX-445 and 1 with placebo; 
Cohort C1: 1 with TC and 1 with triple placebo) at least 24
 hours before the remaining 6 subjects 
in each cohort. Doses may be staggered in othe
r cohorts if deemed necessary based on review of 
emerging safety data.

Note: Dose escalation criteria are described in Section  9.7.1, and dose escalation will be stopped when the 
predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_460363] (see Section  9.8.1). 
a The Washout Period is a minimum of 6  days and may be increased as needed based on emerging data from 
earlier co horts (Cohorts  A1 through A6). Subjects in Cohort  A7 will receive a single dose of VX -445 on up to 
3 dosing occasions. VX -445 doses include 2  single oral doses of tablet (dose TBD, pending PK data from 
previous Part  A cohorts, but will not exceed the highe st dose that was safe and well tolerated) and a single IV 
dose (the planned dose is 20  mg, but may be adjusted pending data from previous Part  A cohorts; however, the 
final selected dose will not be predicted to exceed the highest exposure that was safe an d well tolerated). If the 
IV formulation or the data supporting the use of the IV formulation are not available, then the third dosing 
period, in which subjects receive the IV dose, will not be conducted. If the IV dose is not administered, subjects 
will be discharged from the CRU on Day  13 after completing all study visit assessments and will return for a 
Safety Follow -up Visit ( Table 3-3). 
b The dosage of TEZ/IVA will be TEZ 100  mg qd/IVA 150  mg q12h which will be administered as TEZ 
100-mg/IVA 150-mg FDC in the morning and IVA 150  mg in the evening.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening (Parts A, B, and C) 
Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1. 
Screening will occur within 28 days before administration of study drug. If the time between 
screening and dosing exceeds 28 days as a r
esult of unexpected operational delays (e.g., delayed 
drug shipment), then subjects do not require rescreening if the Day -
1 laboratory results meet the 
eligibility criteria. 
Subjects will be instructed on the study
 restrictions ( Section 9.4.1).  

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588176] will be a
llowed to participate in more than 1 dose cohort or in more than 1 study part.  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility
 criteria may not be rescreened with the following 
excepti
ons, all of which require principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_41473]: 
 Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_351574]) in the [ADDRESS_588177] study drug dose that was properly 
evaluated and which re
solved fully 
 Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation 
within the allotted screening window 
 Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to 
commit to all study procedures 
 Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but are not randomized for administrative reasons 
(e.g., study drug is not available at the study site) 
 Subjects who were screened under a prior version of the protocol and did not meet any 
exclusion criterion, with the exception of a criterion that was updated in a subsequent version 
of the protocol 
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, 
unless there is clear evidence of a damaged sample, laboratory error, or equipment malfunction. 
In all cases, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460364]. 
The medical monitor must be notified of any decisions made regarding rescreening or retesting. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Period (Parts A, B, and C) 
Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 and will remain in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for the 
duration of the Treatment Period. 
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table 3-2 (Cohorts A1 through A6), Table 3-3 
(Cohort A7), Table 3-4 (Part B), and Table 3-5 (Part C). 
The treatment periods will be conducted as described in Section 9.1. Dosing details are given in 
Section 9.6.1. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study-rela
ted abnormalities at the
 conclusion of a 
scheduled inpatient portion of the study, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be 
notified, and the subject will be asked to remain in the CRU until such abnormalities resolve. If 
the subject is unable or unwilling to remain in the CRU, the
 medical monitor (or authorized 
designee) will be notified, and the investigator will make every effort to arrange follow-up 
evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalities. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up (Parts A, B, and C) 
Subjects will have a Safety Follow-up Visit [ADDRESS_588178] study drug dose. Safety 
Follow-up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-2 (Cohorts A1 through A6), Table 3-3 
(Cohort A7), Table 3-4 (Part B), and Table 3-5 (Part C).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS] Early Discontinuation (Parts A, B, and C) 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will be asked to return to the CRU for a 
Safety Follow-up Visit . Safety Follow-up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-2 (Cohorts A1 
through A6), Table 3-3 (Cohort A7), Table 3-4 (Part B), and Table 3-5 (Part C). 
9.1.2 Parts D, E, and F 
Part D, which is comprised of Parts D1 and D2, is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
and evaluates VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes). Part E is 
randomiz
ed, double-blind, TEZ/IVA-controlled and evaluates VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in 
subjects with CF (
F/F genotype). Part F is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and 
evaluates VX-445 in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes). Part F is an 
optional part of the study, which will be conducted at the sponsor’s discretion. All parts are 
multicenter and designe
d to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-445 in TC. 
Approximately 104 subjects with CF will be enrolled. Part D may be initiated while Parts A, B, 
and C are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. Enrollment of Parts
 D1 and 
D2 will be sequential, while enrollment of Parts E and F will be in parallel with Part D2.  
After all P
art D1 subjects complete the Day 15 Visit, a blinded review of all available safety and 
PK da
ta will be conducted by [CONTACT_460401](s). Dosing in Parts D2, 
E, and F will start after t
his review, if supported by [CONTACT_460391].  
Part E subjects who are participating in Study VX11-661-110 (Study 661-110), an open-label 
study of TEZ/IVA combination therapy, will not need to washout TEZ/IVA treatment; these 
subjec
ts will transition directly from their prior treatment to the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period 
providing that they meet all eligibility criteria. These subjects can have screening assessments for 
this study done while they are continuing to participate in Study 661-110.  
Key study elements are summarized in Table 9-2. The treatment arms and randomization ratios 
for each part are summarized in Table 9-3. A schematic of the study design is shown in

Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit).  
Study eligibility for Part E subjects will
 be confirmed before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in the 
Run-in Period (on the Day -28 Visit). Subjects who prematurely discontinue TEZ/IVA during the 
Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period (Period 1), unless 
they rescreen and complete a 4-week Run-in Period (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2).  
Study visits during the Run-in Period will occur as shown in Table
 3-7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Period (Parts D, E, and F) 
To be eligible to continue into the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease and 
have remained on stable CF medication regimen during the [ADDRESS_588182] had an acute non-CF illness within 14 days before the Da
y 1 Visit. 
The VX-445 treatment duration is 4 weeks. The Trea
tment Period duration is approximately 
5 weeks for Parts D1 and D2 (Period 1 + Period 2), 4 weeks for Part E (Period 1), and 4 weeks 
for Part F (Period 1). All study periods will be conducted as des

withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Independent Data Monitoring Committee (Parts D, E, and F) 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_82571] (IDMC), which will 
conduct reviews of safety data from all parts of the study. The IDMC Charter, which will be 
finalized before the first subject is screened, will include procedural details of the IDMC 
structure and function, triggers for meetings, and plans for data to be reviewed. The IDMC Chair 
will review available safe
ty and PK data from Parts A, B, and C of the study prior to 
commencement of dosing in Part
 D1 to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with the study.

9.3 Rationale for S
tudy Des
ign and Study Drug Regimens 
9.3.1 Study Design 
[IP_ADDRESS] Parts A, B, and C 
Parts A (except Cohort A7) and B have a parallel- group, dose-escalation design, with each 
subj
ect participating in only 1 cohort to avoid PK and/or PD carryover effects. 
VX-445 is being developed in TC with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF, and subjects with CF 
will be dosed with the TC in Parts D and E of this study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Part C of this 
study is included to e
valuate the safet
y, tolerability, and PK of the TC in healthy subjects befor e 
subjects with CF are dosed with the TC. 
Parts A (except Cohort A7), B, and C will be randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled 
in order to avoid bias in the collection a
nd evaluation of safety and tolerability data during study 
conduct. Placebo was chosen as the control treatment to assess whether any observed effects are 
treatment-related or simply related to the study conditions. 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588187] 2 subjec
ts are dosed (1 active, 1 placebo), there will be at 
least a 24-hour observation period before the re
maining subjects in Cohorts A1 and C1 are 
dosed. Staggered dosing will be used in Cohort A1 bec
ause this is the first time VX-[ADDRESS_588188] time 
VX-445 will be administered in TC with TEZ/IVA in humans. Staggered dosing for Part B is not 
considered necessary beca
use the total daily dose in the first cohort (Cohort B1) will be at least 
[ADDRESS_588189] Part A dose for which safety, tolerability and PK results are 
available and that is safe and well tolera
ted. Therefore, the relative risk to subjects dosed in 
Cohort B1 is considered to be less than that of subjects in Cohorts A1 and C1. 
Cohort A7  
Cohort A7 will not be initiated until all data r
equir
ed to support administration of the VX-445 
tablet and IV formulations are available. Subj
ects in Cohort A7 will receive up to 3 single doses 
of VX-445: 2 single oral doses of tablet (dose to be de
termined [TBD] pending PK data from 
previous Part A cohorts, but not to exceed the highest dos
e that was safe and well tolerated) and 
a single IV dose (the planned dose is 20 mg, but ma
y be adjusted pending data from previous 
Part A cohorts; however, the final selected dose will not be predicted to exceed the highest 
exposure that was safe and well tolerated). Each dosing occasion will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
6 days. Based on nonclinical data, the interval between dosing occasions is considered adequate 
to minimize any potential for carryover. However, the washout interval of 6 days may be 
increased if needed based on emerg
ing PK data from earlier Part A cohorts. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Parts D, E, and F
 
This is the first time that VX-445 will be administered to subjects with CF. The TC regimen of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA will be evaluated in Parts D and E because in vitro, the TC has shown high 
levels of efficacy and has shown to provide a gr
eater increase in chloride transport than any of 
the dual combinations or individual compounds .11 The safety of VX-445 monotherapy will be 
evaluated in Parts A and B in healthy subjects, and the safety of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA 
will be evaluated in Part C in healthy subj
ects. A Phase 3 program for TEZ/IVA is ongoing. 
Parts D and E are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA 
and to establish proof-of-concept in 2 populations of subjects defined by [CONTACT_460403] (F/MF 
and F/F). Additionally, Part F will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ 
and VX-561 (a deuterated form of IVA) in subjects with F/MF genotypes, if conducted at the 
sponsor’s discretion. 
Efficacy has not be
en demonstrated for a corrector, potentiator, or any corrector/potentiator 
combination in subjects with F/MF genotypes. A Phase 3 study of TEZ/IVA in subjects with 
F/MF genotypes (Study VX
14-661-107) was terminated following a planned interim futility 
analysis which showed that the combina
tion of TEZ/IVA did not result in a pre-specified 
improvement in lung function. Because there is no effective treatment for this population, 
placebo is the control in Parts D1, D2, and F.  
A potential for benefit was demonstrated for TEZ/IVA in subjects with the  F/F genotype in 
Study VX11-661-[ZIP_CODE], and a Phase 3 study of TEZ/IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype 
(Study VX14-661-106) demonstrated a cli
nically meaningful benefit across multiple endpoints.18 
Therefore, TEZ/IVA is the active control in Part E.  

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588190] Part A dose for 
which safety, tolera
bility, and PK results are available and that is safe and well tolerated. 
Initiation of successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on safety and PK data as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
Part C VX-445 Starting Dose and Dose Escalation 
Part C may be initiated while Parts A and B are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and 
PK data.  
The starting dose
 (Cohort C1) will be at least [ADDRESS_588191] Part B dose for 
which safety and tole
rability results are available and supportive. Dosing will be staggered in 
Cohort C1, with 2 subjects dosed (1 with VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA and 1 with triple 
placebo) at least 24 hours
 before the remaining 6 subjects. Staggering at higher doses may be 
conducted if deemed necessar
y based on review of emerging safety data. 
Parts B and C Treat
ment Duration 
The duration of dosing in Part B (10 days) and Part C (14 days) is a standard duration for 
multiple-dosing in first
-in-human studie
s and is of sufficient length for an early assessment of 
safety and tolerability and for assessment of steady-state PK.  
TEZ and IVA Doses (Part C)  
The doses of TEZ and I
VA are the same as those being evaluated in Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA 
combination therapy (
TEZ: 100 mg qd; IVA: 150 mg q12h). These doses of TEZ and IVA are 
appropriate for evaluatio
n in the TC based on in vitro experiments with VX-[ADDRESS_588192] is predicted for VX-445 oral absorption. 
However, given the ultimate intent to administer VX-445 in combination with TEZ/IVA, which 
are administered with fat-containing food, this early assessment of safety and PK will be 
conducted under fed conditions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Parts D, E, and F 
VX-445 Dosage 
VX-445 will be given qd. 
Part D may be initiated while Parts A, B, and C are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, 
and PK data. Single doses of VX
-445 up to 360 mg were safe and well tolerated in Part A, and 
multiple doses of VX-445 up to 340 mg qd fo
r 10 days were safe and well tolerated in Part B. In 
Part C, multiple doses of VX
-445 up to 280 mg qd in TC with TEZ 100 mg qd and IVA 150 mg 
q12h were safe and well
 tolerated after 14 days of dosing. 
Part D1 will evaluate 1 dose level (mid-dose: 100 mg qd) of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA to 
assess safety, tolerabil
ity, and PK in a smaller subset of subjects before enrolling a larger number 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588193] 
Part C dose for which safety and tolerability results are available and supportive. 
Part D2 will evaluate 3 dose levels of VX-445 (low: 50 mg qd; mid: 100 mg qd; and 
high: 200 mg qd) in TC with TEZ/IVA. The TC-high dose of VX-[ADDRESS_588194] dose shown to be safe and well tolerated in Parts A, B, and C. 
The dose levels evaluated in Part D2 will be expected to
 provide clinical benefit (based on 
in vitro data) and will be selected to provide a range of exposure for exposure-response analyses 
of safety and efficacy.  
The highest TC dose of 200 mg qd VX-445 used in Part D2 will also be used in Parts E and F. 
Dose- and exposure-response information obtained for
 the TC in Part D (subjects with F/MF 
genotypes) is expected to be applica
ble to other populations with an F508del mutation, including 
F/F, based on similar potency of the TC in HBE cells that have 1 copy or 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] F508del.11  
TEZ Dosage 
In all study parts, the TEZ dosage will be 100 mg qd, which is the same dose being evaluated in 
Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA.  
IVA Dosage 
In Parts D and E, the IVA dosage will be 150 mg q12h. This dosage is being used in Phase 3 
studies of TEZ/IVA and is also the approved IVA 
monotherapy dosage for patients aged 
12 years and older.  
VX-561 Dosage 
A VX-561 dose of 150 mg qd was selected for e
valuation in Part F based on preliminary PK 
results from a relative bioavailability stud
y (Stud
y VX16-770-018) evaluating the 50-mg table t 
formulation of VX-561. 150-mg qd is predicted to result in similar PK parameters as IVA when 
administered alone at a dose of [ADDRESS_588195] clinically meaningful improvements in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_460368]-R; differences in biomarkers of CFTR activity (sweat chloride) between IVA and placebo 
groups were also demonstrated. Furthermore, in Study VX11-661-101 dose-dependent 
improvements in lung function were observed 
for TEZ/IVA after [ADDRESS_588196] observed within 14 days. Given the increased 
in vitro response of the TC relative to TEZ/IVA, it is expected that the 4-week treatment duration 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588197] is pre
dicted for VX-445 oral 
absorption. 
9.3.3 Study Population (Parts D, E, and F) 
The study will include subjects with F/MF and F/F  genotypes. The inclusion of subjects with 
F/MF and F/F genotypes is based on in vitro data that indicate the potential for significant 
improvements in chloride transport for CF patients with [ADDRESS_588198] 
of care (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
9.3.[ADDRESS_588199] parameters for Phase 1 clinical studies.  
Rationales for other safety, PK, and PD assessments ar
e listed below: 
4β-hydroxycholesterol (Part B)  
4β-hydroxycholesterol is an endogenous marker for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity.20 
Evaluation of 4β-hydroxycholesterol is increasingly being used to assess potential clinical 
CYP3A induction. In Part B, comparison of 4β-hydroxycholesterol on Day
 10 (predose) relative 
to baseline (Day 1 predose) will be used to evaluate potential induction of CYP3A by [CONTACT_94273]-445. 
Based on in vitro data, VX-445 is not expected to be an inducer of CYP3A.11 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (Parts B and C) 
Transient declines in lung function have been observed at initiation of treatment with another 
CFTR corrector that is not included in the current study (LUM).21 Although nonclinical toxicity 
results do not indicate a risk of lung function decline for VX-445, lung function, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038], will be included in Parts B and C as a precautionary safety measure.

[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medi
cations 
Table 9-5 lists prohibited medications. TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 are metabolized extensively via 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. VX-445 has a low potential to be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP 
enzymes based on in vitro data but is meta
bolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5. Therefore, use of moderate and 
strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, which ha
ve the potential to alter the exposure of 
VX-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 will be prohibited. VX-445 is a potential inhibitor of the 
hepatic transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). Therefore, sensitive 
substrates of OATP1B1, such as HMG- Co-
A Reductase Inhibitors (“statins”) are prohibited 
during treatment. Commercially available CFTR modulators are also prohibited.

9.7 Dose Escalation Criteria 
9.7.1 Parts A, B, and C 
The decision to initiate successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on safety, tolerability, 
and available PK data from preceding cohort(s), as indicated in Sections [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS] , 
and [IP_ADDRESS]. The investigator, Vertex medical monitor, and Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) 
physician will conduct a blinded evaluation of all safety data on an ongoing basis, and all 
Grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormalities or AEs (Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Trials) will be evaluated to 
determine if dosing/dose escalation should be continued. A safety report, which includes 
available PK data and justification for selection of the dose, will be prepared by [CONTACT_460405]. 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 70 of 114 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS] Part A 
The planned dose escalation scheme for Part A is shown in Ta
ble 9-1. Doses may be adjusted 
upward or downward based on safety, tolerability, and PK data from preceding dose group(s). 
No dose increment will be expected to yield greater than a 3-fold increase (Cohorts A1 
through A3) or a 2-fold increase (all other Part A 
cohorts except Cohort A7) in exposure from 
the preceding dose level. Dose escalation will be stopped when the prede
fined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_325683] (see Section  9.8). 
The decision to initiate successive cohorts and dose selec
tion will be based on safety, tolerability, 
and available PK data from all subjects in each preceding cohort. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Part B 
Part B may be initiated while Part A is ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. 
The starting daily dose (Cohort B1) will be at l
east [ADDRESS_588222] based on safety, tolerability, a

[IP_ADDRESS] Part C 
Part C may be initiated while Parts A and B are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and 
PK data. The starting dose (Cohort C1) will be
 at least [ADDRESS_588224] Part B dose for which safety and tolerability results 
are available and supportive. 
9.7.2 Parts 
D, E, and F 
If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. 
9.8
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] 
9.8.1 Parts A, B, and C 
Dose escalation will be stopped if the mean AUC 0-∞ (single-dose escalation) or AUC 0-24h 
(multiple-dose escalation) of the next dose is predicted to exceed an AUC of 290 μg·h/mL or the 
Cmax is predicted to exceed 19.5 μg/mL (NOAEL exposure at the 50 mg/kg/day dose in male rats 
in the 28-day
 GLP toxicity study). 
An individual subj
ect will discontinue study drug dosing if the subject has a serious adverse 
event (SAE) or an AE that jeopardizes the subject’s safety. The investigator must immediately 
notify the Vertex medical monitor if either an SAE or a severe (or greater) AE occurs that is 
considered related or possibly related to study drug. All SAEs, regardless of the presumed 
relationship to study drug, must also be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  If an SAE occurs that is considered related or possibly related to study drug, or if 2 severe (or 
greater)
 AEs occur that are considered related or possibly related to study drug, then the study 
will be halted (i.e., dosing of study drug in all study subjects will be halted). Occurrence of such 
events will trigger an internal safety review, including discussion between the investigator and 
medical monitor. The study may be restarted if the sponsor and the investigator decide that this is 
appropriate.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_588225] elevations of >3 × ULN, or total bilirubin 
>2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by [CONTACT_460406] [ADDRESS_588226] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 
48 to 72 hours). 
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), and 
the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria are met: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice 
 Indirect bilirubin >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct 
bilirubin) 
A thorough inv
estigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued , if either of the following criteria is met: 
 Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral 
hepatitis, or alcohol inge
stion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels 
have improved 
 Subsequent indirect bilirubin values confirm the initial value as >2 × ULN (defined as 
ULN for tot
al bilirubin minus ULN for direct bilirubin), in association with decreased 
haptoglobin 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation and/or increased bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases or 
bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval of the medical 
monitor is required befo
re resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, 
transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined 
transaminase or bilirubin eleva
tion interruption threshold recurs during the Treatment Period 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 72 of 114

All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin 
should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.

on study; however, Vertex retains the right to remove a subject from the study. 
In Parts D, E, and F, subjects who have been randomized and whose screening CFTR genotype 
does not confirm study e
ligibility must be discontinued from the study, even if a previous CFTR 
genotype laboratory report was used to establish eligibility. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all 
unused investigational products (Parts D, E, and F), request that the subject return for a Safety 
Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see S
ection [IP_ADDRESS] for Parts A, B, and C and  Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
Parts D, E, and F), and follow up with the subje
ct regarding any unresolved AEs. 
If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no fur
ther evaluations will be performed and no 
additional data will be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use the study data and 
samples collected. The study data and the samples may be used for the development of the study 
compound, other drugs, or diagnostics, in publications and pr
esentations, or for education 
purposes. If the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will 
remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her 
information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from 
him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her samples. Any 
information that already has been obtained from the samples will continue to be used.

urine will be performed and results provided for leukocytes, erythrocytes, crystals, bacteria, and casts.  
c If blood urea nitrogen cannot be collected, urea may be substituted.  
d Haptoglobin will be analyzed only if there is evidence of possible hemolysis as determined by [CONTACT_779].  
Pregnancy (β-human chorionic gonadotropin) tests 
Parts A, B, and C: serum samples will be analyzed at the local laboratory for all female 
subjects. 
Par
ts D, E, and F : serum samples will be analyzed at the central laboratory for all females of 
childbearing potential. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the site. The urine pregnancy 
test must be negative before the first dose of study drug (Day 1 for Parts D1, D2, and F; Day -28 
for Part E). Additiona
l pregnancy tests may be required according to local regulations and/or 
requirements.  
Follicle-stimulating Hormone, Screening Period only (All Parts): Blood sample for FSH will be 
measured for any suspected postmenopausal female with at least [ADDRESS_588245], Screening Period only (All Parts): Blood sampl es will be collected for the 
G6PD activity test, which will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay 
routinely. For Parts D, E, and F, the use of a local laboratory that routinely runs quantitative 
G6PD activity assays is ac
ceptable as an alternative to the central laboratory. 
Serology (Parts A, B, and C): HBsAg, HCV antibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 Abs, and p24 antigen 
will be tested for. 
Drug and Alcohol Testing (Parts A, B, and C): Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], methadone, cannabinoids, cocaine, 
amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cotinine, and alcohol levels 
will be assessed by a blood or urine test; alcohol breath tests are acceptable alternatives for 
alcohol testing. Subjects may undergo random urine drug screen and alcohol testing if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. Drug screen result must be negative for all subjects to receive 
study drug. 
CFTR genotype, Screening Period only (Parts D, E, and F):  CFTR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_460383]. If the screening CFTR genotype result is not received before randomization, a 
previous CFTR genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility. Subjects who 
have been randomized and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibility must be 
discontinued from the study (Section 9.9). 
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
In Parts D, E, and F, for purposes of study conduct, the central laboratory must be used for all 
laboratory tests with the exceptions not
ed above. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion 
of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value 
is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_460414]. If it is not possible 
to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), 
the investigator may base the assessment of a
n AE on the local laboratory value. 
11.7.[ADDRESS_588246] 
study visits (Section 3). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom-directed vital sign 
assessments can be performed at t
he discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider. 
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, 
and throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; 
and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs. 
Parts D, E, and F only: The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body 
systems: EENT, cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], skin, and abdomen. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest in the seated position.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  11.7.4 Pulse Oximetry (Parts D, E, and F) 
Arterial oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_460415] a 5-minute rest 
(seated) and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse 
oximetry will be collected before the morning dose. This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen 
delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. 
11.7.5 Electrocardiograms 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety ECGs 
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3). Additional standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed at 
any other time if cli
nically indicated.  
The subject will be instructed to rest in the seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site, as shown in Section 3. A printout of the 
ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_460416]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the 
Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
Study sites should use QTcF unless they receive approval in adva
nce from the medical monitor 
to use QTcB. 
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately
 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. I
f either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 m
sec from baseline or 
≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.
 Further details 
pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separate document (ECG 
Manual). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Continuous ECGs for Cardiodynamic Assessment (Part A, With the 
Exception of Cohort A7) 
In Part A, continuous ECGs will be obtained per Table 3-2 using a continuous 12-lead digital 
recor
der. The continuous 12-lead digital ECG da
ta will be stored onto Secure Digital memory 
cards. ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by [CONTACT_460417] 3-2 and will be read centrally. At each protocol-specified time point, 10 ECG replicates 
will be extracted from a 5-minute “ECG window” (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]
, the last [ADDRESS_588247] i
s maintained in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]-recumbent quiet position). 
The following principles will be followed in the laboratory: 
 ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation. 
 Baseline and on-treatment ECGs for a particular subject will be over-read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by [CONTACT_336601]. 
 The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analyzable, then the primary lead of 
analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set. 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 86 of 114 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  The ECG data collected by [CONTACT_460418], or the analysis 
may be restricted initially to 1 or more cohorts. The decision to analyze the ECG data will be 
based on future development decisions for VX-445. If it is determined that the continuous ECG 
data will be ana
lyzed, a separate analysis plan will be created for the evaluation of the ECG data, 
including the Cardiodynamic ECG Assessment and Concentration-QTc Analysis.

[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception 
Contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following: 
 True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must 
be practiced from the Screening Visit through [ADDRESS_588250] dose of study drug.  
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the first 
dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_155425]).  
 If the female is of non-childbearing potential. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum FSH level 
within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females. 
• Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy. 
Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do not have 
a documented bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) will be considered to be of 
childbearing potential.  
 Same sex relationships  

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 87 of 114

12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 
This section presents a summary of the planned safety analyses and clinical pharmacology for 
this study. Safety statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
for this study, and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical 
pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before clinical database 
lock. 
Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study, all data have been 
entered in the clinical study database, and the database has been locked.  
12.[ADDRESS_588258] been performed. The number of subjects participating in 
each cohort is common in early clinical pharmacology studies and is considered sufficient to 
achieve the objectives of the study. 
12.1.2 Parts D, E, and F 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Objectives  
The primary objectives of Parts D, E, and F are the evaluation of safety and tolerability, and 
efficacy
 of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA (Parts D and E) and in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 (Part F) 
in subjects with CF. The sample size calculations described below are deemed adequate to 
evaluate the primary objectives, based on clinical and statistical considerations. 
Safety and Tolerability 
The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of AEs. Approximately 104 subjects with CF will 
be enrolled in
 the study with approximately 81 subjects receiving VX-445 in TC with either 
TEZ/IVA or TE
Z/VX-561. The sample size for each treatment group will provide sufficient data 
for a descriptive analysis of AEs.  
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV [ADDRESS_588259] 90% 
power to detect a mea
n change of 7 percentage points. 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Secondary Objectives  
A secondary objective of Parts D, E, and F is the evaluation of the PD effect of VX-445 in TC 
with TEZ/IVA (P
arts D and E) and in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 (Part F) in subjects with CF. 
The absolute change from baseline through Day [ADDRESS_588260] for a decreasing dose-response 
trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using a multiple comparisons 
procedure (MCP). The procedure consists of testing the null hypothesis of the lack of a 
decreasing dose-response trend versus a decreasing trend using the 1-sided maximum t-statistic 
that controls the type I error at alpha = 5%. The procedure requires a family of candidate 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588261] will be analyzed in the higher dose TC treatment group. For the purpose of 
analysis, the priority order of increasing study drug treatment will be defined as placebo, TC-
low, TC-mid, and TC-high.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis 
12.3.1 General Considerations 
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, standard error (SE), median, minimum value (min), and 
maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be 
specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, minimum and maximum values will be 
reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean, median, SD, and SE will 
be reported to [ADDRESS_588262] 
units (metric or Inter
national System [SI]) will be converted with the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_588263] recent non-missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1 of Treatment Period for Parts A, B, and C or Day 1 of Period 1 for 
Parts D, E, and F). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment 
measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment 
measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period 
(i.e., Day 1, as described above). 
Absolute chan
ge from baseline will be calculated as postbaseline value – baseline value. 
Relative ch
ange from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value – baseline 
value)/baseline
 value. 
Parts D, E, and F Only 
The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period will include the time from the first dose in Period [ADDRESS_588264] dose of the study drug for subjects who do not 
complete the Sa
fety Follow-up Visit. An additional TE period related to the Run-in Period in 
Part E will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate. Only data collected through the end of the 
study will be included for analysis. 
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for performing multiple hypothesis tests.  
The rules for ha
ndling missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be described in 
the SAP. 
All data will be summarized for Parts D, E, and F separately, unless specified otherwise.

No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Parts A, B, and C 
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary Enhanced 
(WHO-DDE) and categorized as the following for the purpose of analysis: 
1. Prior medication: Medication that started before the first dose of study drug, regardless of 
when dosing of the medication ended 
2. Concomitant medication: Medication received at or after the first dose of study drug, 
medication that was received before initial dosing and continued after initial dosing of study 
drug, or medicati
on with missing stop date 
If a medication start date is on or after the date of initial dosing of the study drug, then the 
medication will be summarized as concomitant medication regardless of whether the medication 
end date is missing or not. If a medication end date is before the date of initial dosing of the 
study drug, then the medication will be summarized as prior medication regardless of whether 
the medication start date is missing or not. Note that medication that started before initial dosing 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 92 of 114

separately as concomitant medication. 
Prior medications will be listed only. Concomitant medications will be summarized using 
Preferred Name. 
Parts D, E, and F 
Medications used in this study will be coded using the WHO- DDE and categorized as the 
following for the purpose of analysis: 
 Prior medication:  any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, 
regardless of when it ended 
 Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE Period 
 Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received after the TE Period 
A given medicati
on may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of 
study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in 
all [ADDRESS_588265] data listing. 
An additional classification of concomitant medications related to the Run-in Period in Part E 
will be defined in the

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS] Important Protocol Deviations (Parts D, E, and F Only) 
An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s 
rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP. 
All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing. 
12.3.3 Efficacy Analysis (Parts D, E, and F Only) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Variables 
The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change from baseline for ppFEV 1 through Day 29 
in Parts D, E, a
nd F. The analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) with
 change from baseline as the dependent variable. The model will include 
treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as random 
effect, and the continuous baseline ppFEV [ADDRESS_588266] errors. If the model estimation does not converge, a 
compound symmetry covariance structure will be used. Conditional on observed data and 
covariates, missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be assumed to be missing 
at random. 
Adjusted mea
ns and 95% confidence intervals of the average treatment effects through Day 29, 
as applicable, w
ith 2-sided P values, will be estimated within MMRM using LSMeans via PROC 
MIXED in SAS, for a
ll within-group and between-group comparisons in both parts. 
Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be 
described in the SAP.  
Additional supportive analyses utilizing the Washout Period in Part E to compare treatment 
groups will be desc
ribed in the SAP. Subgroup analyses will also be described in the SAP. 
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for performing multiple hypothesis tests. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variabl es 
The secondary efficacy variables are relative change in ppFEV [ADDRESS_588267] a decreasing dose-response 
trend (in Part D) of VX-445 at 3 doses in TC with TEZ/IVA relative to placebo based on sweat 
chloride, will be per
formed using the MCP procedure with the pre-specified comparisons 
(contrasts) of the treatment group means within an MMRM framework. The model will include 
treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with the continuous 
baseline sweat chloride as a covariate. The test will be performed using the 1-sided maximum 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 94 of 114 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  t-statistic of the individual t-statistics for the multiple pre-specified contrasts at alpha = 5%, 
based on the trea
tment group means through Day 29 in Part D.  
Estimation of Trea
tment Effects 
In a separate MMRM model, adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals of the average 
treatment effe
cts through Day 29, with 2-sided P values, for all  within-group and between-group 
comparisons for each part, separately, will be estimated within MMRM, with appropriate 
adjustment for covariates. 
Additional details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
12.3.5 Safety Analysis

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Parts A, B, and C 
AEs will be coded according to MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
an AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_306029]. AEs will 
be classified as pretreatment or treatment-emergent. 
Pretreatment AEs are defined as AEs that were reported or worsened after signing the ICF up 
to the start of study drug dosing. 
Treatment-emergent AEs  are defined as AEs that were reported or worsened on or after the 
start of study drug dosing through the Safety Follow-up Visit. 
Only TEAEs will be summarized in tables. All summaries of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_460421]. Some rules that will apply to the 
summarization of AEs are (1) a subject with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a 
continuing AE will be counted only once; (2) only the maximum severity level will be presented 
in the severity summary; and (3) only the worst relationship level will be presented in the 
relationship summary. 
AEs leading to death, SAEs, dose interruption, and permanent discontinuation will be listed 
separately. All AEs through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be listed in an individual subject data 
listing, including pretreatment AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_588268]-treatment 
AEs, defined as follows: 
 
 Pretreatment AE : any AE that started before the first dose of study drug 
 TEAE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed at or after the first 
dose of study drug through the end of the TE Period 
 Post-treatment AE : any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed 
beyond the TE Period 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study drug treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs. 
AE summary tables will be presented for TEAEs only, overall and by [CONTACT_460422], and will include the following: 
 All TEAEs 
 TEAEs by [CONTACT_155429]  
 TEAEs by [CONTACT_764]

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the
 ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
13.1.1.
[ADDRESS_588274] result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself w
ill be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal stud
y assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of 
the following: 
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588275]’s clinica
l status indicates a life-threatening AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points: 
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent) 
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit 
 For enrolled subjects in Parts A, B, and C who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, 
[ADDRESS_588276] dose of study drug 
 For enrolled subjects in Parts D, E, and F who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the 
earliest of 
o [ADDRESS_588277] dose of study drug 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_588278]'s source documents. The following data will be documented 
for each AE: 
 Description of the event 
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
 Severity  
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_588279] the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Toxicity Grading Scale for

guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_a
pplications/ctc.htm (Accessed August 
2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades
 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” The severity of 
an AE that does not appe
ar in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in 
Table 13-1.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Caus
ality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-[ADDRESS_588281] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administr ation of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease . 
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug  (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  

Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.[ADDRESS_588282] to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug  administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed bef ore the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/Resolved With 
Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_460387]16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 103 of 114 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.
g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergenc
y room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred be
fore the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168788], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168789] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indica
te an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow-up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_306031]. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related 
to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately 
reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_460428](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be 
assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and 
severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not 
resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes 
of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, 
regardless of the p
resumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be 
completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes 
available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  APPENDIX A  CFTR Mutations That Are Predicted to Result in a CFTR Protein 
With Minimal Function (Parts D and F) 
Per the study eligibility criteria, heterozygous F508del-CFTR  subjects in Part D must have a 
second CFTR  allele containing a mutation that is predicted to result in a CFTR protein with 
minimal function and not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy. These CFTR mutations 
were defined using 3 major sources:  
 biological plausibility for the mutation to respond (i.e., mutation class) 
 evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (per CFTR2 patient registry; accessed 
on 15 February 2016) 
o average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, and 
o prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50% 
 in vitro testing 
o mutations resulting in baseline chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR were 
considered minimal function 
o mutations resulting in chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR following the 
addition of TEZ and/or IVA were considered nonresponsive  
The clinical severity criteria (average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L and %PI >50%) do not apply 
to the individual subjec
ts to be enrolled in this study, but were used to classify the mutation 
status on a population level. 
The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by [CONTACT_13247]-cleared 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_124365]; however, this list may not include every eligible mutation, and investigators 
should contact [CONTACT_460430].

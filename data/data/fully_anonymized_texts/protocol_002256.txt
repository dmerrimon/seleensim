NAME [CONTACT_11715] :Celgene International II Sàrl
(CIS II)PROTOCOL No. :RPC01 -202
NAME [CONTACT_29703]: RPC1063
TITLE OF STUDY : A Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, d ouble -blind, placebo -controlled parallel -group 
study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of induction therapy with RPC 1063 in patients with 
moderate ly to severely  active ulcerative colitis
PLANNED NUMBER OF STUDY CENTERS: It is planned to initiate approximately 80study centers to 
enroll patient s in North America, Europe ,and Asia Pacific.
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: 2
PLANNED STUDY DATES: The planned duration of the study is from October 2012 through December 
2019.
OBJECTIVES: 
Primary Objective: The primary  objective of the study  is to compare the efficacy  of RPC1063 vs placebo 
for induction of clinical remission at W eek 8 in patients wit h moderate lyto severely active ulcerative colitis 
(UC)
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to:
Compare the efficacy of RPC1063 vs placebo at weeks 8 and 32 as measured by [CONTACT_207375], 
clinical remission, and mucosal healing
Compare the overall safety and tolerability of RPC1063 vs placebo for the duration of the study
 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:   Study RPC01 -202 is a Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled , parallel -group study in patients with moderate ly to severe lyactive UC.
This study includes 3 periods ( Screen ing, Induction, and Maintenance) and an optional Open -Label 
Treatment Period (OLP) .  Following the 5-week Screen ingPeriod, eligible patients will be randomized and 
enter the9-week placebo - controlled Induction Period (IP) .  Patients who are responders at Week 8 will
continue on their assigned treatment in the 24 -week Maintenance Period (MP) .  Non-responders at W eek [ADDRESS_247706] not. Itis 
anticipated that approximately 50 % of the patients included in the study will have receive d anti-TNF 
therapy .  
Induction Period (IP) :  The IP will serve as a dose -finding study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
RPC1063 for the induction of clinical response, remission, and mucosal healing in patients with moderately
to severely active UC .  The IP will last 9 weeks and consists of dose escalatio n over 8 days follo wed by [CONTACT_207376] 8-week s.
Approximately 180 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens :
RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl 0.5mg(equivalent to o zanimod 0.46 mg)daily oral capsule
RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl 1mg(equivalent to ozanimod 0.92 mg)daily oral capsu
le
Placebo daily  oral capsule

6The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_146275] -TNF therapy experience (yes versus no).
For patients randomized to one of the active treatment groups, there will be an8-daydose escalation
regimen in the IPconsist ingof 4days of treatment with RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl 0.25 mg (equivalent to 
ozanimod 0.23 mg), followed by 3 day s of treatment with RPC1063 0.5 mg , followed by [CONTACT_207377].
Maintenance Period (MP) :  All patients who complete the IP and are responders at Week [ADDRESS_247707] the 
option to enter the OLP.
Disease relapse is defined as when all of the following criteria are met:
An increase in UC disease activity as defined by [CONTACT_207378] 2 points 
compared to the Week 8 partial Mayo score with an absolute partial Mayo score 4 points
An endoscopic subscore of 2 points
Exclusion of other causes of an i ncrease in disease activity unrelated to underlying UC 
(e.g., infections, change in medication)
Open -Label Treatment Period ( OLP ):  Patients who complete the IP and are non-responders at Week [ADDRESS_247708] not shown 
clinical improvement 8 weeks after initiation of the OLP should discontinue from the study. Eligible 
patients willbe transitioned into the Phase 3 open -label extens ion UC Study RPC01 -3102 and will be able 
to immediately enter the study (without completing the 30 -day or 90- day Safety Follow -up Visit s).  The 
OLP will continue for up to 6 years or until marketing approval of RPC1063 for UC in the country of the 
clinical site(estimated to be in 201 9),or completed transition of patients to Study RPC01- 3102, or until the 
Sponsor discontinues the development program .
Safety Monitoring/Follow -up:  
Potential adverse events (AEs) of interest that may be a consequence of sphingosine 1 -phosphate 1 
receptor 1 ( S1P 1)modulation will be closely monitored during the study . These AEs include bradycardia, 
heart conduction abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, macular edema, cutaneous malignancy, serious or

7opportunistic infection and hepatotoxicity.   A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) forthe study will 
perform safety reviews periodically ,approximately four times a year until the end of the Maintenance 
Period .
The safety of patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_207379] -emergent AEs, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), physical exams, vital signs, Holter monitoring ,electrocardiograms ( ECG s), pulmonary function 
tests, optical coherence tomography (OCT), blood chemistry and hematology panels, coagulation panel s, 
and urinalysis at baseline and various time points during the study .  White blood cell (WBC )counts and 
lymphocy te counts will be monitored centrally (and will not be provided to the site) to prevent potential 
unblind ing of the Investigator .  Patients who discontinue from treatment due to lack of response, AEs, or 
other reasons, even if alternative treatment is given ,will be followed for 90days for collection of safety 
data and for the assessment of their disease status.

319. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1. Overall Study Design and Plan
Study  RPC01- [ADDRESS_247733] ive UC.
This study  includes 3 periods ( Screen ing, Induct ion, and Maintenance) and an optional 
Open -Label  Treatm ent Period (OLP).  Following the 5-week Screen ingPeriod, eligible 
patients will  be rando mized and enter the
[ADDRESS_247734] the opti on to enter the OLP .
The study  will include both anti -TNF pat ients as well as ant i-TNF naïve pat ients. Itis 
anticipated that approximately 50% of the patients enro lled will have had prior anti- TNF 
therapy  experi ence.
The study  design i s shown in Figure 1.  Assessments and procedures are outlined in Table 1
for the IP and MP and Table 2for the OLP .  Assessments are described in Secti on11.
Induction Period (IP)
The IP will serve as a dose -finding study  to assess the efficacy  and safet y of RPC1063 for the 
induct ion of clinical response, remission, and mucosal healing in pat ients with moderately to 
severely  active UC .  
The IP will last 9 weeks and consists of dose escalat ionover 8 days 
followed by [CONTACT_207390] 8 weeks.
Approximately  180 pati ents will be rando mized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatment 
regimens:
RPC10 63/ozanim od HCl  0.5mg(equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 mg)daily oral 
capsule
RPC1063 /ozanim od HCl  
1mg(equivalent to ozanimod 0.92 mg)daily oral 
capsule
Placebo daily  oral capsule
The rando mizat ion will be stratified by  [CONTACT_146275] -TNF therapy  experi ence (yes or no) .  
For pati ents randomized to one of the active treatment groups, there will be a n 8-day dose 
escalat ionregimen in the IP consisting of 4 days of treatment with RPC1063 /ozanim od HCl  
0.25 m g (equivalent to ozanimod 0.23 mg ), followed by  [ADDRESS_247735] 8 weeks .
Maintenance Period (MP)
All patients who complete the IP and are responders ( see Secti on13.8) at Week [ADDRESS_247736] vi sit in the MP will occur at Week 32 .  Patients

32who com plete the MP will be given the optionto parti cipate in the OLP. Patients that enter 
the MP and experience disease relapse will have the option to enter the OLP .
Optional Open -Label Treatment Period ( OLP )
Patients who com plete the IP and are non-responders at Week [ADDRESS_247737] not shown clinical improvement 8weeks after init iation of the OLP shoul d 
discontinue fro m the study .  
Eligible pat ients willbe transit ioned into the Phase 3 open -label 
extensio n UC Study  RPC01- 3102 and will be able to immediately enter the study  (without 
completing the 30 -day or 90-day Safety Fo llow -up Visits).   The OLP will cont inue for up to 
6 years ,or until market ing approval of RPC1063 for UC in the country  of the clinical site 
(estimated t o be in 2019), or completed transit ion of patients to Study  RPC01 -3102, or until 
the Sponsor discont inues the development program.
Safety Monitoring/Follow -up
Potenti al AEs of  interest that m ay be a consequence of S1P 1modulation will be closely 
monitored during the study .  These AEs include brady cardi a, heart conducti on abnorm alities, 
pulmo nary toxicity, macular edema, cutaneous malignancy, serious or opportuni stic 
infect ion,and hepatotoxicit y.  A DMC for the study  will perform  safet y reviews periodically , 
approximately  [ADDRESS_247738] ion of treatment -emergent AEs,SAEs, 
physical exams, vital signs, Holter monitoring and ECGs, PFTs , optical coherence 
tomography  (OCT ), blood chemistry  and hematol ogy panels, coagulation panel s, and 
urinalysis at baseline and at various time points during the study .  White blood cell (W BC)
counts and lymphocy te counts will be m onitored centrally  (and will not be provided to the 
site)to prevent potential unblinding o f the Invest igator.  
Patients who discont inue from treatm ent due to l ack of  response, AEs, or other reasons, even 
if alternat ive treatment is given, will be fo llowed for 90days for collect ion of safet y data and 
for the a ssessment of their disease status .

pregnancy test result is positive, the Investigator will instruct the patient to suspend further RPC1063 dosing, if applicable, and schedule a follow -
up 
appointment as soon as possible.  A serum pregnancy test will be performed for confirmation, incl uding after the 90-day Safety  Follow -up Visit, if needed.
j.At screening includes height and weight, and Visits 1, 5, 6, End -of-Study , and 30-day Safety Follow - up Visit includes weight only.   A complete PE will be 
performed at screening and End -of-Study . The complete physical examination will include a full examination of the skin for lesions as well as a check for visual 
symptoms (i.e. ,blurred vision or decreased visual acuity).  
k.An interim physical examination will be conducted at Visits 1, 5, 6, and 30-day Safety Follow -upVisit . The interim PE will include areas with previously noted 
abnormalities and/or that are associated with any new complaints from the patient.  The interim PE will also include a check for visual symptoms (i.e. ,blurred 
vision or decreased visual acuity).
l.DLCO ,if applicable, will be done at Screening and End of Study/ET.
m.Blood samples for PK evaluation are to be taken up to 15- 30 minutes prior to investigational drug (pre-dose) and just prior to discharge from the clinic ([ADDRESS_247743] dose) on Day 1.  Blood samples on Week [ADDRESS_247744] prior to dose administration.  The actual time of investigational drug administration for all visits with PK evaluation will be recorded on the dosing 
log.  The blood sample at the 30-day and 90-day Safety Follow - up V isitscan be collected at any point during the visit.  An additional PK sample will be 
obtained for patients with any AE resulting in unblinding, discontinuation, or SAE.    
n.At screening a colonoscopy will be required if the patient has had UC ≥[ADDRESS_247745] be completed with in21days of 
randomization.  This procedure can also be used to determine the endoscopy subscore component of the Mayo Score.  
o.At Visit 5, sigmoidoscopy should be performed eith er on day of visit or no more than 7 days prior to the visit date.
p.At screening patients will be issued with a Mayo diary and will be trained in the completion of the diary.
q.The Mayo partial clinical score on Day 1 should be combined with the Central endoscopic read in order to assess the patient f or “Mayo Score” entrance criteria.
r.The 90-day Safety  Follow -up Visit should be conducted as a clinic visit.  However, if the patien t is not available for a clinic visit, a telephone call follow - up 
should be performed (with at least 3 attempts within the visit window) to record the pregnancy test result, concomitant medic ations, and AEs, including 
information regarding relationship of the AE to RPC1063.
s. If ALC is confirmed < 200 cells/μL, the Investigator will temporarily discontinue investigational drug and then consult the Medical Monitor . Laboratory testing will be 
repeated weekly until ALC is > 500 cells/µL.  For patients whose ALC level is confirmed < 200 cells/μL and has not reached the acceptable range (ALC > 500cells/µL) 
during the study, laboratory testing will be repeated at the 90-day Safety  Follow -up Visit.

9.6.6. Study Treatment Storage and Accountability
Study treatment should not be used for purposes other than as defined in this protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Treatment Storage
RPC1063 and placebo capsules should be stored at room temperature ( approximately 25° C
[77°F], excursions permitted 15°C to 30°C [59°F to 86°F]) ina dry  locati on.  The inact ive 
ingredients used in the formulat ions are slight ly hygroscopic; therefore, all bottles contain a 
½-gram desiccant canister and should be kept tightly sealed when drug product is not being 
dispensed.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Treatment Accountabil ity
All supplies of invest igational drug and placebo will be accounted for in accordance with GCP.  
There will be an individual invest igational drug accountabilit y record for each patient and the 
Invest igator should maintain accurate records relating to investigational drug supplies received 
during the study .  These records should include the amounts and dates clinical drug supplies 
were received, dispensed to the patient, returned by  [CONTACT_207393].  If 
errors or damages in the cli nical drug supply  shipments occur, the Invest igator should contact 
[CONTACT_207394].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_207355] y 
records will be provided by  [CONTACT_207395] f or inclusion in the Trial Master File after databa se 
lock.  The Study  Moni tor will peri odically check the supplies of investigational drug held by  [CONTACT_207396] y of all invest igational drug used.
The Investigator will provide investigat ional drug only to the i dentified patients of this study , 
accor ding to the procedures described in this study protocol.  After the end of the study, the 
Study Moni tor will ensure that all unused invest igational drug and all medicat ion containers can 
be destroy ed on -site as l ong as pro per documentation is supplied.  The Study  Moni tor will  
perform  final accountabilit y, package, seal , and prepare for shipment.  If destruction on -site is 
not possible then medication and all medicat ion containers will be returned to Almac and 
docum entati on will be returned to the CRO.  The CRO will verify  that a final report of drug 
accountabilit y is prepared and maintained in the Investigator’s Study  Center File.

any time .  The Investi gator will provide a written explanat ion in the source documentation to be 
entered on the appropriate electroni c case report form (eCRF )page describing the reason for 
discontinuat ion.  If a patient withdraws before complet ion, every effort shou ld be made to 
complete the assessments atthe 30-day and 90-day S afety Follow - upVisits.  
A pat ient may discont inue the study  for the fo llowing medical or administrative reasons:
Invest igator decisio n
The Treating Invest igator may discont inue invest igational drug if it is determined that 
it is not in the patient’s best interest to receive further treatment .  The Medical 
Moni tor shoul d be prom ptly notified of the decisio n.
Adverse Event/ Inter current illness
A pat ient may be discont inued fro m the study  if, in the j udgment of the Invest igator , 
the pati ent devel ops an adverse event such as an intercurrent illness or complicat ion 
that is not consistent with the protocol requirements or that, in any  way, j ustifies
withdrawal  from the study .
Lack of Efficacy/ Worsening Disease
If the patient becomes pregnant

51Noncompliance
After consultation between the Invest igator , the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor
when appropriate, a patient may  be discont inued from the study fo r failure to com ply 
with protocol  requi rements .
Patient chooses to discont inue invest igational drug .
The patient may  choose to di scontinue investigat ional drug but has not withdrawn 
consent. In this case it is expected that the ET and 30 -day and 90-day Safety Follow -
up V isitswoul d be co mpleted.
Patient wi thdrawal of consent
Every  effort shoul d be made wit hin the bounds of safet y and pat ient choice to have 
each patient complete the study .  If a patient withdraws consent, the only addit ional 
study  data to be collected will be the follow-up of SAEs as mandated by  [CONTACT_760] .
Sponsor terminat ion or suspensio n of the study .
All patients who discont inue invest igational drug and who have not withdrawn consent shoul d 
complete an Early  Terminat ion Visit and the 30-day and 90-day Safety Follow - up V isitsfor the 
collect ion of safet y data and to assess their disease status (see Table 1and Table 2).  For subjects 
who hav e a confirmed ALC below the 200 cells/μL limit and permanent ly discontinue fro m 
participat ion in the study, central laboratory testing will cont inue every 14 days (± 3 days) after 
the Early  Terminat ion Visit until it is above the lower limit of normal.
The reason for discontinuat ion of invest igational drug will be recorded in the clinical records and 
the pati ent’s eCRF .  
9.7.2.
Withdrawal of Patients from the Study

Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_14181]-TNF treatm ent (yes vsno) and will be rando mized 1:1:1 to 
receive placebo, RPC1063 0.5 mg , or RPC1063 1 mg .  
9.12. Unblinding Procedures for Individual Patie nts
A patient’s treatment group assignment blind will not be broken unt il the end of the study  unless 
medical treatment of that patient depends upon knowing whether the patientis receiving act ive 
drug.  In the event that the blind needs to be broken becau se of a m edical emergency, the 
investigator may  unblind an individual pat ient’s treatment allocat ion. Prior to unblinding, the 
investigator should first attempt to contact [CONTACT_207402].   The treatment assignment will be unblinded 
through an IVRS .  Reasons for treatment unblinding must be clearly explained and just ified in 
the eCRF .  The date on which the code was broken ,together with the ident ity of the person 
responsible ,must also be documented.
A PK sample will be obtained whenever possible for patient s with any AE or SAE resul ting in

583Severe disease
aEach patient serves as his or her own control to establish the degree of abnormality of the stool frequency.
bThe daily bleeding score represents the most severe bleeding of the day.
cThe physician’s global assessment acknowledges the three other criteria, the patient’s daily recollection of 
abdominal discomfort and general s ense of well -being, and other observations, such as physical findings and the 
patient’s performance status.
Parti al Mayo scores are calculated using data from Items 1, 2 and 4 only.
Mayo scores are calculated using:
1.The Stool  frequency and rectal bleeding data form  the most recent consecut ive 3 -day 
period pri or to the visit,excluding the following:
a.The day  medicat ionsfor constipat ion,diarrhea, or 
bowel  irregulari ty aretaken
b.The day (s) of  a procedure or preparation fora procedure ( e.g., enemas , other 
laxative, clear liquid diet) that woul d affect bowel frequency  or bl ood content of 
the stool
c.The 48 hours following use of anti -motility agents (i.e.,loperamide )
d. T he 48 hours following endoscopy
Disease r elapse isdefined as when all of the following criteria are met:
An increase in UC disease activit y as defined by  [CONTACT_207404] 
2 points compared to the Week 8 partial Mayo score with an abso lute partial May o 
score 4 points
An endoscopic subscore of 2 points
Exclusio n of other causes of an increase in disease activit y unrelated to underlying 
UC ( e.g., infections, change in medication).
11.2. Clinical Safety Assessments
Physical Examination 
A co mplete physical examinat ion will include evaluation of heart, lung, head and neck, 
abdo minal, neuro logical, full examinat ionof the skin for lesions, and extremi ties.  An interim (or 
brief) physical examinat ion will include areas with previously noted abnormalit ies and/or that are 
associ ated wi th any new co mplaints fro m the patient.In addition, patients will be quest ioned on 
visual symptoms (i.e. ,blurred visio n or decreased visual acuit y) during both the complete and 
interim physical examinat ions.  
All significant findings that are present at screen ing must be reported on the relevant medical 
history /current m edical condit ions eCRF .  Significant findings made after randomizat ion that

Height will be measured at screen ing.  Weight will be monito red throughout the study .
Vital Signs
Heart rate and blo od pressure (systolic and diastolic ) will be assessed per the Schedule of Events 
(Table 1and Table 2).  
When obtaining the predose HRand BP during dose escalat ion(Day  1/1OL P
), the pati ent shoul d 
rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_72126] 15minutes before measurement to establish an accurate 
baseline measurement.  After the patient has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 15 minutes , 
HR and BPwill 
be measured 3 times . An automated validated device can be used , if available .  In case the cuff 
sizes avai lable are not large enough for the patient's arm circumference, a sphygmo mano meter 
with an appropriately  sized cuff may be used.   The repeat HR and BPmeasurements will be 
made at [ADDRESS_247775] predose value of supi[INVESTIGATOR_207359] (based on the 
systolic BP) shoul d be taken as the baseline measure and used for comparison to postdose values .  
Orthostatic b lood pressure will then be measured once withthe pati ent in the standing position
(after standing for 2 minutes) .  A sudden, signi ficant fall in BP(>20 mmHg) between [ADDRESS_247776] 5 minutes .HR and BP will be measured once using an automated validated device .  
Any clinically  relevant change from  baseline should be confirmed on repeat measures. 
Orthostatic blood pressure will then be measured in the same manner with the patientin the 
standing posit ion(after standing for 2 minutes) .

11.3. Laboratory Safety Assessments
Analysis of samples will be conducted centrally by [CONTACT_207407].  Wherever possible during 
the Induction and Maintenance Period, Invest igators should not send laboratory samples to their 
local labs as this may  lead to unblinding of the treatment assignment given RPC1063’s MoA 
(retention of systemic lymphocy tes).  Further details of the procedures to be fo llowed for sam ple 
collect ion, storage, and shipment will be documented in a laboratory  manual .
Addit ional and repeat l aboratory  safet y testing m ay be perf ormed at the di screti on of  the 
Invest igator.
The fo llowing laboratory  tests will be performed to assess the safet y profile of RPC1063, as 
outlined in Table 1and Table 2:
Routine safet y laboratory  tests:  
Hem atology–red bl ood cell  (RBC )count, total and differential WBC count 
(basophils, eosinophils, lymphocy tes, m onocy tes, and neutrophils), platelet count, 
Hgb, hematocri t, mean corpuscul ar vo lume (MCV ), mean corpuscular 
hemoglo bin (MCH ), and mean corpuscular hemoglo bin concentration (MCHC ).  
Total  and different ial WBC counts will not be provided to the Invest igator to 
maintain the treatment blind during the Induct ion and Maintenance Period . These 
param eters and alerts for these parameters will be mo nitored by  [CONTACT_207408] y 
Surveillance team.
Blood c hemistry - sodium, potassi um, chloride, calci um, magnesium , phosphate, 
blood urea nitrogen, random glucose, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, 
ALT, AST, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT ), amylase, total bilirubin, 
conjugated bilirubin and CRP . CRP resul ts will not be reported until co mpletion 
of the study to maintain the treatm ent blind during th e Induction and Maintenance 
Period.  Abnormal laboratory  param eters inconsist ent wi th clinical presentation of 
UC or suspi [INVESTIGATOR_207364] m edical condit ion should be repeated for 
accuracy .  If an increase of amylase above the clinically notable value 
(≥ 300 U/L) is observed at any post randomization visit, lipase should be tested to 
determine the origin of elevated amylase (pancreatic versus extra pancreatic) .
Urinalysis -leukocytes, specific gravit y, bilirubin, blood, gl ucose, ketones, pH, 
protein, and urobilinogen
Routine blood samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2237] .  Blo od sam ples 
taken at the screen ing visit are to be in the fast ing state .  Blood sam ples taken at 
subsequent visits are recommended to be in the fasting state .  Details regarding 
collect ion of samples, shipment of samples, reporting of results, laboratory  reference 
ranges, and alert ing abnormal values will be supplied to the site before site i nitiation 
in a study  laboratory  manual .  The results of the analysis will be made available to

Invest igators will be asked to comment on those abnorm alities on the respective 
laboratory  resul t page, including a notati on of  the clinical significance of each 
abnorm al finding in the patient’s source documents .  The l aboratory  sheets will be 
filed with the patient’s source documents .  Abnormal laboratory  values shoul d not be 
recorded on the AE eCRF; however, any diagnoses (or signs or symptoms if a 
diagnosis is not possible) associated with the abnormal findings should be recorded 
on the AE eCRF.
Pregnancy test: serum beta -hCG must be performed at screen ing in women of 
childbearing potential . Urine beta-hCG will be performed in wo men of childbearing 
potenti alat each schedule dvisit. Between scheduled visits up unt il the 90-day S afety 
Follow-up V isit, monthly  home urine pregnancy tests should be performed by [CONTACT_4677].  If a urine pregnancy test result is positive, the Invest igator will instruct the 
patient to suspend further RPC1063 dosing, if applicable, and schedule a fo llow-up 
appoint ment as soon as possible .  A serum  pregnancy  test will be performed for 
confirmat ion, including after the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visi t, if needed .
Coagulation panel: prothrombin t ime ( PT)and partial thro mboplast in time ( PTT)
.  
Tobe performed as scheduled in Table 1and Table 2.
Serol ogy testing will be performed at screen ing to determine the patient's immune 
status with respect to several viruses ; testing will be as fo llows: 
anti
-VZV IgG
HIV antibodies
HBsAg and HBcAg IgM
anti-HCV IgG or IgM
Patients who are negative for VZV IgG antibodies at screening can undergo vaccinat ion and be 
rando mized 30 days after appropriate VZV vaccination has been co mpleted.   Patient s testing 
positive for HIV ,or for serol ogical  markers of acute or chronic hepatit is Bor C,will be excluded 
from the study  unless they  are indicat ive of prior hepatit is B vaccinat ion or cured hepatit is B and

11.5. Monitoring of Patients With Adverse Events of Special Interest
Several o f the AEs noted in fingo limod clinical studies may be a consequence of S1P 1 
stimulat ion and will therefore be clo sely monitored in the RPC01 -202 study .  These AEs include: 
a.Brady cardi a and heart conduction abnormalit ies.  Dose -related transient, reversible 
bradycardia and first degree atrioventricular blo ck were reported primarily  as first 
dose effects in fingo limod studi es.  
The HR reduction observed with sphingosine -1-
receptor agonists is an expected effect of S1PR modulat ion and appears to be 
conducted through the same pathway as vagus nerve st imulat ion. In addit ion, these 
negat ive chronotropic effects of S1P 1 agonists appear to a ttenuate over time 
secondary  to S1PR desensit ization and internalizatio n on cardiac my ocytes 
(Kovarik 2008). This effect appears to occur with increasing exposure to 
investigat ional drug
; thus, gradual dose escalat ion of thedose of RPC1063 over 
several days may mit igate against larger reductions in HR.
b.Pulmo nary toxicity.  An ini tial sharp decrease followed by  a slow progressive decline 
over time in FEV 1was observed in fingo limod clinical studies.  Nonclinical toxicit y 
studi es wi th RPC1063 have revealed the potential for pulmo nary toxicity at doses 
considerably higher than the pharmaco logically active dose.  Pulmonary funct ion 
tests including FEV 1, FVC , and DLCO , if applicable, will be m easured in all pat ients. 
All efforts shoul d be made to obtain DLCO assessments and except ions based on l ack 
of equi pment m ust be pre -approved by [CONTACT_1034]. Every  patient whose PFTs are 
abnorm al will be foll owed unt il such time as resolution is confirmed or no further 
improvement is expected by [CONTACT_24342] (based on a fo llow-up peri od of  not l ess 
than 3 m onths).
c.Hepatotoxicit y.  Fingo limod caused frequent, reversible liver enzyme elevat ions 
greater than [ADDRESS_247781] in up to 12% of patients; this was a significant 
cause of cessat ion of therapy .  In thi s study , clinical blood chemistry  analyses to 
assess LFTs will be performed.  Every  patient whose LFTs are abnormal will be 
followed unt il values return to baseline.
d.Macular edem a.Instances of serious macular edema were reported in fingo limod 
renal transplant studies, and a 0.8% incidence was reported as an SAE in fingo limod

64(1.25 m g dose) MS clinical studies.  Nonclinical studies with RPC1063 have not 
revealed eye -related toxi cities.  In thi s study , OCT will  be perform edin all patients at 
baseline and the end of study  visit s or early termination .  In addition, patients will be 
questioned about visual signs or symptoms at each study  visit and instructed to 
inform  the in vestigator if they  devel op symptoms between visit s. For patients with 
symptoms of macular edema, OCT and ophth almologic examinat ion including dilated 
ophthalmoscopy  will also be perform ed.  Every  patient whose oph thalmic evaluat ions 
reveal abnormalit ies w ill be followed unt il values return to baseline.
e.Opportuni stic or serious infections.  TB, serious bacterial infect ions, sy stemic fungal 
infect ions, viral infect ions such as herpes infect ions (including herpes zoster and 
disseminated herpes simplex) and pr otozoal  infect ions should be reported as adverse 
events of special interest .
Overall, the fo llowing procedures should be fo llowed:
Vital signs will  be assessed in supi[INVESTIGATOR_207365].  A sudden, 
significant fall in BP (> 20 mmHg) b etween 2 and 5 minutes after standing from the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_207366] c hypotension and will be documented 
in the pat ient chart and eCRF.
Patients will  be closely m onitored in the clinic after their first dose of the init ial dose 
escalat ion
regimen for a period of 6 hours after treatment.  ECGs will occur predose 
and at Hour 6 following dosing, with more frequent assessments as clinically 
indicated; vital signs, including orthostatic BPassessment, will be assessed predose 
and then hourly  for 6 hours foll owing dosing.  
Clinicians should be particularly mindful o f patients who have a low HRat baseline 
(spontaneously  or through drug induced ß -receptor blockade), prior to administration 
of the invest igational drug.  Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_207367], up to a maximum daily  dose of 3 m g.  Furtherm ore, the commo n 
guidelines for treatm ent of bradycardia ( e.g., Advanced Cardiac Life Support -ACLS 
guidelines) shoul d be f ollowed as appropriate:
In case of c linical symptoms or hy potensio n, administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 1 mg, 
repeated administration in 3 -5 minutes.
If HRand/or BPremain unresponsive, consider administration of dopamine drip 
5-20 g/kg/min or epi[INVESTIGATOR_207368] 2 - 10g/min.
Perform ance o f transcuta neous pacing may also be considered
In the setting of decreased BP, isoproterenol should be avo ided or used with 
cauti on.
Any condit ion that might affect the outcome of pulmo nary function testing including 
infect ion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_29197] s, occupati onal expo sures (including asbestos) and 
cigarette smoking needs to be collected before PFT testing and transcribed to the 
pulmo nary function tests eCRF page. If patients have decline in PFT values (FEV 1
and/or FVC) below 50% of the predicted values, treatment shoul d be discont inued.

ophthalmo logical  evaluat ions will be conducted until such time as reso lution is 
confirmed or no further improvement is expected by [CONTACT_207410] (based on a 
follow-up period of not less than 3 months).  If the patient does not show definite 
signs of  improvement on examinat ion [ADDRESS_247783] experienced in the management of this condit ion shoul d be initiated.
Examinat ion of the skin for lesions will be performed as part of the physical 
examinat ion at screen ingand at the end of study .  If skin lesions are noted, the patient 
will be referred to a dermatologist for evaluat ion and follow-up care.

6612. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, MONITORING, AND REPORTING
Throughout the study , the Invest igator will remain alert to possible AEs .  If an AE occurs, the 
first concern shoul d be f or the safet y of the patient,and appropriate medical intervent ion should 
be provided if necessary .  
At the signing for the informed consent form, patients should be given names and telephone 
numbers of site staff for reporting AEs and medical emergencies.
12.1. Adverse Events
The AE defin itions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply wit h current CFR 
[ADDRESS_247784] study  visit.  All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs provided: a descript ion of the 
event, severit y, time of occurrence, duration, any  action (e.g., treatm ent and follow-up tests), and 
the outcom eshoul d be provi ded al ong with the Investi gator’s assessment of the relat ionship to 
the invest igational drug .
AEs will be recorded from the time written informed consent is signed unt il 90days fo llowing 
the last dose of treatment with the investigat ional drug.
If known, the event diagnosis should be recorded, in preference to the list ing of individual signs 
or symptoms .  AEs must be graded as being mild, moderate, or severe and their approximate 
durati on given .  Definit ions of severit y are as fo llows:
Mild : an AE usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering wi th normal act ivities;
Moderate: an AE that is sufficient ly disco mforting to interfere with normal act ivities;
Severe: an AE that is incapacitat ing and prevents normal act ivities.
Even if t he Invest igator feels there is no relationship to the invest igational drug , all AEs MUST 
be recorded in the eCRF .  The Investigator is requested to assess the relat ionship of any AEs to 
treatm ent using the fo llowing definit ions:
Unrelated: those AEs which are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes 
(concurrent drugs, environment etc.) and do not meet the criteria for drug relat ionship listed 
under Unlikely, Possible, Probable or Related.
Unlikely: an AE m ay be considered unlikely if it include s at l east the first two features:
It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administrati on of  the drug.

It coul d not be reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_207411]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy  administered 
to the patient.
It disappears or decreased on cessat ion or reducti on in dose .  There are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discont inuat ion of the drug (e.g .,bone marrow 
depressio n, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc. ).
It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug.
Related: an AE may be considered related if it includes all of the fo llowing features:
It follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from  administrati on of  the drug.
It coul d not be reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_207411]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy  administered 
to the patient.
It disappears or dec reased on cessat ion or reducti on in dose .  There are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discont inuat ion of the drug (e.g., bone marrow 
depressio n, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc. ).
It follows a known pattern of response to the sus pected drug.
It reappears or worsens if the drug is re- administered.
12.2. Serious Adverse Events
A SAE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence or effect that fulfi lls the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (NOTE: the term  "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the 
patientwas at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypotheti cally  might have caused death if it were more severe)
Requires hospi [INVESTIGATOR_207370]. Number: 23698993 - 23698906Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No .  RPC01 -202

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or resul t in death o r hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092] m ay jeopardi ze the patientor may requi re 
intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above .  These should 
also usually be considered serious .  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room  or at hom e for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do 
not resul t in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
12.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Invest igator r eporting requirements for SAEs wi ll be managed on behalf of the Sponsor by [CONTACT_3642].  
Full details o f the procedures to be adopted will be documented in a safet y management pl an 
approved by  [CONTACT_207413], in brief:
Any SAE which occurs to any  patientfrom the time wri tten inform ed consen t is signed through 
the last visit must be reported by  [CONTACT_24342] .  All SAEs that occur within 90days of the last 
dose of treatment with the invest igational drug , whether or not considered related to the 
investigat ional product, m ust also be reporte d.  Any SAE that is ongo ing when the patient
completes the study  or di scont inues from the study will be fo llowed by  [CONTACT_207414], stabilized, or returned to baseline status or the pati ent is l ost to foll ow-
up.
Any AE consid ered seri ous by  [CONTACT_81686] -Invest igator or that meets serious criteria 
shoul d be rep orted to [COMPANY_003] Pharmacovigilance (PVG) using the remote data capture (RDC) 
system . Data entry  must be com pleted wi thin [ADDRESS_247785] learned of the event. 
In the event that RDC entry  is not possible (e.g.
,system failure or access problems), the study 
site shoul d com plete the paper SAE report form and fax the form to [COMPANY_003] PVG within [ADDRESS_247786] informat ion for the [COMPANY_003] Pharmacovigilance Center : 
SAE Hotline: [PHONE_4463] 
SAE Fax line: [PHONE_4464] 
The init ial report should be prompt ly followed by  [CONTACT_12908], wri tten reports, which will include 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_207371] , discharge summaries, autopsy  reports and other documents when 
requested and applicable . For unrelated cases, a full detailed case descript ion may negate the 
need for addit ional hospi [INVESTIGATOR_63337], di scharge summaries ,etc.
12.4. Monitoring of Patient s with Adverse Events
Invest igators must carefully monitor each patient for AEs .  This includes clinical laboratory  
variables .  Assessments must be made of the seriousness, severit y,and rel ationship to the 
EDMS Doc. Number: 23698993 - 23698906Sponsor: Celgene International II Sàrl Protocol No .  RPC01 -202

69admi nistrati on of  the investigat ional drug.  After the init ial AE/SAE report the Invest igator is 
requi red to fo llow up proactively  each patient and provide further informat ion to [COMPANY_003] on the 
patient’s condit ion.  During the study ,all AE/SAEs should be fo llowed up until resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline status or pati ent is l ost to foll ow-up,unless the event is 
considered by [CONTACT_207415] ’s underlying disease.
12.5. Procedures to be followed in the Event of Abnormal Laboratory Test 
Values
In the event of unexplained abnormal laboratory  test val ues, the tests should be repeated 
immediately  and followed up unt il they have returned to the normal range and/or an adequate 
explanat ion of the abnormalit y is found.  For abnormal laboratory  test val ues rel ated to AEs of 
special interest ,refer to Secti on11.5.
12.6. Clinical Laboratory Parameters and Abnormal Laboratory Test 
Results
Clinically significant changes, in the judgment of the Invest igator, in laboratory parameters 
(abnormalit ies) will be recorded as AEs .  
During the treatment period, all Total WBC and WBC different ial results will be blinded.  
Reductions in ALC levels is a known pharmacodynamic effect of RPC1063.   
Ifanyof the 
following results are observed, the Invest igator will be notified and asked to repeat the laboratory 
tests within approximately 7 days :
Absolute lymphocy te count [ALC] < 200 cells/µL
Absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1000 cells/µL
Total  WBC > 20,000 cells/µL
If the repeat values also exceed these limit s, the Investigator will be informed that the patient’s 
resul ts for the abnorm al parameter have fallen belo w the acceptable thresho ld.
If ANC or total WBC counts are confirmed below the acceptable limits, the Medical Monitor 
will contact [CONTACT_207416]-up, at the discret ion of the investigator.
If the ALC is confirmed <200 cells/µL, the Invest igator will temporarily discontinue 
investigat ional drug and then consult with the Medical Monitor. Laboratory  testi ng will be 
repeated weekly until ALC is > 500 cells/µL.
When ALC has returned to > 500 cells/µL, the tr eatment may be reinit iated at the Invest igator’s 
discreti on (Secti on9.6.2 for instructions on resuming treatment after missing doses).  For 
patients whose ALC level is confirmed < 200 cells/μL and has not reached the acceptable range 
(ALC > 500 cells/µL) during the study , laboratory  testing will be repeated at the 90-day Safety 
Follow
-up Vi sit.
If pat ients have elevat ions in ALT and/or AST ≥3x the u pper limit of normal (ULN), a retest 
shoul d be perform ed as soon as possible but not later than [ADDRESS_247787] are < 3x ULN . If 
the ALT and/or AST stabiliz es at a l evel > 3x ULN, the Medical Monitor may agree to less

70frequent testing.   The Invest igator should establish causalit y. In addit ion, the confirmed 
elevation > 3x ULN is an adverse event of special interest (see Secti on11.5) and should be 
reported by  [CONTACT_24342]. 
At any time, if any of the fo llowing occur and there are no apparent alternat ive causes for the 
finding, the investigat ional drug m ust be perm anentlydiscont inued :
ALT or AST > 8x ULN or
ALT or AST > 5x ULN with confirmat ion, wi thin 2 weeks or
ALT or AST > 3x ULN and (total bilirubin > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5) or
ALT or AST > 3x ULN with the appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).
The Investigator should establish causalit y.
After di scontinuat ion due to el evation of ALT or AST > 5x ULN or concurrent elevat ions of 
ALT or AST >3x ULN and bilirubin > 2x ULN, further liver fu nction evaluation should be 
perform ed (for exam ple, coagul ation panel and alkaline phosphatase )in consultat ion with the 
Medical Monitor .
12.7. Abnormal Clinical Safety Findings
Clinically significant changes, in the judgment of the Invest igator ,will be recorde d as AEs.
12.8. Treatment of Overdose of Study Treatment
An overdose is any  dose of invest igational drug given to a patient or taken by a patient that 
exceeds the dose described in the protocol .  There is no information regarding overdose with 
RPC1063 .  Any over dose, wi th or wi thout associ ated AEs, m ust be prom ptly reported to [COMPANY_003] 
Pharmacovigilance Center .  Overdoses do not need to be recorded as AEs in the eCRF; only in 
case of any  AEs associ ated wi th the overdose, these should be reported on relevant AE/SAE 
sections in the eCRF .  
12.9. Procedures in Case of Pregnancy
If a urine pregnancy test is posit ive, the Invest igator will instruct the patient to suspend further 
RPC1063 dosing. If the test was performed by  [CONTACT_207417] s, a fo llow-up 
appo intment will be scheduled as soon as possible. A serum pregnancy test will be performed for 
confirmat ion.
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that an invest igational 
product may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.  However, the 
outcom e of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective terminat ion, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormalit y) must be fo llowed up and docum ented even if the patientwas 
discontinued fro m the study .
All reports of congenital abnormalit ies/bi rth defects are SAEs .  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs .  Elective aborti ons wi thout com plicat ions should not be

7213. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The data management and statist ical analysis o f this study  will be perform ed by [CONTACT_3642].
13.1. Data Management
An eCRF will be used for the current study ,and a data management plan will be prepared by [CONTACT_207418], [COMPANY_003] .  
13.2. Sample Size Estimation
Approximately  300 pati ents will be screen ed to ensure that 180 pati ents are randomized in the IP, 
assuming a 40% screen failure rate .  Patient s will be enrolled in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_247788] at the 
alpha= 0.05 level o f significance, and assuming a placebo remissio n rate of 10%, a sample size of 
60 pati ents per group will provide 80% power to detect an improvement in the remissio n rate of 
21percentage points or larger (i.e., an active group remissio n rate of 3 1% or l arger).
A meaningful change or clinical improvement (defined in this study  as the incremental increase 
in the proportion of patients obtaining remissio n in response to a medicat ion compared to 
placebo), i s dependent upon both the impact of the disease and the impact of the medicat ion on 
the pati ent’s health and well -being.  Key factors that need to be cons idered include: the 
consequences of the di sease, the efficacy  and safety pro file of the the rapy, 
and the efficacy and 
safet y profile of alternative treatm ents.

diarrhea, bl ood l oss, abdo minal pain and loss o f income .Current therapi [INVESTIGATOR_207372] r efficacy, safety ,or convenience.
We have chosen remission as the primary endpoint of this study since to obtain remissio n 
requi res patients to be free of symptoms and have significant resolution of their disease activit y. 
Patients who o btain remissio nhave a notabl e improvem entintheirhealth and qualit y of life.  
Obtaining remissio n, this clinically  important endpoint ,is a notable medical achievement; 
therefore, a moderate increase of 15 -20% in the proportion of patients in remissio n would be 
meaningful for patients with moderate to severely active UC.

13.4. Randomization
Patients will  be randomized into the study  on Day 1 using an IVRS provided by  [CONTACT_3642].  
Patients will  be randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, RPC10 630.5 mg , or RPC1063 1 mg .  
Therando mizat ion will be stratified by  [CONTACT_14181]-TNF therapy (y es vs no).

74Endoscopy  images will be obtained during each endoscopy  and will  be sent to Robarts Clinical 
Trials for central  reading and determinat ion of the May o endoscopy  score. The result of the 
central  reading of the endoscopy  will be used to ensure pati ent eligibilit y prior to enrollment and 
to cal culate the May o Score at the times indicated in the schedule of events.   The May o score 
used for clinical endpo ints in the study  will utilize the May o endoscopy  score derived fro m the 
central  reader.
13.8.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be co mpleted based on the ITT population for the IP.  
Theprimary  analysis will be carried out when all patients have completed (or would have been 
eligible to complete) the IPof the study .
The primary  endpoint of clinical remissio n at Week 8 will be analyzed using the Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratif ied by [CONTACT_146275] -TNF therapy  experience . Theprimary 
analysis will use the data from the [ADDRESS_247791] at the alpha= 0.05 level of significance .
13.8.3. Key Secondary Analyses
If the primary  efficacy analysis is statistically  significant (p <0.05), then addit ional confirmatory  
tests using the ITT populat ion will be performed in the following prespecified order :
Proporti on of  patients in clinical remissio n at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo
Proporti on of  patients in clinical response at Week 8: 1 mg dose versus placebo
Proporti on of  patients in clinical response at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo
Change in Mayo score fro m baseline at Week 8: 1 mg dose versus placebo 
Change in May o score from  baseline at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo 
Proporti on of  patients w ith mucosal healing at Week 8: 1 mg dose versus placebo  
Proporti on of  patients w ith mucosal healing at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo  
Proporti on of  patients in clinical remissio n at Week 32: 1 mg dose versus placebo 
Proporti on of  patients in clinical remissio n at Week 32: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo 
Proporti on of  patients in clinical response at Week 32: 1 mg dose versus placebo
Proport ion of patients in clinical response at Week 32: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo
Change in Mayo score fro m baseline at Week 32: 1 mg dose versus placebo 
Change in Mayo score fro m baseline at Week 32: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo 
Proporti on of  patients wi th mucosal healing at Week 32: 1 mg dose versus placebo
Proporti on of  patients wi th mucosal  healing at Week 32: 0.5 mg dose versus placebo
Provi ded that all  previ ouslyspecified tests are statistically significant (p <0.05), each of these 
comparisons will be ass essed using a two -sided test at the alpha = 0.05 level of significance .

75However, if a co mpar ison is not statistically significant, then all subsequent comparisons will be 
considered exploratory .
Secondary  endpoints that are defined as proportions will be analyzed using the same t ype of 
methodol ogy as described for the primary analysis .  Analyses of all proportion endpo ints using 
the CMH test will be co mpleted using the data from the two groups being co mpared.   
Quant itative secondary  endpoints will be analyzed using analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) 
models wi th effects for treatm ent group (three levels) and prior anti -TNF therapy  experience , and 
with the baseline value o f the corresponding endpoint included as a covari ate.  All secondary 
analyses will be carried out using two -sided test at the 5% level o f significance.

16.1. Regulatory Approval
The Sponsor or their appointed agents will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
regul atory  authori ty approvals are obtained, according to local country  requi rements.
No patient may enter the study  until this approval has been obtained .  A copy  of the approval 
(where one i s provi ded, according to local country  requi rements) will be provided to the 
Invest igator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) .
16.2. Protocol Amendments
In accordance with ICH Topic E 6 (R1) Guideline for GCP the Invest igator should not 
implement any deviat ion from, or changes of the protocol without agreement by [CONTACT_207434]/IECs of a protocol amendment, except where necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study  patient s, or when the change(s) invo lves only 
logistical o r administrative aspects of the study  (e.g., change in mo nitor(s), change of telephone 
number(s)) .  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment .  Any potential 
amendment m ust be approved by  [CONTACT_1034] .  A wri tten am endment m ust be submitted to 
theappropriate regulatory  authori ties and to the IRB/IECs assuming this responsibilit y.  
TheInvesti gator m ust awai t IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implement ing 
thechanges, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immedia te hazard to patient s.  In these 
cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified wit hin [ADDRESS_247794] be approved in writ ing by [CONTACT_207435]/IEC, except for administrative amendment s, which require notification 
but not wri tten approval .  Once approved, the protocol amendment will be distributed to all 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29614], with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol.
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/I EC, the Investigator, and/or Sponsor, the protocol 
amendment al ters the study  design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the patient , 
the currently approved written informed consent form will require modificat ion.  The modified 
inform ed cons ent form must also be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_1034], appropri ate 
regul atory  authori ties, and the IRB/IEC .  In such cases, repeat informed consent must be 
obtained fro m patients enro lled in the study  before parti cipat ion cont inues.
16.3. Protocol Adherence and Deviations
The protocol must be read thoroughly  and the instructi ons must be followed .  However, 
exceptions will be made in emergency  situations when the protection, safet y, and well -being of 
the patientrequires immediate intervent ion based on the judgment of the Invest igator or a 
responsible, appropriately trained, and credent ialed professio nal(s) designated by  [CONTACT_207436] a sub -Invest igator .  
In the event of a significant protocol deviat ion due to an em ergency, accident, or error, the 
Invest igator or designee must contact [CONTACT_51876] .  This allows for an early  joint decisi on to be m ade as to whether or not the patient

2.  PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
Title of Study:  A Phase 2 Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel -Cohort 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of  Once -Daily 
Application of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_142711]-1102 Ointment for 28 Days in Subjects with Actinic  Keratosis  
Study Center(s):  Approximately  6 sites in the US and 3 in Israel  
Study Duration: 11 months Phase s of D evelopment: Phase 2  
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective: To co mpare the reduction on Day 56 in the number of the actinic 
keratosis (AK) lesions in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once -daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5% or 
10% VDA- 1102 ointment for 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in 
subjects receiving placebo.  
Secondary Objectives : 
• To e valuate the systemic and local (skin) safety and tolerability of once -daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_106014] 5% or 10% VDA- 1102 ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult subj ects 
with AK. 
• To assess the systemic exposure of VDA- 1102 and jasmonic acid, its primary  
metabolite , at selected time points during  topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 5% or 10% VDA -1102 
ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult subjects with AK . 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To compare the proportion of subjects receiving 28 days of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 who 
on Day 56 had complete clearance of AK lesions to subjects receiving placebo . 
• To compare the reduction on Day 84 in the number of the actinic keratosis (AK) lesions 
in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once -daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5% or 10% VDA -1102 
ointment fo r 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in subjects receiving 
placebo.  
Study Design :  
This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multi- center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multiple -dose, parallel -cohort study involving the once -daily non- occluded, topi[INVESTIGATOR_142714] (5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment, or placebo) for [ADDRESS_162119] 75 evaluable 
subjects by [CONTACT_124808]. Fifteen (15)  of these subjects will constitute a Nested Phase 1b 
Safety S tudy Sub-Cohort, and a maximum of 18 of the  84 subjects will be included in a PK 
Study Sub-Cohort. T hese 2 su b-cohorts may overlap and are described below.  
To qualify for the study, subjects aged 18 (inclusive) or older must have signed informed 
consent and met the study enrollment criteria  that include having 4-8 discrete Grade 1 or 2 AK [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 4

lesions within a 25 cm2 area on the scalp or face ( “the Treatment Field ”). Subjects will be 
randomly assigned in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 3 parallel treatment cohorts ( 5%, o r 10% 
VDA-1102, or placebo, respectively) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomized subject s will apply a  
single thin  application of the study drug to the ir Treatment Field for 28 days.  
This clinical trial will include 3 study periods.   
Screening Perio d (Day -21 through Day 1 Pre- Dose):  
During the Screening Visit  (up to 21 days pre -dose ) subjects who have given written informed 
consent will undergo safety assessments including medical and medication histories, adverse 
event ( AE) documentation, vital signs, limited physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, 
12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), dermatologic examination, and Treatment Field 
identification, as well as other qualifying procedures.  
At the Day 1 Pre -Dose Visit , eligible subjects will return to the investigative site for ba seline 
assessments as well as final eligibility screening . The 18 subjects enrolled in the PK Study Sub-
Cohort ( described below) will have a baseline blood sampling for PK analysis.  Subjects who 
continue to meet the enrollment crite ria will undergo randomization to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 
5% VDA-1102, 10% VDA-1102, or placebo .  
Three times during the Screening and Day 1 Pre- Dose Visits, subjects will be trained and tested 
in proper application of the study drug to the Treatment Field with the help o f a flexible plastic 
stencil  (“Treatment Field Template”) . Subjects unable to apply the study  drug properly will be 
excluded , unless they are accompanied by a dosing partner willing and able to properly dose the 
subject each evening.  
Treatment Period  (Day  1 Dosing through Day 28):  
During the Day 1 Dosing Visit , randomized subjects (or their dosing partner) will apply the first 
dose of the study drug under the supervision of the site personnel in order  to further assure 
proper application.  
From Day 1  through Day 27, subjects will continue dosing the study drug to their respective 
Treatment F ields each evening while at home. Subjects will visit their respective investigative 
sites on Day 7 and Day 14 for safety and efficacy assessments , drug accountability, and re -
training in proper application of the study drug.  In addition, subjects in the PK Study Sub-
Cohort will undergo a single blood sampling at approximately 12 h  after the prior evening's 
dose. On the Day [ADDRESS_162120] in

Observation Period (Day 29 through 84): 
Subjects will visit their respective investigative site on Days 35 and 56 for efficacy and safety 
assessments.  On Day 84 subjects will return to the sites for their final efficacy  and safety 
assessments.  Subjects with continuing AEs  will be scheduled for  follow- up evaluation, as 
appropriate.  
Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub -Cohort:  The first 15  (PK and non- PK) subjects enrolled in the 
trial will undergo on Day [ADDRESS_162121] completed t heir Day 7 Visit , safety data (including AEs, LSR 
scores, clinical laboratory results, and ECG data ) from Day 1 through Day 7 will be reviewed in 
a blinded fashion by a safety committee.  During this blinded interim safety review, enrolled 
subjects will continue dosing the study drug and study enrollment will remain open. 
PK Study Sub -Cohort :  Of the approximate [ADDRESS_162122] 15 subjects  to 
be enrolled into the study. 
Number of Randomized Subjects (planned):   Approximately 84  (3x28) subjects will be 
randomized in order to complete  the study with at least  75 (3x25) subjects anticipated to be 
available for efficacy analysis .  
Maximum Time Subjects May Remain in the Study : Subjects may participate in this study 
for a maximum of approximately 117 days (21 Screening  Period  + 32 Treatment Period + 64 
Observation Period ) 
Study Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint :  Change from baseline in the number of AK lesions in the 
Treatment Field of each subject on Day 56. 
Safety Endpoints :  Assessment of AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory 
parameters, Local Skin Reaction (LSR) Scores , and electrocar diograms.    
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints:   Assessment of  the systemic exposure of VDA -1102 and its 
primary metabolite jasmo nic acid at selected time points during topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 5% or 
10% VDA-1102 ointment for 28 days in adult subjects with AK. 
Exploratory Endpoints:  The percentage of subjects achieving complete clearance of AK 
lesions within the Treatment Field on Da y 56.

Day 84.  
Statistical Analyses:  
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be based on changes from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_162123] (as is appropriate). In the event that the number 
of baseline lesion s is different between the treatment groups, then relative changes (%) will be 
analyzed as well.  
The overall change and the trend of differences in the changes over time between the groups 
will be analyzed using  mixed-effect model for repeated measures. The model will include 
changes at any time, the fixed effect time and the interaction of treatment and time. The model 
will be adjusted for baseline measures and for other relevant covariates.  
Interim Efficacy Ana lysis (IEA)  
A single interim efficacy analysis will be conducted as soon as 50% of the subjects have 
completed their Day [ADDRESS_162124] size and t -value, which will be based on the 
difference in the change from baseline in the number of AK lesions for each of the active 
groups as compared to the placebo group. If baseline measure differs between the groups, then 
relative change (%) will be tested.  The total significance level of 5% was divided between the 
interim efficacy analysis (0.005) and the final analysis (0.045). The spending function 
calculation for alpha will be performed using the O 'Brien -Fleming methods . In case the 
distribution of the outcome variable does not approximate normality, the appropriate non -
parametric methods will be considered for the interim analysis.  
Safety Analysis  
The safety end point data will be summarized for the ITT population.  AEs will be categorized by [CONTACT_142758] (SOC) and Preferred Terms (PT) 
using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  version 19.[ADDRESS_162125] results, 12 -lead ECG tracings, drug exposure, 
concomitant medications, and withdrawals/terminations.  Clinical and  laboratory data will be 
presented by [CONTACT_7169].  Continuous variables will be described as the mean, median, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values 
of n observations. Categorical data will be 
described with contingency tables including freque ncy and percent. These findings will be [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 7

5. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
5.1 Indication 
VDA-1102 is a small molecule new chemical entity (NCE) under development for the 
treatment of patients with actinic keratosis  (AK) .  
5.2 Actinic Keratosis and Current Approaches to Treatment  
Actinic keratosis (AK) is one of the most common dermatologic diagnoses and affects an 
estimated 58 million people in the [LOCATION_002]. Estimated treatment costs in 2004 were $1.2 billion (Warino 2006). AK  is generally present as rough patches or papules with erythema 
and scaling on sun- exposed skin, predominantly in older individuals with fair skin 
(Fitzpatrick skin types I -III). The lesions are often asymptomatic, but they may itch or be 
tender to the touch. Histologically, AK is characterized by [CONTACT_142759][INVESTIGATOR_49196] , with defective maturation of the superficial epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]  (Cohen, 2010). T he most 
common reason for treatment is to prevent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). 
Although the risk of progression to invasive SCC for a specific lesion may be low, it is 
widely regarded that 60% to 97% of SCCs originate from AKs (Hurwitz 1995, Mittelbronn , 
1998). This estimate is supported  by [CONTACT_142760] (Kanjilal, 1995, Ortonne, 2002, Kanellou , 2008, Padilla , 2010). Consequently , AK is 
often referred to as cSCC in situ  (Heaphy , 2000, Oppel , 2004, Röwert -Huber, 2007) and is 
part of the continuum of transformation from normal skin to AK and cSCC ( Ziegler , 1994, 
Stockfleth , 2013).  
Since AK results from malignant processes in sun- exposed skin (mainly face, scalp, and 
extremities), it is often necessary to treat en tire fields and not only the individual lesions. 
Cryosurgery and laser -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_142717]. C urrent ly the  
most common  topi[INVESTIGATOR_142718]-treatments  of AK are 5-fluorourac il 
(5FU) , imiquimod cream, ingenol mebutate gel, photody namic therapy (PDT), and diclofenac 
sodium in hyaluronic acid (Chetty , 2015).  
5.3 Unmet Medical Need  
Current AK therapi[INVESTIGATOR_142719]. Nearly 
all field treatments  are associated with  painful severe local skin reactions  ranging from 
necrosis to inflammation  which reduce treatment compliance  (Shergill 2014) . Cryotherapy 
and surgery are used to treat a limited number of lesions. However, these may leave unsightly 
scars or hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_142720].  
The limited tolerability of most current treatments greatly decreases the willingness of patients to be retreated. Diclofenac sodium is t he only drug available that is well tolerated . [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 17

VDA -CP-03 P2A AMENDMENT 1;  07 JULY2016 
VDA -CP-03 P2A AMENDMENT 2;  [ADDRESS_162137], VDA -1102 has the potential for a significantly more desirable benefit -risk ratio . 
The drug induces neither necrosis nor an inflammatory reaction. VDA -1102 would mitigate 
people ’s avoidance of treatment and the often required re -treatment  of their chronic, recurrent 
skin disease.   
5.4 Nonclinical Summary  
The two GLP toxicology studies were: 1) a 28-day repeated dose oral  toxicity study in rats 
with a re covery phase and toxico- kinetics, and 2) a 28-day topi[INVESTIGATOR_142721] a recovery phase and toxico-kinetics.  
An MTD for the local application of VDA -[ADDRESS_162138] feasible 
concentration  tested (20%). As discussed below in Section 5.6.2, t he relative doses of VDA -
1102 fed to rats and applied to the skin of minipi[INVESTIGATOR_142722]. Full details of the non- clinical studies performed to date are found in the accompanying 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.5 VDA-1102 Clinical Summary 
Study VDA -CP-01 (titled, “A Phase 1 Randomized, Double -Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, 
Dose -Escalation Study in Healthy Older -Adult Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Topi[INVESTIGATOR_142723] -1102 
Ointme nt”) was recently completed and preliminary blinded data are available. Healthy 
female volunteers without reproductive potential and male volunteers, aged 35-70, were 
sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 consecutive treatment cohorts (5%, 10% or 20% VDA -1102 
ointment, respectively).  Five subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion in each dose 
cohort with [ADDRESS_162139] to receive matched 
placebo (0% VDA -1102; vehicle control).  A  total of 1 5 subjects were ran domized: 12 
subjects received active VDA -1102 and 3 received placebo.   
There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or early study discontinuations in this study.  
There were a total of 11 adverse events reported  (whose treatment assignment is still 
unknown) . All the AEs were mild, short -lived, and reversible.  There were no clinically 
significant changes in study drug application sites, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 18

VDA -CP-03 P2A AMENDMENT 1;  07 JULY2016 
VDA -CP-03 P2A AMENDMENT 2;  [ADDRESS_162140] at  any time point 
regardless of treatment.  
Plasma concentrations of VDA -1102 and its main metabolite, jasmonic acid were below the 
level of quantific ation  of the LC/MS/MS bioanalytical assay  (1 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, 
respectively) . 
Further details of the results of this trial are provided in the VDA -1102 Investigator’s 
brochure. 
There are currently no ongoing clinical trials in which VDA -[ADDRESS_162141] Population 
(i) Efficacy  
VDA- 1102 has shown relevant pharmacological effects  in vivo  in the UVB -induced SKH -1 
hairless mice  model of actinic keratosis and skin cancer. In this pre-clinical study, dermal 
application of VDA -1102 led to a significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in the number of lesions 
relative to vehicle , that was comparable to the reduction noted with the comparative control 
compound ingenol mebutate (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_142724]®) 0.05%. C linical effects were observed within a week 
or two of treatment initiation , although full clinical benefit was observed after 3 -4 weeks.  
In this clinical protocol, study drug will be applied once -daily for 28 days to the Treatment 
Field on the scalp or face subjects with AK. Approximately 84 male and female subjects aged 
18 or older with 4- 8 discrete Grade 1 and/or 2 AK l esions who sign informed consent and 
meet the study enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned in a double -blinded fashion to 1 
of 3 parallel treatment cohorts (5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment, or placebo) at a ratio of 
1:1:1. The primary endpoint of this study is reduction in the number of AK lesions in the 
Treatment Field on Day 56. 
(ii) Safety  
The results from the toxicology studies and the estimated safety margins indicate that daily 
dermal application of 250 mg of VDA -1102 ointment for 28 days at doses as high as 20% to 
an area of [ADDRESS_162142] risk for evaluation in the target patient population. 
Specifically, topi[INVESTIGATOR_142725] -daily for 28 days of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment to 
10% of the minipi[INVESTIGATOR_142726], reversible skin findings.  
In the completed Phase 1a clinical trial (Section 5.5 above), no safety concerns were 
identified following a single -dose of approximately 250 mg of 5%, 10%, or 20% VDA -1102 
applied once to a 25 cm2 area on the forehead of healthy older -adult volunteers.  PK analysis [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 19

demonstrated that ther e were no detectable concentrations of VDA -1102 or its primary 
metabolite, jasmonic acid.  
In this study a lower dose of 200 mg of 5% or 10% VDA- [ADDRESS_162143] 15 subjects enrolled in the trial will be defined as a Nested Phase 
1b Safety Sub-Cohort. A vailable safety data (including AEs, LSR scores, clinical laboratory 
results, and ECG data ) from Day 1 through Day 7 from these 15 subjects will be reviewed in 
a blinded fashion by a safety committee consisting of 2 independent investigators (not 
involved in the evaluation of subjects in the study) and the Study Safety Monitor.  
(iii) Pharmacokinetics  
In preclinical PK s tudies, VDA -1102 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_78081], form ing jasmonic acid as its 
inactive primary metabolite, regardless of the animal species or the route of administration. In 
all cases, the amount of JA in the blood equaled or exceeded the concentrations of VDA-1102 
in the blood.  In a 28 -day dermal toxicity study in male and female minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], 5%, 10% or 
20% of VDA -1102 ointment was applied once daily to 10% of the body surface area. Blood 
levels of VDA -1102 were essentially below the LLOQ on Day 1 and very low and highly 
variable on Day 28. Blood concentrations of the primary metabolite jasmonic acid on Day 1 were detected only in the 20% VDA -1102 ointment group On Day 28, blood levels of 
jasmonic acid were detected at all dose levels and were higher than that on D ay 1, likely 
related to slow transdermal absorption as it appeared that steady state levels were present on Day 28.  
In the completed Phase 1a clinical trial (Section 5.5 above), there were no detectable 
concentrations of VDA -1102 or its primary metabolite, jasmonic acid following a single -dose 
of approximately 250 mg of 5%, 10%, or 20% VDA -1102 that was applied once to a 25 cm
2 
area on the forehead of healthy older -adult volunteers.   
In the current study, approximately 84 subjects will be dosed once each evening for 28 days  
with approximately 200 mg of study drug. Eighteen subjects will be enrolled into a PK Study 
Sub-Cohort and will undergo plasma sampling on Days 7, 14, 28, and 35 for PK assessment . 
Holter monitoring will be performed for 24 hours on Day 28 in all  subjects enrolled in the 
PK Study Sub -Cohort so that relevant  ECGs  tracings corresponding to peak levels (if 
detected) of VDA -1102 and/or jasmonic acid may be extracted once the PK /exposure data are 
available.  
5.6.2 Dose and Posology Justification 
The doses to be evaluat ed in this clinical trial are approximately 200 mg of 0%, 5%, and 10% 
VDA- 1102 topi[INVESTIGATOR_125053], spread evenly (unoccluded) over a 25 cm2 area of skin  on the 
face or scalp of subjects with actinic keratosis .  [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 20

Table 1  lists the mg/kg/day exposures in non- clinical toxicology studies as compared to the 
exposure planned in the proposed human trial. Data is presented as dose ratios rather than 
exposure ratios, because in vivo , trans -dermal absorption of VDA -1102 and its primary 
metabolite, jasmonic acid, appears to be minimal (minipig and human single doses) as 
determined with a sensitive bioanalytical assay.

135-fold below the non- clinic al systemic HED NOEAL levels determined in both species, rat 
and minipig. [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 21

Based upon the non -clinical toxicology data and the safety findings from the Phase 1 clinical 
trial, VDA-1102 will be advanced to Phase 2 development. The doses in this clinical trial 
(200 mg of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 once daily for 28 days) are well  below the nonclinical 
systemic HED NOEAL lev els determined in both rats and minipig s. Furthermore, t he daily 
dose proposed (~200 mg) is below the ~250 mg single dose administered in the Phase 1 
clinical trial in  healthy older -adult volunteers in order to more closely approximate the 200 
mg dose administered in the non- clinical toxicology studies and to reduce the local and 
systemic exposures in humans.  [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 22

keratosis (AK) lesions in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once -daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  5% 
or 10% VDA -1102 ointment for 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in 
subjects receiving placebo.  
Secondary Objectives : 
• To evaluate the systemic and local (skin) safety and tolerability of once -daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_106014] 5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult 
subjects with AK.  
• To assess the systemic exposure of VDA -1102 and jasmonic acid, its primary

7. STUDY DES CRIPTION 
7.1 Study Design  – Study Periods, Days, and Visits  
Approximately 84 subjects , aged 18 or older, who sign informed consent and meet the study 
enrollment criteria, will be randomized  to 1 of 3 parallel  treatment cohorts (5% or 10% VDA -
1102 ointment, or placebo ) in a 1:1:1 ratio . The clinical trial will include 3 study periods  
(Figure 1 and Table 4). 
Screening Period  – Subjects who have given written consent to participate in the trial will 
undergo safety and qualifying procedures between Day -21 and Day -1 (Screening Visit ). At 
this visit, the subject’s Treatment Field will be identified and the subject will be trained to 
precisely measure and apply the study  drug without actually applying ointment to their 
Treatment Field . Subjects unable to express the proper dose from the study drug tube and/or 
unable to identify their Treatment Field  will be required to bring a dosing partner to the next 
study visit in order to proceed in the study.  
Subjects who meet all the study’s inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will 
return on Day 1 for baseline assessments to ensure they still meet the study enrollment 
criteria  (Day 1 Pre-D ose Visit ). During this  visit, the Treatment Field sele cted at the 
Screening Visit will be requalified.  If the field previously chosen fails to requalify, a ne w 
Treatment Field must be found or the subject must be excluded for failure to meet Inclusion 
Criterion #3 (Section 8.1). Subjects will be trained  and tested twice during this visit for 
proper dose measurement (using the Dosing Cards  13.6.2), proper identification of the 
Treatment Field (us ing the Treatment Field Template 22.4), and precise dosing of that field 
using the template (stencil) . Subjects (or their dosing partner) who are unable to express the 
proper dose from the study drug tube and/or are unable to precisely identify their Treatment 
Field will also be considered ineligible for the study (Inclusion Criterion #4, Section 8.1).  
Subjects who continue to meet all the study enrollment criteria following the Day [ADDRESS_162146] a pre-dose blood sample drawn.

10.1.4 Holter Monitoring  (PK Study Sub-Cohort only) 
Subjects in the PK Study Sub-Cohort will undergo approximately 24-hour s of continuous 
multi- lead cardiac telemetric monitoring from Day 28 (approximately 12 hours after the  Day 
27 dosing) through Day 2 9. Subjects will remove the monitors on Day 29, approximately 24 
hours after they are attached , and return the Holter recorder at  the Day 35 Visit.  
ERT’s instruction manual  describes proper use and placement of these monitors. Site 
personnel will be trained regarding proper placement of the electrodes and recorders.  
The purpose of the 24-hour cardiac Holter monitor recording is to allow ECGs to be extracted 
based upon the plasma PK findings.  
10.1.5 Local Skin Reaction Score  
The Investigator (or designee) will use the Local Skin Reaction ( LSR) Score (see Section 
22.1) to numerically assess the overall degree of erythema, edema, weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] / exudate, 
vesicles, erosions / ulcerations, scaling / dryness, scabbing / crusting, itching, or pain)  in the 
Treatmen t Field  on a 5-point scale , from 0 (none) to 4 (severe).  This assessment will be 
performed on Day 1 Pre -Dose (baseline) and repeated at each subsequent visit.  The 
individual scores for each potential finding will be recorded in the respective cells by [CONTACT_142765].  
In this trial LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Details regarding reporting are 
included in Section 15.1. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_162177] are: (a) to review the Dosing Instruction Packet and Dosing Diary with each

a. Grade 1 or Grade 2 AK lesions (Section 11.1.1);  
b. located on the subject’s forehead, cheeks, or scalp but not on the  lips, submandibular 
area, or neck;  
c. discrete (i.e., no borders are clearly touching one another) ;  
d. a maximum diameter 10 mm (inclusive) in any direction ; 
e. non-hypertrophic and non- hyperkeratotic (i.e., no thick scale, horn, or > 1 mm raised  
above background skin); and  
f. not atrophic, acantholytic, pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], or Bowenoid.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_162181] that contains  4-8 AK l esions 
that meet the requirements stated in AK Lesion Eligibility  criteria (section 11.1.2) may be 
selected as the study Treatment Field. The Tre atment Field will be selected at Screening and

In this trial LSRs will be collected independently of AEs.  Any LSR that occurs within 
the selected Treatment Field and extends to adjacent surrounding skin (defined as within a 2 cm border around the Treatment Area) will be considered LSRs and will not 
be recorded as AEs.  LSRs that require medical intervention (prescription medication) or extend beyond the 2 cm surrounding skin should be documented as an AE.  
Clinically meaningful (for a given subject) changes i n physical examination and test findings 
should also be recorded as AEs.  The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows: 
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
3. Test result leads  to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant

15.2 Clarification of the Difference between “Severe” and “Serious”  
Severity describes the intensity of an event, irrespective of its medical significance (such as 
severe headache).  This is not the same as seriousness, which is based on regulatory 
definitions. Seriousness (not severity) defines SAE reporting obligations.  The severity of all 
AEs will be graded on a 3- point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in detail on the 
CRF.   
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. 
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
• Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
15.3 AE Reporting  
Specific instructions regarding the reporting of AEs, including start and stop dates, relationship to study drug, outcomes, expectedness, etc. will be detailed in the Safety Monitoring Plan.  
15.4 Relationship to Study Treatments  
“Causality” refers to the relationship of the AE to the study drug. The investigator must 
include assessment of causality (whether there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the 
event) for each AE. Causality will be categorized according to the following criteria:  
 
• Not Related : There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may  be related to 
study drug usage and other causes are much  more likely.  
• Unlikely Related:  There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related 
to study drug usage, but a relationship cannot be completely ruled out. There are other 
more likely causes.  
• Possibly Related : There is weak medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be 
related to study drug usage and a relationship cannot be completely ruled out. 
• Likely Related:  There is good me dical evidence to suggest that the AE may  be 
related to study drug usage but other causes cannot be ruled out completely.  
• Related : There is a strong and convincing medical evidence to suggest that the AE  is 
related to study drug usage and other possible c auses are highly unlikely.  
15.[ADDRESS_162223] and Diagnostic Procedure Abnormalities 
An abnormal result will not be recorded as an AE unless one or more of the below occurs: 
• The abnormal test is accompanied by [CONTACT_23805].  
• The test result leads to an alteration or interruption in study medication. 
• The test result requires medical or surgical intervention  [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 64

• The test result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_39595].  
If such an event occurs, the test should be repeated within 10 days to confirm the finding and 
appropriately monitored.   
15.6 Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All AE related symptoms and/or signs will be followed until there is a return to the baseline 
status, all associated parameters have returned to normal (or are no longer cons idered 
clinically significant), or no further improvement is anticipated.  Follow -up is mandatory, 
irrespective of causal relationship to the study drug(s).  SAEs will be monitored until 
resolution, as medically indicated.   
Any subject who has received at  least [ADDRESS_162224]’s last application of the study medication.

1. Death.  Death is an outcome, not an event.  Where the cause of death is uncertain, the 
reported SAE should be the same as the term on the subject’s death certificate.  
2. Is life -threatening.  Life -threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires or prol ongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life function s. 
5. A congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
6. A medically serious event based upon appropriate medical judgment.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

17. STATISTICAL PLAN  
17.1 Sample Size Rationale and Justifica tion 
The primary objective of the trial is to compare the reduction on Day 56 in the number of the 
AK lesions (or % reduction if baseline measure will be found different between the groups) 
in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving 5% or 10% VDA -[ADDRESS_162230] with a 0.045 two- sided 
significance level. The total significance level of 5% was divided between the interim analysis 0.5% (0.005) and the final analysis 4.5% (0.045). The sample size calculation was 
based on the final significance. The spending function calculation for alpha will be performed using the O
'Brien -Flem ing approach. Assuming a drop- out rate of 10%, approximately [ADDRESS_162231] 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_162232] with a 0.045 two- sided significance level.  
17.2 Statistical analysis 
All measured variables and  derived parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, 
tabula ted by [CONTACT_9086]. For categorical variables summary tables will be provided 
giving sample size, absolute and relative frequency and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for proportions by [CONTACT_1570]. For continuous variables summary tables will be provided 
giving sample size, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum and maximum and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for means of  variabl es 
by [CONTACT_1570]. The data will be analyzed using the SAS ® version 9.3 or higher (SAS 
Institute, Cary North Carolina).  
17.2.1 Efficacy Analysis 
The efficacy analysis will be performed with the ITT, mITT , and PP  populations (see Section 
17.5.2).  The primary  efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in number of AK lesions. 
If the baseline lesions number will be found different between the treatment groups, then 
relative change ( %) will be analyzed as well. The within -group absolute changes (decrease) 
in AK number of lesions from baseline to each visit will be analyzed using paired t -test or 
signed rank test for two means (paired observations, as is appropriate). 
Comparative analysis of the above changes will be applied between each of the active groups 
versus the placebo group using the two -sample t -test, the non- parametric Wilcoxon -Mann -
Whitney rank sum test for independent samples, or the Median test (as appropriate).  [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 69

VDA -CP-03 P2A AMENDMENT 1;  07 JULY2016 
VDA -CP-03 P2A AMENDMENT 2;  [ADDRESS_162233] will be calculated for each time point ( Days 7, 14, 28, 35 and 56) versus  
baseline and the overall effect. The model will be adjusted for baseline measure and for other 
covariates suspected as affecting the outcome and which will be found different between the treatment groups.  
In case the bas eline number of lesions differs  between the groups, analysis of relative change 
(%) will be applied as well.  
Chi-square test or Fi sher’s e xact test (as is appropriate) will be used for analyzing the 
difference in percent of subjects with complete clearance of study AK lesions at the end of the treatment. L ogistic regression will be applied for analyzing the difference in proportions 
with adjustment for baseline measure and for other covariates suspected as affecting the outcome and which will be found different between the treatment groups.  
17.2.2 Safety Assessme nts 
The safety end point data will be summarized for the ITT population.  AEs will be 
categorized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Terms (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 19.1 or higher).  The incidence of  
AEs, as well as the intensity and relationship to study drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490].  Safety will also be assessed by [CONTACT_142788], vital signs, dermatologic assessments, clinical laboratory test results, 12 -lead ECG tracings, Local 
Skin Reaction Score, drug exposure, concomitant medications, and withdrawals/terminations.  
These findings will be summarized and compared between treatments and within treatment 
group compared to findings from baseline evaluations.   
Local Skin Reaction scores (LRS) will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].      
17.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Non-compartmental PK parameters (e.g., AUC, C
max, Tmax, t1/2) will be calculated, if possible.  
17.2.[ADDRESS_162234] or Fisher’s exact test (as is appropriate) will be used for analyzing the 
difference in percent of subjects with complete clearance of study AK lesions at the end of 
the treatment. Logistic regression will be applied for analyzing the diffe rence in proportions 
with adjustment for baseline measure and for other covariates suspected as affecting the 
outcome and which will be found different between the treatment groups.  [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 70

Sensitivity analysis will be applied for identifying the cut- off of the change (or relative 
change) from baseline in number of lesions on Day 56. Analysis of the difference in the 
binary change will be applied using Chi -square test or Fisher ’s exact test. Logistic regression 
will be applied for analyzing these differences with  adjustment for baseline measure and f or 
other covariates suspected of  affecting the outcome and which will be found different 
between the treatment groups.  
Additional exploratory endpoint assessments will be described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
17.3 Missing Data 
Assuming the scope of missing data of the primary efficacy endpoint will be significant, data 
imputation will be applied. Missing data at random imputation (MAR) will be performed for 
those subjects with missing data. Multiple imputation will b e applied using SAS PROC MI to 
perform the imputations. Sensitivity analysis will be used for detecting differences between 
the analyses with and without data imputation. 
17.4 Interim Efficacy A nalysis 
An interim efficacy analysis will be conducted as soon as approximately 50% of the subjects 
have completed the study. The objective of the interim analysis is to evaluate the probability 
to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The data for the interim analysis sub -set will be collected and analyzed for effect size and t -
value. Effect size will be calculated based on the difference in the change from baseline in 
AK lesions for each of the active groups as compared to the placebo group. Relative change 
(%) will be used if baseline measure will be found different between the groups.  
Futility will be based on O'Brien -Fleming boundaries. If the t -value with 22 degrees of 
freedom is below 0.34, then the study is unlikely to succeed when taken to completion. In 
case the distribution of the outcome variable will not be found with approximation to 
normality, then appropriate non- parametric methods will be considered for the interim 
analysis.  
17.5 Data Sets  
17.5.1 Intent -to-Treat Population  
The ITT population will be defined as all subjects who are randomized and who receive study 
drug.  This is an appropriate population for the primary analysis because this is a blinded trial 
and the dose will be applied in the clinic by [CONTACT_142789].   [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 71

18. STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION  
18.1 Data Collection Methods 
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be utilized in this trial. The EDC system is 
fully validated and conforms to Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11 and the 
Guidance for Industry on Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials requirements.  The 
system has capabilities such as on -line data review via the browser, tracking review status of 
eCRFs  with built- in flagging, issuance and tracking of electronic Data Clarification Forms  
(queries) , and real -time vie wing of entered subject’s da ta.  If the EDC is not ready to accept 
data by [CONTACT_142792], data may be entered on paper CRFs and 
transferred to the EDC as soon as it is ready to accept data.  
The trained Investigational site staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_142793].  All information on the eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents.   Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be 
discussed with the study site for resolution.  The study site is responsible for providing 
missing data and  resolutions to the data queries and for correcting the eCRFs as appropriate.  
Electronic CRFs must be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_737].  All original laboratory, and ECG reports will be kept with the subject source documentation and a copy 
will be trans mitted to the Sponsor (or designee), if required. 
Cardiac d ata should be transferred to eRT  (eResearch Technology, Inc., Philadelphia, PA) the 
same day the data are obtained, if possible. Central Laboratory samples should be shipped on 
a daily  basis, if possible, unless specific holiday or w eekend schedules are in effect.  
Data should be entered into the EDC (or paper CRF) within 5 business days of the study visit; 
queries should be appropriately addressed within [ADDRESS_162239] be appropriately addressed by [CONTACT_16547]

20. INVESTIGATOR'S OBLIG ATIONS  
20.1 General  
The Investigator agrees that the stud y will be conducted in accordance with  the clinical 
protocol, FDA’s GCP  guidelines , ICH  guidelines,  and the Decl aration of Helsinki.  The 
Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance  with all governmental, state 
and local laws.  
20.[ADDRESS_162246] obtain approval of the 
clinical protocol and ICF from the IRB complying with the provisions specified in FDA CFR, 
Title 21, Part 56, ICH Guidelines, and all gove rnmental,  state and local laws.  
A copy of the written IRB approval of the protocol, ICF and any other documentation (such 
as advertising) as appropriate must be provided to the Sponsor or its designee prior to initiation of the study.  The approval letter must iden tify the IRB name [CONTACT_3816], the 
clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, and the date approval was granted. Furthermore, the approval letter must contain a statement that the IRB complies with the FDA CFR, Title 21, Part 56, and ICH Guidelines  for a study conducted under an IND, or 
other applicable government regulations for studies not conducted under an IND.  
The Investigator is responsible for supplying the IRB with the data required for continued review of this study at intervals not exceeding one year, or at intervals otherwise specified by [CONTACT_1201].  The Investigator shall supply the Sponsor with written documentation of this 
continued review.  When necessary, an extension or renewal of the IRB approval must be 
obtained and this shall also be forwarded to the Sponsor. A list of the IRB members should be forwarded to the Sponsor in accordance with local regulations. 
The IRB and the regulatory authorities will be provided with any amendments for their 
review and/or approval.  A yearly status report on the progress of the study will be submitted 
by [CONTACT_142795]. 
20.3 Investigator Protocol Adherence  
The Investigator and his/her designees are required to adhere to the protocol.  While 
deviations from the protocol are discouraged, they may be necessary in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to subjects or to facilitate adherence to protocol procedures.  
Emergency deviations  from the protocol that eliminate an apparent immediate  hazard to a 
subject and that are deemed crucial for the safety and well -being of a particular subject may 
be instituted for that subject only.  The Investigator or other attending physician will contact 
[CONTACT_142796] a deviation.  These deviations do not [IP_ADDRESS].[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 78

22. APPENDICES  
22.1 Local Skin Reaction Score   
This score has been modified from a score published in Lebwohl M et al (2012), “ Ingenol 
Mebutate Gel for Actinic Keratosis” , N Engl J Med 2012;366:1010- 9).  
The Local Skin Reaction Score is an assessment of all the skin in the Treatment Field  (not of 
the AK le sions) . At each study visit the Investigator (or designee) will assign a severity score 
to each of the objective and subjective findings listed in the table. For example, if the 
Treatment Field contains vesicles of moderate severity, the number 3 would be placed under 
the field labelled “Vesicles”.  
The Investigator will assess the selected Treatment Field and rate the findings on a [ADDRESS_162248] of the sum of all the individual severity scores.

22.3 Treatment Field Map Instructions  
This thin, flexible, plastic transparency  sheet  (Section 22.2), with a grid of 1cm x 1cm 
squares printed on the surface , will be used by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) to outline the 
Treatm ent Field, enabling consistent counting the AK lesions within the Treatment Field. It is 
also used to prepare the Treatment Field Template (see Treatment Field Template instructions 
Secti on 22.5). 
This tool should be used in the following manner: 
1. Affix a label that includes the subject’s identifier(s) and the visit date near the top of the 
sheet.      
2. Place this transparency over the Treatment Field selected on the subject’s face or scalp.  
3. With a supplied marker, draw the outline of several  facial landmarks (e.g. eyebrows, ear 
helix and/or lobule, moles, scars) on this map. These landmarks will be transferred  
4. Write at the top of the map any additional information that helps orient placement of the 
map. For example, “Left Face” or “Center Scalp”.    
5. Identify the 25 squares that make up the 25 cm2 contingent area (that includes 4 to 8 
discrete non -hyperkeratotic and non- hyperkeratotic AK lesions)  
6. With the supplied marker, outline the outer border of the 25 squares that defines the chosen Treatment Field.

22.5 Treatment Field Template Instructions  
This thin, flexible, plastic blank transparency (Section 22.4) will be used by [CONTACT_737] 
(or designee) to prepare a template (stencil) outlining the Treatment Field. This template will 
be used by [CONTACT_142798]. This tool should be prepared in the following manner by [CONTACT_737] (or designee):  
1. Take one of the supplied clear Treatment Field Templates and affix a label to the top 
that includes the subject’s identifiers and the date of the visit.  
2. Lay the template on top of the Treatment Field Map of this s ubject.  
3. Trace all the identifying landmarks from the Treatment Field map onto the clear template using the supplied marker. 
4. After the template is removed from the map, the Treatment Field should be precisely cut out of the Treatment Field Template using the supplied safety blade.  
5. At least [ADDRESS_162249]’s Treatment Field. Make sure the template delineates the Treatment Field precisely and doesn’t include a wider area (and different AK lesions) when it is laid flat.  
7. Use this opportunity to demonstrate to the subject the proper positioning of  the 
template on the Treatment Field.  If possible, let the subject use a mirror to observe 
the position of the template over the Treatment Filed.  
8. The Treatment Field Map and one copy of the template should be stored at the site in 
a protective envelope. The template should be used at each visit for counting AK 
lesions, not the map  since the grip marks on the map might obscure or distort the AK 
lesions.  
9. At each visit, at least [ADDRESS_162250] for practicing and dosing purposes.

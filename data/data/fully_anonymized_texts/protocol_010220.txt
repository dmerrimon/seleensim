Secondary objectives:
Toevaluate the overall safety data on 3 mg/mL Gablofen®(baclofen injection) given by [CONTACT_486307].
Study Design This is a prospective twelve -month Phase IIIb clinical safety trial followed by a 2-year, Phase IV 
study that will be conducted at 10 to 15 clinical trial sites that are experienced with the use of 
intrathecal baclofen.  All patients will be entered after signing an IRB approved informed consent. 
Patients will be followed for the duration of their treatment with Gablof en®(baclofen injection)
3mg/m Lusing the SynchroMed®II Programmable Pump or until the study is terminated.  Patients 
will be evaluated for clinical complications associated with the use of intrathecal baclofen that are 
considered signs and symptoms of a n inflammatory granuloma, specifically new radicular pain at 
the level of the catheter tip, and /orspi[INVESTIGATOR_13377].  Reports will be requested from the 
investigator at every clinical visit for the first 12 months for each pa tient enrolled and then every 
6months thereafter. If there are any signs or symptoms identified which may indicate an 
inflammatory granuloma formation, an MRI scan with and without infusion will be performed 
(with consent of the patient) to evaluate the potential presence of an inflammatory granuloma. 
Events that may be related to an inflammatory granuloma will be classified as adefinite 
granu loma, possible granuloma, other catheter related problem (confirmed not caused by a 
granuloma) ,or other clinical sequelae caused by [CONTACT_486308]. An interim analysis will be conducted when 100 subjects on the 3 mg/mL 
concentration of Gablofen®(baclofen injection) reach [ADDRESS_624873] cohort of 100 patients reach 12 months.

Safety Analysis
(Cont.)Clinical signs and symptoms that may indicate an inflammator y granuloma include:
oa sudden decrease in therapeutic response requiring increased daily doses that is not 
attributed to other assignable causes (e.g. mechanical failures, catheter movement 
or catheter blockages)
ounexplained pain at the dermatomal level of the catheter tip
ounexplained neurological deficit or dysfunction that could be due to compression of 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25373] a catheter tip
For the purpose of this study, definite inflammatory granuloma is an intramural extra -
medullary m ass at the catheter tip that is confirmed by [CONTACT_486311] . If only clinical signs 
are detected, but the inflammatory granuloma or mass cannot be verified by [CONTACT_9268], and no other 
cause can be determi ned, the event will be classified as a possible inflammatory granuloma .   
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_313193] a reasonable probability that the subject may be 
experiencing an inflammatory granuloma, an MRI without and with infusion of a contrast agent 
will be requested.  All MRIs will be assessed by a single central independent radiologist who 
will be blinded to the patient ’s history .  
During the trial, all SAEs reported to the investigator shall be reporte d to the Mallinckrodt 
Pharmacovigilance department within [ADDRESS_624876] and summarized.

18 December 2014 14 CONFIDENTIAL1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Baclofen (Gabl ofen®) is a derivat ive o f gamma -amino butyric acid (GABA) and is an agonist for 
the GABA Breceptors (Mezler et al.,2001 ; Dzitoyeva et al .,2003 ).  It is primarily used to treat 
spast icity and has been a primary treatment for this indicat ion by [CONTACT_486312].  Baclofen’s beneficial effects in spast icityresul t from actions at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_486285] .  Bacl ofen does not seem to significant lyinduce tol erance and maintains itsanti-spasm odic 
effect over many  years.  However, if the underlying disease that is the source of the spast icity 
continues to progress, the dose of baclo fen needed to manage the spast ic symptoms may increase 
over time.
Baclofen USP
Gablo fen® (baclofeninject ion) is indicated for use in the management of severe spast icity in 
adult and pedi atric patients age 4 y ears and above. Gablo fen®(baclo fen injection) is current ly 
approved only for us e in the Medtroni c SynchroMed®IIProgrammable Pump or other pumps 
labeled f or intrathecal  administrati on of  Gabl ofen®(baclo fen inject ion).  The pump is refilled 
with Gabl ofen®(baclo fen injection) using an appropri ate refill kit and according to the pump 
manufacturer’s instructions.  Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion) or other baclo fen products are not 
permitted by  [CONTACT_486313] h other medicat ions for the purpose of intrathecal 
administration.
After confirmat ion of the efficacy of Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion) by [CONTACT_486314], an 
infusio n pump may be im planted.  The dose may  be adj usted by  [CONTACT_486315] i s obtained.  After implantation of a SynchroMed®IIpump, the dose 
titration of  Gabl ofen®(bacl ofen inject ion) may be adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical eff ect.
Over time, the dose of Gablo fen®(baclofen inject ion) may be increased by [CONTACT_8622] 20% each time 
the pump is refilled.  Sudden changes in dose may indicate a catheter complicat ion and shoul d be 
carefully  eval uated and correcti ve acti ons taken as appropriate.  At the higher doses, the 
frequency  of pum p refills c an beco me a burden on the patient and medical system.  Thus, a 
higher concentration formulat ion of Gablo fen®(bacl ofen injecti on)is needed to help reduce the 
number of pump refills and improve pat ient qualit y of life.

Gablofen®(baclofen injectio n) Version:  2.0
18 December 2014 15 CONFIDENTIALThe purpose of this study  is to eval uate the safet y of a higher concentration, 3 mg/mL o f 
Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion).  
The benefit and risks of intrathecal ( IT)baclo fen are well understood from many years of clinical 
experience andpeer-reviewed publicat ions.Medtroni c has conducted a large publicly  available 
post-approval surveillance study  for the SynchroMed®II Programmable Pump that also includes 
surveillance of various drug products delivered by [CONTACT_137957].  This study  followed 4,384 
patients wi th implanted SynchroMed®II Programmable Pump drug delivery  systems at fift y (50) 
centers, wi th 3,101 pati ents receiving various other IT medications f or pain and 1,283 patients 
receiving baclo fen for spasticit y.  Included in Medtronic’s study  was a careful e xaminat ion of 
inflammatory  granulo ma formation in pat ients.  An inflammatory  granulo ma in the Medtronic 
surveillance study  was defined as “an intradural extra -medullary mass at the catheter tip that 
could be visualized by [CONTACT_486316].”  The criter ia for diagnosing such a 
granulo matous m ass is based on several clinical signs and symptoms: a decrease of drug effect 
and new radicular pain and/or cord compression, MRI findings of an enhancing mass at the 
catheter ti p on the T -1 infusio n and surgical or histol ogical confirmat ion.
From  2003 to 2010 six (6) cases of confirmed or probable inflammatory  granulo ma were noted 
as well as six (6)cases of possible granulo ma out of the 4,384 patients evaluated (12/4384, 
0.27%).  All of these patients were being tr eated with intrathecal morphine for severe, intractable 
pain.  Of particular note is that no cases of a granuloma (possible, probable or confirmed) were 
docum ented in the 1,283 patients who were receiving baclo fen (0.0%).  While it is well known 
that a sig nificant am ount of pharmacy co mpounding occurs to provide concentrations of baclo fen 
up to 4 mg/mL in routine use, the number of patients receiving doses of baclo fen above 2 mg/mL 
or multiple m edicati ons is not provi ded in the report.  Thus, while the study clearly  dem onstrated 
that IT baclo fen is not associated with inflammatory granulo ma formation, and that the risk is far 
less than with IT m orphine or m orphine rel ated drugs used in the SynchroMed®II Programmable 
Pump, no definite conclusio ns can be reac hed about the ris k of the concentrati ons above 
2mg/mL from this study . 
These data are further supported by  [CONTACT_486317] a significant risk wit h baclo fen even a t 
concentrations above 2 mg/mL (see the FDA Summary  Basis of Approval for Gablofen®
(baclo fen inject ion) review pages 41 -49 and (Deer et al., 2008) ). The use of pharmacy  
compounded concentrati ons of baclo fen above 2 mg/mL is co mmo n, but not well documented. 
The dangers of compounding of baclo fen have been well illustrated (Moberg -Wolff, 2009) but 
inflammatory  granulo mas seem to occur only when opi[INVESTIGATOR_486286] -infused with baclo fen (Deeret 
al., 2008).  
Medtroni c has correctly  warned physicians using IT baclofen therapy  to avoi d higher 
concentrations above 2 mg/mL given th e implicat ions of off label use, despi[INVESTIGATOR_486287] ( PubMed search 8 -2011).  While no well -documented cases have been

Gablofen®(baclofen injectio n) Version:  2.0
18 December 2014 16 CONFIDENTIALreported, i n a publ ished review arti cle by  [CONTACT_486318].,three (3) cases of possible inflammatory 
granulo ma formation are reported based on reduce dflow of solution through the catheter (Deer
et al., 2008 ). However, he concludes that these cases cannot be confirmed as the reports did not 
included any  confirming pathol ogy, no T -[ADDRESS_624878] com pressi on.  The  Deer et al. review arti cle also noted that the only 
clinical co mplication was a gradual decrease in efficacy in the three (3) cases which was 
resolved by [CONTACT_486319] -establish drug delivery .  Thus, Deer and co -
authors conclude that these cases were more likely due to “poor distribution o f baclo fen in the IT 
space where arachnid loculat ions, adhesio ns or encasement of the catheter ti p are assumed to be 
the problem”.  It is important to note in evaluat ing clinical risk in these three (3)cases that even 
with reduce catheter flow, there were no symptoms of sudden withdrawal from baclo fen and the 
patients were adequately trea ted wi thout any  long term  negative clinical effects.
Thus, there is no clear signal in clinical trials, published literature, or 1 9years of commercial use 
of IT bacl ofen that inflammatory  granulo ma formation is a m eaningful  clinical risk.  It i s also 
well known that phy sicians and pharmacists routinely provide higher concentrations of 
compounded baclo fen for use in the SynchroMed®II Programmable Pump and other IT pumps.  
The ri sk of these compounded formulat ions that are not manufactured under GMP conditi ons 
and controlled for sterilit y woul d seem to present a more significant risk to patients than the 
undetectable risk of inflammatory  granulo ma formulation in this population (Moberg -Wolff,
2009 ).  Given the effect iveness of baclo fen in the management of severe spast icity of cerebral 
and spi[INVESTIGATOR_486288], the risk benefit profile for the use of this product 
provi des the importance of replacing compounded higher strength formulat ions wit ha 
well-controlled commercial product would seem posit ive.
Mallinckrodt has developed a 3 mg/mL concentratio n of Gablo fen®(baclo fen inject ion)to meet 
the needs o f patients on hi gh daily  doses and proposes this open labelsafet y surveillance study  to 
assess the potential for complications related to this higher concentration formulat ion.

1.2.2 Toxicology
[IP_ADDRESS] Mutagenic and Carcinogenic Toxicity
No increase in tumors was seen in rats receiving baclo fen orally for two (2)years at 
appro ximately 30 -60 times o n a mg/ kg basis, or 10 -20 times on a mg/m2basis, the maximum 
oral dose recommended for human use.  Mutagenicit y assays wit h baclo fen have not been 
perform ed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Genetic and Teratogenicity Studies
Specific genetic, fetal and post -natal toxicit y studies have not been performed wit h baclo fen.  
While the intrathecal route of administration gives low systemic exposure relat ive to oral 
baclo fen, the potential for genetic or teratogenic effects cannot be ruled out .  
1.3 Clinical Experience
Evidence supporting the efficacy of intrathecal baclo fen was obtained in rando mized, controlled 
investigat ions that com pared the effects of either a single intrathecal dose or a three (3) day 
intrathecal infusio n of intrathecal baclo fen to placebo in pat ients with severe spast icity and 
spasms due to either spi[INVESTIGATOR_486290]. Intrathecal baclo fen was superior 
to placebo on both principal outcome measures employ ed: change from  baseline in the Ashworth 
rating of spast icity and the frequ ency of spasms. 
The efficacy of intrathecal baclo fen was investigated in three (3) controlled clinical trials; 
two(2) enrolled pat ients with cerebral palsy  and one enrolled pat ient with spast icity due to 
previous brain injury . The first study ,a rando mized controlled cross -over tri al of 51 pati ents 
with cerebral  palsy, provi ded strong, stati stically significant results; intrathecal baclo fen was 
superi or to pl acebo in reducing spasticit y as measured by  [CONTACT_486322] e. A second 
cross -over study  was co nducted in [ADDRESS_624881] ic (p= 0.066) and provided 
directionally  favorable results. The l ast study , however, di d not provi de data that could be 
reliably  analyzed.
1.4 Study Rationale
The rati onale for the proposed open -label clinical safet y surveillance study  is to obtain safet y 
data on a new higher concentration (3 mg/mL) of Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion).  The study  will 
provi de safet ydata on at least [ADDRESS_624882] 12 m onths in support of a market ing authorization applicat ion to the US Food and Drug 
Administrati on.
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Protocol CNS -GAB101US
Gablofen®(baclofen injectio n) Version:  2.0
18 December 2014 18 CONFIDENTIALThe study  design allows participants to utilize ahigher strength concentration of Gablo fen®
(baclo fen inject ion),which will allow less frequent pump refills.  The study  is open -label and as 
such all subjects will benefit fro m the higher strength formulation.  Subjects will be mo nitored 
for safet y at least e very 6-months.  While there is no expectation that complicat ions will occur, if 
there are clinical signs of an inflammatory  granulo ma the subject will be asked to have an MRI 
to confirm the presence of a granulo ma or to ident ify the cause of the symptoms which may be
related to a blocked catheter or other pump related complicat ion.
Thus, the study  will provi de adequate clinical safety  data to all ow for approval  of this higher 
concentration formulat ion of Gablo fen®(baclo fen inject ion) that is manufactured under GMP

2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this study  is to confirm the safet yand frequency of inflammatory  granulo ma
from a 3 m g/mL form ulation of Gablo fen®(baclofen inject ion).
2.[ADDRESS_624883] -approval surveillance study  is to obtain data on the 
rate of inflammatory  granulo mas in pat ients given Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion) 3m g/mL by  
[CONTACT_486323] e of administration.
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary  objectiv e of this study  is to eval uate the overall safet y data on 3 m g/mL

3.0 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of Trial Design
This is a prospective twelve -month Phase III bclinical safet y trial followed by  a 2-year, Phase IV 
study  that will be conducted at 10 to 15 clinical trial sites that are experienced wit h the use of 
intrathecal baclo fen.  All patients will be entered after sign ing an IRB approved informed 
consent. Patients will be fo llowed f or the durati on of  their treatm ent wi th Gabl ofen®(baclofen 
inject ion) 3mg/mLusing the SynchroMed®IIProgrammable Pump or until the study is 
terminated.  Patients will be evaluated for clinical complicat ions associated with the use of 
intrathecal baclo fen that are considered signs and symptoms of an inflammatory  granulo ma, 
specifically new radicular pain at the level o f the catheter tip, and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377].

each patient enrolled and then every  6 months thereafter. If there are any signs or sym ptoms 
ident ified which may indicate an inflammatory granulo maformation, an MRI scan with and 
without infusio n will be performed (with consent of the pat ient) to evaluate the potential 
presence of an inflammatory  granul oma. Events that may be related to a n inflammatory 
granulo ma will be classified as definite granul oma, possible granul oma, or other catheter related 
probl em (confirmed not caused by  a granul oma) or other clinical sequelae caused by [CONTACT_486325] n system related event. Aninterim analysis will be conducted when 
100 subjects on the 3 mg/mL concentration of Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion) reach [ADDRESS_624885] 12-months of 
therapy following the init iation o f treatm ent wi th a 3 m g/mL form ulation of Gablo fen®(baclofen 
inject ion).
A confirmed inflammatory  granulo ma or m ass is one where there are clinical signs and 
symptoms of an inflammatory  granulo ma, and an intrad ural extra- medullary mass is verified by

other assignable cause can be ident ified, the event will be recorded as a possible inflammatory  
mass.

3.5.1 Rationale for Doses and Dosing Regimen
All subjects enro lled in this trial will be on a stable current dose of intrathecal baclofen 2 m g/mL .  
A stable dose of baclo fen for the purpose of this trial will be defined as adequate symptom 
control  with no m ore than a 20% change in da ily dose over a 30 day  period.  Study  partici pants 
will be switched to the 3 mg/mL formulat ion of Gablo fen®(bacl ofen inject ion) at their current 
daily  dose of bacl ofen.  Dose adj ustments may be permi tted ten (10) day safter the swi tch to 
3mg/mL Gablo fen®(baclo fen inject ion) as needed according to standard of care ,however, the 
daily  dose will not exceed 2000 mcg.

Evaluation of Adverse Events and Adverse Drug Reactions:
Adverse events in the Case Report Form (CRF) will be classified according to the most rec ent 
FDA definit ions and in a manner co nsistent with ICH guidelines.  As such the fo llowing 
definit ions will be used:
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associ ated wi th the use of an invest igational (medicinal) product (IP) or other protocol -imposed 
intervent ion, regardless of attribut ion.  An AE may include intercurrent illnesses or injuries that 
represent an exacerbat ion (increase in frequency, severit y, or specificit y) of pre -exist ing 
condi tions (e .g., worsening of asthma).  A laboratory  abnorm ality will be reported on the 
“Adverse Event” case report form only if it is associated with clinical sequelae or requires 
therapeuti c intervent ion.  Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis a s the AE term  
rather than a series of symptoms relat ing to a diagnosis.  AEs will be graded according to the 
NCI Commo n Termino logy Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03.
The reporti ng period for nonserious AEs starts after the first administration of study  drug on Day  
1and ends after discont inuat ion of study  medicat ion.
If a SAE rem ains unreso lved after discontinuation of study  medicat ion, the subject will be 
followed, at the invest igator’s discret ion, until resolut ion of the event .SAEs m ust be fo llowed 
until reso lution by [CONTACT_978], even if this extends beyo nd the study -reporting period.  Resolut ion is 
defined as the return to baseline status or stabilizatio n of the condit ion with the expectati on that i t 
will remain chronic.
The invest igator will assess AEs for severit y, for rel ationship to IP, and as to whether the event 
meets one or more of the definit ions of an SAE .
The invest igator will determine the relat ionship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the 
source documents and AE CRF, using the categories of unrelated, possibly  related (ie ,reasonable 
possibilit y of causal  relati onshi passoci ated wi th use of IP ), and probably related (ie ,probably or 
known reason to con clude that use of IP caused the event) .

13.2.1 Reporting Requirements for Ser ious Adverse Events
Initial Reporting
SAEs (based on FDA/ICH definit ion of an SAE) require immediate reporting to Mallinckrodt or 
designated representative. 
For all fatal or life -threatening events, the invest igator(s) or designee must report informat ion 
within [ADDRESS_624913] igator(s) or designee must complete the SAE report form wit h the 
minimum informat ion required by [CONTACT_486341] [ADDRESS_624914] igator(s) or designee will receive acknowledgement of receipt of the SAE report form 
from Mallinckrodt.
Shoul d the invest igator(s) or desi gnee have any  difficul ty in sending the SAE report, they  may 
contact [CONTACT_486342] 1 -800-778- 7898 (24 hour call center) or email: 
[EMAIL_621].
If there is any doubt about whether the informat ion consti tutes an SAE, the informat ion is to be 
treated as an SAE.
Follow Up Reporting 
The invest igator(s) or designee must complete an SAE report form for all fo llow-up informati on 
received and fax it to the sponsor 314 -654- 5759 within 24 hours of receipt of addit ional or 
upda ted inform ation (eg, detailed written descript ions that include copi[INVESTIGATOR_486299], autopsy  reports and other supporting documents). The invest igator(s) or designee will 
receive acknowledgement of receipt for each SAE report form fro m Malli nckrodt.
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Protocol CNS -GAB101US
Gablofen®(baclofen injectio n) Version:  2.[ADDRESS_624915] igator(s) or designee is required to report immediately unexpected SAEs to the 
responsible IRB/IEC. 
All adverse events (serious and non- serious) occurring in subjects from the time of informed 
consent through the complet ion of the follo w-up telephone call will be documented as an AE in 
the source and in the eCRF. All fields on the AE eCRF page should be completed for each event 
with a full descri ption of the event and date and time of onset and reso lution. The invest igator 
must fo llow up on all AEs and SAEs unt il the events have subsided, until values return to within 
the acceptable range, the invest igator determines that fo llow-up is no l onger necessary, or the 
subject is referred to a nonstudy  physician.
The sponsor will report SAEs to the FDA and investigators according to local regulat ions.

intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion includes all pat ients who were deemed eligible, have signed the 
inform ed-consent form  (ICF), have been i mplanted wi th the SynchroMed®II Programmable 
Pump and treated with baclo fen. The evaluable (or “per protocol”) population is the subset of 
ITT patients who were deemed eligible, signed the ICF, have been clinically evaluated for 
inflammatory  granulo ma formation through a physical examinat ion and evaluat ion of the 
investigator.
The incidence of inflammatory  granul omas, suspected granulo mas, and other catheter related 
events will be compared by  a paired two -tailed T -test between each of the treatment groups .

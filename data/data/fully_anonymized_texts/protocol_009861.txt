Study Title:  Evaluation of the Performance of Trima Accel® Version 7.0 Software Enhancements 
for the Collection of Platelets Stored in Platelet Additive Solution  
Study Number:  CTS-5059  
Target Population:  Healthy Adults  
Device Description:  The Trima Accel system  is an automated blood component collection system that uses 
centrifugal force to separate donor blood into platelet, plasma, and red blood cell 
(RBC) components and uses Anticoagulant  Citrate Dextrose, Solution  A (ACD -A) as 
the anticoagulant. The device is comprised of three major sub -systems, 1) the Trima 
machine itself, 2) sterile, single -use disposable blood tubing sets  and, 3) embedded 
software. There are additional optional accessories such as plasma bags , platelet bag s, 
a seal safe system, and barcode scanner kit.  
The Trima Accel system  received [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
510(k) clearance for hyperconcentrated platelet collections stored in platelet additive solution (PAS) on 17 December  2012 (BK120049).  
Intended Use:  The Trima Accel system is an automated blood cell separator intended for use in 
collecting blood components for later transfusion into patients . 
Study Centers Planned:  At least 2 and up to 8 Blood Centers  in the [LOCATION_002]  
Objective:  To verify that platelets collected on the Trima Accel system  with Version 7.0 software 
enhancements and  stored in PAS meet the FDA requirements for leukoreduction 
(< 5.0 × 106 residual white blood cells [WBC] per transfu sable unit).  
Rationale:  The study is designed  to evaluate changes to the Trima Accel software to ensure the 
modified software  meet s the FDA acceptance criteria for leukoreduction  and platelet 
yield . The operating range for the system flow rates, anticoagulant ratios, storage 
conditions, and centrifugal forces are the same as the currently cleared Trima Accel 
system. There are no changes to the environment or storage conditions for platelets ; 
therefore, no in vitro or in vivo platelet quality data will be collected . 
Outcome Measures:  Primary Endpoint:  
The proportion of platelet units with an acceptable residual WBC level. Acceptable residual WBC counts are: singles = residual WBC level < 5.0 × 10
6; doubles  = residual 
WBC level < 8.0 × 106 or < 5.0 × 106 for each transfusable unit; and triples = residual 
WBC level < 12.0 × 106 or < 5.0 × 106 for each transfusable unit.  
Secondary Endpoint:  
The proportion of platelet units with an acceptable platelet yield . Acceptable platelet 
yield for single, double and triple platelet products are: platelet yield ≥ 3.0 × 1011 for 
singles, platelet yield ≥ 6.2 × 1011 for double s, and platelet yield ≥ 9.3 × 1011 for triples.  
Safety Measures:  Safety will be monitored through collection of adverse event s (AEs) , serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ), and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs). 
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Age 18 years or older . 
2. Meets the inclusion criteria defined by [CONTACT_872957] . These criteria are based on FDA  
guidance  and American Association of Blood  Banks (AABB) standards. Note: 
subjects who are deferred from volunteer community donations because of travel 
restrictions, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982] , or tattoos may participate in the study, as products are not 
transfused .

1.1 Background  
Platelet transfusions are used extensively for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
associated with major trauma, surgery , or chemotherapy, and in individuals that are 
thrombocytopenic (have low platelet count) or have other platelet dysfunctions.  
Currently, the majority of platelets transfused in the [LOCATION_002] are collected by [CONTACT_16166].1 
Platelets collected by [CONTACT_872958] (red blood cells [RBC], white blood cells [WBC] and/or 
plasma) can be cycled back to the donor. The use of platelet concentrates obtained from single 
donors by [CONTACT_872959] (hyperconcentrated) in a single apheresis collection. This practice maximizes the amount of platelets collected from each donor in a manner that  is time and cost efficient, and it has the benefit of exposing the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872951], thereby [CONTACT_872960] (AEs) such as pathogen transmission and immune reactions.
[ADDRESS_1219282] 
disease (TA -GvHD ), alloimmunization, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, transmission 
of intracellular viruses (eg , cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and 
transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM). To reduce the risk of WBC induced transfusion 
complications, leukoreduction is employed and removes the majority of WBCs from blood 
component products.
3,4 
In addition to leukoreduction in platelet products, platelets can be stored in platelet additive 
solution (PAS). In Europe it is common practice t o replace part of the plasma with  PAS. The 
rationale behind this practice is that diluting the plasma may reduce the risk of deleterious 
reactions such as allergic reactions and immune reactions triggered by [CONTACT_872961].[ADDRESS_1219283] 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the use of PAS was in 2009. This first 
approval was for the use of the PAS InterSolTM (Fenwal™, a Fresenius Kabi company) as a 
replacement of 65% plasma in platelet components. Subsequently, approval was received in 2012

Confidential  Page 12 of 38 for IsoplateTM solution use with the Trima Accel® Automated Blood Collection system  (Trima 
Accel system ). 
[ADDRESS_1219284], Inc. (Terumo BCT) is a corporation that develops and markets the Trima Accel 
system , an apheresis medical device for the collection of blood products, including platelets. The 
Trima Accel  syste m is an automated blood component collection system that uses centrifugal 
force to separate donor blood into platelet, plasma, and RBC  components using Anticoagulant 
Citrate Dextrose, Solution  A (ACD -A) as the anticoagulant . The device is comprised of 3 ma jor 
sub-systems: 1) the Trima machine itself; 2) sterile, single -use disposable blood tubing sets; and 
3) embedded software. There are additional optional accessories, such as plasma bag, platelet 
bag, seal safe system, and barcode scanner kit .  
The Trima Accel system consists of a functionally closed disposable set (sterile, nonpyrogenic) 
used in conjunction with equipment and software to collect combinations of blood products. 
Collections for this study will be performed per the Version 6.0 Trima Accel Op erators Manual  
and the Version 7.0 user change summary  which is provided to the study site by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Trima system  4.0 was initially cleared  for the collection of platelets by [CONTACT_8956] 13 
October 1998 (BK970023). The Trima Accel system was clear ed under BK010046 and 
BK010050 and additional Trima Accel embedded software modification s have been submitted 
and cleared  by [CONTACT_872962] [ADDRESS_1219285] 2014 (BK140158) for 
Version 6.[ADDRESS_1219286] has developed new Trima Acc el embedded software (ie, Version 7.0) to enhance 
the collection of platelets stored in PAS.  
2.1 Version 7.0 Software  
The Trima Accel system Version 7.0 software is intended to consolidate multiple enhanced 
software versions with the additional value of creating improvements relevant globally. These 
improvements include enhancing the leukoreduction, reducing the procedure time, and 
improving the overall experience for the operator and donor.  
The configuration of the device (software update to Version 7.0) will be provided to the 
Investigator by [CONTACT_97034]. These configurations will be within the normal operating r ange of 
the Trima Accel system V ersion 6.4, as clear ed by [CONTACT_1622]. The operating range for the system 
flow rates, anticoagulant ratios, storage conditions, and centrifugal forces are the same as the currently cleared Trima Accel system  software . 
The following modifications have been made in Version 7.0 software to be used with the Trima Accel system :

specific portions of prime, allowing the system to reduce the time of the blood prime procedure by [CONTACT_872963].  
2. Modifications to the leukoreduction system (LRS) chamber clearing procedure to clear 
excess WBC content from the LRS chamber in a more efficient manner.  
3. Changes to the platelet inventory recovery (PIR) phase to reduce the platelet inventory in the separation channel and LRS chamber at the end of the procedure when sufficient 
platelets remain.  
4. The platelet collection algorithm has been modified to improve the control of the 
concentration of platelets deliver ed to the LRS separation chamber, thereby [CONTACT_872964]. 
5. The platelet collection algorithm for hyperconcentrated platelets has been modified to 
improve the control of the concentration of platelets within the LRS separation chamber, also improving the leukoreduction potential of the LRS chamber. 
6. Improvements to the venous access pressure monitoring algorithms have been made that adjusts the draw flow rate in response to a venous access alarm  (autoflow) . Specifical ly, 
this algorithm allows for longer pump pauses in response to a venous access alarm by [CONTACT_872965] e the flow rate when  
no venous access  alarms occur . 
7. Maintenance modifications to the software to upg rade the operating system from 
VxWorks 5.[ADDRESS_1219287] practice during phlebotomy to use a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff approximately 2 inches above the antecubital area for venipuncture.
8 The American Association 
of Blood Bank s (AABB) recommends applying [ADDRESS_1219288] operating procedures (SOPs), which generally state to 
maintain appropriate pressure (20 to 40 mmHg) and blood flow (ie, squeeze a hand -gripper) 
during the apheresis procedure.  
Trima Accel® system  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS- 5059  Version 4.0: [ADDRESS_1219289] has developed an arm cuff which can be used as an alternative to maintain pressure 
on the arm and blood flow during apheresis procedures. Specifically , this arm cuff has a pressure 
control valve which allows the cuff to be fully inflated for use in obtaining venipuncture, an inline relief valve which allows the cuff to maintain the desired donation pressure (20 to 
40 mmHg) , and an inflation bulb which the donor may squeeze to maintain the donation 
pressure.  
The arm  cuff is not connected or linked to the Trima Accel system  and will be submitted f or FDA 
clearance as a standalone  device as  an alternative method to the standard methods of maintaining 
arm pressure and blood flow for apheresis procedures. In the current study, half the study sites will receive the arm  cuff and the remaining will utilize their standard method of maintaining 
donation pressure as indicated by [CONTACT_941] S ite SOP. The use of the arm cuff is not expected to impact 
the leukoreduction, volume, or yield of single, double or triple platelet products.  
2.3 Platelet Additive Solution  
InterSol solution was FDA approved for the storage of hyperconcentrated platelets (BN080041) on 07 December 2009  for use with  the 
AmicusTM Separator system  (BK090065) . InterSol PAS  is 
an isotonic solution designed to replace a proportion (65%) of the plasma used in the storage of 
leukoreduced apheresis platelets under standard blood banking conditions.  
The solution contains constituents that are naturally occurring components present in many cellular systems: sodium acetate as a n utrient, sodium citrate to prevent platelet clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_872952], sodium phosphate for buffering, and sodium chloride for osmolarity. InterSol solution does not have a pharmacological effect in vivo, but rather acts to provide the appropriate 
environment for platelet storage in lieu of a portion of the plasma. 
InterSol solution is provided as a 500 mL sterile and non-pyrogenic solution in a non-polyvinyl 
chloride plastic container with a sterile and non-pyrogenic fluid path. Each 100 mL of InterSol contains 305 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, anhydrous, [LOCATION_002] 
Pharmacopeia ( USP); 93 mg monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate, USP; 318 mg sodium 
citrate, d ihydrate, USP; 442 mg sodium acetate, trihydrate, USP; 452 mg sodium chloride, USP; 
Water for Inject ion, USP quantity sufficient. 
Currently , the use of InterSol  solution for storage of platelets  with the Trima Accel system  has 
not been cleared by [CONTACT_1622] . The FDA has recently approved a prospective in vitro study of 
platelets collected on the Trima Accel system  and stored in InterSol solution (IDE [ZIP_CODE]).

The collection of single, double, and triple platelets stored in PAS will be done with the Trima 
Accel Platelet + Sampler + AutoPAS, MultiPlasma, RBC disposable set (catalog number [ZIP_CODE]). 
This disposable set was cleared by [CONTACT_1622] (BK120049) on [ADDRESS_1219290] multiple blood components, alone or in combination. For the purposes of this study the following products will be collected under this protocol: 
• Platelets Pheresis, Leukocyte Reduced in 65% InterSol PAS (single, double, and triple units)

volume accuracy ± 6%  indicating the system was properly primed for the collection procedure 
and decreased the overall procedure time.   
Additionally, the in vitro quality of double hyperconcentrated platelets collected from a single 
donor on the Trima Accel system , split and then stored in plasma via gravity drain and InterSol 
solution via auto PAS- metering  was tested . The acceptance criteria
9 of pH (22°C) > 6.2 was met for 
all units in this study through 7 days of storage. In vitro cell quality of platelets stored in InterSol 
solution (determined by [CONTACT_872966] [ESC], hypotonic shock response [HSR], 
membrane-bound P-selectin expression [CD62P], and morphology scoring) was robust in 
InterSol solution stored platelets and was comparable to control platelets stored in plasma.  
[ADDRESS_1219292] been  
studied alone and in combination from  clinical donations from healthy donors. Software changes  
made to  previously released software versions were tested to determine if the additional 
Version  7.0 software modifications resulted in improved leukoreduction, maintained platelet 
yield, and decreased procedure time.

Confidential  Page 16 of 38 5.1 Hyperconcentrated Platelet Leukoreduction Improvements  
Changes to the platelet collection algorithm were tested in blood donations from healthy 
volunteers to determine if software modifications resulted in  improvements to the platelet 
leukoreduction in hyperconcentrated platelet products. In hyperconcentrated platelet products, 
the modified platelet collection algorithm alone showed an overall system performan ce of 100% 
of products containing < 5.0 × 106 WBCs per transfusable dose and 99.9% of hype rconcentrated 
products contain < 1.1 × 106 WBCs per transfusable dose per log normal regression analysis. 
When this modification was assessed with  additional Version 7.0 enhancements (n = 24), all  of 
the hyperconcentrated products contained < 5.0 × 106 WBCs per transfusable dose.  
5.2 Platelet Yield and Procedure Time Improvements 
The Trima Version 7.0 software has been modified to improve the overall platelet collection 
procedure time by [CONTACT_872967] . Changes to the prime procedure alone (n  = 52), resulted in a product volume 
accuracy ± 6% and when tested with other Version 7.0 enhancements (n = 40) platelet 
concentrations in the plasma product averaged 5 × 103 cells/uL.  
The venous access monitor has been modified to adjust the draw flow rate in response to venous access alerts (autoflow). A clinical assessment of the autoflow algorithm paired with the arm cuff 
(n = 30) resulted in the average operator intervention per procedure being 0.433 ± 0.935. An 
additional study was conducted with the autoflow paired with the Version 7.0 software modifications and showed an average operator intervention rate of 0.50 ± 0.88 per procedure. 
These modifications are a significant improvement over the [LOCATION_002] average of access 
related events (approximately  [ADDRESS_1219293] historical data) . 
The LRS chamber purge modifications resulted in 3-5 minutes of time advantage over the 
current Trima Accel collection for each algorithm respectively. There is an  even greater time 
savings advantage for runs wher e 1 or more purges are saved due to LRS chamber purge 
changes. T he time savings due to PIR software modific ations are dependent on the donor size 
and precount on the day of donation and therefore may differ per donation. 
6 RATIONALE FOR THE CU RRENT STUDY  
The study is designed to evaluate changes to the Trima Accel software (Version 7.0) to ensure they meet the FDA acceptance criteria for leukoreduction
9,10 (< 5.0 × 106 WBC per transfusable 
unit) and results in platelet yield s ≥ 3.0 × 1011 for singles, ≥ 6.2 × 1011 for doubles and 
≥ 9.3 × 1011 for triples.  
The operating range for the system flow rates, anti -coagulant ratios, storage conditions, and 
centrifugal forces are the same as the currently FDA cleared Trima Accel system. There are no

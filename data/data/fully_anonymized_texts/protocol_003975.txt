[ADDRESS_1256441] been used for over 8 0 years as an internal method of absorbing 
menstrual flow.  Tampons are constructed of 100% cotton, 100% rayon, or blends of cotton and 
rayon.  They are manufactured with or without an overwrap and may be provided with a 
cardboard or plastic applicator for inserting the tampon into the vagina.  
The study involves normal menstrual use.  Prior experience has indicated that the s tudy design 
described below effectively detects any differences between test product s with a long history of 
safe (as labeled) use.  In addition, a questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_748], after product use, 
has been found to be a sensitive way of detectin g any product -related sensa tions such as 
burning, stinging, irritation and comfort.  
2.0 Study Objectives  
2.1 Objective (s)   
 
1. The objective of this study is to support a claim of “clinically tested” while women wear 
tampon(s) during their full menstrual period with medical and gynaecological 
assessments of vaginal health and consumer self -reported assessments of comfort.  
2. To confirm the tolerability of four (4) tampon products based on a body of evidence 
associated with multiple assessments of vaginal health and adverse events.  The primary 
conclusion will be derived from the clinical assessments including vaginal erythema, 
ulcerations, abrasions, vaginal  pH, vaginal di scharge, and Adverse Events (AE s).  
3. Usage  diaries and questionnaires are added for learning purposes regards to comfort and 
tolerability.

 3.7 Measurement, Assessment, and Sample Collection  
 
3.7.1 Evaluation Assessment s 
 
Data from this study will be collected through multiple assessments.  These include:  
• Questionnaires (per use and monthly)  
• Vaginal assessment ( discharge and pH) 
• Clinical Vaginal exam (vaginal exam)  
 
3.7.[ADDRESS_1256461] observation or visi t, they had any of the following:  
• experienced any changes in well -being,  
• used any new medications or supplements,  
• changed medication regimens (both prescription and non -prescription), or  
• been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896345].   
 
Questions should be of a general nature and should not suggest symptoms.  
 
When an AE is suspected, all relevant evaluations will be carried out and appropriate treatment 
provided.  Additional follow -up will be performed as necessary, recorded in the subject’s source 
documents, wi th the results provided to the Sponsor.  Subjects who experience any clinically 
significant AE will remain under medical supervision until the Investigator deems the AE to be 
resolved, stabilized, or no longer serious enough to warrant follow -up.  Laborato ry values that 
are abnormal (whether or not they are assessed as AEs) may be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator until resolved or stabilized.  
 
For AE definitions and reporting requirements, refer to Section 5.6.

pH samples  for evaluations  will be obtained  at Visit 1( screening ) and Visits 2  thru 6.  These will 
be collected and processed according to instructions (Appendix 7 ) 
 
Microbiome samples will be collected at  Visit 1 (Screening)  and Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 . These will 
be collected and processed according to instruction ( Appendix 9 ). A vaginal microbial swab will 
be collected for the purpose of assessing the vaginal microbial community of the study 
population.  Analyses will be coordinated by [CONTACT_226982] & Gamble’s Micr obiology Group and is not 
 
    CSD2017164  
 
[ADDRESS_1256462] # in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_896346].   
 
Samples will be stored in a -70˚Celsius freezer at the Procter & Gamble Micro Lab for a 
maximum of 5 years, after which, all specimens will be destroyed per P&G’s policy for 
specimen destruction.   
 
The results of this testing will not result in a commercially valuable product.   
 
Subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in this testing or to have her samples used for 
analysis.  The Microbiologist will destroy the samples collected from the subject and will delete 
any data collected from the analysis of the samples.   The microbiologist will document this 
process for the Study File.   
 
Testing does not have any clinical, diagnostic or therapeutic implications for the individual 
subjects.  Therefore, the results will not be r eported to the Investigators, the subjects or their 
primary care physicians.  There will not be any follow -up with the subjects regarding this 
testing”.  
 
4.0 Statistical Methods  
 
4.1      Analysis Population  
 
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all eligible subjects who are enrolled into the 
study, randomized to treatment, and are given their assigned test products for use.  The Per -
protocol (PP) population is defined as all subjects in the ITT p opulation who are compliant with 
the study protocol and complete all four months of the study.  Given the duration of the study 
and likelihood of some panelist drop -out, analyses will be performed on both the ITT and PP 
populations.  
 
4.2      Determination of Sample Size  
 
As the prior data that is available is years old on the treatments in this study, the sample size of 
65 subjects was determined using clinical results based on expert judgment related to relevant 
publications/past clinical st udies.   
 
4.[ADDRESS_1256463] Acceptance  will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_115645]/clinical with regards to the tolerability of the four treatments based on a body of 
evidence associated with multiple assessments of vaginal health and adverse events. The primary 
conclusion will be derived from the clinical assessments including vaginal erythema, ulcerations, 
abrasions, vaginal pH, vaginal discharge, and AE’s.  
 
Prior to statistical analysis, all data will be checked for accuracy, completeness and compliance 
to protocol.  Analyses will be com pleted using PC SAS Release 9.4.   
 
Demographic data will be summarized in tables of descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_896363].   
 
Summary descriptive statistics will be provided for all parameter s. Confidence intervals (95% 
Confidence int ervals ) will be constructed for all clinical assessments for each treatment code.  
Any data reported as ‘unable to evaluate’ will be treated as missing and excluded from the 
analysis.  
 
The frequencies of vaginal disch arge color and consistency responses will be tabulated for each  
visit/treatment. Depending on the distributions, categories may be collapsed prior to statistical 
analysis.  The frequencies for normal vs. abnormal classifications will be tabulated per 
visit/treatment. Ninety -five percent CIs around the proportion with abnormal classification, and 
corresponding odds ratios will be constructed.  
 
The frequencies of erythema scores will be tabulated for each visit/treatment. Also per 
visit/treatment, 95% CI s will be constructed around: (1) the proportion of subjects with 
erythema, and (2) the proportion of subjects with moderate or severe erythema. CIs for the 
corresponding odds ratios also will be constructed.  
 
The frequencies for abrasion and ulceration wi ll be tabulated for each visit/treatment. For each of 
these parameter, 95% CIs around the proportions and odds ratios will be constructed.  
 
Additional analyses may be conducted to further understand the data.  
 
5.0 Investigator Obligation  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the applicable GCPs, International Conference 
on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice . The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_896347], or incidental t o those 
described herein, in accordance with the highest standards of medical and clinical research 
practice.  Delegation of any study responsibility will be documented in writing.  The Investigator 
will also be required to submit a report documenting stud y execution.  
 
5.1 Institutional Review  
The study will not begin prior to the receipt of written confirmation of approval by [CONTACT_896364].  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain the IRB 
approval (per the U.S . Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 56 and applicable ICH 
 
    CSD2017164  
 
22 
 guidelines) for the protocol, amendments, informed consent, subject information sheet, 
questionnaires, and advertising materials used to recruit study subjects, if appropriate.  A copy of 
the IRB approval letter along with a list of the IRB members who acted on this protocol and a 
statement that the IRB is in compliance with current ICH E6 and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) 
guidelines will be provided to the Clinical Trial Manager.  
It is the  Investigator’s responsibility to promptly report to the IRB all changes to the research 
activity and all unanticipated problems involving the risk to human subjects.   
5.2 Protocol Amendment(s)  
With the exception of emergency situations, implementation of  any significant change in the 
protocol (i.e., one that affects the safety of the subjects, scope of the investigation, or the 
scientific quality of the study) will not be permitted until the Sponsor, the Investigator, and the 
IRB have reviewed, approved, and documented the protocol amendment in writing.  
Amendments include changes in the study procedures, Investigator or site address, change risk 
level, etc.  
 
When a change is made to eliminate or reduce the risk to subjects, it may be implemented before 
review and approval by [CONTACT_1201].  The Investigator shall notify the IRB of said change in writing 
within [ADDRESS_1256464] be documented in writing and promptly 
reported to the Sponsor, the IRB, or other appropriate regulatory/government authority (if 
appropriate).  
 
Implementation of an administrative (minor or non -significant) change [e.g., changes i n other 
Sponsor personnel (Clinical Data Manager, Statistician), IRB or Sponsor address, typographical 
errors, spelling errors, etc.] cannot be made until said change is reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_9323] a memo communicating the change is provided t o the Investigator.  Forwarding of 
these memos to the IRB by [CONTACT_896365].  
5.[ADDRESS_1256465] sign and personally date a study -specific informed consent form to serve as a 
participant in the study.  This consent form will comply with all applicable regulations governing 
the protection of human patients.  The basic elements of informed consent are specified in the 
US CFR Title 21 parts 50.25, 50.27, and 50.55 and the ICH Harm onized Tripartite Guideline for 
GCP.  
 
The Investigator will obtain the IRB’s written approval of the written informed consent form to 
be provided to the subjects, including approval of all revisions.  Prior to the start of the study, the 
Investigator or an  authorized staff member will inform patients about the nature of the study.  
Subjects will have the opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether to 
participate.  Subjects will be instructed that they are free to withdraw their p articipation in the 
study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.  The 
 
    CSD2017164  
 
23 
 Investigator will inform subjects of new information that may be relevant to subjects’ 
willingness to continue participation in the study a nd the Investigator’s obligation to protect 
subject confidentiality.  
 
The Investigator will provide each subject with a copy of the signed and dated consent form and 
will document in the subject’s source notes that informed consent was given.  
5.4  Data Col lection  
The Investigator has the responsibility for ensuring that all source documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol.  
Source documents and paper CRFs, where they exist, should be  available at the site during the 
in-life portion of the study.  
5.4.1 Electronic Case Report Form (s) 
This study will utilize web -based, electronic case report forms (eCRFs) developed through a 
validated, Electronic Records/Electronic Signatures (ERES) -compliant platform (21 CFR 
Part 11), and all investigator data included in the study database will be col lected in these eCRFs .   
Prior to the initiation of the trial, the study center will be contact[CONTACT_407724], 
hardware specifications, internet connectivity, etc., to evaluate their capacity to use this type of 
data capture system. Every p erson at the study center who will be entering data into this system 
will receive training on the system.  Each user will be issued a unique user identification and 
password. For security reasons, and to be in compliance with regulatory guidelines, it is 
imperative that only the person who owns the user identification and password enter the system 
using those user names and passwords. Passwords are not transferable. In the case of a change in 
study center personnel, the newly assigned individuals will be tr ained and a personal user 
identification and password will be provided. They may not use the identification and password 
of the previous user.  
Data changes, as well as the initial entry of data, into the eCRFs will be captured within the 
system’s audit tra il. Included in the audit trail will be the item, the original value, the changed 
value, who made the change/entry, when the change/entry was made, and a reason for the 
change.  
During routine monitoring visits, the study center will make available to the m onitor their 
computer and telecommunications that are suitable for Internet access so that the monitor may 
make a thorough crosscheck of the data entries with any source documentation.  
The Investigator will be responsible for the timeliness, completeness,  and accuracy of the 
information on the eCRFs. Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to 
identify errors or inconsistencies. Errors or inconsistencies will be posted as queries in the 
eCRFs or in an excel spreadsheet for resolution. T he study center must answer the queries within 
a reasonable, mutually agreed, period of time.  
5.4.2 Source Documents  
 
    CSD2017164  
 
24 
 The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents (medical 
records, raw data collection forms, etc.) design ed to record all observations and other pertinent 
data for each patient treated with the study drug.  
 
The Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, and authorized 
regulatory authority inspectors to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study.  
 
5.5 Adherence to Protocol  
By [CONTACT_896366], the Investigator confirms in writing 
that he/she has read, understands, and will strictly adhere to the study protocol and will condu ct 
the study in accordance with ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 
and applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
5.6 Adverse Events  
 
Adverse Event :  Any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that appears or 
worsens in a patient or clinical investigation patient during the period of observation in a clinical 
study.  The AE may be any of the following:  
 
• A new illness,  
• An exacerbation of a sign or symptom of the underlying condition under treatment or of a 
concomitant illn ess, 
• Unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study product or 
comparator drug, or  
• A combination of one or more of the above factors.  
 
No causal relationship with the study product is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse even t.”  
An exacerbation of a pre -existing condition/illness is defined as a more frequent occurrence or as 
an increase in the severity of the pre -existing condition/illness during the study.  Planned or 
elective surgical or invasive procedures for pre -existin g conditions that have not worsened are 
not AEs.  However, any complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is an A E.  
(If the event fits the serious criteria, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , it will be considered a serious AE.)  
Conditions leadi ng to unplanned surgical procedures may be A Es. 
 
When an AE occurs after written informed consent has been  obtained but before the first 
exposure  of study product,  the AE will be considered a nontreatment -emergent AE.  Only serious 
nontreatment -emergent A Es that are related to study procedures will be collected.  An AE that 
occurs from the time the patient receives her first exposure  of study product  until her exit from 
the study will be considered a treatment -emergent AE.  All treatment -emergent A Es will b e 
collected.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  As provided by [CONTACT_776844], an SAE:  
• results in death;  
• is life threatening;  
 
    CSD2017164  
 
25 
 (Note : The term “life threatening ” refers to any AE that, as it occurs, puts the patient at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.)  
• results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49199] (not i ncluding 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition that has not increased in severity or frequency 
from the patient ’s underlying medical condition prior to entry into the study);  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• is a congenita l anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient; or  
• is judged to be medically important.  
 (Note :  A medically important AE is a medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896348].  Medical and scientific judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whether A Es appropriately meet this criterion and are 
immediately reportable to the Sponsor.  Examples of such medica l events include 
transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product, allergic bronchospasm that 
requires intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home and blood dyspraxias  or 
convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
 
SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the study center being informed of the 
AE (see Section 5.6.2). Sponsor clinical representatives are Stacey Carpenter (513 -307-3221) 
and Jan Streicher -Scott (513 -265-3893 ).  
 
5.6.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Anticipated adverse events in this study include: mild and transient discomfort with insertion and 
removal of the Tampon.  
 
Every attempt should be made to describe the AE in terms of a diagnosis.  If a clear diagnosis 
has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they represent 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_49197], in which case they should be reported as 
separate events.  If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be 
recorded  individually.  
 
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, serious/unexpected AE, unanticipated 
adverse device effect, or medical event which was not present at baseline and/or which results in 
the withdrawal  of a subject from the study must b e followed to resolution with appropriate 
medical management unless documented as “not clinically significant” condition considered 
stable or the subject is lost to follow -up by [CONTACT_737]. Adverse events reported by [CONTACT_896367].  
 
When completing appropriate forms for reporting the AE, the Investigator will be asked to assess 
the AE as follows:  
 
Severity of Adverse Event :  Refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily 
activities.  Severity will be categorized according to the following criteria:  
   
 
    CSD2017164  
 
26 
 -- mild - normal activities unaltered, AE is annoying, but AE is tolerable  
   -- moderate - normal activities a ltered or AE requires intervention  
   -- severe - unable to undertake normal activities or is incapacitated  
 
The term “severity” is used to describe the intensity of an event (as in mild, moderate, severe); 
the event itself may be of relatively minor medic al significance, such as a severe headache.  This 
is not the same as “serious.”  Seriousness, not severity, serves as the guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
- Investigator's Opi[INVESTIGATOR_896349]  
  -- not related - there i s no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be  
      related to investigational product usage  
  -- doubtful - there is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related  
      to investigational product usage, or there is another more probable  medical  
      explanation  
  -- possible - there is possible evidence to suggest that the AE could possibly be  
      related to investigational product usage  
  -- probable - there is probable evidence to suggest that the AE is probably  
      related to inv estigational product usage  
 
- Action Taken Regarding Test Product  
  -- none - no change in test product usage  
  -- reduced/interrupted - test product usage will be reduced or temporarily interrupted  
  -- discontinued - test product usage will be discontinued  
 
The Investigator(s) will decide on a case -by-case basis as to whether any subject should be 
dropped from the study.  If the Investigator(s) or subject decides to discontinue study 
participation,  this should be documented and filed with the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1256466].   
 
5.6.2 Serious or Unexpected Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Serio us Adverse Events will be recorded (on a Detailed Adverse Event Report) and tracked 
in this study.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is “any unexpected medical occurrence that at any 
exposure:  1) Results in death; 2) Is life -threatening; 3) Requires in -patie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_896350]; 4) Results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity; 5) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 6) Is medically significant.  The 
Investigator will notify the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1256467] t he Sponsor within 24 hours at the following numbers to answer 
questions regarding potentially serious or unexpected Adverse Events.   
  
During normal business hours or after hours:    
Stacey Carpenter 513 -307-3221  
 
The Clinical site will be responsible for notifying the IRB of any reportable AEs in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_896351]. Any notifications to the IRB also require notifications to the 
Sponsor’s reps within 24 hrs per the above.   
 
5.7 Records Retention  
 
The Investigator(s) must retain the subject identification codes, informed consent documentation, 
and disposition of the test product, CRFs, medical records, and othe r source data for a minimum 
of 5 years after study completion. The Investigator (s) must receive written authorization from the 
Sponsor before destroying any study document.  
 
The Investigator(s) will make the records available for inspection and copying upon the request 
of an authorized employee of a government authority or the Sponso r, at reasonable times.  
In the event the Investigator(s) retires, relocates, or for any other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, custody of the records may 
be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility for the records. Notice of such a 
transfer must be given in writing to the Sponsor.  
 
The sponsor will maintain clinical records according to P&G Records Management Guidelines.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1256468] ency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
• Routine site monitoring,  
• Source/CRF review, and  
• Data management quality control checks  
 
In addition, a representative from the Sponsor may conduct periodic audits of study processes, 
including, but not limited to, a review of the Investigator’s Trial Master File (TMF), Standard  
 
    CSD2017164  
 
28 
 Operating Procedures (SOPs) pertaining to the clinical study, and  training records of staff 
involved.  
 
6.1.1  Monitoring  
 
Prior to the commencement of the study, an initiation meeting will be held with the appropriate 
study site personnel to review the objectives and procedures of the clinical trial.  To assure 
accurate,  complete,  consistent, and reliable data, the study  site(s) and study procedures will be 
monitored by a representative of the Sponsor according to the US CFR Title 21 Part 312 and 
ICH Guideline for GCP (Section 5.18).  The investigator will permit Sponsor’s representative(s) 
to make consistent  site visits during the study.  The frequency of monitoring visi ts will be agreed 
upon as to the most appropriate intervals as determined by [CONTACT_879520].  
6.[ADDRESS_1256469] udy centers may be suspended or withdrawn by [CONTACT_896368].  In such cases, all parties will be notified in a 
proper and timely fashion.  The IRB will be informed promptly and the Sponsor or the 
Inves tigator will supply reason(s) for the termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_13179].  Otherwise, the study is considered terminated upon 
completion of all patient treatments and evaluations.  
 
6.3 Investigator(s) Final Re port 
 
The Investigator or designee will submit a study report to the Sponsor within 4 weeks following 
study completion or termination.  This report should include:  
 
• Investigator’s designee of authority statement for specific tasks, e.g., designation 
by [CONTACT_896369] a qualified staff person to enroll subjects.  
• Personnel list of responsibilities (including any non -Test Site Facility personnel)

Risk Assessment  
 
This study is a four month in use randomized, cross over, controlled, double blind study to assess 
the tolerability and comfort of four tampon products.  The study will be conducted at Radiant 
Research (Cincinnati, OH) under the direction of Michael Noss, MD.  The study will include up 
to [ADDRESS_1256473] methods  along with the study design described in this protocol for 
CSD2017164 are assessed as minimal risk based on the probability and magnitude of harm or 
discomf ort anticipated in the study  not being greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily 
life or d uring the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.  This 
assessment is based on study design, appropriate inclusio n/exclusion criteria for eligibility , 
physician oversight, properly trained study personnel, safe history of use of these  tampons  and/or 
similar tampon products, proper usage instructions and controlled product use.   
 
The study procedures will include non -invasive measurements of the labia minora, vagina and 
introitus as detailed above.  During study conduct, su bjects will be asked to participate in the 
following procedures at various time points: speculum insertion, vaginal assessment, and/or 
vaginal sampling. Assessment may  include non -invasive measur ements for  vaginal discharge , 
pH, visual grading for erythema , abrasions, ulcerations,  and superficial tissue/cell collection. The 
study site staff will have sufficient training and experience with each of these minimal risk 
procedures. The side effects associated with this examination and technical measures are 
expected to be minimal.

Vaginal Assessments, Documentation of Findings , and Follow Up PRN  
The study Physician of record will conduct the procedures and vaginal exam/assessments appearing 
below.  Any potential confounding activities will also be assessed during the vaginal exam i.e., sexual 
activity within the past  [ADDRESS_1256477] use other than study supplied tampons.   
 
All findings either normal and abnormal, will be documented in the eCRF  Form , noting sc ore (for 
erythema) and absence or presence of abrasion, ulceration, laceration, and color an d character of vaginal 
discharge and any evidence of sexually transmitted disease.  Document the location, extent, and detailed 
description of any finding s in comments.    
 
Study subjects who have abnormalities or irritation noted on their gynecological  examination form may  
be scheduled for a follow up examination.  The Study Physician  will determine whether follow -up is 
necessary.  Follow up examination s will occur [ADDRESS_1256478]’s  next menstrual 
period.  
 
Procedure Order :  
• Subjects will be placed in the dorsal lithotomy  position.   
• Observe external genit alia and record any findings on eCRF  Form;   
• A speculum  will be inserted into the vagina to visual ize the upper 1/3 of the vagina;  
• Using the scales and descriptors outlined in th e protocol and Appendices, record all findings  on

Vaginal Assessment  
 
Vaginal pH   
 
 
1) Use appropriate personal protective equipment.  
2) Vaginal pH is measured before  the insertion of a speculum.  
3) A pH test stri p (2.0 -9.0 range) is grasped at the end and either held by [CONTACT_896372] a sterile 
hemostat (long tool capable of re aching into the vagina thru the speculum) and carefully 
brought to the vagina.  
4) The strip is moistened with the "fluid" from the middle to upper third of the lateral wall 
of the vagina.  It is held in place for 30 sec. 
5) The strip is carefully removed and the  colour change should be "read" immediately after 
removal . 
6) The corresponding pH value is recorded on the eCRF Database

STI Microbiology Screening ( Visit 1 Only)  
 
Vaginal swab samples will be collected at the screening visit (Visit 1).  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_896353]’s, 
subject’s specimens will be identified only by [CONTACT_2030] [ADDRESS_1256482] number.   
Aptima  swabs will be used for wet mount samples.   
All subjects will be screened for the microflora exclusion criteria BV (bacterial vaginosis), 
Candida spp ., Trichomonas vaginalis , Chlamydia trachomatis , and Neisseria  gonorrhoeae .  The 
presence of three of the four following  criteria is diagnostic of BV: (1) non -viscous homogenous 
milky Vaginal Discharge , (2) vaginal pH > 4.5, (3) the presence of a fishy amine odor or the 
production of the odor upon the addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the vaginal 
discha rge, and (4), the presence of clue cells (> 20 % clue cells). All subjects will be tested for 
Candida spp ., Trichomonas vaginalis , Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria  gonorrhoeae  using 
suitable diagnostic methods.  Subjects testing positive for any of the mic robial vaginal exclusion 
criteria will be dismissed from further study participation.   
Tests for Bacterial Vaginosis,  Candida spp ., Trichomonas vaginalis :  Vaginal samples are 
treated as follows.  Gently agitate the vaginal swab suspension and place one drop on a glass 
slide.  Apply a cover slip and examine under low - and high -power magnifications, looking for 
clue cells (vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_896354]).  The presence of clue cells (> 20 % clue cells) is consistent with the 
diagnosis of nonspecific vagino sis (BV); pseudohyphae is consistent with Candida spp .; and 
motile trichomonads is consistent with Trichomonas vaginalis . Add a drop of 10% KOH for 
detection of yeast pseudohyphae and presence of a fishy amine odor.  
Tests for Chlamydia trachomatis  and Neisseria  gonorrhoeae :  A nucleic acid probe -based 
method is recommended, e.g. the P ACE 2 System (Gen -Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA).  
Endocervical samples will be handled per manufacturer’s  instructions.   
 
 
Results for all microbiologic al screening will be captured in the eCRF Database.

Vaginal Swab for Microbiome Assessment   
 
Microbiome swab sample will be collected at Visit 1 (Screening) , 3, 4, 5 and 6 .  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_896353]’s, 
subject’s specimens will be identified only by [CONTACT_2030] [ADDRESS_1256483] number.   
 
Materials Needed for the Sampling:  
1. COPAN ESwab™ (COPAN Diagnostics In c.)  
A Sterile Peel Pouch Package with:  
• A Nylon Flocked Swab  
• A Screw Cap Tube with 1 ml of liquid Amies  
2. Sterile Saline  
Prior to sampling:  
 
1. Note whether subject has used antibiotics within [ADDRESS_1256484] and  be provided appropriate 
covering while waiting for the procedure.   
2. Subjects will be positioned appropriately for sampling ( i.e.; feet in stirrups of gynaecologic  exam 
table).       
3. This vaginal swabbing procedure will be conducted following the visual vaginal exam and prior 
to subsequent vaginal swabbing for vaginal infections or sexually  transmitted diseases.  
 
During Sampling ( Aseptic technique must be followed with regard to swab handling; minimize open 
tubes, use sterile solutions etc.)  
 
1. Use appropriate hand hygiene and apply gloves.  
2. Open the peel pouch and remove the swab from the pou ch with care (must not touch the area 
below the marked breakpoint indication line and avoid touching the swab tips to any unintended 
surface to avoid contamination).  
3. Pre-moisten the swab by [CONTACT_868697][INVESTIGATOR_896355] 5 seconds.  
4. Insert speculum by [CONTACT_896373]  (if not already done) . 
5. When swabbing: insert the moist swab beyond the tip of the speculum, in the posterior fornix, 
being careful not to touch the tip of swab to any unintended surface to avoid contamination. N ote, 
the sample should be obtained from an area of the posterior fornix that has not been in contact 
[CONTACT_896374].  
6. Rotate the swab 5 times (clockwise 2 times and counter clockwise 3 times), pressing lightly against 
the vaginal wall.  
7. Carefully remove the swab without touching any unintended surface.  
8. Remove the ESwab tube from the pouch and uncap.  
9. Insert the swab all the way to the bottom of the tube.  
10. Holding the swab shaft close to the rim of the tube, break the swab shaft at the colored breakpoint 
line while holding the tube opening away from your face.  
11. Screw the cap on tightly to prevent leakage.  
12. Apply a label to the tube and then store the samples at -20C until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].    
13. Visually assess the fornix region after all swabs are collected and note any new visual findings.  
14. The samples will be shipped on dry ice to MBC micro lab to the below address:

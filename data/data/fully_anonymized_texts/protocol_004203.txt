Title of Protocol: A Phase 4, Open -Label Study to 
Evaluate Vedolizumab IV Dose Optimization on 
Treatment Outcomes In Nonresponders With Moderately 
to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (ENTERPRET)IND No.: [ADDRESS_1262018] No.:
Not applicable
Study Number: Vedolizumab -4014 Phase: 4
Study Design:
This is a phase [ADDRESS_1262019] dosing of vedolizumab IV, over a 30 -week treatment period. This study will 
enroll adult subjects with moderately to severel y active ulcerative colitis (UC) who are eligible for treatment with 
vedolizumab IV. Approximately 250subjects will be enrolled in order to randomize approximately 100 nonresponder 
subjects with high vedolizumab drug clearance.
All eligible subjects will receive induction therapy with vedolizumab IV 300 mg on Day 1 and Week 2 (Lead -in 
Period). Subjects who are assessed as having high vedolizumab clearance, based on a predefined Week 5 serum 
vedolizumab concentration threshold (<5 0 µg/mL) and who are nonresponders (based on partial Mayo score) at Week 
[ADDRESS_1262020] or optimized doses of 
vedolizumab IV. Subjects who are determined to be responders or are nonrespo nders at Week 6 with a Week 5 level 
above the predefined vedolizumab concentration threshold ( ≥50 µg/mL) (ie, Lead -in Failures) will not be randomized 
and will receive the Week 6 study drug dose and thereafter appropriate treatment per physician discretion . The study is 
comprised of a 28 -day Screening Period, a 6 -week Lead -in Period, and a 24 -week Randomized Treatment Period, 
followed by [CONTACT_1629] 18 -week Follow -Up Safety Visit and a long-term follow -up (LTFU) safety survey by [CONTACT_756] [ADDRESS_1262021] dos e of study  drug. 
Primary Objectives:
To determine the effect of vedolizumab IV dose optimization on mucosal healing compared with the standard 
vedolizumab IV dosing regimen at Week 30 in subjects with UC and high vedolizumab clearance based on a 
predefin ed week 5 serum vedolizumab concentration threshold (<50 µg/mL) and who are Week 6 nonresponders.
Secondary Objectives:
To determine the effect of vedolizumab IV dose optimization on clinical response and remissio ncompared with the 
standard vedolizumab I V dosing regimen at Week 30 in subjects with UC and high vedolizumab clearance based on a 
Week 5 predefined serum vedolizumab concentration threshold (<50 µg/mL) and who are Week [ADDRESS_1262022] Population: Adult subjects aged of [ADDRESS_1262023] high vedolizumab clearance based on a predefined

Vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q8W (optimized arm lowest 
dose available following return to normalization from 
Ctrough >90 µg/mL) 
Duration of Treatment:
30-week treatment periodPeriod of Evaluation:
The study  includes a [ADDRESS_1262024] dose of study drug. The duration of the study will be 
approximately 56 weeks. 
Main Criteria for Inclusion:
The subject has been determined to be suitable for vedolizumab IV by [CONTACT_9682].
Age at Screening between 18 to 85 years of age, inclusive.
Diagnosis of UC established at least 1 month prior to Screening. 
Active moderate to severe UC as determined by a complete Mayo score of 6 to 12 with an endoscopic subscore of 
≥2 within 28 days prior to enrollment.
Subject has had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or intolerance of at least 1 of the following agents: 
immunomodulator, corticosteroids, or tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α) antagonist. Subjects who are TNF -α 
antagonist naïve or who have failed prior TNF -α antagonist treatment (primary and secondary nonresponders or 
intolerant ) may be included. 
At Week 6, subjects must meet both of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for randomization into the 
Random ized Treatment Period of the study:
The subject is assessed as having a high vedolizumab clearance, based on a predefined Week 5 serum 
vedolizumab concentration threshold (<50 µg/mL).
The subject is a nonresponder based on partial Mayo score at Week 6.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
The subject has had extensive colonic resection, subtotal or total colectomy.
The subject has any evidence of an active infection during Screening.
The subject has a positive progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) subje ctive symptom checklist 
during Screening or prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1 .
The subject has received any investigational or approved biologic or biosimilar agent within 60 days or 
5half-lives prior to Screening (which ever is longer).
The subject has had prior exposure to approved or investigational anti -integrin antibodies (eg ,vedolizumab, 
natalizumab, efalizumab, etrolizumab, AMG -181, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule [ anti-MAdCAM -1] 
antibodies, or rituximab).
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
Primary  endpoint:
The proportion of subjects achieving mucosal healing , defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1point, at 
Week 30.
Secondary endpoints:
Proportio n of subjects achieving clinical remission, where clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score

Vedolizumab IV
Study No. Vedolizumab -4014 Page 15of 132
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 0 3 19 April 2018
of ≤2points and no individual subscore >1 point at Week 30.
Proportio n of subjects achieving clinical response, where clinical response is de fined as a reduction in complete 
Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of 
≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point, at Week 30.
Proportio n of subjects achieving clinical re sponse (based on partial Mayo score), which is defined as a reduction 
in partial Mayo score of ≥2 points and ≥25% from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding 
subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at, Week 14. 
Proportio n of subjects using oral corticosteroids at Baseline who have discontinued corticosteroids and are in 
clinical remission, at Week 30.
Proportio n of subjects achieving durable clinical response, which is defined as clinical response based on p artial 
Mayo score at Weeks 14 and 30.
Safety Endpoints:
Safety as assessed by [CONTACT_20721] ( AEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs) (including serious
infections including opportunistic infection such as PML, liver injury, malignancies, infusion -related or injection 
site reactions orsystemic reactions and hypersensitivity), serious adverse events ( SAEs ),vital signs, and results of 
standard laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis).
Statistical Considerations:
All efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set (FAS), with the exception of corticosteroid-free remission 
which will be based on the subset of the FAS who are taking concomitant oral corticosteroids at Baseline. 
All proportion -based primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_900057] 95% confidence intervals for the proportion by [CONTACT_1570] . The difference in proportions between treatment 
groups along with the 95% confidence interval will be p resented. The primary efficacy analyses will be based on 
logistic model with treatment as a factor ,natural logarithm of trough concentration at Week 6 and other important 
covariates as explanatory variables. Odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval for treatment effect will be provided
All subjects with missing data for determination of endpoint status will be considered as a nonresponder in the 
analy sis.
Sample Size Justification: The sample size was based on an estimate of precision and not on statist ical power 
considerations. A total sample size of approximately 250subjects enrolled to achieve approximately 100 subjects 
randomized at Week 6, including 50 subjects per treatment group, will be sufficient to provide 95% confidence 
intervals for mucosal healing rates with a half width no wider than +/ -13.9%. In addition, the maximum width of the 
95% confidence intervals (2-sided) for the difference in mucosal healing rates between the 2 groups will be no wider 
than +/ -19.6%. If there is a high rate of pat ient drop out from the study, additional patients may be added.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Diseases and Current Treatments 
Ulcerat ive colit is (UC) is characterized by [CONTACT_260214], superficial infla mmat ion of the colonic mucosa 
that begins in the rectum and extends proximally to invo lve any cont iguous length of the colon. 
The prevalence o f UC is approximately  200/100,000 of the [LOCATION_002] populat ion and 
approximately  150/100,000 of the popul ation in Western Europe [1-3]and 63.6/100,000 of the 
popul ation in Japan [4].A genet ic contribut ion to the disease is indicated by  [CONTACT_900061] (of 30 to 100
times that of the general  populat ion) among first -degree relatives of 
patients wi th UC. The characteristic patho logy is one of chronic inflammat ion characterized by 
[CONTACT_900062] m ucosa and submucosa with an 
acute inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils variably present.
Clinical manifestations of UC include diarrhea, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_260202] , as well  as abdominal pain, fecal 
urgency, and incont inence. Systemic features such as fever, weight loss, malaise, and fat igue are 
indic ators of more extensive disease. Extra -intestinal manifestations which track intestinal act ivity 
such as peripheral arthritis (ty pe1), epi [INVESTIGATOR_900054], and ery thema nodosum  are commo nly associ ated 
with inflammatory  bowel  disease (IBD), whereas those that mani fest independent of disease 
activit y such as ankylosing spondylit is, py oderm a gangrenosum, primary  sclerosing cholangit is, 
and uveit is may be seen as well. The diagnosis of UC is usually made by [CONTACT_900063], ph ysical examinat ion, in combinat ion with laboratory and imaging 
studi es.
Current treatments have been effective for many patients with UC but have numerous limitat ions 
for pati ents wi th moderately to severely act ive disease. 5- aminosalicylates (5 -ASAs) are the 
mainstay  of UC pharmacotherapy  for induct ion and maintenance of remissio n for patients with 
mild to m oderate di sease, but are less effective in moderate to severe disease [5,6]. 
Corti costeroi ds are often required for the 1/3 of patients who fail to respon d to 5 -ASAs [
7,8]. 
While highly effect ive for induct ion of remissio n, corti costeroi ds are not recommended for 
maintenance of remissio n and carry  significant undesi rable side effects, including osteoporosis, 
glucose intol eranc e, and increased ri sk of infect ion. 
Immunomodulatory  agents, including [ADDRESS_1262029] a role in 
maintenance of remissio n in moderately to severely  active UC. Thei r relatively slow onset of 
action precludes their use during flares of disease, and the use o f these agen ts has been reported to 
potenti ally increase the ri sk of lymphoma in patients with IBD [
9]. Other severe adverse events 
(AEs) associated with use of immuno modulators i nclude cy topenias, hepat itis, and infection.
Intravenous (IV) cy closporine has a role in the management of severely  active UC; however, it is 
impract ical in non -hospi [INVESTIGATOR_9643], requires intense monitoring, and may cause irreversible 
nephrotoxi city, all of which limit its use.

Monoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) directed against tumor necrosis factor -alpha(TNF -α) have been 
approved for the treatment of UC in many countrie s world -wide, including infliximab (Remicade), 
adalimumab (Humira) and go limumab (Simponi) [10-12] . These agents have substant ially 
improved the care of patients with UC by [CONTACT_260218] n and decreasing the 
need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260204], and other complicat ions. Alt hough TNF -α antagoni sts 
repres ent an important addit ion to the UC pharmacologic armamentarium, they  are effect ive in 
only a subset of patients, with roughly 2/[ADDRESS_1262030] y ear of therapy  [
13,14]. Induction of remissio n with infliximab occurs in only 31% to 
39% of patients with UC [
15]and durable clinical remission (ie, defined as clinical remissio n at 
Weeks 8, 30, and 54) occurs in only 26% of pat ients with UC. In addit ion, controlled studies have 
demonstrated that, after failure of [ADDRESS_1262031], a patient’s response to a secon d TNF -α 
antagonist is substant ially lower [
16]. The TNF -α antagonists are also as sociated with a number of 
serious safet y concerns based on their suppressio n of systemic immunit y, including react ivation of 
tubercul osis (TB); various bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infect ions; and malignancies, 
such as hepatosplenic T cell l
ympho ma [10,11] .
Failure of pharmaco logical therapy  leads to col ectomy  in 9% to 35% of pat ients with UC wi thin 
5years. Colectomy is considered to be an important adjunct treatm ent for re
fractory  UC; however, 
colectomy wi th ileal pouch anal anastomosis (the standard surgical therapy) has many limit ations 
and is associated with its own set of complications, including high stool frequency [17], female 
infertilit y [
18], and a cumulative incidence of pouchit is of 50% at 10 years [ 19]. The limitat ions o f 
current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_260205] a significant need for safer and more effect ive 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].
4.1.2 Vedolizumab IV
Vedolizumab (also known as MLN0002) is a novel reco mbinant humanized mAb co mposed of 
2light chains o f the subclass a nd 2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G 1 heavy chains. Vedo lizumab binds 
specifically to the human lymphocy te integrin 47. The α 4β7integrin mediates lymphocy te 
trafficking to gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa and gut -associ ated lymphoi d tissue (GALT) through 
adhesive inte raction wi th mucosal addressin cell adhesio n molecule -1(MAdCAM -1), which is 
expressed on the endothelium o f mesenteri c lymph nodes and GI mucosa [20-23] . As a result, 
vedo lizumab impairs the migra tion of  gut-homing leukocy tes into GI m ucosa [
24]andacts as a 
gut
-select ive immunomodulator.
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Vedolizumab for Inject ion, for 
Intravenous Use; Vedo lizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusion; or MLN0002 
IV) has been gr anted m arket ing approval in numerous regions, including the [LOCATION_002] (US), 
Canada, and European Unio n (EU). Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult 
patients wi th moderately to severely  active UC and CD, who have failed convent ional treat ment, 
such as immuno modulators, corti costeroi ds, or TNF -α antagonists. The approved dosing and 
administration regimen is 300 mg vedo lizumab IV infused intravenously at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and 
then every  8 weeks (Q8W) thereafter and is the standard vedolizuma b dosing regimen referred to 
in this protocol.

Vedolizumab IV
Study No. Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1262032] characterized the efficacy, safety , tolerabili ty, 
pharmacokinet ics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicit y of vedo lizumab IV, a 
lyophilized form ulation. As of 19 May  2015, approximately  3600 subjects (309 heal thy subjects, 
1393 subjects with UC, and 1896 subjects with Crohn’s disease [CD]) have received at least 1 dose 
of vedo lizumab across completed and ongo ing studies (Edit ion [ADDRESS_1262033] igator’s Brochure). 
Vedolizumab exposure has extended for ≥12 months in 1667 subjects, ≥24 months in 1306 
subjects, ≥36 months in 935 subjects, ≥48 months in 676 subjects, ≥60 months in 267 subjects, and 
≥72 m onths in 26 subjects. Based on drug shipment data (19 November 2015 ), the cumulat ive 
patient exposure to vedolizumab IV since its marketing approval in May  [ADDRESS_1262034] ive UC (Study  C13006), vedolizumab IV 300 mg 
administered as an IV infusio n at Weeks 0 and 2 (induction) fo llowed by [CONTACT_900064] 4 weeks 
(Q4W) or Q8W administration from Week 6 through Week 52 (m aintenance) induced a 
statist ically -significant increase in rates of clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remissio n at 
Week 52 (primary  endpoint for the Induction Period and Maintenance Period, respectively) 
compared wit h placebo [25]. The study also met important secondary endpo ints, including durable 
clinical response, durable clinical remis sion, mucosal  healing at Weeks 6 and 52, and 
corticosteroi d-free clinical remissio n at Week 52. Given the significant morbidit y associ ated wi th 
chronic corticosteroid treatment, the corticosteroid -sparing effects of vedo lizumab provide an 
important benefit to pati ents wi th UC.
Vedolizumab IV has shown an acceptable and consistent safet y profile in clinical studies and 
postm arket
ing. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 studies (C13006 in UC and C13007 in CD), the most 
commo n (≥5% and at a higher incidence than placebo) a dverse reactions in subjects administered 
vedo lizumab IV were nausea, nasopharyngit is, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826], arthralgia, 
pyrexia, fat igue, headache, and cough. Most serious adverse events (SAEs) have been related to 
exacerbations or complicati ons of  the underlying UC or CD. For those infect ions that were 
reported more frequent ly in vedo lizumab -treated subjects, the sites of these infect ions correlated 
with the known tissue distribut ion of MAdCAM -[ADDRESS_1262035] ions 
(bronchit is, pneumonia, urinary tract infect ion, sepsis) occurred at low frequency (<1%). A total of 
4% of vedo lizumab -treated subj ects and 3% of placebo -treated subjects experienced an 
infusio n-related reacti on. In C13006 and C13007, 10% of subjects were posit ive for 
antivedo lizumab ant ibodies (AVA) [ADDRESS_1262036] an increased risk for malignancy wit h 
vedo lizumab treatment. 
A similar safet y profile was observed in subjects who received vedo lizumab IV Q4W or Q8W. 
Overall, the safet y profile fo llowing lo ng-term treatm ent wi th vedolizumab in C13008, a 
long-term safet y study , is consistent with safet y in the completed studies. No cases of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML) have been ident ified to date in the clinical or 
postm arket ing setting.

Vedolizumab PK is described by a 2 -compartment model with para llel linear and nonlinear 
eliminat ion. Using reference covariate values, the linear eliminat ion half-life o f vedo lizumab is 
25.5 days; linear clearance (CL L) is 0.159 L/day  for UC and 0.155 L/day  for CD; central  
compartment volume of distribution (V c) is 3 .19 L; and peripheral co mpartment vol ume of  
distribut ion is 1.[ADDRESS_1262037] been ident ified as 
potenti al clinically important predictors of vedolizumab CL L[26]. 
As higher therapeutic mAb concentrations have been associated with greater efficacy in pat ients 
with UC or CD, a bet ter understanding of the determinants of vedo lizumab clearance may help to 
optimize dosing [
27].
4.[ADDRESS_1262038] a 
personalized treatm ent approach. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the observed concentratio n 
at the end of a dosing interval (C trough) with dosing ti tration to achieve a prespecified therapeut ic 
range, i sone m odali ty that is increasingly emplo yed to enhance UC patient care [
28]. 
Approximately 1/3 of pat ients fail to respond to induction therapy of TNF -α antagoni sts and up to 
60% experience secondary  loss of response. Differences in drug clearance may be an important 
explanat ion for this observat ion. Patients who lose response are typi[INVESTIGATOR_900055], switching to another agent with the same mechanism o f action, or m oving to 
an agent with a different mechanism o f action. Wit h a limited number of therapeut ic options 
available, healt h care providers are optimizing the use of TNF -α antago nists by [CONTACT_900065] [
27,29] . 
Several factors are associated with accelerated clearance of mo nocl
onal antibodi es, including the 
presence of anti -drug ant ibodies, sex, body size, conco mitant immunosuppressant use, IBD ty pe, 
albumin concentration, and degree of systemic inflammat ion [26]. Furthermore, a consistent 
relationship between efficacy  and exposure, in distinct ion to drug dose, has been observed for 
many of thes e agents; that is, higher C trough values are associated with greater efficacy [
30]. 
Recent studi es suggest a correlation between serum  drug concentrati ons and clinical outcomes 
such as clinical and endoscopic remissio n [
27]. Very few prospective clinical studies that compare 
the optimal therapeut ic ranges and clinical outcomes for biologic therapi [INVESTIGATOR_900056] 
(ie,TNF -α antagoni sts) have been conducted to date. The Trough Level Adap ted Infliximab 
Treatment trial (TAXIT) was a randomized controlled trial of 251 UC and CD pat ients that dose 
optimized all pat ients into a therapeutic window and then compared pat ients dosed by  [CONTACT_900066] i nfliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy .
After dose optimizat ion, continued concentration -based dosing was not superior to clinically based 
dosing for achieving remissio n after 1 year, but was associated with fewer flares during the course 
of treatm ent [
29]. 
A similar understanding of the optimal therapeut ic target range for vedolizumab IV is particularly 
important given its mechanism of action. Data for multiple endpo ints from the vedo lizumab IV UC 
clinical studies [
25,31] were analyzed to gain insight into the exposure -response relationships for

Vedolizumab IV
Study No. Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1262039] endoscopic subscores were below the overall Week 6 median Ctrough levels in C13006
[26,32] . From this analysis at Week 6 (end of induction), patients w ith an endoscopic subscore of 
3had on average 25% higher CL L, than pat ients with an endoscopic subscore of 0 [26]. 
In the C13006 UC study , 47% of subjects achieved clinical response at Week 6 [
25]. Of those 
subjects who failed to respond, 89% had vedo lizumab C trough lev
els <40 µg/mL, which may part ly 
be attributed to high drug clearance. Clearance is the most important PK parameter for 
determinat ion of dose. Individuals with vedo lizumab clearance >0.14 L/day  were associ ated wi th 
diminished efficacy  outcom es. Im proved out comes may  be seen by [CONTACT_900067]. Given the clearance cut -point of 
0.14 L/day  and the approved vedo lizumab IV dosing regimen, a target steady state vedolizumab 
trough concentration >12.7 µg/mL was calculated. Simulations with the published populat ion PK 
model were conducted to evaluate strategies to (1) ident ify high clearance individuals, and 
(2)recommend dose adjust ments necessary to achieve the steady -state target, both based on Week 
5 plasma vedo lizumab concentrations in this study.
Addit ional support for this hypothesis is provided by  [CONTACT_304957] a small , prospective study  
with vedolizumab IV conducted in IBD patients (N=34) who failed [ADDRESS_1262040] 
therapy  [33]. Resul tsfrom this study  support the val ue of an early assessment of vedolizumab

An unmet need exists for patients who do not respond to UC therapy . Fift y-three percent of 
subjects did not achieve clinical response at Week [ADDRESS_1262046] high vedo lizumab clearance, based 
on a predefined Week 5 serum  vedolizumab concentrati on thresho ld (<50 µg/mL ).In addit ion, if 
Ctrough levels exceed the exposure lim it of 90 µg/mL, protocol instructions are designed to decrease 
subsequent doses and decrease exposure.
Overall, vedo lizumab IV has been well tolerated in clinical studies and the benefit -risk profile is

ident ified as having high vedo lizumab clearance, based on a predefined Week 5 serum 
vedo lizumab concentration thresho ld (<50 µg/mL). This study  will evaluate the p otenti al benefi t 
of vedo lizumab IV dose optimizat ion on clinical outcomes based on derived target Ctrough levels . 
Vedolizumab doses ranging fro m 0.2 to 10 mg/kg and [ADDRESS_1262061] exposures fo llowing 
multiple dose administration of vedo lizumab IV were observed in the phase 2 study  C13002 in 
subjects wi th UC [31]. In C13002, individual C trough levels ranged fro m 13.4 to 155 µg/mL at 
Day 85 fo llowing administration of 10 mg/kg vedo lizumab IV at Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 12; the highest 
exposure was observed in a [ADDRESS_1262062] weighing who received 900 mg of vedo lizumab IV for 
each infusio n. Safet y in this study  was consistent with the overall safet y profile observed wit h 
vedo lizumab IV. The median C trough concentrati on in this phase 2 study was 90 μg/mL, which was 
selected as the safe e xposure limit for the current study . 
Phase 2 and 3 data from the vedo
lizumab clinical studies contributed to the populat ion PK model 
that was used to simulate the estimated C trough following administration of vedo lizumab IV 600 mg 
Q4W (the maximum dose to be administered in this study ) in subjects wi th high cl earance [26]. 
Based on simulat ions of Week 5 plasma vedo lizumab concentrations, strategies to 1) ident ify hig h 
clearance subjects (eg, clearance >0.14 L/day ), and 2) recommend dose adjust ments were 
explored. Results revealed that a Week 5 plasma vedolizumab concentration <50 µg/mL cut point 
woul d capture m ost of  the hi gh-clearance subjects while minimizing the fract ion of 
lower-clearance subjects who might be misclassified. A dosing strategy was selected that would 
resul t in a higher proportion of subjects achieving C trough concentrati ons >12.7 µg/m L at 
steady -state and be within the range of concentrations found to be safe in clinical studies, ensuring 
virtually no subjects would be expected to exceed the max imum trough concentration of 
90µg/mL. The fo llowing 2 regimens were selected to begin at Week 6 based on Week 5 
vedo lizumab concentrations: Regimen A for subjects with Week 5 vedo lizumab concentration of 
≥30 µg/mL but <50 µg/mL, and Regi men B for subjects with Week 5 vedolizumab concentrations 
of <30 µg/mL.
The approved dosing regimen of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and then Q8W 
thereafter (through Week 22) will be tested in the Standard Dosing Arm. For all subjects 
rando mized to the Dose Optimized Arm, vedo lizumab IV 600 mg at Week 6 fo llowed by [CONTACT_318217] 
300 m g Q4W or 600 m g Q4W (through Week 26) will be tested. The assessment of target 
concentrations and high clearance was based on phase 3 GEMINI data [
25], whi ch identified a 
maximum dose of [ADDRESS_1262063] clearance individuals evidenced by a Week 5 seru m vedo lizumab concentration 
<30μg/mL. Subjects with Week 5 serum vedo lizumab concentrations above or equal to 30 μg/mL 
and below 50 μg/mL will receive maintenance doses of 300 mg Q4W in order to achieve the steady 
state serum vedo lizumab target conc entrati on.
The primary  endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving mucosal healing (defined as May o 
endoscopi c subscore ≤1point) at Week 30. Assessment at Week 30, or 6 months from the Week 6 
rando mizat ion, was selected as it's a real -world time poin t for mucosal  healing (Ul cerat ive Co litis

the study .
The Week 6 time point for assigning dosin g regimens was selected based upon the correlat ion of 
Ctrough concentrati ons at Week 6 with clinical remission status at Week 14 [
25]. The Week 14 time 
point, whi ch is an established efficacy  evaluat ion time point for vedo lizumab, was designed as a 
check to allow for dose reduction from the init ial dosing regimen in the event that the Week 13 
serum  vedolizumab concentration exceeded 90 μg/mL since approximately 75% of the 
steady -state exposure will be achieved at that time.
FcRn rec eptor gene polymorphisms may
 impact vedolizumab drug clearance and, as a result, 
influence clinical outcomes. Pharmacogeno mic analysis may be conducted to invest igate the

Week 6 Dose Assignments for Dose Optimization Arm (b) 
At Week 6, all subjects randomized to the Dose Optimization Arm will be assigned to either Regimen A or 
Regimen B (below) based on the subject’s Week 5 serum vedolizumab concentration. Subjects with serum 
vedolizumab concentration <50 µg/mL and ≥30 µg/mL will be assigned to Regim en A, and subjects with 
serum vedolizumab concentration <30 µg/mL will be assigned to Regimen B:
Regimen A: Vedolizumab IV 600 mg (Week 6) and 300 mg Q4W (Weeks 10, 14, 18, 22, 26), OR
Regimen B: Vedolizumab IV 600 mg (Week 6) and 600 mg Q4W (Weeks 10, 14, 18, 22, 26)
Week 14: Dose Optimization Arm Safety Checkpoint
At Week [ADDRESS_1262093]’s most recent 
preceding serum vedolizumab is >90 µg/mL (eg, Week 13 PK sampling prior to Week 14 dosing). I n the 
event that steady -state C trough levels exceed safety exposure limits of 90 µg/mL, the next dose will be withheld 
and another PK sample will be taken 1 week prior to the next scheduled dose. If at the next scheduled dose the 
Ctrough is still >90 µg/mL , the next dose will be similarly held and the PK repeated 1 week prior to the next 
scheduled dose. Once C trough is ≤90 µg/mL, the subject will move to the next lowest dose. For example:
If subject was on [ADDRESS_1262094] was moved from 600 mg Q4W to 300 mg Q4W and subsequent C trough >90 µg/mL, then subject 
goes to next lowest dose (ie, 300 mg Q8W).
(a) Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1262095] vedolizumab IV therapy. 
(b) Sites will use IRT to obtain the dose to be administered based on Week [ADDRESS_1262096] according 
to the study  protocol .
All cases of overdose (with or without associated A Es) will be documented on an Overdose page 
of the eCRF, in order to capture this important safety  information consistent ly in the database. 
Cases of overdose without manifested signs or symptoms are not considered AEs. AEs associated

Vital signs will  include body  temperature, respi [INVESTIGATOR_2842], blood pressure, and pulse (bpm) and 
will be co llected at every visit.
On dosing days, vital signs are taken predose.
9.1.[ADDRESS_1262110] diary  entries, physician’s 
global assessment, and flexible sigmoidoscopy . A complete May o score will  be obtained at 
Screening to determine eligibilit y along with confirm ation of disease locat ion. The subject must 
have evidence of UC proximal to the rectum ( ≥15 cm  of involved colon) prior to start of 
vedo lizumab IV dosing. 
Results obtained during Screening will be the Baseline complete Mayo score. Sigmo idoscopy  will 
be done during Screening and Week 30/Early  Terminati on (ET) Visit, and complete May o score 
will be calculated for these visit s. The invest igator or designee will record the com plete May o 
score in the subject’s source documents, with the endoscopic component subscore being provided 
by [CONTACT_900076]. For Week 30, the invest igator or designee will use the loca l 
endoscopi c com ponent subscore to calcula te the complete May o score. Seven days of completed 
diary data pri or to each study  visit is requi red for May o calculati on (not including the day  before 
the preparation day, the day  of, and the day  after the flexible sigmo idoscopy  is perform ed).
A partial M ayo score will be derived for the visits at which endoscopy will not be performed and as 
listed in Schedule o f Study  Procedures ( Appendix A).These sco res will be used to determine 
clinical response during the study .
The May o endoscopi c subscore determinat ion of mucosal healing (as defined in Sect ion 3.5) will

Diary entries will  be m ade daily  by [CONTACT_260229] o score cal culat ion. During 
Screening, subjects will be instructed on how to appropriately co mplete the d aily diary . The 
symptoms of UC must be recorded throughout the study, including the screening period. En tries 
shoul d be reviewed and mo nitored by  [CONTACT_39802].
Because the flexible sigmo idoscopy  preparati on and the procedure itself can interfere with th e 
assessment of other clinical parameters, diary  entries used to cal culate the com plete May o score 
shoul d not be taken from  the day  before (the preparati on day ), the day  of, and the day  after the 
flexible sigmo idoscopy  is performed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Flexible Sigmoidoscopy and Biopsy
Flexible sigmo idoscopy  will be performed at Screening (within [ADDRESS_1262111] dose) and Week 30 
(or ET Visit), and the results will be used for calculat ion of the complete May o score for these 
visits. For subjects without cancer surveillance en doscopy  performed in the last 12 months, the 
investigator can perform a co lonoscopy  at Screening. All endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Screening and Week 30) 
will be centrally  read. For Week 30, the invest igator or designee will use the local endoscopic 
component subscore to calculate the complete May o score. On the days sigmoidoscopy  is done, 
biopsy samples will be collected from all subjects to possibly evaluate changes in histology . 
During screening endoscopic evaluat ion, 2 biopsies should be taken from the rectum, 2 fro m the 
sigmoid, and 2 from the descending col on (if eval uated) taken from the most severely  affected 
areas. If the descending is evaluated and found to be normal, 2 biopsies should also be taken

methods include hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . A postm enopausal  state i s defined as 
no menses for 12 months without an alternat ive medical cause. A high FSH level in the 
postm enopausal range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in 
younger wom en (eg, those <45 y ear ol d) or wom en who are not using hormonal contraception or

Deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) forms the basis for the genes that make the body  produce proteins 
such as enzymes, drug transporters or drug targets, and may be evaluated for the genet ic 
contribution how the drug is broken down, or how the drug affects the body . This is called a 
“Pharmacogeno mics resea rch study .” Specific purposes of this study  include:
Identifying genet ic reasons why certain people respond differently to vedolizumab.
Finding out more informat ion about how vedolizumab works.
Generat ing informat ion needed for research, development, and r egulatory  approval  of tests to 
predi ct response to vedolizumab.
Ident ifying variations in genes related to the bio logical target of vedo lizumab.
This information may be used, for example, to develop a better understanding of the safet y and 
efficacy  of vedo lizumab and other study drugs, to increase understanding of the disease/condit ion 
being studied, and for improving the efficiency , desi gn and study  methods of  future research 
studi es.
Two whole blood samples (3 mL per sample) for DNA iso lation will be collected before dosing on 
Day [ADDRESS_1262134] astic potassium ethylenediamine -tetraaceti c acid (K 2EDTA) 
spray -coated tubes, and stored under frozen condit ions. A portion of the DNA sample will be used 
to explore FcRn polymorphisms and its asso ciation with drug cl earance. 
If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if iso lation of DNA fro m the fir st 
sample was not successful or possible. In addit ion, if the DNA sample was not collected at the 
designated time po int described in the protocol , it can be collected at a l ater time point.
Two whole blood samples (2.5 mL per sample) will be collected before dosing on Day 1 for 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) pharmacogeno mic analysis fro m each subject in the study, into a PaxGene 
tube, and stored under frozen condit ions.
Each pharmacogeno mic sample for a study subject should be ident ifiable on the requisit ion form 
with an [ADDRESS_1262135] ID (the [ADDRESS_1262136] i dentificat ion number).
The samples will be stored f or no l onger than 15 years after complet ion of the vedo lizumab study  
and/or until the drug development of vedo lizumab is no longer act ively pursued by [CONTACT_45326]. No samples will be stored for longer than permitted by  [CONTACT_36611] l aw an d 
samples will be destroyed upon notificat ion from [COMPANY_005]. “Stored samples” are defined as samples 
that are coded (the samples are stripped of all personal identifying information but a key  links the 
samples to the clinical data collected fro m the sampl e donor) and are used in the analysis of study 
drug or related drugs.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal

not it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1262157] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)

Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a

Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG paramete rs are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y

If abnormal labora tory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing con ditions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening

severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Basel ine (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, in vestigators shoul d ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion,the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).

resul ting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion

Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or physician.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.

Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study  medicat ion was stopped for a reason other than the parti cular AE eg, 
the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already  
stopped before the onset of the AE.
Dose Interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved –Subject returned t o first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal ra nge or to Baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ symptoms or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resol ved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death. 
Unknown –the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1670]’s participation in the study .
10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reportin g of AEs
[IP_ADDRESS] PTE and AE Collection Period
Start of PTE collect ion:
Collect ion of PTEs will co mmence from the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study  and cont inue until the subject is first administered study medicat ion 
(Day 1) or until screen failure before Day 1. For subjects who discont inue prior to study 
medicat ion administration, PTEs are collected until the subject discontinues study  parti cipat ion.
Start of AE collection: 
AEs must be collected from the time that the subject is first administered study medicat ion 
(Day 1).

End of AE collection: 
Routine co llection of AEs will cont inue for [ADDRESS_1262162] dose of study  medicat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS] PTE and AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subject ive AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitored until the s ymptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study  procedure, need not to be fo llowed-up for the 
purpo ses of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medicat ion 
or not, m ust be m onitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline o r until there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the 
changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, 
whether or not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The 
following informat ion will be documented for each event:
1.Event term .
2.Start and stop date (and time).
3.Severit y.
4.Invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the causal relat ionship between the event and administration of study 
medicat ion(s) (rel ated or not rel ated) (not completed for PTEs).
5.Invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the causal relat ionship to study  procedure(s), including the details of 
the suspected procedure.
6.Action concerning study  medicat ion (not applicable for PTEs).
7.Outcom e of event.
8.Seriousness.
The IBDQ and patient diary will not be used as a primary  means to collect AEs. However, should 
the invest igator become aware of a potential AE through the informat ion collected with this 
instrum ent, proper follow -up wi th the patient for medical evaluat ion shoul d be undertaken. 
Through this follow -up, if it is determined that an AE not previously reported has been identified, 
norm al reporting requi rements shoul d be applied.

11.0 STUDY- SPECIFIC COMMITTEES
No data safet y monitoring co mmittee will be used in this study.
11.1 PML Independent Adjudication Committee 
A PML Independent Adjudication Co mmittee (IAC) will be inst ituted for this study . The PML 
IAC will consist of a panel of leading PML experts, including a neuro logist, neuroradio logist, and 
a viro logist.
11.1.1 Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) for PML
Natalizumab (TYSABRI), another integrin receptor antagonist, has been associated with PML, a 
rare and often f atal opportuni stic infection o f the central  nervous system . PML is caused by  [CONTACT_39809] (JCV) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_39752] 
[38,39] . Natalizumab is a pan -α4 integrin antagonist that binds to both the α 4β1and α 4β7integrins 
and inhibit s cellular adhesio nto vascular cell adhesion mo lecule -1 (VCAM -1) and MAdCAM -
1 
[40,41] . In contrast, vedolizumab binds to the α 4β7integrin only  [24]and inhibit s adhesio n to 
MAdCAM -1, but not VCAM -1. Al though no cases of PML have been reported in clinical trials 
with vedolizum ab to date, a risk o f PML cannot be ruled out.
To address the theoretical risk o f the development of PML in subjects treated with vedo lizumab 
IV, the sponsor, with input fro m renowned PML experts, has developed a RAMP program. The 
complete descri ption of t he RAMP program, including materials and instructions for its 
implementation and mo nitoring, i s included in the RAMP Study  Manual.
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion ofstudy  drug, if applicable. Subjects are assessed for signs and 
symptoms of PML prior to the administration of each dose of study  drug using a PML subject ive 
symptom  checklist. Subj ects wi th a posi tive PML subjective symptom checklist at any  time after 
enrollment in a vedo lizumab IV clinical study  will be evaluated according to a prespecified 
algorithm (the PML Case Evaluation Algorithm). The next dose of study drug will be held unt il the 
evaluat ion is co mplete and results are available. Subsequent doses of study  drug will  be 
administered only  if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively  excl uded, as described in the RAMP 
algorithm. An IAC has been established as part of the RAMP program to review new neuro logical 
signs and symptoms potentially  consistent wi th PML, and will provide input regarding subject 
evaluat ion and m anagement as defined in the IAC charter. 
To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subjects will be trained to report specific neurological signs and symptoms without 
delay. Educati onal materi als for teaching site personnel and subjects about PML and the RAMP 
procedures will be distributed to all sites and are included in the study  manual . Form al teaching 
and training will be perf ormed for site personnel pri or to the start of the study . Subjects will 
receive training and educat ional materials prior to receiving treatment. The informed consent form 
will contain specific informat ion on the hy potheti cal risk of PML. Any documented cas e of PML 
will be reported as an SAE, regardless of whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149323].

Change 12:Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] Corticosteroid Taper, co-administration maximum dose and 
budesonide taper were added.
The primary  change occurs in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Corticosteroid Taper .
Initial 
wording:Oral corti costeroi d taper shoul d be ini tiated by  [CONTACT_10585] 10 and no l ater than Week 14 
according to the fo llowing schedule:
For predni sone doses >10 mg/day (or equivalent), the dose will be reduced at a 
rate of 5 mg/week unt il a 10 mg/day dose is reached.
For predni sone doses ≤10 m g/day (or equivalent) or once a 10 mg/day dose (or 
equivalent) is reached, the dose will be reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week unt il 
discontinuat ion. Fo r subjects who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without 
recurrence of clinical symptoms, corticosteroids could be increased up to, but not 
exceed, the original dose the subject was on at the start of the induct ion phase. In 
such cases, the tapering regimen above will be reinit iated within 2 weeks.
Amended 
wording:The maximum dose of oral prednisone for the treatment of UC that may be 
coadministered with vedolizumab IV is 30 mg/day or 9 mg/day budesonide (or 
equivalent). Oral corticosteroid taper s hould be initiated by [CONTACT_10585] 10 and no later 
than Week 14 according to the fo llowing schedule:
For predni sone doses >10 mg/day (or equivalent), the dose will be reduced at a 
rate of 5 mg/week unt il a 10 mg/day dose is reached.
For predni sone doses ≤10 m g/day (or equivalent) or once a 10 mg/day dose (or 
equivalent) is reached, the dose will be reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week unt il 
discontinuat ion. For subjects who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without 
recurrence of clinical symptoms, corticosteroid s coul d be increased up to, but not 
exceed, the original dose the subject was on at the start of the induct ion phase. In 
such cases, the tapering regimen above will be reinit iated within 2 weeks.
Budesonide should be reduced 3 mg every 2 weeks until discon tinuation.
Rationale for Change: Up to 30 mg/day o f oral corti costeroi ds is considered the standard of 
care; any doses higher than that, indicates a more severe disease progression and unlikely to taper 
the pati ent.

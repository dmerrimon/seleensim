4 Process of change:  
In order to expl ore our logic model assumption that immediate change in program targets (i.e. 
couple relationship skills ) immediately following program  participation leads to longer -term 
outcomes in couple functioning we will examine a path model . See Figure 1.  
5) Do changes immediately following Elevate participation in couple relationship skills  
predict  couple satisfaction  at 6 months , accounting for  baseline ?

baseline?   
   
B. Description of the intended i ntervention and counterfactual condition 
This section provides a brief description of t he intervention being evaluated. 
1. Intervention condition(s)  
Intended Components:  The intervention consists of participation in either the Elevate 
curriculum or the Couples Connecting Mindfully (CCM) curriculum.  The couples education 
interventions are multi- session programs written for delivery to couples in community- based 
educational settings. Each curriculum involves 6- week group -based classes in which couples 
receive content on relationship skills .  
Intended Content: The content of the curricula is focused on key relationship skills and 
information that promotes couple quality and stability (see The National Extension Relationship 
and Marriage Education Model www.nermen.org). These include: self -care, intentionality, 
conflict and stress management, development of intimate knowledge of partner, development of 
a couple identity, caring couple behaviors, and development of supportive social connections.  
Planned Dosage and Implementation Schedule:  Both curricula are explicitly research -
informed and consist of 6 sessions delivered in separate consecutive weekly sessions of 
approximately 2 hours each.  This  implementation schedule was consistent across the 10 
implementation sites.  
Intended Delivery:  Program s are delivered in accessible community -based facilities that 
support a productive learning environment.  Trained facilitators (male/female teams) deliver the 
programs.  
Target Population:  Each program is broadly offered in the 10 different implementation sites 
and are intended to serve couples aged 19 and older in self -defined committed couple 
relationships .  
Education and Training of Staff:  Most facilitators have a background in family services 
and/or education and all have a minimum of a Bachelor’s  degree.  Specifically, 73% of 
facilitators have a bachelor’s degree; 24% have a Master’s degree; and 3% have a doctorate. 
Each facili tator is provided a comprehensive 2- day training on program curriculum by [CONTACT_623621] . Facilitators then complete fidelity checklists following each 
program session to track program components that were implemented each week. C lasses were 
also routinely monitored by [CONTACT_623622]. Ongoing t echnical assistance

[ADDRESS_830366] included sources for employment, housing, child services, health and we ll-
being, education, addiction treatment, legal services, and other multi -need services. The partner 
agencies’ staff was able to update the resource list throughout recruitment. No other programs 
and services are provided to them as part of the intervention study.

[ADDRESS_830367] 2016 and was completed in January 2018. Approximately a month 
before the beginning of programming for each cohort, recruitment across the 10 implementation 
sites began. The implementation sites are: 1) Alabama Cooperative Extension System in Elmore 
County, 2)  Circle of Care, 3) Family Guidance Center, 4) Family Success Center, 5) Hope Place, 
6) IMPACT Family Counseling, 7) Auburn University, 8) Parents and Children Together 
(PACT), 9) Sylacauga Alliance for Family Enhancement (SAFE), and 10) Tuscaloosa’s One 
Place (TOP).  
Recruitment of couples into the impact evaluation occurred through distribution of flyers 
(approved by [CONTACT_623624]) at community agencies, such as 
family resources centers, local churches, libraries, and other settings where community members 
were likely to frequent. Additionally, flyer inform ation was posted online via the AHMREI 
Facebook page and website. 
All adults who indicated they were in a committed couple relationship (married or 
nonmarried) and who expected to attend as a couple if selected for a program group were eligible 
to particip ate in the local impact evaluation study. Anyone under age [ADDRESS_830368] one of the  individuals in the couple completed 
the baseline survey. The evaluation lead conducted the random assignment by [CONTACT_623625]. Couple IDs developed by [CONTACT_623626] -specific SPSS 
files by [CONTACT_623627] . The evaluation staff utilized the SPSS random number generator to 
arbitrari ly code the couples as a 1 (Elevate), 2 (Couples Connecting Mindfully), or 3 (control) in 
order to randomly as sign the study participants. Following completion of random assignment, the 
evaluation staff notified each study participant  via an email with their assignment.  For those in 
the program groups, their email include d times and location of the assigned class.  Each step of 
the random assignement process was implemented by [CONTACT_623628].  
2. Data collection  
The following data collection procedures were approved by [CONTACT_623629] (IRB) that oversees Human Subjects protecti on in research . The 
original approval was provided on August 15, [ADDRESS_830369] 
using the recruitment script. We explained random assignment procedures, reminding couples 
they had a 2 out of 3 chance to be assigned to one of the program groups and a 1 out of 3 chance 
they would be assigned to the control (no program) condition.  We explained they would be 
asked to complete a series of  surveys on the web -based system, Qualtrics, at the following 
times: baseline, immediate post-  program  (8 weeks after baseline) , 6-month follow -up to 
ANALYSIS PLAN FOR HMRF LOCAL IMPACT EVALUATIONS: [ AUBURN UNIVERSITY ] 
 
 
 
7 baseline,  1-year follow -up and 2- year follow up. We explained that participants complete the 
surveys individually rather than as a couple. We offered  the option of filling out these surveys 
through a link provided via email or by [CONTACT_623630]/center to complete on a tablet in 
the rare case that a participant does not have personal access to technology. We also explained 
the participant compensation plan: participants who completed a survey received  $[ADDRESS_830370]- program, 6- month, and 1- year, and $[ADDRESS_830371] information (first name, last 
name, birthdate, address, phone, email) to a staff member/educator in order to generate a 
participant profile in the nFORM system. Enrollment took place both on the phone and  in-
person. Information was provided for ea ch member of the couple, resulting in an individual 
profile , and both a participant and couple ID in the nFORM system  were generated . 
Immediately following  enrollment  in the nFORM system , each participant indicated their 
willingness to participate in the study by [CONTACT_623631] d. 
Two weeks prior to  program start, all study participants who signed and returned an 
informed consent letter were emailed a link to a baseline Qualtrics survey to be completed 
within a week. One week before the start of classes, participants who completed (or who had a 
partner complete) a baseline survey were randomly assigned by [CONTACT_3725]  (block random 
assignment), using a random number generator based on the couple ID (generated upon 
enrollment through nForm)  to either one of the two program groups or to the comparison group.  
Participants in the program groups also w ere asked at  their first clas s to complete the 
nForm surveys (i.e., applicant characteristics and Entrance surveys ). All participants who  
receiv ed programming were asked to complete the nForm  Exit survey at the last class meeting. 
Note:  the data from the Entrance and Exit surveys are  not included in our impact evaluation.  
All impact study participants (program groups and controls) were emailed a link to the 
immediate post -program Qualtrics survey within one week after  the class series ending .  
This survey process was repeated at the six month, one year, and two year  marks after 
baseline survey completion.  Participants were initially contact[CONTACT_623632]. Several prompts and reminders to complete the survey were sent during the “open” 
period.  
The evaluation staff at the central A.U. office t racks data as it is collected and initiate s 
compensation via mailed checks within the week of receiving a  completed survey from a 
participant .  
Efforts to reduce attrition after enrollment:  
Following enrollment in the study, the following engagement strategies were utilized: 
• Weekly emails and/or texts to remind participants of study activities and deadlines, such 
as receipt of the baseline survey and class start dates  for those assigned to program 
groups  
ANALYSIS PLAN FOR HMRF LOCAL IMPACT EVALUATIONS: [ AUBURN UNIVERSITY ] 
 
 
 
8 • Email and/or text throughout the week of survey completion until survey wa s submitted  
• An email and/or text one day prior to class start  for the program groups  
Engagement strategies to retain participants in the study for the 6- month , 1-year, and 
2-year  follow up include:  
a. Birthday card e mailed to participant [ADDRESS_830372] e mailed to participant 1 week prior to anniversary date (anniversary 
date information was collected on the pre -program survey).  
c. Receipt of “save the date” (email, mail, and /or text) 1 week prior to emailing follow -up 
survey links. 
d. Reminder texts and emails during the “open” period for survey completion that included 
offering scheduled appointments for coming to agency to complete on iPad  there.

9 D. Analysis  
1. Outcome measure s 
Primary:  
Couple relationship skills  will be measured using 32 items from the Couple Relationship 
Skills Inventory (CRSI).  This measure was constructed to match the core relationship skills and 
predictors of couple quality emphasized in the HMRE programs provided.  Items are taken from 
several established and validated social science measures assessing commitment and intentionality 
in the relationship, intimate knowledge about partner, sense of friendship and togetherness, caring 
behaviors, conflict management behaviors, and connections to support outside the relationship. 
We have recently conducted validity tests of the factor structure (i.e., confirmatory factor analyses) 
and have evidence of validity and reliability of the full measure for our sample. Response anchors 
range from 1  (Very strongly disagree)  to 7 (Very strongly agree). Composite  scores  will be created 
at the individual level  since they reflect the individual’s level of skills . Higher scores indicate 
greater  couple relationship skills . Cronbach’s al pha for men (α = . 91) and women (α = .92 ) indicate 
excellent  reliability.  
 
Individual mental health will be measured using the SF -12 Mental Component Summary 
score (Sanda, Wei, & Litwin, 2002) . Items are asked on differing scales ( e.g., 1 to 3 or 1 to 5) w ith 
different anchor responses (e.g., all of the time to none of the time, or not at all to extremely). 
Following the SF -[ADDRESS_830375] standardized, then summed, and 
standardized further by [CONTACT_1583] 60.[ZIP_CODE], per the SF -12 scoring instructions . Higher scores indicate 
better individual mental health. 
 
Relationship satisfaction  will be measured using an abbreviated version of the Couple 
Satisfaction  Index ( Funk & Rogge , 2007)  utilized in previously published studies.  The 3 items 
are: “I have a warm and comfortable relationship with my partner ,” “How rewarding is your 
relationship with your partner? ,” and “ In general, how satisfied are you with your relationship? ”  
Response anchors range from 0 (Not at all)  to 5 (Completely ). Composite  scores  will be created 
based on responses from each member of the couple individually and from both members of the 
couple  combined to represent a couple level variable .  Higher scores indicate higher relationship 
satisfaction . Cronba ch’s alpha for men (α = .85 ) and women (α = .89) indicate good reliability.

2. Data preparation  
Survey responses for each cohort across each time point w ill be  downloaded from Qualtrics  
into separate SPSS databases. These databases w ill be  merged based on participant individual ID 
in order to create a master dataset with survey responses from each of the five cohorts across 
each of the five time points. Basic descriptives w ill be  run on all variables of interes t to assess 
for outliers or impossible scores on each scale.  
Furthermore, consistency in demographic data w ill be  assessed across participants and 
timepoints. E valuation staff will use  a master code list containing participant IDs and 
demographic data and nFORM to verify accuracy in demographic data across parti cipants and 
timepoints. Responses that are obvious keystroke errors of respondents based on master code list 
information and inconsistency with other timepoint reports will be co rrected .  We will also 
assess couple demographics reported between dyads  for agreement .  If a couple disagrees on 
marital status (i.e., one reports married and one reports nonmarried), we will defer to the 
nonmarried report.  
Data will be assessed for patterns of missingness using a thorough plan that explores percent 
of missingness by [CONTACT_11164], by [CONTACT_103366], and by [CONTACT_225129]. We will explore at each 
timepoint whether those missing data within treatment and control groups differ systematically 
from those who do respond in order to determine whether there is a risk of generalizability bias.  
CONSORT  diagram s will clearly describe the number  of couples who consented to be in the 
study, who complete the baseline assessment, who were randomly  assigned to the program and 
control groups , and who responded to the immediate post -program and each follow -up survey.   
 
Another table will be completed to illustrate the sample characteristics of the groups, as well 
as the means and standard deviations of the measures of  interest, at baseline and at follow -up 
points.  Statistical tests will be conducted (t- tests for continuous variables and chi square 
difference tests for categorical variables) to determine whether there are differences between 
respondents in the control group and respondents in the program group. Additionally, the 
Hedge’s g effect size for group differences will be calculated based on the analytic sample.  
 
ANALYSIS PLAN FOR HMRF LOCAL IMPACT EVALUATIONS: [ AUBURN UNIVERSITY ] 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_830377] statistical tests of between -
group differences. Hedge’s g effect size for group differences will be calculated. Patterns of 
missingness between treatment groups also will be assessed in order to determine whether there 
is a risk of causal validity bias, which results from systematic differences between responders in 
the treatment and control groups.   
 
After assessing overall and differential attrition,  we will examine patterns of missingness by 
[CONTACT_623633]. Our plan includes s everal approaches to  addressing missingness , depending on the 
findings from the initial examination of missingness . If it is determined that we have a very low  
rate of missing values , there are no systematic differences between respondents and 
nonrespondents  within and between groups , and loss of those cases would not affect power in 
our planned analyses, cases with missing valu es will be deleted in listwise fashion . Additionally, 
to address item nonresponse and to create scale scores, mean imputation methods will be used. 
Specifically, when an individual participant has responded to 80% of the items that make up the 
scale, they will be retained for the analyses and  the mean of the items will be imputed . This will 
be done separately for treat ment and control group member s.  
 
3. Analytic sample  
The analytic sample will differ based on the research question because response rates ar e 
different at immediate post- program and at 6- month follow -up.  T he current numbers presented 
in the CONSORT diagram illustrates the number of respondents at each time point who 
completed the survey (i.e., prior to imputation) . We anticipate using the procedures described in 
the previous section for addressing missing data to maximize the retention of cases and for 
ensuring valid comparability of the treatment and control groups; however, because we are using 
mean imputation for those who respond to 80%  or more of the measure, these numbers may 
change slightly based on the outcome of interest. Attendance at the program for those assigned to 
the program condition is not a condition of inclusion in the analytic sample (see explanation 
below for the Intent to Treat design).   
For primary research questions #1 & #2 we will utilize 753 couple data sets over 2 time 
points (baseline and immediate post -program). Specifically, [ADDRESS_830378] -program survey. For primary research 
questions  #3-6 we will utilize 671 couple data sets over 3 time points (baseline, immediate post-
program, and 6 -month follow -up). Specif ically, 221 couples randomly assigned to Elevate, 231 
couples randomly assigned to CCM, and 219 couples randomly assigned to the control condition 
responded at the 6 -month follow -up. 
Assessment of baseline equivalence 
Differences among groups on baseline demographics (e. g., race, age, income, marital status, 
parent status, and education level ) and baseline levels of the outcomes of interest w ill be  assessed 
using independent t -tests for continuous variables and crosstabs with chi -squares for categorical 
variables  wherein statistical significance in differences is  determined at p < .05.  Additionally, 
the Hedge’s g effect size for group differences will be calculated based on the analytic sample.  
These tests of difference will be completed with non -imputed data.  
ANALYSIS PLAN FOR HMRF LOCAL IMPACT EVALUATIONS: [ AUBURN UNIVERSITY ] 
 
 
 
12 Furthermore, t here was no condition crossover .  That is , no control respondents participated 
in the HMRE program during the study period. Although not necessarily considered cross -over 
or contamination of services, 10% of control respondents did seek and/or receive services that 
are always available in the community  at the immediate post- program survey, 15% at the 6-
month follow -up, and 18% at the 1- year follow -up. Because case management is offered to all 
HMRE program participants, involvement in community services was higher for those randomly 
assigned to a program group. Specifically, 34% of program participants sought or received 
services available in the community immediately following  the program, 36% at the 6- month 
follow -up, and 37% at the 1- year follow -up. This information was gathered from questions on 
the Qualtrics surveys administered by [CONTACT_623634]. Regardless  of whether other services were accessed during the study 
period, all control respondents will be included in the control group for analyses to maintain an 
intent to treat model for analyses.   
4. Analytic approach  
 We will use an “Intent to Treat” (ITT) approach , which is the most rigorous approach to 
evaluation and yields the most reliable efficacy results for testing a program in a “real world” 
setting (OPRE, 2010; Weiss & Jacobs, 2008; Wood et al., 2014). Group com parisons are based on 
assignment to one of the three possible groups, rather than completion. All [ADDRESS_830379] (or treatment effect) of progr am participation.  
Questions [ADDRESS_830380] on immediate change (approximately 6 
weeks after baseline) in couple relationship skills for Elevate and for  CCM , the primary  areas of 
skills -training  for the intervention.  We will utilize multi- level modeling to assess differences 
between groups at the  immediate  post-program timepoint. With this method, we can account for 
baseline levels of the skills and account for the nesting of the individual within the couple. To test 
for program impact at the 6- month mark of the other two primary outcomes (questions 3- 6) we 
will employ recommended methods for randomized trials. Although most studies of C ouple 
Relationship Education using comparison groups and included in meta -analyses have used 
repeated measures analysis of covariance to test for treatment effects , suggestions are that growth 
curve modeling as a variant of mixed- effects models (or rand om effects, random -regression) is a 
more powerful techni que than the repeated -measures analysis  of covariance ( e.g., Schultz, Cown 
& Cown, 2006; Gueor guieva & Krystal, 2004; Amato, 2014) . The results of multilevel Growth 
Curve M odel can provide information on differences at timepoints between groups, as well as the 
program impact on rates of change.  We will model these statistical analyses with a Bayesian 
approach in Stan.  
 
 We will use  SPSS and Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998- 2014), and the COMPLEX 
specification, which corrects for the non -independence of cases by [CONTACT_623635]/site ID. Group differences across the 2  groups (i.e., one of the two program groups and the 
contr ol group) will be tested by [CONTACT_623636] -square difference 
test to determine if variant and invariant models are significantly different. Findings are considered 
statistically significant based on p < .05, two -tailed tes t. Cohen’s effect size d will be calculated to 
evaluate effect size, .10 = small, .25 = medium, .40 = large (Cohen, 1988).  
 
 Sensitivity analyses will include testing alternative methods/approaches to ensure the 
robustness of the results and the appropria teness of the analytic approach taken. In couple datasets

Background, Rationale and Context 
 
Chronic Pain After Surgery 
 Primary indications for major joint surgery include limited joint function and pain.  
Although joint replacement or repair surgery is usually remarkably effective, in some cases pain 
and function are worse or not improved after surgery.  Chronic pain after some surgical 
procedures, e.g., phantom limb pain after extremity amputation, has been long recognized, but 
more recent investigations suggest that chronic pain after physical injury including that of major 
surgery is not uncommon.  The purpose of this study is to provide preliminary data for a 
Program Project Grant to the National Institutes of Health to examine specific hypotheses 
regarding identifying patients at risk for chronic pain after surgery and probing mechanisms 
which may be manipulated to decrease this risk. 
 Chronic pain after surgery is typi[INVESTIGATOR_679964].  Although there is some disagreement regarding the time 
normal healing is required, most investigators consider pain beyond [ADDRESS_920062] wall pain 4 
years later compared with those without pain at 2 months (1). 
 The incidence of chronic pain after surgery ranges from 10-50% (2).  After breast 
surgery for cancer, nearly half of those with chronic chest wall pain after surgery rate it as 
moderate to severe and seek treatment for it (3).  Given that there are nearly [ADDRESS_920063] which amplify pain after 
peripheral trauma are depending on descending facilitation pathways. 
Protocol version: 7/23/[ADDRESS_920064] is 
regulated and by [CONTACT_679969]. 
 Descending inhibition of pain can be temporarily engaged in normal humans by [CONTACT_2931] 
a noxious stimulus.  This concept of ‘pain inhibiting pain’ is most easily demonstrated by [CONTACT_1299] 
a foot in a mildly noxious cold water bath and testing for pain perception on another extremity 
(4).  The noxious stimulus applied to the foot results in reduction in pain perceived by [CONTACT_679970].  In humans this effect is blocked by [CONTACT_161187], indicating a 
role for endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (5).  In animals, this effect is blocked by [CONTACT_679971][INVESTIGATOR_659368] a noradrenergic receptor antagonist, indicating 
engagement of descending noradrenergic inhibition. 
 There is wide inter-individual variability in the degree to which pain inhibits pain using 
this experimental method.  Since we believe that activating descending inhibition is essential to 
normal recovery of pain after surgery, it is not surprising that the degree to which this system 
can be demonstrated experimentally using this pain-inhibits-pain test correlates strongly with the 
risk of chronic pain after surgery (6). 
 
Stress and reward 
 In addition to surgical factors (specific procedure and likelihood of nerve injury) and 
biologic factors (including ability to engage descending modulation), several psychosocial 
factors are associated with an increased risk of chronic pain after surgery.  Especially prominent 
and consistent factors associated with increased risk are pre-existing depression, anxiety, fear 
of pain, and catastrophizing.  Our central hypothesis is that these cognitive aspects reflect brain 
connectivity and patterns of activity which gate pain perception.  Several lines of converging 
evidence indicate important roles for medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and basal ganglia in 
processing noxious stimuli within the overall context of the internal and external environment.   
 This subconscious processing can significantly alter pain processing and the normal 
resolution of pain after injury.  For example, we recently observed a remarkably low incidence of 
chronic pain after childbirth, including cesarean delivery.  Similarly, in animals we showed that 
the immediate post-delivery period is associated with protection from chronic pain from 
peripheral nerve injury and that this protection was lost when oxytocin receptors in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_679965].  Centrally released oxytocin has long been known to 
enhance social interactions, bonding, and trust, while reducing fear and anxiety.  In addition, we 
propose that individuals or populations, such as new mothers, with increased oxytocin signaling 
are protected from chronic pain after physical injury.  Initial studies in our laboratory indicate that 
oxytocin does this by [CONTACT_679972]. 
 In contrast to reduced pain responses and positive psycho-social engagement 
encouraged by [CONTACT_300854], high levels of psycho-social stress produce nearly opposite effects.  As 
such, a model of high stress in rodents induced by [CONTACT_679973], exaggerated responses to noxious stimuli, and evidence of plasticity associated with 
chronic pain (7).  Within the laboratory studies of our Program Project Grant application will be 
manipulation of environmental and neurohormonal factors to understand the link between higher 
Protocol version: 7/23/[ADDRESS_920065] Grant application for the October, 2011 deadline and 
the purpose of this IRB application is to acquire preliminary data to demonstrate feasibility and 
allow an accurate power analysis for the size of the proposed study within that grant application. 
  
 
Objectives  
The objectives of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_679966]:  
1) To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting this protocol in this clinical population. The 
execution of this study will allow us to identify expected enrollment rates, patient  drop-out rates, 
and other threats to the accurate assessment of the course of pain after major joint surgery. 
 
2) To estimate the individual variability in pain trajectories over time and to obtain effect size 
estimates for factors that predict pain trajectory. 
 
3) To demonstrate feasibility of providing a pre-surgical teaching intervention in this clinical 
population.  
 
 
Methods and Measures 
 
Design  
The proposed study is a prospective longitudinal observational study. Patients who are 
undergoing elective orthopedic surgery: unicompartmental knee replacement, a total knee 
replacement or total hip replacement will be approached and asked to provide consent to 
participate in [ADDRESS_920066] (i.e., no treatment algorithms will be altered for this study), 
but will complete diaries and survey instruments at numerous intervals.  
 
Setting  
 The study will be conducted on patients scheduled for major joint orthopedic surgery at 
Wake Forest University Health Sciences WFUHS.  Informed consent and p re-surgical surveys 
and CBT Intervention will be performed during the preoperative visit in the Joint Replacement 
Education Conference Room, Preoperative Assessment Clinic or in the Orthopedic Clinic. 
Perioperative care will be provided at the surgical and post-surgical areas of WFUHS. 
 
Subjects selection criteria 
 
 Inclusion Criteria 
Protocol version: 7/23/2012 4 Adult patients scheduled for elective unicompartmental, total knee replacement, or total 
hip replacement surgery, will be included.  Patients will be American Society of 
Anesthesiologists physical status 1, 2, or 3. 
 
 Exclusion Criteria 
We will exclude patients who do not understand English (subjects must be able to read 
English to answer the questionnaires. The questionnaires are not available in multiple 
languages), those who are pregnant or within 1 year of childbirth, those with Raynaud’s 
phenomena of the foot, and those with neuropathy of the lower extremities with loss of 
temperature sensation. 
 
 Sample Size 
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_679967]. As such, the proposed sample size is not intended to provide definitive 
estimates of the hypotheses underlying the research. Instead, we propose to enroll N = 
75 participants to obtain estimates of drop-out rates (this sample size will allow 95% 
confidence interval precision of +- 8.2% assuming a 25% drop-out rate)  as well as initial 
estimates of effect sizes for the predictors in the study. 
   
Interventions and Interactions  
 
 All patients will complete written informed consent.  In addition to review of medical 
history, indication for major joint surgery and current joint function will be recorded.  
 The following questionnaires will be completed: 
 
Daily Stress Inventory (DSI, Brantley et al., 1987; 58 items) 
 
 
Catastrophizing Scale of the Copi[INVESTIGATOR_100779] (CATS, 7 items) 
 
McGill Pain Questionnaire- SF (MPQ-SF) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pre-surgical Intervention: 
 After completion of baseline questionnaires (MPQ-SF, DSI, CATS) the Brief CBT 
Intervention will be viewed by [CONTACT_423]. Upon completion of the presentation, the CATS 
questionnaire will be administered again.  The subject will receive a packet containing “The 
Power of the Mind,” they will be asked to read this information and complete the exercise at the 
end of the packet.  The study staff will call the subject one week after the initial meeting and ask 
if they have read the packet and will also have the subject to complete the CATS questionnaire 
again. A postage paid, addressed envelope will be provided for the subject to return the 
questionnaires to the study team. The questionnaires will be de-identified and only contain 
subject initials and study identification number. 
Protocol version: 7/23/[ADDRESS_920067] will be given a notebook with paper questionnaires and instructions on how 
to complete the questionnaires per the schedule below .   All participants will complete the 
assessments in a sequence using one of several methods: 
A. Inpatient evaluation (surgery to discharge): Nursing staff will inquire about the patients pain 
levels using standard of care methods and assessment tools (e.g., numerical rating scale 0 – 
10).   
B. Ecological Momentary assessment (discharge to day 14): The subject will complete the 
questionnaires in the morning and in the evening. 
C. Once daily (day 15 to day 28): The patient is instructed to complete a diary entry at the end 
of their day, just prior to going to sleep. 
D. Once weekly (day 29 to day 85): The patient will be called at their home and participate in a 
brief interview. 
E. Once monthly (day 86 to day 168): The patient will be called at their home and participate in 
a brief interview once each month. 
Each of the assessments will only require about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.  At each of the at 
home assessments the McGill Pain Questionnaire-SF will be administered. 
In addition, information from the postoperative care from the orthopedic surgery division will be 
recorded, including range of joint motion and functional limitations, if any, at the times of routine 
postoperative clinic visits.

Outcome Measure(s) 
 The primary outcome measure for this study is self-reported pain intensity. To obtain 
estimates of pain intensity, we will use the McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form (MPQ). This 
instrument has been extensively used to assess pain in a wide variety of settings, and is 
uniquely suited to our present study in that the items can be completed while in a post-operative 
setting as well as a daily diary setting.   
Protocol version: 7/23/[ADDRESS_920069] size estimates and indicators of 
feasibility. As such, the analytical plan is primarily descriptive in nature. Careful attention will be 
given to missing data due to any reason, participant withdrawal, and evidence of corrupted or 
invalid assessments. These threats to data collection will be itemized and descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize the rates and expected proportions (with 95% confidence intervals) of 
measurements that may be lost due to any reason.  
To estimate individual variability in the trajectory of pain over time (i.e., healing and 
diminishing pain reports), and predictors of that trajectory, hierarchical linear modeling 
(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) will be used.  The application of HLM in individual change data is 
well suited for the examination of post surgery pain.   Briefly, change trajectories are created for 
each participant. Because of the nature of the expect ed change, the trajectories will be  modeled 
using an intercept, slope, and quadratic term.  The intercept is  coded to represent the baseli ne 
level of the pain score (day of surgery).  The slope estimates  the linear change over time and 
represents  the increase or decrease in the variable. Final ly, the quadratic term estimates  the 
acceleration or deceleration over tim e and reflects changes in the rate of change  in pain 
reporting.  
 To assess our specific hypotheses, we will first evaluate the appropriateness of a model 
that consisted of only intercept (starting value), time, and time-squared as first-level predictors.  
This first level model describes individual trajectories (change) across time. This model will be 
evaluated for fit, redundancy, and variability in the parameters and will be reduced to a linear 
change model if conditions indicate.  When a suitable first-level model is developed, and if there 
is significant variation across participants in either the intercept or change parameters, a second 
level model will be specified. The second level model will examine the impact of the 
questionnaires and baseline sensory testing on the trajectories (i.e., linear and quadratic 
components of the first level model). In all cases, the model coefficients and their standard 
errors will be of primary interest to inform out later, definitive study.    
 
 
Risks 
Taking part in this research study may involve subject’s providing information that they consider 
confidential or private.  Efforts, such as coding research records, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_128559], will be made to keep 
research related information safe. 
 
 
Human Subjects Protection  
 
Subject Recruitment Methods 
Patients scheduled for unicompartmental knee,   total knee replacement, or total hip 
replacement surgery at WFUHS will be contact[CONTACT_679974] [ADDRESS_920070] potential participants.   
Protocol version: 7/23/[ADDRESS_920071] will be convened. However, threats to participants’ confidentiality will be minimized using 
the following methods. First, the collected data will be stored on University networked, password 
protected computers. The databases will be created such that only a patient ID number 
identifies participant records, and that ID will be linked to actual patients in a separate file that 
itself is password protected on the PIs computer. The diary information, recorded at the 
participant’s home will not contain any protected health information, and will only be linked to 
the participant through internal database keys.  
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol 
changes will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_46128].

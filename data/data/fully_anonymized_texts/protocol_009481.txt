  Study Synopsis  
 
Title  A Phase 3 Prospective, Randomized, Double -blinded, Placebo -controlled 
Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Rebiotix RBX2660 
(microbiota suspension) for the Prevention of Recurrent Clostridium 
difficile  Infection.  
Investigational 
Product and 
Indication for Use  RBX2660 (microbiota suspension).  RBX2660 is being studied for the 
prevention of recurrent Clostridium difficile  infection (CDI) in 
individuals with prior recurrent Clostridium difficile  infection resolved 
following antibiotic treatment.  
Control Product  Placebo (enema) of normal saline.   
Study Purpose  The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
RBX2660 for the prevention of recurrent CDI in subjects who have had 
prior recurrent Clostridium difficile  infection that was resolved with 
antibiotic treatment.  
Definition of 
Recurrent CDI for Study Entry  The definition of recurrent CDI for study entry is a documented diagnosis 
of: 
1. CDI diarrhea; the passage of three or more unformed/loose stools 
in [ADDRESS_1055810] two consecutive days, that began within 8 weeks after completion of previous CDI treatment;  
2. and at least one positive stool test for the presence of toxigenic 
C. difficile , which must be within 30 days prior to or on the date 
of enrollment (informed consent).   
 
To be considered for enrollment, a subject must have medical record 
documentation of recurrent CDI per the above study definition that includes either:  
a) at least one recurrence after a primary epi[INVESTIGATOR_769426]-of- care oral antibiotic therapy or;  
b) had at least two epi[INVESTIGATOR_769427].  
Definition of CDI 
Diarrhea  The definition of CDI diarrhea for use in enrolled subjects throughout the 
study includes: 
1. The passage of three or more unformed/loose stools (i.e. Bristol Stool Scale type 6 -7) in [ADDRESS_1055811] 
two consecutive days; 
2. and a positive stool test for the presence of C. difficile toxin; 
documented at the time of the diarrhea.

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055812] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 77 
 Objectives  Primary Objective:  To confirm the efficacy of RBX2660 as compared to 
a Placebo in preventing recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_256251] 8 weeks. 
Secondary Objective:  To evaluate the sustained clinical response rate of 
RBX2660 as compared to Placebo after blinded treatment. 
Endpoints  Primary Efficacy Endpoint:   Recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of 
blinded treatment.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint :   Loss of sustained clinical response 
through 6 months after blinded treatment . 
Safety Endpoints:  
1. Number of adverse events per subject  
2. Timing of attributable adverse event post -treatment exposure 
(treatment emergent adverse event TEAE)  
3. Duration of TEAE 
4. Relatedness of TEAE  
5. Severity of TEAE  
6. Causality of TEAE to IP, enema, C difficile  or prior condition  
7. Number of each of the followi ng through [ADDRESS_1055813] blinded 
treatment: death, septic shock, toxic megacolon, colonic 
perforation, emergency colectomy, and ICU admission.  
8. Onset of new chronic conditions relative to blinded treatment 
administration   
Study Design  This is a prospective , multicenter, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -
controlled Phase 3 study to confirm the efficacy and safety of RBX2660 
for the prevention of recurrent CDI.   
Up to 270 subjects may be randomized and treated in this study. Randomization will be at a 2:1 ratio (RBX2660:Placebo); approximately 
180 subjects will be randomized to RBX2660 treatment and 90 subjects 
randomized to Placebo.  Consented subjects who meet all eligibility criteria ( inclusion and exclusion) will be randomized.  Consented 
subjects who do not meet the eligibility  criteria will be considered screen 
failures and will not count towards the total randomized.  Subjects who 
are randomized but exit prior to the administration of the first blinded 
enema may be replaced with additional subjects which could cause overall number of subjects randomized to be greater than the [ADDRESS_1055814] been 
prescribed antibiotics to control recurrent CDI symptoms at the time of 
enrollment per the investigator’s standard of care.  This means patients 
who have already completed their prescribed course of antibiotics to treat 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055815] anot her 
recurrence that is treated with antibiotics .   
Once enrolled (informed consent obtained), in order to be randomized 
and treated :  
1. Subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria;  
2. Antibiotics will have been administered for a minimum of 10 
consecutive days prior to the washout period; 
3. CDI symptoms must be under control leading into the antibiotic washout period.  
Control of CDI symptoms is defined as no longer meeting the 
symptomatic criteria for CDI diarrhea  which is the passage of three or 
more unformed/loose (i.e. Bristol Stool Scale type 6-7) stools in [ADDRESS_1055816] Diary (completed from time 
of enroll ment until day of treatment) must show that symptoms are under 
control the two days prior to the washout period in order for the subject 
to be treated.   
Once screening is completed and all inclusion and exclusion verified, the 
subject can be randomized.  The assigned study treatment will be 
scheduled to consist of a single, blinded study enema according to the randomization assignment.  Study treatment is to be completed as soon as possible, but no more than 14 calendar days following randomization.   
Ultimately, the study treatment needs to be administered within 21 days 
of the Screening visit. A minimum of 24hr to maximum of 72hr antibiotic washout period is required prior to administration of the assigned study treatment.    
In-office study follow-up visits occur at weeks 1, 4 and 8 after 
completing the blinded study treatment.  Telephone assessments for adverse events occur during weeks 2, 3 and 6 after the study enema and at months 3 and 6.  Subjects are required to keep a detailed diary to 
assess for solicited events from the date of enrollment (informed consent) 
to the 1- week follow -up visit.  The diary will be collected and reviewed 
at the baseline visit prior to blinded enema administration. The subject will continue to complete the diary following enema administration and it 
will be collected and reviewed at the [ADDRESS_1055817] receives an

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055818] has 
completed the 6 -month follow-up visit for their study treatment.  This 
includes 6-month follow-up after an unblinded RBX2660 study treatment.  At that time the study will be considered complete.   
Randomized Study 
Dosing  Placebo Arm – Group A  
• Placebo dosing consists of one enema of Placebo given in a 
blinded manner.   
RBX2660 Arm – Group B  
• Active treatment consists of one enema of RBX2660 given in a blinded manner.   
Definition of 
Treatment Success  Treatment success is defined as:  
• The absence of CDI diarrhea for 8 weeks after completing a study treatment.   
Definition of 
Sustained Clinica l 
Response  Sustained Clinical Response is defined as:  
• Treatment success of the presenting CDI recurrence and no new CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_256252] 8 weeks through 6 months after 
completing a study treatment.        
Definition of 
Treatment Failure (CDI recurrence)  Treatment failure (CDI recurrence) is defined as:  
• The presence of CDI diarrhea within [ADDRESS_1055819] safety, including the

 potential for serious adverse events, an additional C. DIFF QUIK CHEK 
COMPLETE® Test will be permitted to be conducted at the site or other 
laboratory known to the site in addition t o sending a sample to the 
central laboratory for testing.   
Management of 
Treatment Failures  Following blinded treatment, subjects meeting the protocol definition of 
treatment failure may be scheduled for administration of an unblinded 
RBX2660 enema within [ADDRESS_1055821] 
Diary for up to 7 days after treatme nt; in -office visits at [ADDRESS_1055822] agree not to take any oral vancomycin, metronidazole, 
fidaxomicin, rifaximin, nitazoxanide, and IVIG through the 8- week 
follow-up assessment unless newly prescribed by a treating investigator during the course of the study as a result of recurrent CDI diagnosis.   
Determination of 
Success/Failure:  
(Investigator and EAC) The site investigator makes the initial determination of success or failure 
based on the pre-defined study definitions.  The site investigator’s assessment will then be provided to the Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) for independent, blinded adjudication of treatment 
success or failure that will be utilized for study analysis and reporting 
purposes.

 Medical Monitor  The Medical Monitor provide s blinded review of serious adverse events 
to assess accuracy of the reporting as related to seriousness and causality , 
and periodic  review of adverse events for trends .  The Medical Monitor’s 
review will be provided to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB ) for analysis purposes and as applicable for the proper 
adjudication of potential study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37660].  
Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB)  The DSMB will review safety data for trends and may be unblinded to 
adjudicate certain adverse events  and for review of both the primary 
efficacy and safety analysis and the final analys is. D etails  regarding 
DSMB responsibilities related to analysis oversight and data reporting 
will be provided in the DSMB Charter.  
Blinding  Subjects, site personnel, the DSMB , EAC  and the Medical Monitor are 
blinded to the randomization assignment.  Blinding will be maintained through the data cutoff for the primary efficacy analysis after which the 
blind may be lifted for the DSMB.  The DSMB may be unblinded to individual assignments earlier as needed to adjudicate certain adverse events.  Individual randomization assignments will not be revealed to the 
subjects, site personnel , EAC  or the Medical Monitor until the study is 
completed.   
Subjects will be randomized to recei ve either RBX2660 or placebo 
through an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) System prior to the blinded study treatment.  Randomization assignment is provided to the 
Rebiotix Operations Department personnel for product preparation and shipment.  The Rebi otix Kit is shipped to the site in a sealed carton that is 
only opened by [CONTACT_769453], out of view of the subject and other site personnel.  While the site IP 
administrator will not have access to the actual randomization 
assignment, it may be possible to guess through visualization at the time of enema preparation and administration.  Additionally, subjects will be instructed to disregard any product characteristics that may become 
evident during or after administration such as the presence or absence of 
color or odor.  To limit study bias, the IP administrator is not allowed to perform any of the subject study assessments  from completion of the 
enema administration visit through the subject’s final study visit. 
Sample Size  To demonstrate a 69% success with one dose of the RBX2660 treatment 
group vs. 47% success in the Placebo control group, 240 subjects are required (power 90%).  Up to an additional 30 subjects will be enrolled 
to allow for a 10% lost- to-follow up rate, for a total of up to 270 subjects 
randomized and treated with a blinded enema.  Considering the 2:1

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055824] signed consent but do not meet all inclusion 
and/or exclusion criteria will be considered screen failures.  Randomized subjects who withdraw for any reason prior to administration of the blinded enema will be replaced without counting toward the sample size 
cap which may result in more than 270 subjects being randomized, 
however no more than 270 subjects will be treated with a blinded enema.  Replacement subjects will be randomized in the same manner as other subjects.   
Statistical 
Considerations 
 The primar y efficacy analysis will be performed on all pre -defined 
analysis populations comparing the RBX2660 arm to the Placebo arm, Intent- to-Treat (ITT), modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) and Per -Protocol 
(PP).  However, the determination of meeting the pre-defined primary 
efficacy endpoint will utilize the mITT population results.  The primary 
endpoint analysis will be based on Pearson’s chi-square test with a 0.05 alpha level for this comparison.  Secondary efficacy endpoints will also be completed on all analysis  populations.  Finally, all safety analyses will 
be performed on the Safety population (SP) which includes all subjects in whom a blinded enema was at least opened and attempted.   
A primary efficacy and safety analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed their [ADDRESS_1055825] 
has completed the 6 -month follow-up visit for their study treatment.  This 
includes 6-month follow-up after an unblinded RBX2660 study 
treatment.  At that time the study will be considered complete.

 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256253], the study 
terminated, or other action taken based on their assessment that:  
1. There is probable cause that the IP or enema procedure (e.g., due to 
transfer from an RBX2660 donor) contributed to a new pathogenic intestinal infection in the stool of any subject, or 
2. Any series of events of major significance such as death or other serious outcome for which a causal connection with the IP is plausible represents an excess of the important adverse event(s ) in 
one of the study arms.  
In the event that one of the preceding rules appears to be met based on 
site reported data and/or medical monitor review, the Rebiotix Operations Department will review the donor history and batch processing/release records for  the product unit(s) administered in these 
cases.  A report of the review will be forwarded to the DSMB Chair for blinded review.  If probable cause is suspected, the DSMB Chair will convene the entire DSMB for event review.   
Upon the DSMB’s determination of action, the Chair will notify the 
Rebiotix Clinical Department, who will notify the study sites.  If 
enrollment is stopped, Rebiotix and the study sites will assess for the 
occurrence of similar events, and evaluate IP and study records for possible root cause(s).  Enrollment may be re-started upon further review and approval from the DSMB.  As appropriate, the DSMB may 
recommend study termination or measures short of termination with the 
objective of reducing the risk of adverse events.  Details regard ing 
DSMB responsibilities will be provided in the DSMB Charter.

1. Introduction  
1.1. Background 
RBX2660 (microbiota suspension) is an intestinal microbial suspension prepared from 
human stool obtained from carefully and thoroughly screened healthy human donors.  It 
is being studied for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile  infection (CDI).   
RBX2660 is prepared from a standardized amount of stool mixed with saline and a cryoprotectant.  It is stored at the manufacturer in a frozen state and is shipped frozen to 
the clinical site for administration via enema.  
 
The donor selection process is m ultifaceted in its original screening of candidate donors 
as well as the ongoing assessment of donated samples prior to release for use in a 
clinical study.  Some of these measures include the following:  
1. Donor qualification screening includes questions that specifically address risk factors 
for colonization with multi- drug resistant organisms ( MDROs ), and individuals at 
higher risk of colonization with MDROs are excluded from donation. Examples of 
persons at higher risk for colonization with MDROs include: 
a. Health care workers  
b. Persons who have recently been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256255]  
c. Persons who regularly attend outpatient medical or surgical clinics 
d. Persons who have recently engaged in medical tourism 
2. Donor stool testing include s MDRO testing to exclude use of stool that tests positive 
for MDRO. The MDRO tests include at minimum extended spectrum beta -lactamase 
(ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae , vancomycin- resistant enterococci  (VRE), 
carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and methicillin -resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA).  
3. All drug product currently in storage has undergone screening and stool testing for 
MDROs as described above.  
4. The informed consent process for subjects being treated with RBX2660 product as 
part of this study describes the risks of MDRO transmission and invasive infection as well as the measures implemented for donor screening and stool testing. 
 
Rebiotix has concluded the first clinical study of RBX2660 (n=34) in an open- label, 
non-controlled Phase [ADDRESS_1055835].  Additionally, Rebiotix has completed enrollment and interim reports of two Phase 2 clinical studies. 
Protocol 2014-01 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled, 3- arm Phase 2B study (n=127 treated ) designed to demonstrate the efficacy 
and safety of RBX2660 for the treatment of recurrent CDI.  Primarily, the Phase 2B Central La boratory

 study compared the efficacy of RBX2660 to placebo, and secondarily compared the 
efficacy of  two planned enemas of RBX2660 to one planned enema of RBX2660 with 
one enema of placebo.  The study has completed enrollment and primary efficacy 
analysis and continues in long term follow-up.  Protocol 2015-01 is an open label study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of two planned RBX2660 enemas (n=136  treated) to a 
historical control (n=110) is in long- term follow -up.  
 
Finally, to complete the RBX2660 clinical development program, Rebioti x is initiating a 
Phase [ADDRESS_1055837] had prior recurrent 
Clostridium difficile  infection  that was resolved with antibiotic treatment. 
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol as approved by [CONTACT_769454]’s governing Institutional Review Board or Research Ethics Board (Canada); in accordance to relevant regulatio ns in 21 CFR Part 
11, 50, 54, 56 and 312; and the ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance. 
 
1.2. Investigational Agent 
RBX2660 (microbiota suspension) 50g/150mL in an enema bag within a brown opaque sleeve, which is to remain in place over the bag and tubing during administration and 
disposal.  Each bag contains one dose.  Each dose contains minimum 10
7 microbes/mL 
of suspension in a saline/polyethylene glycol 3350 vehicle.    Note:   For this protocol, the term “Investigational Product (IP)” refers to both 
RBX2660 and the P lacebo.  
 
1.3. Placebo  
The Placebo consists of [ADDRESS_1055838] published cases in 1958 (Eiseman et al., 1958) to the present.  The literature present s 
significant evidence of the safe and effective use of FT for over 500 cases of recurrent Clostridium difficile  infection (CDI) with no product- related adverse events reported to 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055839] occurred in subjects 
receiving FT via enema (Bakken, 2015) . Based on the significant human clinical 
experience documented in the literature, it has been determined that preclinical studies 
are not warranted.  
 
1.5. Clinical Data to Date 
1.5.1. Phase 2 Study Protocol 2013-001 Fina l Data  
On July 12, 2013, Rebiotix received permission from FDA to proceed with the Phase 2 clinical study entitled “A Phase 2 Open -label Clinical Trial Demonstrating the Safety of 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension for the Treatment of Recurrent Clostridium dif ficile -
associated  Diarrhea.”  This study ended with the last subject’s 6-month assessment in 
July 2014.   
It was a prospective, multi -center, open -label, non-controlled Phase 2 study designed to 
demonstrate the safety of RBX2660 (50 g/150 mL) for the treatment of recurrent CDI.  
The target population was adults (≥ 18 years old) with recurrent CDI who had eithe r a) 
at least two recurrences after a primary epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (primary epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] + ≥ two recurrences, 
i.e., at least three epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) and had completed at least two rounds of standard-of- care 
oral antibiotic therapy or b) had at least two epi[INVESTIGATOR_769433].  The Rebiotix Phase [ADDRESS_1055840] been used in humans for 
many years, as discussed in the literature.  The study’s primary objective was  to assess 
the safety of RBX2660 but additional information was gathered on efficacy and the 
therapy’s impact on quality of life.  Eligible subjects who proceeded to treatment received one treatment with RBX2660.  If their CDAD returned before Day [ADDRESS_1055841] eight days after receiving an RBX2660 enema.  
Rebiotix performed a final analysis of the Phase 2 data for the generation of the Final Clinical Study Report.  As of the report’s data lock on July 28, 2014, 40 subjects were enrolled.  Of these, six did not proceed to receive a treatment with RBX2660 (screen failures).  Of the [ADDRESS_1055842], 02- RBX01 -007, died 35 days

 after receiving her second treatment with RBX2660 from respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], which was 
not related to RBX2660 or the administration procedure.  As of July 28, 2014, 31 subjects remained in active follow -up and all completed the study (6-month telephone 
assessment after their last treatment with RBX2660).  Here are the clinical study data and conclusions as presented in the Final Report.  
Efficacy Results  
The primary efficacy parameter of this study was treatment success, defined as the absence of CDAD (passage of three or more unformed stools in [ADDRESS_1055844] two consecutive days) at [ADDRESS_1055845] one treatment with RBX2660, 31 of them were presented in this efficacy analysis (31 had efficacy data available).  Twenty -
seven (27) out of 31 subjects, or 87.1%, were considered a treatment success.  Sixteen (16) subjects or 50.0% (N=16/32) were considered a treatment success after their first 
treatment with RBX2660.  Of the [ADDRESS_1055846] treatment, 15 subjects 
proceeded to receive a second enema of RBX2660. Of those, 11 subjects or 78.6% (N=11/14) were considered a treatment success (one subject was not counted because she did not reach the 56-day endpoint).  The reasons for the increased rate of success after the second enema were not fully understood.  It may be due to a number of factors, 
including changes in the subject’s microbiome after one treatment, complete elimination 
of vancomycin from the subject’s stool over time, or other reasons not yet determined. 
Safety Results  
The subjects enrolled in the Rebiotix Phase [ADDRESS_1055847] received one or two treatments with RBX2660.   
 
Of the reported solicited events, which were collected du ring the 8 -day period inclusive 
of the day of dosing and the subsequent 7-day follow-up period, the incidence and severity of these events declined over the 8 -day period.  The proportion of subjects 
reporting solicited AEs was lower on Day 7 in subjects who received two treatments (41.7%; N=5/12) with RBX2660 than in subjects who received one treatment (51.5%; N=17/33), yet the efficacy rate after two treatments rose to 78.6% from 50% after one

 treatment.  There were seven subjects who experienced a total o f 20 SAEs, only one of 
which had a possible relationship to RBX2660; most were probably or definitely related 
to a pre-existing condition, including CDI. Overall, adverse events declined over time; 
66.5% of AEs occurred from baseline through the 7-day visit.  This was the first known 
study to prospectively, systematically, consistently and aggressively solicit, record, and classify adverse events in subject s who received an intestinal microbiota fecal transplant 
product.  It was therefore expected that the incidence rate of reported AEs might be 
higher than that reported in the literature, but it represented the true rate and types of 
events experienced by [CONTACT_769455]. 
Figure 1-1 shows the decline in the proportion of subjects reporting solicited adverse 
events over the 8 days from the day of dosing (Day 0) to the seventh day after dosing 
(Day 7).  
 
 
 
Figure 1-1 :  Proportion of Subjects Reporting Solicited AEs from Day 0 -Day 7  
 
Conclusions 
The RBX2660 efficacy rate of 87.1% represented a significant improvement over reported success rates for oral antibiotics and was within the range of results reported in the literature for similar fecal microbiota products. This was the first known study to prospectively, systematically, consistently and aggressively solicit, record, and classify 
adverse events in subject s who received an intestinal microbiota fecal transplant product.  
It was therefore expected that the incidence rate of reported AEs (188 events in 28 
subjects) might be higher than that reported in the literature but it represented the true 

Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055849] were 
related to a pre- existing condition, primarily C. difficile  infection .  Efficacy rose after 
two treatments with RBX2660 yet the proportion of subjects reporting solicited AEs was lower on Day 7 in subjects who received two treatments than in subjects who received 
one treatment.  The efficacy benefit of RBX2660 outweighed the incidence and type of 
adverse events , especially the risk of recurrent CDI, thus providing a satisfactory 
benefit: risk ratio.  
 
1.5.2. Phase 2B Study Protocol 2014-01 Interim Study Data  
EFFICACY RESULTS :  The efficacy objectives of the study were analyzed using the 
n=127 treated subjects (n=41 Group A, n=44 Group B, n=42 Group C) in the ITT population.  In particular the assessment of RBX2660 as compared to placebo for subjects with a history of recurrent CDI and the assessment of further treatment on subjects who are confirmed treatment failures.  
 While the anticipated primary efficacy endpoint of two (2) enemas of RBX2660 administered 7 ±2 days apart (61.0%) as compared to placebo (45.5%) in the blinded phase was not met, the key secondary efficac y endpoint of one (1) enema of RBX2660 
(66.7%) as compared to the placebo group (45.5%) was met with a p- value of 0.048.  All 
other secondary objectives for the study were also met. The active RBX2660 treatment groups A and C in the were compared to each other with a p -value of 0.589 indicating 
no difference between one RBX2660 enema and two (2) administered 7 ±2 days apart.  
As such, an analysis using the combined RBX2660 treatment groups A and C with a 
success rate of 63.9% (53/83) was compared to the placebo (45.5%) also with a significant p -value of 0.046 by [CONTACT_141612]’s chi-square.   
 
Additionally, analysis of the ITT population was done to establish the overall efficacy 
rate for RBX2660 which took into consideration both blinded and open label treatments.  The resulting overall efficacy for all subjects treated with RBX2660 (n=107) was 88.8% which compared to the placebo rate of 45.5% was also significant with a p-value of 
<0.0001. 
 Finally, an analysis of the ITT placebo group subjects using them as their own control by [CONTACT_769456] (placebo treatment) to open label success (after 
RBX2660 treatment) showed a significant increase in success rate from 45.5% (20/44) 
in the blinded phase to 87.5% (21/24) after treatment with RBX2660 with a resulting p -
value of <0.0001. 
 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055850] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 77 
 Confirmation is provided by [CONTACT_769457] (PP) population analysis in which the 
combined RBX2660 treatment groups A and C with a success rate of 75.0% (45/60) were compared to the placebo 52.9% (18/34) with a significant p -value of 0.029 by 
[CONTACT_141612]’s chi -square during the blinded treatment phase. Further, overall RBX2660 
efficacy rate in PP subjects who received at least 1 RBX2660 enema either blinded or in open label (n=76) was 93.4% (71/76).   When compared to the PP Control Group B rate of 52.9%, a resulting p- value of <0.0001 further substantiates that RBX2660 is an 
effective treatment for the prevention of recurrent CDI.  
 Overall the efficacy data confirms the following primary conclusions:  
• Treatment with RBX2660 following a standard course of antibiotics significantly increases the success rate for prevention of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in subject s with a history of multi- recurrent 
disease.    
• Appropriate treatment with RBX2660 includes a single enema administered 
following completion of a standard course of antibiotics with another 
RBX2660 enema administered only if CDI  symptoms return.  
 
Not only do these results prevent a recurrence of CDI wi thin the 56 day (8 week) 
timeline as established by [CONTACT_6750], the results are maintained longer term.  The long term CDI free rate at the time of this analysis was 95.8% (91/95) for subjects successfully treated with RBX2660 at an average follow-up of 8.2 months (range: 1.6 – 
14.9). 
 Lastly, the donor screening and manufacturing process appears to properly ensure the quality of the RBX2660 product as consistent results in treatment success are shown 
regardless of donor. 
 These efficacy results also validate previous results from the Phase 2 study which 
reported an 87.1% treatment success with RBX2660.  
 
SAFETY RESULTS :  The Safety Population (SP) consists of any subject who had a 
study enema attempted (n=128) whether placebo or RBX2660.  Adverse events were 
independently reviewed by a Medical Monitor with additional oversight by a DSMB for evaluation of safety trends and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The DSMB completed an interim review 
of safety data as reported during the double-blind period.  Following review, the DSMB 
recommends continuation of the study as no pre-defined study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_769434].   
 
Adverse events (n=580 in 94 subjects) were collected by [CONTACT_769458] a study enema.  The adverse

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055851] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 77 
 events reported were mostly mild -to-moderate in severity (90.8%) and were primarily 
related to gastrointestinal disorders (41.9%) as would be expected in this population.  
 
Death has been reported in seven (7) subjects at the time of the analysis, none (0) of 
which were reported as related to the study enemas or procedure.  Six (6) of the seven (7) were reported as related to a pre -existing condition.  Further, one (1) of the seven (7) 
subjects died prior to receiving the assigned study treatment.   
There were 45 (7.8%) serious adverse events (SAEs) in 26 subjects reported.  Of the 
SAEs only three (3) were reported as possibly related to the study enema.  Additionally, of the 345 enemas administered in the study, zero (0) had a report of SAE related to the enema procedure.  While 31.1 % of SAEs were reported as related to CDI and 77.8% 
reported as related to a pre-existing condition.  No differences in the rate of adverse 
events between treatment groups was identified in the number of subjects experiencing an adverse event.  Additionally, only five (5) subjects were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769435], none (0) resulting in ICU admission.  
 
A detailed review of subjects with adverse events relative to the number of exposures to RBX2660 (0-4 exposures) was completed which showed there was no significant increase in the number or rate of adverse events with increased exposure to RBX2660.  
There were 108 subjects (84.4%) in the safety population who were exposed to 
RBX2660 with a total of 223 exposures for an average of two (2) exposures per subject.   Analysis of the donor screening process indicated no adverse events subsequent to treatm ent with RBX2660 were linked to transfer of conditions to a subject from an 
RBX2660 enema or its constituents.   Overall the safety data indicates that treatment with an RBX2660 enema followed by [CONTACT_769459]2660 if needed due to recurr ence of CDI  symptoms can 
be safely administered as it does not increase the risk for adverse events or result in a transfer of donor conditions.   
OVERALL RESULTS :  These results conclude that a single enema of RBX2660 
followed by [CONTACT_769460]2660 ene ma if ne eded due to a recurrence of CDI  
symptoms is a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of recurrent CDI following a standard course of antibiotics. 
 
1.5.3. Phase 2 B Study Protocol 2015-01 Interim Study Data  
EFFICACY RESULTS :  The efficacy objectives of the study were analyzed using the 
n=246 treated subjects (n=[ADDRESS_1055852] one enema of RBX2660, and 110 historical controls)  in the Full Analysis Set defined as all subjects who received any 
study treatment.   In particular the ass essment of RBX2660 as compared to historical 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01

 controls for subjects with a history of recurrent CDI and the assessment of further 
treatment on subjects who are confirmed treatment failures.  Historical controls were 
subjects who received antibiotics for recu rrent CDI, not RBX2660 or other enema 
treatment, and were identified through review of patient records.   
 The primary efficacy endpoint analysis of treatment success for the RBX2660 treatment 
administered 7 ±2 days apart (79.4%) as compared to historical c ontrols (51.8%) 
reached statistical significance (p < 0.0001) .   
 Further sensitivity analysis was completed in which the RBX2660 improvement in treatment success rem ained statistically significant  versus the control group after 
adjusting for age (p<0.0001), race (p-value 0.0003), sex (p<0.0001), number of previous epi[INVESTIGATOR_769436] (p -value 0.0002).  
 Overall the efficacy data confirms the following primary conclusions:  
• Treatment with RBX2 [ADDRESS_1055854] course of antibiotics 
significantly increases the success rate for prevention of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in subjects with a history of multi- recurrent 
disease.    
 
SAFETY RESULTS :  The Safety Population (SP) consists of any subject who ha d a 
study enema attempted (n=136 ) of RBX2660.  Adverse events were independently 
reviewed by a Medical Monitor . Following review, the Medical Monitor did not see an 
emergence of new adverse events or change in the occurrence rate.   
A total of 482 adverse events were reported in 99 subjects (72.8% of subjects) in the 
RBX2660 treatment group.  This was similar to the number and percentages of adverse events documented in the historical control group (n=691 events in 69 subjects; 62.7% of subjects). 
There were 385 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 94 subjects (69.1% of 
subjects) in the RBX2660 treated group.  The TEAEs reported were mostly mild- to-
moderate in severity (89.1%) and primarily related to gastrointestinal disorders (37.4%) as would be expected in this population 
Three deaths were reported in RBX2660 treated subjects at the time of the interim 
analysis data cutoff date, 12 January 2017, one of which was reported as possibly related to the RBX2660 or procedure but definitely related to C. difficile  disease and pre-
existing condition(s).  The other two recorded deaths were reported as definitely related to a pre-existing condition.  Death was reported in eight of the 110 subjects in the historical control group (7.3%). 
In the RBX2660 treated group, there were 82 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported 
in [ADDRESS_1055855] enema, leaving 80 treatment emergent SAEs (20.8% of all TEAEs) in 23 subjects (16.9%).   O f 
the treatment emergent SAEs, 11 (13.8%) were reported as possibly related to the 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055856], and 5 (6.3%) were reported as possibly related to the enema 
procedure.  Additionally, 23 (28.8%) of the treatment emergent SAEs were reported as related to CDI disease and 62 (77.5%) were reported as related to a pre- existing 
condition. No adverse events subsequent to treatment with RBX2660 were linked to transmission of disease to a subject from an RBX2660 enema or its constituents. 
In the historical control group, there were 80 reported SAEs in 31 subjects (28.2% of 
subjects).  
As of th e interim analysis, none of the pre-identified study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_769437]. 
 
OVERALL RESULTS :  These results indicate that treatment with RBX2660 is a safe 
and effective treatment for the prevention of recurrent CDI following a standard of care course of antibiotics as compared to a historical control. 
 
1.6. Treatment Rationale and Risk/Benefit  
RBX2660 microbiota suspension was developed after careful, controlled component and process testing performed by [CONTACT_256286].  RBX2660 (microbiota suspension) 50 g/150 mL is supplied in an ethylene vinyl acetate enema bag.  Each bag of RBX2660 contains one enema; each enema of RBX2660 consists of a 
suspension of minimum 10
7 live organisms/mL in polyethylene glycol 3350/0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP, solution to ensure a consistent product is delivered.  
This study is confirming  the optimal dosing strategy of RBX2660 enemas (one enema 
followed by a second if needed due to a recurrence of CDI symptoms ) as compared to a 
placebo enema.  In an assessment of risk of recurrent CDI, which often results in severe 
and serious consequences, the benefit of preventing recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_769438]2660 outweigh the risk of the predominately mild to moderate 
AEs experienced by [CONTACT_256287] [ADDRESS_1055857] is low and the method is easy to perform and requires no 
special equipment.  In addition, the enema route for fecal transplants is routinely used and has high efficacy rates reported in the literature with no reports of safety issues.   
 
Based on the results of the Rebiotix Phase 2 and Phase 2B studies, and the known, documented, safe and highly effective use of fecal transplantation for recurrent CDI with other  products administered either via enema, colonoscopy or nasogastric/duodenal tube, 
the rigor of Rebiotix’s donor screening process, and implementation of quality assurance 
testing at all stages of manufacturing, the anticipated risks to subjects are ac ceptable in 
relation to the potential benefits of RBX2660.

 3.2. General Study Design  
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled  
Phase 3 study to confirm  the efficacy and safety of RBX2660 for the prevention  of 
recurrent CDI.  
Up to  270 subjects may be randomized and treated in this study. R andomization will be 
at a 2:1 ratio ( RBX2660:Placebo) which means approximately 180 subjects randomized 
to treatment with RBX2660 and 90 subjects randomized to Placebo.  Consented s ubjects 
who meet  all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will b e randomized.  Potential 
subjects who are consented but do not meet the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria will 
be considered screen failures and will not count towards total randomized.  Subjects who are randomized but exit prior to the administration of the first blinded enema may be replaced with additional subjects  which could cause overall number of subjects 
randomized to be greater than the [ADDRESS_1055863] been prescribed 
antibiotics to control recurrent CDI symptoms at the time of enrollment per the 
investigator’s standard of care.  This means patients who have already completed their prescribed course of antibiotics to treat recurrent CDI, cannot be considered for enrollment unless they have another recurrence. 
Once enrolled (informed consent obtained), in order to be randomized and treated ; 
1. Subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria;  
2. Antibiotics will have been administered for a  minimum of 10 consecutive 
days p rior to the washout period; 
3. CDI symptoms must be under control leading into the antibiotic washout 
period.  
 
Control of CDI symptoms is defined as no longer meeting the symptomatic criteria for 
CDI diarrhea which is the passage of three or more unformed/lo ose (i.e. Bristol Stool 
Scale type 6 -7) stools in [ADDRESS_1055864] of a single 
blinded study enema according to the randomization assignment.  Study t reatment is to 
be completed as soon as possible, but no more than 14 calendar days following  
randomization.  A minimum of 24hr to maximum of 72hr antibiotic washout period is required  prior to administration of the  assigned study treatment . Ultimately, the study 
treatment needs to be administered within 21 days of the Screening visit.

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055865] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 77 
 In-office study follow-up visits occur  at weeks  1-, 4- and 8 after completing the blinded 
study treatment.  Telephone assessments f or adverse events occur during week s 2, 3 and 
6 after the study enema and at months 3 and 6.  Subjects are required to keep a detailed 
diary to assess for solicited events from the date of enrol lment (informed consent) to the 
1-week follow -up visit.  The d iary will be collected and reviewed at the baseline visit 
prior to blinded enema administration. The subject will continue to complete the diary 
following enema administration and it will be collected and reviewed at the [ADDRESS_1055866] receives an unblinded RBX2660 enema, the follow-up requirements will 
restart from the day of the unblinded RBX2660 enema received according to the same 
schedule as required for the blinded portion of the study.   A primary efficacy and safety analysis will be conducted when 100% of the randomized 
subjects in each group have completed their [ADDRESS_1055867] has completed the 6 -
month follow-up visit for their study treatment.  This includes 6-month follow- up after 
an unblinded RBX2660 study treatment. A t that time the study will be considered 
complete.   
See Figure 3-1 for an illustration of the Study Design.

3.3. Definition of Recurrent CDI for Study Entry  
The definition of recurrent CDI for study entry is a documented diagnosis of: 
1. CDI diarrhea ; the passage of three or more unformed/loose stools in [ADDRESS_1055869] two consecutive days, that began within 8 
weeks after completion of previous CDI treatment; 
2. and at least one positive stool test for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile ; 
which must be documented within 30 days prior to or on the date of 
enrollment (informed consent) .   
To be considered for enrollment, a subject must have m edical record  documentation of 
recurrent CDI per the above study definition that includes either:  
a. at least one recurrence after a primary epi[INVESTIGATOR_769439]-of- care oral antibiotic therapy or ;  
b. had at least two epi[INVESTIGATOR_769440] .

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055870] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 77 
 3.4. Definition of CDI Diarrhea for Use in Enrolled Subjects T hroughout the Study  
1. The passage of three or more unformed/loose (i.e. Bristol Stool Scale type 6 -
7) stools in [ADDRESS_1055871] two consecutive days; 
2. and a positive stool test for the presence of  C. difficile  toxin ; documented at 
the time of the diarrhea . 
 
3.5. Definition of Treatment Success  
Treatment success is defined as:  
• The absence of CDI  diarrhea for 8 weeks after completing a study 
treatment .  
 
3.6. Definition of Sustained Clinical Response  
Sustained clinical response is defined as:  
• Treatment success of the presenting CDI recurrence and no new CDI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_769441] 6 months after completing a blinded treatment.       
    
3.7. Definition of Treatment Failure  
Treatment failure (CDI recurrence) is defined as:  
• The presence of CDI diarrhea within [ADDRESS_1055872] provide a 
fresh stool sample.  Site staff will send this stool sample to the central laboratory  for 
analysis . To ensure consistency across clinical sites for the determination of study failures, 
the central laboratory will perform the required C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE® Test 
rapid enzyme immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogena se (GDH) and toxins A and B .  If 
the te st is inconclusive, the central laboratory will conduct a second confirmatory test by 
[CONTACT_954].  
Specifically , regarding interpretation of results , if the GDH and toxin are both positive per 
the rapid enzyme immunoassay  test during the presence of diarrhea then the subject is 
considered a treatment failure.   
However, if the subject experiences diarrhea and the GDH and toxin are both negative per 
the test, then the subject is not considered a treatment failure as the presence of C. difficile  
was not established.  The study investigator will need to determine  the appropriate 
treatment  for the subject as  to avoid the possibility of serious adverse events.   
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055873] are 
inconclusive (one is positive and the other is negative) the central lab will perform a PCR 
test.  If the PCR test is negative, the subject will not be considered a treatment failure as 
the presence of C. difficile  was not established.  If the PCR test is positive, then the subject 
will be considered a treatment failure.    
Finally, if the rapid enzyme immunoassay test provides an invalid result such that the 
control line is not visible, the test will be repeated.  
For suspected treatment failures, a sample must be sent to the  central laboratory .  In the 
case of suspected treatment failure where there is an immediate concern for subject safety, including the potential for serious adverse events, a C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE
® 
Test will be permitted to be conducted at the site or other lab oratory known to the site in 
addition to sending a sample to the  central laboratory  for testing.  If the C. DIFF QUIK 
CHEK COMPLETE® Test is not available, a testing algorithm that directly assesses the 
presence of C. difficile  toxin for laboratory confirmation of recurrent CDI should be used.  
In the event, the test results from the central laboratory differ from that of a local 
laboratory, the results from the central laboratory will be used in determination of 
treatment failure. For subjects who  are suspected of treatment failure, but for whom there 
is not a test result from the central laboratory for the suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], a deviation will be added to the database, and due documentation of the subject’s symptoms and all 
available data will be se nt to the Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) for 
independent adjudication of treatment failure.   
 
3.8. Management of Treatment Failure  
Following blinded treatment, subjects meeting the protocol definition of treatment 
failure  may be scheduled for administration of an unblinded RBX2660 enema within [ADDRESS_1055874] the 
unblinded enema, it needs to be administered within 21 calendar days of failure 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055875] diary for up to 7 days after treatment; in -office visits at [ADDRESS_1055876] 
RBX2660 treatment.  
Treatment failures who do not receive an unblinded RBX2660 enema will continue to 
follow their original schedule of assessments for the duration of the study based on the 
blinded study enema. 
3.9. Determination of Treatment Success/Failure  
The site investigator makes the initial determination of treatment success or failure 
based on the pre-defined study definitions.  The site investigator’s assessment will then be provided to the EAC for independent, blinded adjudication of treatment success or 
failure that will be utilized for study analysis and reporting purposes. This may be done 
in an on- going basis or a single meeting as deemed appropriate.  Details of the EAC 
logistics, activity and responsibilities will be included in a  EAC charter.   
3.10. Endpoint Adjudication Committee  
The Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) provides independent, blinded 
adjudication of treatment success or failure that will be used  for study analysis and 
reporting purposes. The EAC is comprised of three physicians specializing in infectious 
diseases or gastroenterology who have experience managing subjects with recurrent CDI and are not investigators in the study.  Details of the EAC logistics, activity and responsibilities will be included in a EAC charter.   
3.11. Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
The DSMB will review safety data for trends and may be unblinded as needed to 
adjudicate certain adverse events and  for review of both the primary efficacy and safety 
analysis and the final analysis . Details regarding  DSMB responsibilities related to 
analysis oversight and data reporting will be provided in the DSMB Charter.  
3.12. Medical Monitor  
The Medical Monitor provides blinded review of serious adverse events or events 
reported by [CONTACT_769461] , and periodic  review of 
adverse events for trends .  Details of this review are documented in a Safety 
Management Plan.  The Medical Monitor will remain blinded throughout the study.  The 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055877] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 77 
 Medical Monitor’s review will be provided to the DSMB for analysis purposes and as 
applicable for the proper adjudication of potential study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
3.13. Blinding  
Subjects, site personnel, the DSMB , EAC  and the Medical Monitor are blinded to the 
randomization assignment.  Blinding will be maintained through the data cutoff for the primary efficacy and safety analysis after which the blind may be lifted for the DSMB .  
The DSMB may be unblinded to individual as signments earlier as needed to adjudicate 
certain adverse events.  Individual randomization assignments will not be revealed to the 
subjects, site personnel , EAC  or the Medical Monitor until the study is completed. Sites 
will be provided an emergency unblinding code if it becomes medically necessary to 
know the treatment group assigned for a particular subject.     
Subjects will be randomized to receive either RBX2660 or placebo through an 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) System 4-[ADDRESS_1055878]’s final study visit .   
The Rebiotix Kit remains sealed at the  site until opened at the time of administration by 
[CONTACT_769462].  The IP bag is blinded by [CONTACT_769463], and the tube set is covered by [CONTACT_769464], which is placed by t he IP Administrator at the time of preparation at the site; 
preparation occurs out of sight from the subject and other site personnel.  The IP is 
covered by [CONTACT_769465].  
Subjects will be instructed to disregard the presence or absence of odor or color, as these 
characteristics may or may not indicate which product is being administered.  Product is placed  in an opaque biohazard bag that is sealed to avoid accidental visualization.

rectal tube assembly that is used to administer IP as an enema; these components are 
packaged together in the Rebiotix Kit.  Rebiotix Kit components include: 
 1 bag of RBX2660 or Placebo with a spi[INVESTIGATOR_256262] a brown opaque 
sleeve  
 1 rectal tube assembly  
 1 brown opaque sleeve for the tube assembly 
 1 adhesive strip to secure opaque sleeves 
 [ADDRESS_1055888] disposal bag 
 [ADDRESS_1055889]. Ultimately, the study 
treatment needs to be administered within 21 days of the Screening visit.  Subjects are 
randomized to one of the following groups:  
• Group A:  Placebo  
• Group B:  RBX2660  
 
Randomization will occur in a 2:[ADDRESS_1055890]- enema 
administration for vital sign assessment (temperat ure, heart rate, blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) and observation.   
Subjects with a documented treatment failure following blinded treatment may be 
scheduled for administration of an unblinded RBX2660 enema.  In order to receive an 
unblinded RBX2660 enem a, a subject must have documentation of meeting all treatment 
failure criteria as defined by [CONTACT_760]  (Section 3.7).  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], antibiotics are warranted for the control of CDI 
symptoms  prior to receiving the unblinded RBX2660 enema, they can be administered 
but need to be stopped 24-72 hours before enema administration.  The total time from a 
treatment failure (CDI recurrence) determination to administration of an unblinded 
enema is within  21 calendar days.

5.9. Ordering, Receipt and Storage, Dispensing, Returning, and Tracking Investigational 
Product  
5.9.1. Ordering Investigational Product  
Authorized site personnel will randomize subjects using the Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT) System  which automatically triggers ordering of IP .  If a subject is a 
confirmed treatment failure and will proceed to unblinded RBX2660 treatment, the site 
will document the failure in the IRT which automatically triggers ordering of RBX2660 
IP.  
5.9.2. Receipt and Storage of Investigational Product 
Note:  Each unit of IP is designated to be administered to a specific subject on a 
specific date; administration of IP designated for one subject to another subject is 
prohibited.  The Rebiotix Kit must only be opened by [CONTACT_769467].

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055893] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 77 
 Personnel from the Rebiotix Operations Department confirm the randomization 
assignment and ship a unit of IP to the authorized person/ department as specified on the 
Delegation of Authority log at the site in a temperature -controlled shippi[INVESTIGATOR_256263].  
The authorized person opens the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_256263], visually confirms that the unit of IP arrived intact, confirms that the temperature indicator has not been tripped and records receipt and inspection on the Product Accountability Log.  IP is to be thawed and stored in the refrigerator until administration.   
IP must be kept in a secure location under the control of the Investigator or authorized designee at all times; see Section 5.9.[ADDRESS_1055894] be destroyed by [CONTACT_256290] ’s processes  and be 
recorded on the Product Accountability Log. 
 
5.9.3. Dispensing and Administering Investigational Product  
Dispensing procedures vary from site to site, but each site’s study investigator is 
responsible for delegating the administration of IP to a qualified and trained health care 
professional; this person(s) (“IP Administrator”) must be identified on the Delegation of Authority Log and receive product- specific training on IP administration.   
IP is to be administered by [CONTACT_769468]/exclusion criteria have been met , the subject had a negative pregnancy test (if 
applicable)  and the 24-[ADDRESS_1055895] package and the site’s standard procedures.   
 
5.9.4. Returning IP  
Do not return IP to Rebiotix. For IP received but not administered to a subject, i t must 
be destroyed by [CONTACT_256290] ’s processes.   Destruction  must be rec orded 
on the Product Accountability Log.  
 
5.9.5. Product Accountability and Tracking  
Each unit of IP is sent to the site for administration  to an assigned subject and is labeled 
with a batch  number to be recorded in the eCRF and on the Product Accountability Log.  
Each unit must be tracked on the Product Accountability Log by [CONTACT_108443](s) authorized on the Delegation of Authority Log to perform that step.  IP must be kept in a secure location under the control of the site investigator or authorized designee as recorded on the Delegation of Authority Log.  The Product Accountability Log and 
Delegation of Authority Log are to be maintained by t he site and confirmed  during

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055903] sign the study -specific IRB/RE B-approved Informed Consent/HIPAA 
Form; see Section 4.3.  T he original  signed Form is to be placed in the subject’s study 
file.  A copy of the signed Form is  also to be given to the subject for his/her records. 
 
6.3. Subject Diary  
The Subject D iary serves as a tool for the subject to record pre- and post- treatment 
health and information that may indicate ad verse events or the recurrence of CDI.  The 
subject also documents changes in medications.  
At the time of enrollment (informed consent) s ubjects are provided a Subject Diary that 
they are to complete until the day prior to the blinded study enema.  This may mean up 
to [ADDRESS_1055904] Diary is  review ed for solicited 
event occurrence and severity, changes to medications, occurrence of adverse events, and possible recurrence of CDI. The following information is entered  into the study 
database:  
• solicited event severity  
• changes to medication  
• occurrence of adverse events   
 
If a subject  is a documented treatment failure  and s/he elects to receive unblinded 
RBX2660 treatment, the follow-up visit requirements start over with the receipt of an 
unblinded enema . The subject will be given  additional diary pages to complete 
beginning on the day of the unblinded enema until the 1- week visit.  This additional 
information is also entered into the study data base.  
 
6.4. Optional Stool Samples for Additional Testing by [CONTACT_769470]:  
• Screening ( between the time of enrollment and prior to treatment)  
• at the time of the 1, 4 and 8 week office visits;  
• at the time of the 3 and 6 month phone calls;  
• at the time of possible treatment failure symptoms .

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055905]’s study identification number and date/time of the sample; samples will not contain any personal information that would identify the subject .  Samples may be stored for approximately five years.  The stool samples will be 
used for research about the microorganisms in the human gut. Some of the research  will 
include testing for microorganisms ( Clostridium difficile  and vancomycin- resistant 
enterococcus) both before and after receiving the study enema.   Failure to send in a 
sample does not require a protocol de viation , however subjects should be reminded of 
this request.   
 
6.5. Screening  Visit  
The following study activities/data will be collected at the screening visit : 
• Subjects are told about the study and informed consent is obtained (enrollment)  
• Standard demographics (gender, ethnicity, date of birth, race.)  
• Detailed medical history , including Charlson Comorbidity Index variables  
• Assess inclusion/exclusion criteria , including C. difficile  stool testing  
o At the time of enrollment or study entry, a positive stool test for 
toxigenic C. difficile  must be or have been  performed and 
documented no more than [ADDRESS_1055906] be on file 
at the site.   C. difficile  laboratory testing according to the site’s 
standard of care is acceptable for enrol lment, however, the use the 
C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE
® Test  rapid enzyme 
immunoassay test for enrollment is preferred.   If the rapid enzyme 
immunoassay test is  utilized, the same interpretation of results as 
defined for treatment failures is required.  
• Core laboratory b lood sample is collected for CBC w/differential and 
comprehensive metabolic panel ( CMP : Sodium, potassium, chloride, 
BUN, creatinine, albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (direc t, indirect and total), glucose) and  C-reactive protein ( CRP ) testing  
• Onsite u rine pregnancy test  for subjects of child bearing potential   
• For subjects who consented to the Optional Stool Sample collection, 
remind them to obtain and ship a stool sample to Rebiotix anytime 
between their enro llment date and their blinded enema administration visit 
• Assess v ital signs : height, weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
• Complete the Cdiff32 health- related quality of life questionnaire

 • Document concomitant medications  
• Completion of t he Subject Diary is explained and how to complete it is 
demonstrated; see Section 6.3.   
• Verify employment status  
• Assess for protocol deviations  
 
6.6. Randomization 
Once enrolled (informed consent obtained), in order to be randomized and treated:  
1. Subject must meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria; 
2. Antibiotics will have been administered for a minimum of 10 consecutive 
days prior to the washout period; 
3. CDI symptoms must be under control leading into the antibiotic washout period. 
 
After enrollment and confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria compliance, including 
criteria confirmed by [CONTACT_228974], the study coordinator or other trained 
and authorized site staff randomize the subject in the Interactive Response Technology 
(IRT) System and ensures study treatment is completed within 4 -14 calendar  days of 
randomization. Ultimately, the study treatment needs to be administer ed within 21 days 
of the Screening visit. 
The randomization schedule will be created using randomized blocks within four strata 
based on antibiotics used at screening (Vancomycin alone, Vancomyci n in combination, 
Fidaxomicin or Other), and randomized subje cts will be assigned one of two treatments 
(Group A or Group B) within the appropriate stratum. The randomization will not be stratified by [CONTACT_3725], so each site will draw from the same set of blocks.  A subject will be 
assigned the next available treatment allocation from the randomization list.  The 
randomization code and the date and time of randomization will be captured in the IRT. 
Enrolled (consented) subjects who are randomized but exited prior to attempting the blinded treatment may be re -enrolled if another CDI recurrence occurs and thus 
randomized under a different subject identification numbers (re-randomized).  If this 
occurs, they will be included in the analysis using their second randomization 
assignment and subsequent assessments and will only be counted once towards the total randomized.   
Treatment will be assigned in the following proportions: 2:[ADDRESS_1055908] blinded enema may be replaced with additional subjects  which could cause overall number of s ubjects randomized to be 
greater than the 270 anticipated , however no more than 270 subjects will be treated  with 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055909] occur within 21 days of the screening visit.  Antibiotics for the control of CDI symptoms are prescribed or continued until 24-72 
hours before administration of the blinded study enema.  
The following study activities/data will be collected at the baseline visit prior to enema 
administration: 
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria are confirmed including the following:  
o The control of symptoms during antibiotic use is confirmed by [CONTACT_256295]  
o Compliance to the washout period (discontinuation of the 
antibiotics for 2 4-72 hours prior to the baseline visit) is confirmed 
• Modified physical exam (no genitourinary exam unless medically 
indicated) is performed to establish baseline health status (findings that 
can be attributed to the subject’s medical history will not be do cumented 
as adverse events)  
• Central  laboratory blood sample collection for CBC w/differential , HIV, 
Hepatitis A (IgG) Hepatitis B Anti- Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis 
C antibody, and Treponema Antibody. NOTE: the  results are not needed 
before proceeding to treatment per the protocol 
• Central  laboratory stool sample is collected . NOTE: the  results are not 
needed before proceeding to treatment per the protocol 
• Onsite urine pregnancy test for subjects of child bearing potential 
• Assess vital signs : temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] 
• Changes to concomitant medications since the last visit  
• Review subject diary  
• Assess recurrence of CDI  
• Assess for adverse events since enrollment  
• Assess for protocol deviations  
 
Following successful completion of the baseline visit, investigational product is then administered via enema per the Instructions for Use and standard site procedure by [CONTACT_769471]; see Section 5.9.3.  Subjects remain at the site under 
supervision for at least one hour post- IP administration for vital sign assessment 
(temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) about every 15 minutes and 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055910]’s vital signs do not return to the pre- administration values ± 
20%, assess the subject for a possible AE.  The subject is sent home after completion of 
study procedures and a review of the Subject Diary instructions, and is requested  to call 
the study coordinator if symptoms recur or at the onset of an adverse event .

 • For subjects who consented to the Optional Stool Sample collection, 
remind  the subject to collect  and ship a stool sample to Rebiotix.     
 
Treatment failure (CDI recurrence) is defined as:  
• The presence of CDI diarrhea within [ADDRESS_1055917] for  C. difficile  toxin at the time 
of the diarrhea using the study required C. difficile  testing algorithm.  
 
To ensure consistency across clinical sites for the  determination of study failure , the 
central laboratory will perform the required C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE® Test 
(QCC Test) rapid enzyme immunoassay test for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and 
toxins A and B.  
In the case of suspected treatment failure where there is an immediate concern for 
subject safety, including the potential for serious adverse events, a C. DIFF QUIK 
CHEK COMPLETE® Test will be permitted to be conducted at the site or other 
laboratory known to the site in addition to  sending a sample to the central laboratory for 
testing.   
If the C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLE TE® Test is not available  by [CONTACT_769473] , a testing algorithm that directly assesses the presence of C. difficile  toxin for 
laboratory confirmation of recurrent CDI may also be used  to test a sample, in addition 
to sending a sample to the central laboratory for testing . 
Specifically, if the antigen and toxin are both positive per the QCC Test during the presence of diarrhea then the subject is considered a treatment failure.   
Treatment Failure :   
    
 
However, if the subject experiences diarrhea and the antigen and toxin are both negative 
per the QCC Test , then the subject is not considered a treatment failure as the presence 
of C. difficile  was not established.  The study investigator will need to determine the 
appropriate treatment for the subject as to avoid the possibility of serious adverse events.   
Treatment Success :

positive and the other is negative), the stool sample will be sent to a central lab to perform a PCR test.  If the PCR test is negative, the subject will not be considered a 
treatment failure as the presence of C. difficile  was not established.  If the PCR test is 
positive, then the subject will be considered a treatment failure.

6.14. Unblinded RBX2660  
Subjects with a documented treatment failure meeting the protocol definition in the 
blinded portion of the study may  be scheduled for administration of an unblinded 
RBX2660 enema.  In order to receive the unblinded RBX2660 enema, a subject must 
have documentation of the following: 
• Meeting all treatment failure criteria as defined by [CONTACT_760] 
• Compliance to  the washout period (discontinuation of antibiotics for 24-72 
hours prior to administration visit) is confirmed  
• Negative urine-dipstick pregnancy test for subject of childbearing 
potential to confirm that they are  not pregnant on the date of 
administration  
• Unblinded enema administration is to occur  within 21 calendar days of 
failure determination

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055919] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 77 
 While subjects may choose to receive and understand they are receiving an  unblinded 
RBX2660 enema ; neither they nor the study site will be unblinded to their original 
treatment.    
If antibiotics are given to control symptoms, a 24-72hr washout period prior to 
administration of an unblinded RBX2660 enema is required, however the unblinded enema must still be administered within [ADDRESS_1055920] diary from the day of unblinded RBX2660 enema administration until the day prior to the 1 -week visit ; in-office visits at 1 -week (see 
Section 6.8), 4- week (see Section 6.9) and 8- week (see Section  6.10) as well as 
telephone calls at 2 , 3 and 6 weeks (see Section  6.11) and at 3 and 6 months (see Section 
6.12) after the unblinded RBX2660 trea tment.  
The study will be considered complete when all subjects have reached their 6-month 
follow-up after the last study enema received, including unblinded enemas , or have 
exited, whichever is earlier .   
6.15. Study Exit  
A Study Exit eCRF will be completed for each subject who is randomized. Data to be 
collected at this visit includes exit date and reason for study exit. This visit may occur in 
conjunction with the 6-month Follow-Up visit for subjects who complete the study and 
do not have ongoing adverse events.  
The following information will be collected on the Study Exit eCRF:  
• Exit date  
• Reason for study exit 
o Completed Study 
o Screen Failure  
o Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] 
o Study Terminated by [CONTACT_2728] 
o Investigator withdrawal  
o Adverse Event  
o Death  
o Lost to Follow- Up 
o Other: (specify)  
Additional data will be collected when the following occur: 
• Medication changes  
• Adverse Events  
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055921]’s study participation is considered complete once the 6-month telephone call 
is conducted a fter starting the last course of study drug or the subject exits the study, 
whichever comes first .  A subject may withdraw at any time for any reason or be 
withdrawn from the study prematurely for the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_1130] 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Failure to comply to study requirements 
• Termination of study by [CONTACT_456] 
• Death  
• Other (to be specified).  
 
The reason for withdrawal  is recorded on the Study Exit eCRF.  In the event that a 
subject requests to withdraw from the study, every attempt should be made to have the 
subject return for an early withdrawal visit and to complete the required visit 
questionnaires prior to withdrawal.  
For a subject who is suspected of being lost- to-follow-up, a minimum of three attempts 
must be mad e to contact [CONTACT_256297] (e.g., telephone, 
email, text, and letter); one attempt must be a registered postal letter or traceable courier 
notice (e.g., Fed Ex Express) to the subject’s last known address. The contact [CONTACT_256298].  The date the subject is regarded as lost to follow-up is the date of last actual encounter with the subject, such as 
the last phone call contact [CONTACT_19383].   
Completion of a Study Exit eCRF is require d for all randomized subjects when they exit 
the study regardless of reason, including completion of all study requirements, visits and assessments.   Subjects who were randomized but were determined to be screen failures 
or otherwise exited prior to receiv ing a dose of the study drug should also be 
documented on a Study Exit eCRF. 
 
7. Assessment of Safety  
7.1. Adverse Event Management  
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the time of informed consent. Subjects should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the investigator.  Inves tigators should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific dis ease or syndrome rather than individual associated 
signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_256299].  
Rebiotix Inc .  Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension  Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055922] 2019  CONF I DENTIAL Page 58 of 77 However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of 
a specific disease or syndrome by  [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separate 
adverse event on the eCRF.  Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical 
procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded 
as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at screening should not be reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in 
severity or seriousness at any time during the study.  In this case, it should be reported as 
an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g. electrocardiogram) findings that are detected during the study or are present at screening and significantly 
worsen during the study should be reported as AEs.  The investigator will exercise his or 
her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values  occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests 
return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.   Any abnormal test that 
is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
Recurrence of CDI is not to be reported as an AE unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 24 hours is 
required to treat it.  If a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] ≥ 24 hours is not required, it is to be recorded 
on the Follow-up eCRF and applicable CDI Form which will be reviewed as a 
component of the effica cy assessment.  If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ [ADDRESS_1055923] exits the study.  
Events lasting > 3 months are considered to be chronic in nature.  
7.2. Defi
nitions  
Adverse event:   an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in
a clinical investigation subject associated with the use of IP, which does not
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment .  An adverse event
can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated withthe use of IP.
oAll adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems,
complaints, or symptoms are to be recorded on the eCRF within 10
days of site awareness .
Adverse reaction :   All noxious and unintended responses to IP should be
considered an adverse reaction. “Responses” to IP means that a causal
Rebiotix Inc .  Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension  Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055924] a reasonable 
possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out.   
Serious adverse event (SAE): An adverse event or adverse reaction is
considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator, Medical Monitoror sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
oDeath
oLife-threatening adverse event
NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not
include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have
caused death.
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 24 hours or prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645976]: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769445].  An emergency room visit without
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256267] a serious adverse event (SAE)under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled orplanned before signing of informed consent.  Howe ver, unexpected
complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769446].Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186223] (i.e., no place tostay, live too fa r away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will not be considered
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].
oPersistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability
to conduct normal life functions
oCongenital anomaly/birth defect.
oImportant medical eventNOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or do require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769447], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize thesubject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one ofthe outcomes above.  Examples of such medical events include allergicbronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or athome, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency.
Unexpected Adverse Reaction:  An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of
which is not consistent with the applicable product information.
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  An
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is
not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or
severity that has been observed.

 7.6. Serious  Adverse Event Reporting – Procedures for Investigators  
7.6.1. Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_1055927] be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety 
within 24 hours  of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event 
that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria).  All serious adverse events that 
the investigator considers related to study drug occurring after [ADDRESS_1055928] be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) system for the study.  When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel 
will be notified electronically and will retrieve the form.  If the event meets serious 
criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to Medpace 
Safety at medpace -safetynotification@medpace.c om or call the Medpace SAE hotline 
(phone number listed below), and fax the completed paper SAE form to Medpace (fax 
number listed below) within [ADDRESS_1055929] Information: Medpace Clinical Safety  
 Medpace SAE hotline – [LOCATION_003]:  
 
 
 
 
7.6.2. Foll
ow-Up Reports  
The investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) 
or the subject dies.  Chronic is defined as a condition lasting >[ADDRESS_1055930] update the 
SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical 
Safety via fax or e- mail.  If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the 
procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs.   
 

Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055931] reported and unsolicited adverse events are to be graded , according  to 
severity , by [CONTACT_6962] .  For this  classification of events, severity is not the 
same as seriousness , which is defined in S ection 7.1.  Severity is an indication of the 
intensity  or a specific even t (e.g., mild, moderate or severe).  Classification of an event 
as serious relates to an event’s outcome or intervention criteria and is usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  An event can be severe but not serious, such as a migraine.   
Using the definitions in  Table 7-1, the site investigator will categorize the severity of a  
solicited or unsolicited  event on the AE eCR F.  If a particular event is not listed on this 
table, the 
NIH/NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events found at online at

7.8. Causality 
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether the AE meets the criteria for classification as an SAE, serious suspected adverse reaction, suspected 
adverse reaction, unexpected adverse event, or unexpected suspected adverse reaction.  
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_325274].  For adverse events with a causal relationship to the IP or the enema procedure, follow-up by [CONTACT_769474] a level acceptable to the investigator.  
The Investigator will make a causality assessment for all AEs and decide whether there 
is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_769475], including an assessment of biolog ic plausibility, p resence or absence of 
alternative causa l explanations (such as continuation or exacerbation of the subject’s 
recurrent CDI symptoms), and temporal relationship to product administration and/or the procedure.  Relatedness to RBX2660 or the enema procedure is defined as: 
 
Unrelated : The event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
concomitant therapy and is not related to the study product or procedure ( e.g., 
has no temporal relationship to study product or procedure, or has a much more 
likely alternative etiology)  
Possible: There is some temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the study product or procedure, though the event could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Probable: The temporal relationship between the event and administration of the 
study product or procedure is suggestive, and the event is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_748]’ medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31540].  
Definite : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the study product or procedure, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study product and/or procedure, improves upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256271], and reappears upon repeated exposure, if that occurs.

RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055935] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 77 
 If an investigator is unsure about whether to report a finding as an adverse event, s/he is 
encouraged to enter the finding as an AE into the study database.   
 
7.9. Pregnancy Reporting  
If the subject or partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during 
the study after  IP administration , the investigator should report the pregnancy to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within [ADDRESS_1055936] or partner should be followed by [CONTACT_769476].  If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify Medpace Clinical Safety.  At the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the outc ome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
 
7.10. Medical Monitor  
An independent Medical Monitor reviews all serious adverse events and other events 
reported by [CONTACT_769477], qualified judgment of the events.  The Medical Monitor is a physician not participating as an investigator in this study.  The Medical Monitor has the 
responsibility to review and evaluate the information relevant to product safety 
throughout the development and implementation of the protocol.  The Medical Monitor will remain blinded throughout the study.  The Medical Monitor performs the following functions: 
 Reviews SAEs and other adverse events as requested;  
 Reviews the study protocol and Investigator’s Brochure for adequa cy of 
safety oversight;  
 Confers with site investigators , DSMB  and the Rebiotix Clinical 
Department as applicable regarding potential safety concerns;  
 Provides medical surveillance and provides appropriate recommendations 
for the conduct of the study as needed. 
 
Details of the Medical monitor activities and expectations will be documented in a 
Safety Management Plan.  
 
 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055937] (DSMB) 
The DSMB consists of three physicians specializing in infectious diseases or 
gastroenterology who have experience managing subjects with recurrent CDI and are not 
investigators in the study . A biostatistician who is not involved with study design or 
analyses may assist  the DSMB.  The DSMB will operate in accordance with applicable 
sections of the FDA Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees.    
Details of the DSMB logistics, activity and responsibilities will be included in a DSMB 
charter.  General responsibilities include oversight of subject safety through data review 
and assessment of trends.  This includes the ability to stop the study based on pre-
defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  Additionally, the DSMB will provide an independent review of the efficacy data to ensure th e benefits of providing this treatment to subjects outweighs 
the risks.   
 
7.12. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_769449], either in severity, seriousness or 
incidence, and to assess if a study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256273].  Adverse event review 
includes the event description, onset date in relation to the treatment date, and the investigator’s determination of causal relatedness to IP, the enema procedure, and pre-existing condition, as well as rating the event’s severity and seriousness.  Additionally, 
the Medical Monitor assessment of seriousness and causality will be provided and 
reviewed as it may be different from the site investigator report of the event.  If 
necessary, t he DSMB may be unblinded to adjudicate specific adverse events as per the 
study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], below.  Anticipated AEs may trigger the study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
The DSMB will determine whether  enrollment should be paused, the study terminated, 
or other actions taken based on their assessment that : 
a) There is probable cause that  IP or enema procedure (e.g., due to transfer 
from an RBX2660 donor) contributed to a pathogenic intestinal infection in 
the stool of any subject, or 
 
b) Any series of events of major significance such as death or other serious 
outcome for which a causal connection with the IP is plausible  represents  
an excess of the important adverse event (s) in one of the study arms. 
 
To support the DSMB assessment , the Rebiotix Operations Department may be asked to 
review the donor history and batch processing/release records for the product unit(s) 
administered in these cases, and forward its report to the DSMB Chair for review.  The DSMB Chair will review the Operations Department report and may be unblinded to the 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055938] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 77 
 randomization assignment.  If probable cause is suspected, the DSMB Chair will 
convene the entire DSMB for event review.   
Upon the DSMB’s determination of action, the Chair will notify the Rebiotix Clinical 
Department, who will notify the study sites.  
If enrollment is stopped, Rebiotix and the study sites will assess for the occurrence of 
similar events, and evaluate IP and study records for possible root cause(s).  Enrollment 
may be re -started upon further review and approval from the DSMB.  As appropri ate, 
the DSMB may recommend study termination or measures short of termination with the objective of reducing the risk of adverse events.   
 
7.13. Sponsor Reporting of Adverse Events  
The sponsor will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions that are fatal or life -threatening as soon as possible to the FDA & 
Health Canada, and in any case no later than seven days after knowledge by [CONTACT_769478] a case, and that relevant follow-up information will subsequently be communicated within an additional eight days.  
All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA as 
soon as possible but within a maximum of [ADDRESS_1055939] knowledge by [CONTACT_456].  
The sponsor will also inform all investigators as required.  
 
7.13.1. Timeline for  Reporting Requirements  
The following describes the expedited safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_85401]:  
 
 Within 7 calendar days of event discovery by [CONTACT_256303] -
threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later 
than seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.   
 Within [ADDRESS_1055940] meet all three of these criteria for expedited reporting. 
Any study event that is : 
o suspected adverse reaction  
o serious 
o unexpected

 7.13.2. Additional Reporting Requirements  
The sponsor will identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning similar 
adverse events and analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous 
reports.  
 
7.13.3. Reporting AEs to FDA and Health Canada 
Rebiotix will report adverse events to FDA and Health Canada as required by [CONTACT_5279].  All adverse events will be reported in the annual and final clinical study 
reports.   
 
 
 
  
8. Sample Size and Statistical Considerations  
This study has a Stat istical Analysis Plan which contains  complete details of the 
statistical methodology and analyses that will be employed for this study.  
 
8.1. Assessment of Efficacy  
The primary efficacy parameter is treatment success, defined as the absence of CDI 
diarrhea  through  8 weeks after completing a study treatment.   Efficacy assessments will 
occur at the 1 -, 4- and 8- week office vis its. 
Recurrence of CDI after 8 weeks from completion of the assigned study treatment is 
considered a new C. difficile infection, as defined  by [CONTACT_13802] 
(CDC website http://www.cdc.gov/hai/eip/cdiff_techinfo.html ; published August 30, 
2012; accessed October 02, 2016).   
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  Recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of blinded treatment. 
 
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be performed on all pre -defined analysis populations 
comparing the RBX2660 arm to the Placebo arm, Intent- to-Treat (ITT) , modified Intent-
to-Treat (mITT)  and Per- Protocol (PP).  However, the determination of meeting the pre-
defined primary efficacy endpoint will utilize the  mITT population results .  The primary 
analysis of the study will be a Bayesian hierarchical model, which formally incorporates 
data from a previou s randomized Phase 2b study (Protocol 2014-01) of RBX2660. This 
analysis will demonstrate the efficacy of RBX2660 by [CONTACT_30432] a sufficiently high 
posterior probability that the rate of success in the treatment group is superior to the rate of success in the control group.   Secondary efficacy endpoints will also be completed on 
all analysis  populations.  Finally, all safety analyses will be performed on the Safety 
Rebiotix Inc .   Phase 3 Study Protocol 2017- 01 
RBX2660 Microbiota Suspension   Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1055942] 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 77 
 population (SP) which includes all subjects in whom a blinded enema was at least 
opened and att empted .   
A primary efficacy and safety analysis for primary efficacy and safety will be conducted 
when 100% of the applicable subjects in each group have completed their 8- week 
follow- up assessment after receiving the blinded treatment.  Safety analysis w ill be 
completed for safety endpoints defined at or prior to [ADDRESS_1055943] has completed the 6-month 
follow-up visit for their study treatment. This includes 6-month follow- up after an 
unblinded RBX2660 study treatment. A t that time the study will be considered 
complete.    
To demonstrate a 69% success with one dose of the RBX2660 treatment group vs. 47% 
success in the Placebo control group in a 2:1 randomization ratio , 240 subjects are 
requi red (power ≥90% with a nominal 2.5% type I error rate ).  Up to an additional 30 
subjects will be enrolled to allow for a 10% loss -to-follow up rate, for a total of up to 
270 subjects.   Considering the 2:[ADDRESS_1055944] signed consent but do not meet all inclusion and/or exclusion criteria will be considered screen failures.  Randomized subjects who withdraw for any reason prior to 
administration of the blinded enema will be replaced without counting toward the 
sample size cap  which may result in more than [ADDRESS_1055945] identification 
numbers (re -randomized).  If this occurs, they will be included in the analysis using their 
second randomization assignment and subsequent assessments only and will only be 
counted once towards the total randomized.

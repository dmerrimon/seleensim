Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_294983] Summary 
Numerous (>40) epi[INVESTIGATOR_243088]. We are presently engaged in a project which tests the hypothesis that treatment of insomnia in 
depressed patients with hypnotic medications will reduce the intensity of suicidal ideation. This ongoing project 
is called Reducing Suicidal Ideation Through Insomnia Treatment (REST-IT). 
 
We have now acquired and analyzed new data since the inception of the present project that reveals that 
nightmares and disturbing dreams are more strongly related to the intensity of suicidal ideation than is 
insomnia itself.  We therefore propose to target treatment of nightmares in suicidal patients experiencing 
nightmares as part of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This new effort is named Reducing Suicidal 
Ideation Through Treatment of Nightmares in PTSD (REST- ON-PTSD) .  REST -ON-PTSD will offer treatment 
with open label selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for PTSD, or open label treatment for bipolar 
disorder, combined with randomization to prazosin  versus placebo. SSRIs are the only medications approved 
by [CONTACT_243104], while prazosin is the best-practice pharmacologic treatment for 
nightmares.{Aurora, 2010 1365 /id}  REST -ON-PTSD is designed to be a small, randomized controlled clinical 
trial intended to generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_243089], with the following Specific Aims: 
 
Primary Aim:   We will estimate the effect size of prazosin on the intensity of suicidal ideation in PTSD 
outpatients with nightmares and disturbing dreams .  
Hypothesis 1.  Prazosin, combined with an SSRI  or open label treatment for bipolar disorder, will reduce 
suicidal ideation in suicidal PTSD outpatients who have nightmares and disturbing dreams. 
 
Secondary Aim : We will estimate the effect size of prazosin in reducing the intensity of nightmares and 
disturbing dreams in suicidal PTSD outpatients with nightmares and disturbing dreams.  
Hypothesis 2.  Prazosin, combined with a SSRI or open label treatment for bipolar disorder, will reduce the 
intensity of nightmares and disturbing dreams in suicidal PTSD outpatients with nightmares and disturbing 
dreams 
 
Tertiary Aims: We will assess the safety of prazosin in the treatment of suicidal PTSD outpatients with 
nightmares and disturbing dreams . We will assess the impact of prazosin in salivary amylase, which is a test of 
systemic adrenergic tone. 
 
Impact on the Field This application has the potential to change providers’ practice in the approach to treating 
PTSD patients with mild-moderate suicidal ideation. Physicians have limited options in pharmacologic 
approaches to reduce suicide risk. The success of prazosin in reducing suicidal ideation in PTSD patients 
would be a novel strategy for a serious public health problem with few known solutions.

 3. RESEARCH STRATEGY  
3.a. Significance 
Suicide is a leading cause of death across all ages and occurs at a rate of 10-11 cases per 100,000 persons 
per year in the U SA.{Mann, 2005 819 /id}   It is the third-leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_003] in those under  30 
years of age.{Mann, 2005 819 /id} Across the world, the rank order of suicide in global mortality has risen 
between [ADDRESS_294984] in cause of death. An estimated 883,000 persons died by 
[CONTACT_243105] 2010. {Lozano, 2012 1364 /id} Most suicides occur in the context of an active 
psychiatric disorder.{Mann, 2005 819 /id}  
 
Suicide rates in the US military have drawn recent scrutiny as it has been revealed that more American service 
men died of suicide in [ADDRESS_294985] age-adjusted disproportionate risk, and that Iraq deployment indicates  an 
especially high risk.{Krysinka, 2010 1373 /id;Rozanov, 2012 1376 /id} The standard mortality ratio (SMR) for 
the entire US Army was actually lower than expected until 2008, at which time the SMR exceeded 100, and in 
2009 the SMR was estimated at 115.3 (95% CI 113.5-117.1).{Behavioral and Social Health Outcomes 
Program, 2012 1378 /id} 
 
At least some of this elevated risk among returning war veterans is believed to be explained by [CONTACT_447]-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD), a mental disorder distinguished by [CONTACT_243106], heightened 
physiologic arousal, and emotional numbing. Again, there is some debate as to whether PTSD is linked to 
excess suicide death, but there is a consensus that it is linked to elevated suicidal ideation and suicide 
attempts, and {Krysinka, 2010 1373 /id;Rozanov, 2012 1376 /id} during Vietnam PTSD represented a 4-fold 
increased risk for suicide.{Rozanov, 2012 1376 /id}   Although >50% of persons with PTSD also meet criteria 
for MDD,{Post, 2011 1372 /id} and while the risk of suicide is further amplified by [CONTACT_243107] (MDD), PTSD is still an independent risk factor for suicide.{Krysinka, 2010 1373 
/id;Rozanov, 2012 1376 /id}  
 
Risk factors for suicide include both unmodifiable and some potentially modifiable factors.{Maris, 2002 1011 
/id;Coryell, 2005 674 /id;Brown, 2000 314 /id}   Examples of unmodifiable factors are advancing age, male 
gender, and Caucasian ethnicity . Potentially modifiable risk factors include symptoms of depression, 
hopelessness, social isolation, active alcohol/substance use, and severe sleep disturbance.  As a predictor, 
insomnia is stronger than a specific suicide plan in predicting near-lethal suicide attempts,{Hall, 1999 801 /id} 
yet sleep disorder is often overlooked in reviews of risk factors for suicide and suicide prevention.{Oquendo, 
1997 1019 /id}   The need to broaden the search for modifiable risk factors is epi[INVESTIGATOR_243090]: “nowhere is the lack of proven therapeutic methods greater than in the prevention of suicidal 
behavior.”{Oquendo, 2003 1018 /id} 
 
As we have reviewed elsewhere,{McCall W Vaughn, 2011 1253 /id;McCall, 2010 1193 /id;McCall WV, 2013 
1475 /id} >60 research studies link insomnia to suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, or suicide death, including 
>40 studies in adults. {Barraclough, 1975 926 /id;Agargun, 1997 805 /id;Agargun, 1997 8 /id;Agargun, 1998

2003 828 /id;McCall, 2010 1193 /id}  Insomnia and nightmares were the most common sleep disturbances 
associ
ated with suicide, even after adjusting for severity of depression. Five studies were prospective a nd 
showed that insomnia was a risk for suicide death.  {Fawcett, 1990 76 /id;Tanskanen, 2001 797 /id;Fujino, 2005 809 
 
Version Date : April 6, 2015   4 
 /id;Turvey, 2002 397 /id;Bjerkeset, 2011 1246 /i d}  The clinical association of insomnia, nightmares, and suicidal 
ideation is paralleled by [CONTACT_243108], among depressed outpatients, there is an inverse 
relationship between REM sleep latency and intensity of suicidal ideation.{Agargun, 2003 828 /id} A higher rate 
of depressed patients report unpleasant dreams (39%) as compared with persons who are not depressed 
(14%), even when both the depressed and nondepressed persons share similar life circumstances.{Cartwright, 
1996 1371 /id}  Whether the depressing dreams of depressed patients are conceptually the same as the 
nightmares of PTSD is unclear, although it is clear that bad dreams are a risk factor for suicidal ideation, 
independent of a PTSD diagnosis.{Nadorff, 2011 1197 /id}  
 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a mainstay treatment for PTSD, and two of these, sertraline 
and paroxetine, are FDA approved for PTSD.  However, SSRIs do not address all PTSD-symptoms equally 
well. For example, SSRIs are beneficial for symptoms like irritability, and but do less for sleep 
disturbance.{Baker, 2009 1375 /id} Abnormal, elevated activity within the brain’s noradrenergic system is 
believed to play a role in the symptoms of hyper-arousal, such as nightmares, and SSRIs do not directly impact 
the noradrenergic system.{Krystal, 2009 1374 /id} In contrast, FDA-approved, foundational treatments for 
bipolar disorder include lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], asenapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ziprasidone, 
lurasidone ,and the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-fluoxetine combination.[ADDRESS_294986]-practice pharmacologic treatment for 
nightmares is prazosin.{Aurora, 2010 1365 /id} Prazosin is an α 1 adrenergic receptor blocker approved for use 
as an antihypertensi ve. The cardiovascular effects of the drug were fully characterized more than 30 years 
ago.{Colucci, 1982 1369 /id} The drug is slowly titrated starting with 1-mg capsules in order to minimize the risk 
of hypotension, with an average dose of 6-[ADDRESS_294987] common side effects at these doses are: dizziness 10.3%, headache 7.8%, 
drowsiness 7.6%, lack of energy 6.9%, weakness 6.5%, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] 5.3%, and nausea 4.9%.   
 
A number of randomized controlled comparisons of prazosin have proven that prazosin is superior to placebo 
in reducing nightmares. These studies have been primarily in the study of PTSD- related nightmares, with some 
preliminary information suggesting that prazosin may also reduce non-nightmare awakenings in PTSD 
patients.{Thompson, 2008 1367 /id} The most recent large study of prazosin for PTSD-related nightmares in 
American soldiers found that a mean bedtime dose of 15.6 + 6.0 mg in men, and 7.0 + 3.[ADDRESS_294988] common side effects in this study were lightheadedness (25% versus 20% for placebo) and 
nasal congestion (22% versus 11% for placebo).{Raskind, 2013 1474 /id} 
 
3.b. The theoretical model 
One of the favored models for the etiology of insomnia posits that hyperarousal leads to sleep loss. In other 
words, it is not the sleep machinery that is broken in insomnia, but rather an awake system that is in overdrive 
and is inhibiting the expression of sleep, via an overactive sympathetic nervous system.{Bonnet, 2010 1366 
/id} The hyperarousal model of primary insomnia resonates with hypervigilence and hyperstartle reactions as 
core symptoms of PTSD, and is congruent with the finding that these sympathetic-autonomic symptoms are 
relieved by [CONTACT_243109], an α [ADDRESS_294989] for insomnia, nightmares, and suicide risk. Therefore, our theoretical model (Figure 1, below) 
is that treatment of nightmares and disturbing dreams with an α 1 adrenergic receptor blocker leads to reduc ed 
intensity of suicidal ideation.

The expert workshop on suicide prevention concluded that “randomized controlled trials of 
psychopharmacology are needed in suicide prevention studies.”{Mann, 2005 819 /id} Targeted treatment of 
nightmares may represent one such avenue. We show in our Preliminary Studies that (1) the relationship 
between sleep disturbance and suicidal ideation holds true within the context of depression clinical trials, (2) 
nightmares and disturbing dreams about sleep mediate risk for suicidal ideation in insomniacs.  
 
 
 
3.c. Innovation 
We reported the first clinical trial examining insomnia and suicide risk.{McCall, 2010 1193 /id}   While all 
pharmacologic interventions targeting suicide risk are innovative and important, targeting nightmares as a 
modifiable risk factor for suicidal ideation is especially innovative. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_243091], there are no completed psychopharmacology trials targeting nightmares 
for suicide risk reduction.  Our ongoing study, REST-IT, is the first multi-site intervention for insomnia as a 
means to reduce suicidal ideation in depressed, suicidal, insomniacs. The present proposal, REST- ON-PTSD , 
will target treatment for nightmares and disturbing dreams as a second avenue for reducing suicidal ideation. 
We will test the impact of prazosin on suicidal thinking, and as part of our innovation, we will test whether 
improvement is mediated via reduction in nightmares and disturbing dreams.    
 
3.d. How this project will improve knowledge and practice 
This project is consistent with the August 2010 Report of the National Advisory Mental Health Council’s 
Workgroup, “From Discovery to Cure”, which emphasized the importance of advancing ‘personalized 
treatment’ and ‘preemptive treatment’ (page 3).{Leon, 1999 1256 /id} The emphasis of this Report is evident in 
our proposal as we identify nightmares as a symptom of particular relevance in some, but not a ll suicidal 
patients, and deserving of targeted intervention, leading to a preemptive reduction in nightmares and disturbing 
dreams, and presumably, suicidal ideation. In Recommendation 2.4.1, the Report also calls for support for 
clinical trials which sho w that (a) “the adaptation [i.e., intervention] changes a factor [nightmares] that has been 
associated with ….partial response [suicidal ideation], and (b) clear explication of the mechanism by [CONTACT_243110] [nightmares] functions to disadvantage… a subgroup [suicidal PTSD outpatients with 
nightmares].  This project meets the needs expressed in the Report. 
 
3.e. Approach 
 
3.e.1  Preliminary Studies 
Relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation during a 10-week clinical trial   
We consented 60 depressed insomniacs to participate in a study examining the value of adding a hypnotic 
medication to a SSRI.{McCall, 2010 1149 /id}  After a week of baseline assessment, patients received one 
week of open-label fluoxetine (FLX) monotherapy, starting at 20 mg in the morning. Patients still reported 
insomnia after one week of FLX and continued on with 8 more weeks of open label FLX, and were also 
randomized to also receive either the hypnotic eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] ( ESZ) 3 mg or placebo given on a double-blind 
 
Version Date : April 6, 2015   6 
 basis at bedtime. Patients who still had a 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD24) {Hamilton, 
1960 371 /id} >15 at the end of 4 weeks of randomized treatment could choose to take 40 mg FLX for the next 
4 weeks. Study endpoints included measures of sleep, mood, and suicidal ideation . Insomnia severity was 
graded by [CONTACT_117669] (ISI).{Bastien, 2001 639 /id} Suicidal ideation was measured with the 
Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI). {Beck, 1979 18 /id;Beck, 1997 19 /id;Beck, 1999 20 /id} 
 
Participants were 18-70 years old, with either (a) sleep latency > 30 minutes and sleep efficiency < 85% at 
least 4 nights per week. {Edinger, 2004 553 /id}   All participants met a DSM-IV diagnosis of unipolar MDE per 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), {American Psychiatric Association, 1994 286 /id} and a 
HRSD 24 score > 20. {Hamilton, 1960 371 /id}   All participants completed one night of baseline polysomnogram 
(PSG ) which showed no clinically significant sleep apnea (Apnea/Hypopneas index >15) or Periodic Limb 
Movement Disorder (PLM arousal index >15), following standard measurement procedures described 
elsewhere. {McCall, 2009 1052 /id}    
 
The average age of the randomized sample was 41.5 + 12.5 years, and 66% were women, with 23.2% 
minorities. At baseline, the average HRSD24 score was 27.1 + 3.9, and the average ISI score was 20.7 + 4.0.  
Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) scores were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models for repeated 
measures with predictor variables being insomnia (ISI scores), the mood item, and the anhedonia item from 
the HRSD24. Baseline SSI was 3.7 + 5.2, with 55% having a SSI score >1, and 37% of patients having a SSI 
score > 3.  
 
The model with ISI as the predictor for SSI was significant with the regression coefficient corresponding to ISI 
being positive (β=0.0 55, SE=0.02, p<0.01). Other univariate models found that the depressed mood item was 
also a significant predictor of suicidal ideation (p<0.005), but anhedonia was not a predictor of suicidal ideation 
(p=0.9). A multivariate model simultaneously including both the insomnia and the depressed mood items found 
that both were independent predictors of suicidal ideation (both p<0.05). Our findings confirm that the intensity 
of insomnia predicts intensity of suicidal ideas during a clinical trial of MDE, even after adjusting for depressed 
mood and anhedonia.{McCall, 2010 1193 /id}  
 
Suicidal ideation is mediated by [CONTACT_243111] a new study w e have recently reported that the relationship between insomnia and suicide is mediated 
through nightmares and disturbing dreams.{McCall, 2013 1348 /id} We collected cross-sectional data on 50 
adults (mean 55 y.o.) in various stages of active depression or recovery, including 16 psychiatric inpatients and 
23 outpatients and 11 emergency psychiatry patients . Bad dreams were measured with the Disturbing Dreams 
and Nightmare Severity Scale (DDNSI), while the intensity of suicidal ideation was measured with Scale for 
Suicide Ideation ( SSI).{Beck, 1979 18 /id;Beck, 1997 19 /id;Beck, 1999 20 /id} DDNSI was significantly related 
to SSI (r=0. 60, p<0.001), and in a mediation analysis we found that the relationship between insomnia and 
suicidal ideation was in fact mediated in part by [CONTACT_243112]. These results support the 
premise that nightmares mediate insomnia as a risk factor for suicidal ideation in depressed patients. Using a 
rece
iver operating curve, we also found that emergency psychiatry patients are best discriminated from 
outpatients by a Scale for Suicide Ideation score of 16, and while the outpatients and emergency patients were 
best separated by a Disturbing Dreams and Nightmare Severity Scale score of 6 (p<0.001). 
 
METHODS OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL 
 
3.e.2. OVERVIEW 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_112545] [ADDRESS_294991] been on a stable dose of FDA-approved treatment for bipolar disorder

3.e.3.  Participants 
Inclusion criteria:   Participants are 18-[ADDRESS_294993]

 History of hypotension 
 Automatic Blood Pressure readings with systolic BP <90, or diastolic <50, either sitting or standing.  
 Planned use of sildenafil , tadalafil, or similar erectile dysfunction medications 
 
3.e.4. Treatm ent  
Dose finding during randomized care  
Participants who pass all screening and baseline-week assessments immediately begin one capsule of 
prazosin 1 mg capsule or a placebo . Study drug will be taken at bedtime. Participants will be called by [CONTACT_3449]-
staff after two nights, and if participants do not appreciate an improvement in their disturbing dreams and 
nightmares after 2 nights, then they are allowed to increase their bedtime study drug to two capsules, following 
the design of Raskind et al (Table 1). {Raskind, 2013 1474 /id}  
REST -ON participants return to the clinic each week for routine follow up and assessment of treatment 
response, BP, and adverse events. If the patient and research physician judge the benefit of study drug to be 
inadequate for sleep continuity or nightmares, then the dose may be increased according to the titration 
schedule below. At any point during the medication titration, upward dosages will not be permitted if: systolic 
BP <90, or diastolic <50, either sitting or standing, or if the patient has felt faint or near-syncopal, or has had a 
syncopal attack.  The final research visit will be at the end of the eighth week of randomized treatment, and 
decisions will be finalized at that time of transition to care as usual.

Participants will be asked to bring all remaining study drug to the next visit to estimate adherence and 
medication usage rates. At the time of the second dispensation at the end of week-one of randomized care, 
participants will be eligible to increase the dose according to the titration schedule, with additional capsules   
 
Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_294997] the one-week 
timeframe. Of course, the number of capsules will be less in the event that (1) a lower dosage was found to be 
effective in treating nightmares in the first week, or (2) there are side effects or hypotension at lower doses.  
 
Randomization and blinding 
Randomization of the 20 participants will be accomplished with blocked randomization: 5 blocks of two patients 
each. Blinding will be single blind, as the placebo we will use will be a generic lactose-filled capsule, and we 
will not attempt to create a matching placebo for the purposes of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Our reasons for not making a 
matching placebo are as follows: (1) prazosin is generic and the physical appearance of the prazosin capsules 
may be subject to change, (2) the vast majority of participants will not know what generic prazosin looks like 
and hence will remain blind even if the placebo does not look like generic prazosin, (3) our most important 
outcome measures are self-report measures and hence not subject to investigator bias, (4) from prior 
experience, we have learned that creation of matching placebos would incur a minimum expense of about 
$[ADDRESS_294998] who is not involved in the patient’s care during the study, and depending 
upon randomized assignment and the response to treatment under randomized assignment, the patient will 
then have the option of receiving a prazosin prescription at the end of the trial until they re-enter usual care. 
While study drug and doctor’s visits were provided to the participants at no cost during randomization, the cost 
of medications and doctor’s visits will be borne by [CONTACT_243114]. Weekly phone calls will be made after the last visit until the patient has connected with their 
care provider.   
  
 
   
3.e.5 . Measurement of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
The Scale for Suicide Ideation ( SSI) consists of 19 items that evaluate active suicidal desire, specific 
plans for suicide, and passive suicidal desire.{Beck, 1979 18 /id;Beck, 1997 19 /id;Beck, 1999 20 /id} Each 
item is rated by [CONTACT_128762] a 3-point scale from 0 to 2 for a maximum score of 38; a lower score indicat es 
less severe suicidal ideation.   The SSI will be collected at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, and 4 of randomized 
treatment, and once by [CONTACT_243115].  An SSI score >2 
predicts increased risk for suicide death over a period of years.{Brown, 2000 314 /id} The SSI will be collected 
at the start of each visit, before the participant is seen by [CONTACT_243116].  
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS) {Oquendo, 2003 1195 /id} is based upon the 
Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment(C- CASA) .{Posner, 2007 932 /id} This C-SSRS is 
used by [CONTACT_243117], and includes a structured assessment of past or recent 
suicidal behavior.  It will be administered at each visit by a study psychiatrist blinded to treatment assignment. 
C-CASA has excellent inter-rater reliability in classifying suicide attempts, with an overall intra-class correlation 
coefficient of 0.89. 
 
3.e.[ADDRESS_294999]-specific version (PCL-S). The PCL-
S has been shown to have excellent test-retest, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity 
(versus depression), and good sensitivity to change.{Wilkins, 2011 1382 /id} Each participant will complete this 
self-report scale. 
 
3.e.7 . Measurement of Depression 
Depression severity will be tracked by [CONTACT_63634]-rated 24- item HRSD. {Hamilton, 1960 371 /id;Beck, 1988

baseline and thereafter at weeks 1, 2, and 4 of randomized treatment.   Research staff will demonstrate inter-
rater reliability > 0.[ADDRESS_295001] a criterion-set of clinical videotapes.   The HRSD 24 has three sleep items and 
one suicide item. The HRSD will be recorded as the total score (HRSD24), and will also be analyzed without 
the three sleep items or the suicide item (HRSD20).  The three insomnia items and the suicide item will be 
separately examined. 
 
3.e.8 . Measurement of nightmares: The Disturbing Dreams and Nightmare Severity Scale 
The frequency and intensity of disturbing dreams and nightmares will be measured with the Disturbing Dreams 
and Nightmare Severity Scale (DDNSI). This scale is derivative of a simpler Nightmare Frequency 
Questionnaire that had a test-retest weighted kappa>0.85.{Krakow, 2002 813 /id} The revised DDNSI has 
good internal consistency with a Cohen’s alpha >0.80.{Bernert, 2005 798 /id;Bernert, 2009 1044 /id} A DDNSI 
score >10 indicates a clinical nightmare disorder. {Krakow, 2002 1368 /id} Each participant will complete this 
self-report scale.  
 
3.e.9. Measurement of insomnia: The Insomnia Severity Index 
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a 7-item self-report measure that examines the intensity of distress 
associated with night-time and daytime symptoms of insomnia. It is well validated and we have used it 
extensively in our own research. We have no a prior hypotheses regarding the ISI scale, but include it primarily 
to provide a complete description of sleep symptoms. {Bastien, 2001 639 /id} 
 
3.e.[ADDRESS_295002] ‘never’, and anchored on the right end with the word ‘always’. The 
participant will be asked to make a single mark on each of several VAS lines relevant to each of the following 
dimensions of their dreams: 
 Repetitive sameness of the dream plot from night- to-night 
 Dream content is related to prior real-life traumatic event 
 Likelihood of awakening from the dream 
 Feeling sad during or after the dream 
 Feeling scared during or after the dream 
 Feeling angry during or after the dream

of standing. BP will be measured with an approved automated BP machine.  
 
3.e.12 Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global  Impression-Improvement (CGI- I) 
The participants’ overall clinical status and response to treatment will be assessed with the CGI-S and CGI-I. 
Both scales will be rated along a 7-point dimension. The CGI-S and CGI-I will be completed by a study 
psychiatrist. The CGI-S will be scored from “Normal” to “Among the most severely ill”, while the CGI-S will be 
scored from “Very much improved” to “very much worse” The CGI-S will be completed at baseline and at all 
randomized treatment visits, while the CGI-I will be completed only during post-randomization treatment visits.  
 
3.e.13. Salivary amylase 
In humans, α-amylase levels are highest in pancreatic and salivary secretions. Increased salivary amylase 
activity is a marker for increased sympathetic  nervous system activity.{Nater, 2009 1466 /id}  We will collec t 
samples of saliva at baseline and each follow up visit. The tubes containing the samples will be vortexed, 
centrifuged at 2000xg at 4 C for 10 minutes, and the saliva will be aliquoted and frozen at -80C for future

 analysis. On the day of the assay, the samples will be thawed and will be centrifuged once more to assure that 
solids are removed from suspension. Salivary amylase activity will be determined using the Amylase Activity 
Assay kit (Sigma). In this kit, amylase activity is determined using a coupled enzymatic assay, which results in 
a colorimetric 
(405nm) 
product, 
proportional to 
the amount of 
substrate, 
ethylidene-pNP-
G7, cleaved by

 and disturbing dreams.  These models will be used to obtain estimates of the treatment effects (the changes in 
the outcome measure from baseline to end of randomization), estimates of the variability of the outcome 
measures at each time adjusted for baseline measures, and estimates of the within patient correlations over 
time.  These estimates will be used in the design of a subsequent adequately-powered randomized clinical 
trial.  Regression diagnostics, residual plots, and exploratory analyses will be done to find appropriate 
transformations to satisfy the 1) linearity, 2) homogeneity of variances, and 3) normality assumptions.  While 
we assume compound symmetry for the correlation among repeated measures, we will also consider other 
covariance patterns. We will also assess the correlation amongst all the measures collected over time. While 
our sample size is small, we will also use a mediation analysis to determine the degree to which nightmares 
are responsible for (or mediate) the changes in suicidal ideation.{Baron, 1986 1126 /id}-{MacKinnon, 2004 
1260 /id;Efron, 1979 1261 /id}    
 
3.g. Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_243094] 
 
 Alternatives to Prazosin: Clonidine has been reported to have some effect in reducing nightmares but is 
generally described as less effective than prazosin. In contrast, prazosin is the best-practice pharmacologic 
treatment for nightmares is prazosin.{Aurora, 2010 1365 /id} Some psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_243095], notably imagery rehearsal therapy.{Hansen, 2013 1370 /id} However, this 
approach is unlikely to be adopted by [CONTACT_243120]. This approach may well prove to 
be useful but deserves its own separate line of inquiry. 
 
Conclusions and Future Directions 
Results from this project will provide a first clue as to whether a SSRI -prazosin combination treatment is a 
candidate treatment for reducing the intensity of suicidal ideation in PTSD patients. If so, it opens the possibility 
that other forms of nightmare treatment (i.e., imagery rehearsal therapy) may also have benefit. This project 
will also provide support for hypothetical mechanisms explaining the association between nightmares and 
suicidal ideation. 
 
Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_295006]- ON-PTSD are intended to:  (1) yield a sample with PTSD associated 
with suicidality, and (2) exclude patients who might be harmed by [CONTACT_243121][INVESTIGATOR_1102], including 
pregnant women. Three procedures are used to assure participant safety at the baseline assessment: the Mini 
Mental State Exam (MMSE),{Folstein, 1975 78 /id} a pregnancy test for women of conception age, and a 
baseline Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)  score. 
 
 A MMSE score < 24 is statistically abnormal at any age and is consistent with global cognitive deficits such as 
seen in dementia.{Crum, 1993 313 /id}    
 
All women of child bearing age will complete a urine pregnancy test at the first face to face visit. Persons 
excluded because of overly intense suicidal ideation (C-SSRS suicidal ideation score >3 ) will be evaluated for 
safety and perhaps the need for psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
The additional subject exclusion factors are: 
 History of sensitivity or allergy to prazosin or quinazolines 
 History of fainting or syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_243093] 6 months 
 History of hypotension 
 Automatic Blood Pressure readings with systolic BP <90, or diastolic <50, either sitting or standing.  
 Planned use of sildenafil, tadalafil, or similar erectile dysfunction medication 
 
 
6.b.  Recruitment and Consent Procedures    
 
6.b.1. Recruitment      
 
6.b.2.  Consent procedures  The Project Manager will describe the overall study design, and will detail the 
time commitment required from the participant. T he project manager provides a copy of the consent form, 
allowing enough time for the participant to read the consent form and ask questions, and sign the consent 
form. We will assure the capacity of each patient to understand the risks and benefits of participation by 
[CONTACT_243122] (ESC). The ESC was developed by [CONTACT_243123] 
1988 (unpublished; as cited in Deronzo, Conley, & Love, 1998).{Deronzo, 1998 1446 /id}  The ESC assesses 
the factual understanding of subjects, is composed of five items, and can be adapted to any research design.  
 
6.c. Potential risks 
The risks of participating in this project are related to prazosin. The primary risk from prazosin is orthostatic 
hypotension. Prazosin is an α 1 adrenergic receptor blocker approved for use as an antihypertensive. The 
cardiovascular effects of the drug were fully characterized more than 30 years ago.{Colucci, 1982 1369 /id} It 
generally has no effect on heart rate. The most common side effects as these doses in hypertensive patients 
are: dizziness 10.3%, headache 7.8%, drowsiness 7.6%, lack of energy 6.9%, weakness 6.5%, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] 
5.3%, and nausea 4.9%. The most common side effects (>5%) when given to patients with PTSD are:  
lightheadedness 25%, nasal congestion 22%, and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] (6%).{Raskind, 2013 1474 /id} We will manage 
the risk of hypotension by [CONTACT_243124] a history of fainting or syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_243093] 6 
months, history of hypotension, or automatic Blood Pressure readings with systolic BP <90, or diastolic <50, 
either sitting or standing. The risk of side effects might be severe if the patient took an intentional overdose, 
 
Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_295007] a low acute toxicity.{Lip, 1995 1447 /id} 
 
 
6.d. Safeguards 
 
 
The Star*D trial was among the first NIH-sponsored trials to follow the 2001 NIH guidelines for studies which 
included patients at risk of suicide. http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/suicide-prevention/issues- to-
consider- in-intervention-research-with-persons- at-high-risk-for-suicidality.shtml  {Nierenberg, 2004 924 /id}   
The guidelines have several stipulations, and we have responded accordingly: 
1) “Provide specific inclusion criteria and their measurement with regards to suicidality” 
 
Response: Patients included in the study will have a Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) scores >3 but with C-
SSRS suicidal ideation scores of <3. This range defines patients with mild and moderate suicidal 
ideation, but with no intent to commit suicide. This inclusion range for suicidal ideation is consistent with 
prior clinical trials of suicidal patients.  {Brown, 2005 1468 /id;Grunebaum, 2012 1470 /id}  
“Specify the criteria for withdrawal from the treatment trial with regard to increased suicidality, increased 
related symptoms, lack of treatment response, and treatment side effects, and what alternative treatment 
or referral will be offered.” 
 
Response: The decision to withdraw the participant from research treatment will be based upon either the 
participant’s view or the research psychiatrist’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_243096], is 
at imminent risk for suicide, or is functionally decompensating.  The clinician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_243097], the PCL-S, and the C- SSRS , but the decision to withdraw a participant will be 
based upon a combination of psychometrics along with global clinical judgment.  If a participant is 
withdrawn from the study, then he or she will be offered care- as-usual, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17116].    
 
2) “Consider and establish criteria for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], where the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243098], and the 
procedures within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243099]” 
 
Response: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243100], is functionally 
decompensated, or needs specialized treatment outside of the protocol (such as ECT), according to the 
global clinical judgment of the study psychiatrist. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243101], or East Central Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or similar regional facility. 
 
 
3) “Describe procedures in the protocol for managing increases in suicidality, and how research staff is 
trained and available to provide clinical management” 
 
Response: Managing increases in suicidality is predicated upon detection of such increases. Although we 
proposed to examine participants weekly, we recognize that suicidal ideation may emerge suddenly and 
unpredictably. Therefore, research staff will make at least one mid-week phone call to each participant for 
the first [ADDRESS_295008], the participant will complete the  
 
Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_295009] will administer the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS ), allowing fo r a thorough review for the presence of any self-injurious behavior since the last visit 
or the development of any preparatory suicidal planning, as categorized by [CONTACT_941] C- SSRS.{Oquendo, 2003 
1195 /id}   Patients judged by [CONTACT_243125], have smaller supplies of research medication, or may be withdrawn from the 
study and possibly hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
 
4) “Have a procedure for emergency coverage that is clearly understood by [CONTACT_243126], study 
participants, and families” 
 
Response: At the time of consent, participants will receive clear instructions for how to reach study staff 
during the daytime, and how to access after-hours coverage as provided through each site . Psychiatry 
residents- in–training who receive emergency calls from participants after-hours will be instructed to call the 
local principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97318], regardless of the time of day. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_17780]-I will be 
continuously available to the respective on-call residents to guide crisis management and assess for the 
primary suicidal endpoints, if necessary by [CONTACT_648]. 
 
5) “As part of the consent process, consider having explicit discussion with relevant family members, 
guardians, or friends that includes the risks inherent when study participants are suicidal (risk of death, side 
effects of treatment)” 
 
Response: Involvement of the participant’s family will be encouraged, starting by [CONTACT_243127]- to-face screening visit.  
 
6) “Consider and identify the limits of confidentiality with respect to suicidality, as well as other circumstances” 
 
Response: When a participant has emergent suicidality defined as an increase of 6-points (one standard 
deviation of SSI scores in Dr McCall’s outpatients), we will inform the participant of our intent to share this 
with the relevant family, and the consent form will reflect this. 
 
7) “Consider the impact of suicidality on the study participant’s capacity to give informed consent” 
 
Response: Consent will be obtained only from persons who normally would not meet criteria for emergent 
psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], i.e., C-SSRS suicidal ideation score < 4 .  
 
8) “Determine whether additional safeguards are needed to ensure the safety of the study participants” 
 
Response: No additional safeguards needed 
 
9) “Consider situations in which a trial would be terminated prematurely” 
 
Response: As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_243102] [ADDRESS_295010] no statistical endpoints for early 
termination of the study. However, the trial would be terminated prematurely only if the Medical Monitor 
determined that there was a systematic increase in risk, according to the Data Safety Monitoring Plan, 
 
Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_295011]. McCall is the principal investigator.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported immediately 
to [CONTACT_10017]. Otherwise [CONTACT_243135] will review the case report forms for the Scale for Suicide Ideation, vital signs, 
and AEs after the third and sixth patients are completed.  
 
6.f. Confidentiality of subjects’ responses   
All participants are assured of confidentiality of the information obtained during their participation, with the 
exception of the expression of imminent suicidality. We will make every attempt to secure the participant’s 
permission to share a high risk of suicide with the participant’s family. All participants are assigned a subject 
number for the internal purposes of the research, and the patients’ identity on Case Report Forms is indicated 
only by [CONTACT_243128].  Case Report Forms are locked in the research offices of the principal 
investigators. Original source documents relevant to the delivery of clinical care are kept in the patient file 
office of the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavio r which is continuously staffed or locked, and these 
clinic files do not circulate beyond the Department. Participants will be advised that confidentiality could be 
breached in the event of an audit by [CONTACT_243129]. 
 
 6.g. Research procedures    
Risks of teratogenicity will be limited by [CONTACT_19201] a pregnancy test from each women of childbearing potential 
before exposure to the first week of outpatient treatment and by [CONTACT_243130]. 
Pregnancy will be an exclusion criterion for study entry or for continued study participation. The research 
procedures include weekly assessment of suicidal ideation (the SSI and C- SSRS ) and side effects related to 
medication. A study psychiatrist will examine each participant weekly during routine study visits and will 
clinically assess the risk of suicide. Participants judged to be at imminent risk of suicide will be managed as 
described above. Participants will only be given enough study medication to last until their next research visit.  
The principal investigators or designated co-Is will be available 24-hours per day by [CONTACT_243131] a participant’s medical emergency for the entire duration of the trial. Subjects will be provided with a 
business sized card to carry in their wallets. This card will include contact [CONTACT_243132]. In addition, it will include a 24-hour number to call in case of emergency. This number will put 
the subject in touch with the Resident- On-Call provided by [CONTACT_243133] . 
The Resident will be able to put the subject in touch with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_243103].  
 
 
6.h. Risk/benefit ratio  
6.h.1.  Risks  
Emergent suicidal ideation or behavior is a risk of mental disorders . We have operationalized emergent 
suicidal ideation as a 6-point increase. These risks will be discussed with the participant as part of the consent 
process. The risk of a fatal outcome from a suicide attempt is mitigated by [CONTACT_243134]. 
The likelihood of side effects related to prazosin is primarily hypotension and fainting. The risk of side effects 
might be severe if the patient took an intentional overdose, although limited reports of overdose suggest a low 
acute toxicity.{Lip, 1995 1447 /id}  Mechanisms will be in place to mitigate suicide risk. 
 
Version Date : April 6, [ADDRESS_295012] to the patient. Treatment of nightmares should 
bring lessened psychic distress and perhaps lessen suicidal risk. The frequency and intensity of patient 
monitoring for suicidal thinking is greater than that seen in routine care, and is an additional benefit. The overall 
benefit/risk ratio in this clinical trial is highly favorable, with a large potential impact upon public health policy in 
the management of depression with insomnia. 
 
6.i Gender and minority recruitment   
It is expected that women will constitute approximately 50% of the sample , since women represent both the 
majority of persons suffering w ith either depression or insomnia.   Minorities, chiefly African -Americans, will 
comprise approximately 15% of the total sample .

 2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 NKTR-102 
NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) is a long acting topoisomerase I inhibitor polymer conjugate that 
was engineered by [CONTACT_329627] a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer using 
a biodegradable linker.  Irinotecan is releas ed from NKTR-102 following administration and 
further metabolized to the active metabolite,  7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), which 
causes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage through the inhibition of topoisomerase 1.   
The goal in designing NKTR-102 was to attenuate or  eliminate some of the limiting side effects 
of irinotecan while improving e fficacy by [CONTACT_329628].  The size and structure of NKTR-102 results in  a marked alteration of the pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of SN38 derived from NKTR-102 co mpared with that following irinotecan:  the 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reduced  5- to 10-fold, and the apparent elimination 
half-life (t ½) of SN38 is increased from [ADDRESS_407231] va sculature, possibly accoun ting for relatively higher 
concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites in tumor tissues in in vivo animal 
models, where the local vasculature may be re latively more permeable.  A single dose of 
145 mg/m2 NKTR-102, the dose used in the Phase [ADDRESS_407232] can cer (MBC) clinical 
study (BEACON trial), results in approximately  the same plasma exposure (area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]) to SN38 as a 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but 
exposure is protracted, resulti ng in continuous exposure between  dosing cycles and a lower C max.  
NKTR-102 is therefore being developed as a ne w chemotherapeutic agent that may improve 
tolerability and patient outcome.   
2.1.1 Description of Nonclinical Studies 
Nonclinical experience is summarized in  the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
2.1.2 Clinical Experience with NKTR-102 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1 Study 06-IN-IR001 (Single-Agent NKTR-102) 
The NKTR-[ADDRESS_407233] treatments were 
available.  The study evaluated three treatment schedules:  weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks 
(wx3 q4week), once every 14 days (q14d) and once every 21 days (q21d).  In all schedules, 
NKTR-102 was given as an intravenous  (IV) infusion over 90 minutes.

Nektar Therapeutics  Page 15 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 For each schedule, the objectives were:   
• To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D),  
• To characterize the safety and PK profile in subjects with refractory solid tumors, 
• To evaluate subjects for any ev idence of anti-tumor activity.   
This study has been completed and fi nal data are detailed in the IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2 studies 
A Phase 2 study (Protocol 08-PIR-05) of NKTR-[ADDRESS_407234] cancer 
(MBC) evaluating 2 treatment schedules (145 mg/m2 q14d and q21d; n = 70 patients with 
35 patients per treatment schedule) showed signi ficant antitumor activity.  The study showed the 
following activity in the 2 treatment schedules combined:   • ORR by [CONTACT_44993] 1.0 in the intent-to- treat population was 29%, with 2 complete 
responses (3%) and 18 partia l responses (26%).   
• ORR was maintained in patients with advanced  or high-risk disease (ORR equal to 33% in 
patients who had received prior anthracycline, taxane, capecitabine; ORR in patients with 
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was 33%).   
• Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.7 months and 10.3 months, respectively.   
The q21d schedule resulted in less Grade 3 or hi gher toxicity (68.6% for the q14d and 54.3% for 
the q21d schedule), fewer serious adverse even ts (SAEs) (51.4% for q14d schedule and 42.9% 
for q21d schedule), and slightly fewer patients discontinuing the study drug, but not necessarily 
exiting the study, due to an adverse even t (22.9% for q14d schedule and 20.0% for q21d 
schedule).  Two possible drug-relate d fatalities (acute renal failure and septic shock) occurred in 
patients treated with the q14d schedule and none  occurred in patients treated with the q21d 
schedule.  There were no observations of  Grade 4 diarrhea in the q21d schedule.   
Based on these findings, the 145 mg/m
2 q21d regimen was selected fo r continued investigation 
in the Phase 3 study in patients with MBC.  See the IB for additional information on the Phase 3 
study in patients with MBC.   
A Phase 2 study (Protocol 08-PIR-04) of NKTR-102 in  patients with platinum resistant ovarian 
cancer (disease progressing within [ADDRESS_407235] dose of platinum) evaluated 
2 treatment schedules (145 mg/m2 q14d and q21d; n = 71; 36 and 35 patients per treatment 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol)

 schedule).  Preliminary data indicated that  NKTR-[ADDRESS_407236] version 1.0 ORR 
(confirmed and unconfirmed) of 27% and 22% in the q14d and q21d schedules, respectively.  
The Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup response (confirmed and unconfirmed) was 47% in q14d 
and 41% in the q21d schedule ( Vergote et. al., 2010 ).  In those patients whose disease had 
progressed following both platinum (within 6 mo nths) and liposomal dox orubicin (n = 33), ORR 
equaled 21%, median PFS equaled 5.5 months and OS equaled 14.0 months in combined q14d 
and q21d schedules ( Garcia et. al., 2011 ).  Common related grad e 3/4 toxicities (q14d/q21d 
schedules) were diarrhea (22%/11%), dehydration (14%/6%), hypokalemi a (14%/6%), fatigue 
(6%/11%), nausea (14%/3%), and neutropenia (8%/9%) ( Vergote et. al., 2010 ).  Two 
treatment-related deaths were observed; one patient died due to pr e-renal azotemia (q14d 
schedule) and one patient died due to neutropenic se psis (q21d schedule).  The q21d schedule, 
overall, had a better toxicity profile, supporting further development using the q21d schedule.   
A randomized Phase 2 study (Protocol 08-PIR- 03) comparing single-agent NKTR-102 to 
single-agent irinotecan in 2nd-line KRAS-mutant metastatic colo rectal cancer ( CRC) patients was 
completed.  The final Clinical Study Report is not yet available.   
Combination studies have been completed (Pro tocol 07-PIR-02 with cetuximab and Protocol 
09-PIR-07 with 5-FU/leucovorin).   See the IB for additional information on these clinical 
studies.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics of NKTR-102 
Clinical PK profiles are consistent with pr eclinical PK profiles with NKTR-102 infusions 
demonstrating greater and sustained exposure to SN38 than had been reported for irinotecan 
infusions.  Additionally, proportional increases in the area unde r the concentration-time curve 
(AUC) and maximum concentration (C max) were observed for NKTR-102, irinotecan, and SN38.   
The apparent elimination t ½ for SN38 after NKTR-102 administra tion is approximately 40 days, 
whereas after irinotecan administration, the SN38 t ½ has been reported as 29 to 47 hours (
Kehrer et al., 2000 ).  This greatly increased SN38 t ½ results in plasma SN38 concentrations that 
are significantly more sustained between doses than are possible with irinotecan.  Cumulative 
SN38 exposures, as indicated by [CONTACT_329629], were 0.6 - 4.4 fold higher (mean 1.6, standard 
deviation 0.8) than those predicted for irinotecan ( Xie et al., 2002 ) when administered at 
equivalent doses and schedules.

[IP_ADDRESS] NKTR-102 Safety Profile 
As of May 2015, 871 patients across all NKTR-102 clinical studies (com pleted and ongoing; 
single agent and combination therapy) have r eceived at least one dos e of NKTR-102.  See the 
current version of the IB for additional safety information.   
Observations across all studies (including safety data from ongoing studies) have been generally 
consistent with regard to the overall safety profile of NKTR-102.  Gastrointestinal toxicity, 
especially diarrhea, is the most common and clin ically significant toxicity.  Other frequently 
observed AEs include nausea, vomiting, fatigue , decreased appetite, abdominal pain, 
constipation, and dehydration.   Diarrhea and dehydration secondary  to diarrhea were the most common serious adverse events 
(SAEs) across all studies evaluating NKTR-102, occurring at frequencies of 9.5% and 4.1%, 
respectively.  Prolonged severe diarrhea with dehydration leading to pre-renal azotemia and 
subsequent acute renal insufficiency  has been fatal in 4 patients ([ADDRESS_407238] cancers and 1 patient in the Phase 3 
BEACON study).  Early onset ch olinergic-mediated diarrhea has been observed with NKTR-
102. Late-onset, severe diarrhea can occur and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed.  
The median time to onset of Grade 3 diarrh ea for NKTR-102 in the Phase 3 BEACON study was 
43 days (range 3 to 488 days).  Early, proactive,  and aggressive interven tion with anti-diarrheal 
therapy, IV hydration, and maintena nce of electrolyte balance had a significant favorable effect 
on the clinical course of events, preventing vo lume depletion and the development of renal 
failure.   Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, can o ccur in patients receiving NKTR-102; however,

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Discontinuation due to Adv erse Events and Physician Decision in 
Phase 3 BEACON (11-PIR-11) Study 
A summary of the most common TE AEs leading to study drug discont inuation (> 1 patient in the 
NKTR-102 treatment arm) is presented in Table 2 .  There was a higher overall incidence of 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the NKTR- 102 treatment arm (11.1%) compared with TPC 
(6.7%), and there was a higher incidence of di arrhea leading to discontinuation in the NKTR-102 
treatment arm (3.1%) compared with the TPC trea tment arm (0%).  The incidence of neuropathy 
leading to discontinuation was higher in the TPC treatment arm (2.2%) compared with the 
NKTR-102 treatment arm (0.2%).   
Strict protocol-mandated diarrhea management guidelines were implemented in the BEACON 
study, including requirements for removal of patients from the study due to diarrhea.  Guidelines 
were created based on the safety experience obtained in the prior phase 2 program where 
Grade ≥3 diarrhea occurred at a rate  of approximately 20% (see IB  for details).  Dose reductions 
were required to prevent the possibility of accumulation of active drug upon repeated dosing; 
occurrence of Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_407241] occurrence of Grade ≥ 2 
diarrhea.  Because the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea is less than 10% with the implementation 
of diarrhea management guidelines, and given that  the median time to resolution for all Grades

 of diarrhea was 1.5 days, any subsequent studies will not require treatmen t discontinuation after 
3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13368] ≥ 2 diarrhea.   
Also of importance, a greater proportion of pa tients were removed from NKTR-102 (2.8%) for 
neutropenia compared to TPC (0.2%),  despi[INVESTIGATOR_329605] ≥3 neutropenia with 
NKTR-102 (9.6%) compared with that of TPC ( 30.6%).  The median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenia was 120 days on NKTR-102 compared with 16 days on TPC.  The significance of 
the difference in time to onset is that the cl inical decision to discontinue treatment due to 
neutropenia likely occurs at a much later tim e point for patients on NKTR-102, when there may 
be less clinical benefit to conti nue; this situation is quite differe nt from an appropriate response 
to the occurrence of early neutropenia (ie, wi th TPC), where dose delay is more common.

Eligible subjects will con tinue treatment with NKT R-102 at a dose of 145 mg/m2 or less in a 
q21d schedule as outlined in Section 6.5.  Subjects who previously received a dose of 
NKTR-102 at <145 mg/m2 will continue at the lower dose in this study.  Subjects who 
underwent dose reduction of NKTR-102 due to observ ed toxicity prior to participation in the 
Extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09) will not be re-escalated to the previous dose level upon resolution of the toxicity.  Dose escalation for NKTR-102 is not permitted.   
NKTR-102 will be administered as an IV infusi on over approximately 90 minutes (± 15 minutes) 
on Day [ADDRESS_407245] of care until disease progression.  Minimal 
disease evaluation data (best response and date of progression) will be collected within this 
protocol.  Tumor measurements are not required ; only an overall assessment of response or 
progression by [CONTACT_329632].  Subjects may continue to receive repeated cycles of

6.1 Description and Formulation 
The drug substance NKTR-102 is a polymeric conjuga te prodrug of irinotecan with 3 essential 
components:  a relatively large polymer, a biod egradable linker, and an active agent.  In 
NKTR-102, irinotecan is attached to PEG via a releasable linker th at is hydrolyzed in vivo to 
deliver irinotecan, which is further metabolized to the active metabolite, SN38.  Table 3  
provides the nomenclature informa tion for drug substance NKTR-102.   
Table 3: Nomenclature 
Compound Number/Name: [CONTACT_329667] R-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
Sponsor: Nektar Therapeutics 
Chemical classification: Topoisomerase [ADDRESS_407259] ion is formulated as a sterile lyophilized 
powder of NKTR-102 in lactate buffer at pH  3.5, intended for dilution with commercially 
available 5% Dextrose Injection (w/w%; D5W) or 0.9% Sodium Chlo ride for Injection before IV 
infusion.  The pH of the formulation is in the range of 3.2 to 4.2, and NKTR-102 for Injection 
storage condition is 2°C - 8°C, with  a shelf-life of 48 months.   
Both 5% Dextrose Injection and 0.9% Sodium Chlo ride for Injection will be locally sourced at 
each clinical study site.   
6.2 Packaging and Labeling 
NKTR-102 (drug substance) is light sensitiv e.  The lyophilized drug product NKTR-[ADDRESS_407260] be reconstituted with  D5W or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection 
to a final concentration range of 0.2 to 1.6 mg/m L.  The reconstituted drug may be stored under

6.5 Dosage and Administration 
Body surface area (BSA) will be dete rmined before the start of each cycle, based on baseline 
height and most recent weight.  Body surface area may be calculated based on institutional 
guidelines.  NKTR-102 will be admi nistered as an IV infusion over 90 minutes (± 15 minutes).  
The recommended dose and sche dule of NKTR-102 is 145 mg/m2 q21d, with BSA capped at 2.4 
m2.  Subjects who were previously receiving the 145 mg/m2 dose will continue to receive this 
dose in this extension study in a q21d schedule.   
Subjects originally enrolled in  a clinical study in which a lower-than-recommended dose was 
administered (e.g., Protocol 12-102-13 in subjects  with impaired liver function) or was being 
administered after a dose reduction will continue to  receive that same dose in a q21d schedule in 
this study.  For Protocol 12-102-13 subjects with hepatic dysfunction, as defined in that study, 
will continue in this extension study (Protocol 11 -PIR-09) to receive the originally assigned dose 
from the 12-102-13 study in a q21d schedule.   
Subjects originally enrolled in  a clinical study in which a hi gher-than-recommended dose was 
being administered (e.g., Protocol 12-102-12 to  explore the effects of NKTR-102 on cardiac 
function) will receive the recomm ended dose of NKTR-102 of 145 mg/m2 in a q21d schedule in 
this extension study (Pro tocol 11-PIR-09).   
Subjects who underwent dose reduction of NKTR -102 due to observed toxicity prior to 
participation in the Extension study [Protocol 11-PIR -09] will not be re-escalated to the previous 
dose level upon resolution of the toxicity.   
Dose escalation for NKTR-102 is not permitted.

6.7 Dose Modifications and Delays 
All adverse events (AEs) will be assessed acco rding to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.  In the 
event of multiple toxicities, dose delays and m odifications should occur in accordance with the 
worst toxicity observed.   
Specific dose modifications for NKTR-[ADDRESS_407265]

bowel movement habits) for at least [ADDRESS_407266] fails to meet the criteria for re-treatment, treatment  may be delayed, followed by [CONTACT_329637].  Initiation of subsequent doses may 
be delayed for a maximum of 28 days to allow rec overy from any toxicity to permit retreatment.  
Subjects whose treatment delays are ≥ 14 days but ≤ [ADDRESS_407267] 
initiate their next treatment cycle with a dose reduction.  Subjects who require > [ADDRESS_407268] be withdrawn from treatment, unless, in the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuing in the study is of  benefit for the subject.  In this case, the continuation of 
treatment must be discussed w ith the Medical Monitor and the reason for continuation must be 
approved and documented.   Subjects from Protocol 12-102-13 with impaired liver functi on who are entering the extension 
study will receive the same dose as that received in the 12-1 02-13 study.  Investigators may 
choose to reduce the dose of NKTR-102 for either drug-related or non-drug related Grade 3 or 
higher liver dysfunction only after approva l from Nektar Medical Monitor.

 6.8 Antidiarrheal Therapy 
Subjects may experience diarrhea foll owing administration of NKTR-102.   
To date, early-onset diarrhea  (occurring during or shortly after infusion of study drug) has rarely 
been seen with NKTR-102 administration.  It is usua lly transient and only infr equently severe.  It 
may be accompanied by [CONTACT_329638], increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, 
diaphoresis, flushing, and intestin al hyperperistalsis that can cau se abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Early 
diarrhea and other cholinergic sy mptoms may be prevented or ameliorated by [CONTACT_329639][INVESTIGATOR_050] (0.25 to 1 mg subcutaneous or IV), however, routine pr ophylactic use of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_329610].   
Late onset diarrhea (occurring more than 24 hour s after the infusion) ca n be life-threatening, 
because it may be prolonged and may lead to de hydration, hypotension, and renal failure. In the 
BEACON study, 9.6% of patients reported Grade 3 diarrhea.  Among those patients, the median 
time to onset of Grade 2 or higher diarrhea wa s 40 days, and the median onset for Grade 3 
diarrhea was 43 days.  In addition, the median tim e to resolution of Grade 2 or higher diarrhea 
was 3.5 days and the median time to resolution of Grade 3 diarrhea was 6 days.  There were no 
incidents of Grade 4 diarrhea.   
It should be noted in the patient’s medical record  whether the subject is currently receiving anti-
diarrhea supportive care and the date of the last epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337]/loose stool.   
Diarrhea must be treated promptly with anti-d iarrheal therapy; loperamide is recommended.  
Each subject must be instructed to immediatel y begin taking anti-diarrhea l therapy at the very 
first epi[INVESTIGATOR_329611].  Subjects with diarrhea must be carefully 
monitored, should be given adequate fluid a nd electrolyte replacement if they become 
dehydrated, and antibiotic support if they devel op ileus, fever, or seve re neutropenia.   
• Prophylactic antidiarrheal medications must not be used as they can confound the evaluation 
of recovery to Grade 0 (a return to norm al bowel movement habits) and monitoring of 
diarrhea AEs in subjects  receiving NKTR-102.   
• Each subject will be instructed to start taking anti-diarrheal therapy (i.e., loperamide) for diarrhea at the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_329612].

 o One dosage regimen for loperamide used in clinical trials consisted of the following 
(Note: This dosage regimen exceeds the usual dosage recommendations for 
loperamide.):  [ADDRESS_407304] may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 
hours.   
• The use of drugs with stimulant laxative properties should be avoided because of the 
potential for exacerbation of diarrhea.   
• Subjects will be instructed  to report the following :  diarrhea for the first time during the 
infusion of NKTR-102; black or bloody stool s; symptoms of dehydration such as 
lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by [CONTACT_47525]; inability to get dia rrhea under contro l within 24 hours; or fever or evidence of 
infection.   
An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved subj ect instruction sheet on the management of 
diarrhea will be provided to all the subjects.   
6.[ADDRESS_407305] experiences na usea and/or vomiting, the subject may be given prophylactic 
antiemetics treatment prior to the next dose of NKTR-102.  The subject must be carefully 
monitored throughout the study period, and given ad equate fluid and electrolyte replacement to 
prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.   6.[ADDRESS_407306] demonstrate an ANC >
 1.5 X 109/L prior to 
retreatment with NKTR-102.   
Prophylactic use of growth factor support is no t permitted, however use of growth factor support 
in a setting of neutropenia is permitted.  Use of growth factor support must follow American 
Society Clinical Oncology (ASC O), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines 
or standard of care at the local institution.  For example, if a subject required growth factor 
support during a previous cycle, a subject may be administered prophylactic growth factor 
support during a subsequent cycle at the investigator’s  discretion.

 Subjects may receive transfusions (platelets or blood products) at the Investigator’s discretion.   
6.11 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Throughout the study, Investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care.   
All medications (both prescr iption and over-the-counter [OTC ] medications), vitamin and 
mineral supplements, and/or herbs taken by [CONTACT_329640]-of-Treatment visit will be documented on the concomitant medication eCRF.  Throughout 
the study, Investigators may pres cribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary to provide adequate supportive care.  All concomitant  medications administered to 
study subjects will be recorded in the eCRF.   
6.11.1 Permitted Treatments 
• Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms.   
• Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_329613] c onditions, including antiemetic prophylaxis (see 
Section 6.9) and early interventional antidia rrheal therapy (see Section 6.8).   
• Diarrhea is an expected toxicity of NKT R-102.  All subjects must receive optimal 
antidiarrheal therapy immediately after the FIRST epi[INVESTIGATOR_329614].   
• Premedication with antihistamine and/or cortic osteroid is allowed in  subsequent cycles 
following occurrence of a self-limiting allergic/hype rsensitivity reaction to a prior infusion of 
NKTR-102.   
6.11.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
The treatments listed below are prohibited wh ile on study.  For treatments prohibited on study, 
alternative medical intervention sh ould be considered; if a prohibi ted treatment is required, study 
drug treatment should be discontinued.   
• Any concurrent chemotherapy (other than NKTR-102), radiotherapy (with the exception of 
palliative radiation), biologica l therapy, hormonal agents used for the treatment of cancer, 
immunotherapy, or other systemic therapy fo r cancer; megestrol acetate for appetite 
stimulation may be used; 
• Other investigational agents w ithin 28 days prior to Day 1 of  Cycle 1 or during the study;

 • Investigators must monitor subjects for use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inducers or inhibitors, as they may induce or inhibit irinotecan or SN38 metabolism.  Some 
of these agents are OTC medications (e.g., St Jo hn’s Wort); subjects must provide a complete 
list of all concomitant medications as part of the screening process.  See Appendix [ADDRESS_407307] of agents known to induce and inhibit CYP3A4.   
6.11.3 Adequate Forms of Birth Control 
Over the course of the study, women of childbear ing potential (WCBP) and men must agree to 
use adequate contraception during study participa tion (at least two methods  of contraception, one 
of which includes a barrier method [male condom] by [CONTACT_329641]) or a male 
who has undergone a vasectomy greater than [ADDRESS_407308] dose of

 8.0 STUDY OR STUDY SITE TERMINATION 
If the Sponsor, Investigator, Medical Monitor, study monitor, or appropria te regulatory officials 
discover conditions arising during the study that indicate  that the study should be halted or that 
the study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate  consultation.  
Nektar Therapeutics has the right to terminate this study at any time for any reason.  Conditions 
that may warrant termination of the study include, but are no t limited to, the following:   
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unaccep table risk to the subjects enrolled in the 
study 
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to su spend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the study drug 
A study or study site may also warrant termination under the following conditions: 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent regulations of appropriate regulatory 
authorities 
• Recording of inaccurate or incomplete data 
• Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility  to the Sponsor, Study 
Monitor, or appropriate  Regulatory Authority 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements 
• General Good Clinical Practice (GCP) noncom pliance as determined by [CONTACT_329643], 
Nektar Therapeutics shall immediately inform all study Investigators/institutions and Regulatory 
Authorities.  Study termination and follow up will be performed in compliance with the 
conditions set forth in the IC H sixth efficacy publication (E6)  on GCP and local regulatory 
requirements.   
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page [ADDRESS_407313].  An AE can also arise from any use 
of the drug and from any route of  administration, formulation, or  dose.  This definition includes 
intercurrent illnesses or injuri es, and exacerbation of preexisting conditions as well as events 
attributed to protocol-mandated procedures.  Clinical laboratory abnormalities will only be 
reported as AEs if they are deemed clinically si gnificant by [CONTACT_80373]/or are associated 
with signs and symptoms, require treatment, or require follow-up.   
An unexpected AE is one of a type not consistent in nature or severity with information in the 
current IB.   An AE does not include: • A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extract ion, or transfusion); 
an AE is the underlying condition that leads to the procedure 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions presen t or detected before start of study drug 
administration and which do not worsen or incr ease in severity or frequency after the 
administration of study drug 
• Situations where an untoward medical occu rrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197211] a condition that has not wo rsened on study, social and/or convenience 
admissions to grant families a respi[INVESTIGATOR_22216] a subject) 
9.2 Monitoring Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_329644] e appropriate case report form 
(CRF), including but not limited to, the date of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, 
relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with study drug.  Adverse events will be 
reported starting immediately afte r the subject or subject’s legal representative has provided 
written informed consent through the End-of-Treatme nt visit (30 ± [ADDRESS_407314] dose of 
study drug in the extension study).   
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page [ADDRESS_407315] udy drug in the extension 
study (Protocol 11-PIR-09), any AEs that occur w ill be collected under the original protocol.  
For subjects who have ended the original protocol and have provided informed consent for the 
extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09), AEs will be  collected under the extension study (Protocol 
11-PIR-09).   
Adverse events that were considered related to  study drug in the origin al protocol and were 
ongoing when the subject ended the original prot ocol will be captured as a new AE in the 
extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09) marked as c ontinuing.  Unrelated AEs that were ongoing at 
the end of the original protocol may also be  captured as new AEs in the extension study 
(Protocol 11-PIR-09) marked as continuing.   For each AE, the following data elemen ts will be recorded on the CRFs: 
• Verbatim description of event  
• NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 grade for AE se verity (refer to Section 
9.3) 
• Start and stop date of AE 
• Relationship/causality attribution to study drug 
• Whether or not the administration of study drug was reduced, inte rrupted, delayed, or 
permanently discontinued due to the AE 
• Whether or not the event was considered as an SAE 
• Treatment provided for the AE (pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic) 
• Outcome of the AE 
9.[ADDRESS_407316]/event 
outcome or action criteria.  All AEs will be assessed for severity using the NCI-CTCAE 
version 4.0.  If a particular AE is not listed in the NCI-CTCAE, the following criteria will be used to assess severity by [CONTACT_737]:   
o grade 1 = Mild (asymptomatic or mild symptoms or clinical or diagnostic 
observations only, interv ention not indicated) 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page 47 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 o grade 2 = Moderate (minimal, or local or  non-invasive intervention indicated or 
limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living [ADL]) 
o grade 3 = Severe (medically significant  but not immediately life-threatening or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329615], limiting self 
care ADL) 
o grade 4 = Life threatening or disabling (life threaten ing consequences, urgent 
intervention indicated) 
o grade 5 = Death (related to AE) 
Adverse events will be reported using the maximal severity grade experienced for that continuing instance of the AE.  Please refer to  the CRF Completion Guidelines for detailed 
reporting instructions.   
9.4 Causality Relationship of Adverse Events 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_329645]:   
• Not related:  The AE is clearly not related to  the study drug(s).  The AE  can be explained to 
be likely related to other factors such as concomitant medications or the subject’s clinical 
state.   
• Unlikely related:  The AE is doubtfully relate d to study drug(s).  The current knowledge or 
information about the AE indicates that a relationship to the study drug is unlikely.   
• Possibly related:  The AE may be related to the study drug(s).  A plausible temporal 
sequence exists between the time  of administration of the stu dy drug and the development of 
the AE and it follows a known response pattern to the study drug.  The reaction may have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clin ical state or other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_197213].   
• Definitely related:  The AE is  clearly related to the study dr ug(s).  A plausible temporal 
sequence exists between the time  of administration of the stu dy drug and the development of 
the AE and it follows a known response pa ttern to the study drug.  The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s clinical state or other 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_329616] s administered to the subject.   
The causality criteria of definitely related and possibly related will be considered related to the 
study drug as applicable for regul atory reporting requirements.

 9.5 Adverse Event Reporting and Follow-up 
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until 30 ± [ADDRESS_407317] dose of study drug 
administration, whichever is earlier, except re lated AEs which will be followed until they 
stabilize or resolve; until the I nvestigator assesses the event as chronic or stable; start of new 
cancer therapy; subject lost to follow-up or subjec t death, whichever is earlier.  If an unrelated 
AE has not completely resolved up to 30 ± [ADDRESS_407318] dose of study drug, the final outcome 
of these ongoing AEs will be captured as  “Not Recovered/Not Resolved” or 
“Recovering/Resolving”, whic hever is applicable.   
Any new AEs occurring more than 30 ± [ADDRESS_407319] dose of study drug will be captured only 
if serious and assessed by [CONTACT_329646] (possibly/definitely  related) to study drug 
(i.e. a related SAE).  For speci fic instructions on identifying a nd reporting SAEs, see Sections

• Results in death 
• Is life threatening, i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8598] e investigator, the AE places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not incl ude a reaction that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329617] a subject’s participation in a clinical  study, except for those due to the 
following:   
o A surgery or procedure that was planned before the subject entered the study and 
which is part of the planned study procedure 
o Nonmedical reasons, in the absence of an AE 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect

 • Is an important medical event that, ba sed upon appropriate me dical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject and may re quire medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above 
An unexpected SAE is any SAE in which the nature, frequency or severity is not consistent with 
that indicated in the IB.   
Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  All deaths regardless of causality must be 
reported.  An efficacy failure is not considered an SAE.  “Life-threatening” means that the 
subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  This does not include an 
event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  “Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been adm itted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329618].  The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical informa tion.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.   
9.[ADDRESS_407321]’s last dose of study drug, whether or not 
considered related to study drug treatment, will be reported to Nektar Therapeutics Drug Safety or its designee within 24 hours  of when the site becomes aware of the event.  In addition, SAEs 
that are assessed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator as related to NKTR-102 and occurring > [ADDRESS_407322] complete the SAE Repor t Form, assess the causality relationship to the 
study treatment as applicable, and send the completed SAE form by [CONTACT_329647].   
A follow-up report and any additional records (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], consultant reports, and 
autopsy findings) will be faxed to Nektar Therapeutics Drug Safety or designee as soon as these 
documents become available or promptly upon request.   Any medication or other therapeutic measures us ed to treat the event will be recorded.   
All SAEs will be followed as described in Section 
9.8 below.

 Pregnancy, although reportable, is not considered an AE/SAE unless a male subject’s female 
partner experienced signs or symptoms of pregnancy complications.  Females who become 
pregnant will be followed every trimester un til the outcome of the pregnancy is known.  
Pregnancy follow-up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or 
spontaneous termination, details of the birth, and the presence or abse nce of any congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects in the offspring.   
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC will be done  in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC.  Ade quate documentation must be provided to Nektar 
Therapeutics, showing that the IRB/IEC was prope rly notified.  Serious adverse events will be 
reported by [CONTACT_329648] e regulatory authorities, per local regulations.   
9.8 Serious Adverse Event Follow-up 
All SAEs will be followed until th e end of study or resolution, unless related to study drug and 
continuing or reported after the end of the study, in which the related SAE will be followed until 
any of the following occur (whichever comes first):   
• The event resolves. 
• The event has stabilized. 
• The event returns to baseline, if  a baseline value is available. 
• It is unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (e.g., subject or health care 
practitioner refuses to provide additional information; lost to follow-up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow-up efforts).   
• Further follow-up is not warranted based upon th e medical judgment of the investigator.   
• Death 
All ongoing and new SAEs with a start date w ithin [ADDRESS_407323] dose of study drug and 
assessed as “Unrelated” to study dr ug will be followed until reso lution or until 30 ± [ADDRESS_407324] dose of study drug administra tion, whichever is earlier.   
9.9 Expedited Reporting of SAEs 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is a SAE that is considered “unexpected ” and assessed as related to the study drug by 
[CONTACT_29539] .  All SAEs deemed related to  the study drug and not expected 
based on the most current IB are subject to expe dited reporting by [CONTACT_329649].  Therefor e, the investigator or study site  personnel must report all SAEs 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page [ADDRESS_407325] becoming aware of 
the event.   
Fatal or life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs  will be reported by [CONTACT_329650], but no late r than 7 calendar days after S ponsor or Sponsor’s designee has 
first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting.  Non-fatal or non-life-
threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported to the Regulatory Authorities, IRBs/IECs, and 
Investigators as soon as possible, but no later th an 15 calendar days afte r Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designee has first knowledge of the S[LOCATION_003]R.   Reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to all applicable Regulatory Authorities will be done by [CONTACT_329651] r local country and re gional regulations.   
Notification of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the central IRBs will be done by [CONTACT_329652].  Reporting to local 
IRBs will be done by [CONTACT_329653].  Adequate documentation must be provided to Nektar Therapeutics Clinical Operations or 
designee, showing that the loca l IRB was properly notified.   
9.[ADDRESS_407326] safety will be assessed throughout the study by a Safety Review Committee consisting of 
at minimum the Medical Monitor, Sponsor Clinic al Lead and Sponsor Pharmacovigilance Lead 
or designee by [CONTACT_329654].

 10.0 EFFICACY EVALUATIONS 
Due to the nature of this study, no specific schedu le or type of tumor measurements/assessments 
are dictated within the protocol.  These will be conducted as per the local standard of care until 
disease progression.  Data on best response and disease progression (per physician assessment) 
will be collected according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et. al., 2009 ).  
Radiographs that document response, stable di sease, or progression should be performed 
according to routine patterns of care and (preferabl y original) copi[INVESTIGATOR_329619], if requested.   
Approximately every 12 weeks (±4 weeks) followi ng the End-of-Treatment visit, subjects will 
have their medical records reviewed and may be  contact[CONTACT_329642], survival 
status, receipt of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, and resolution of all toxicity attributable to 
study drug.  Disease status during follow-up will only be assessed if the subject has not 
demonstrated disease progression since receivin g NKTR-102.  Quarterly follow-up will continue 
until death, withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_1130], physician decision, lost to follow-up, or the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034].

data are generated, documented, and reported in  compliance with the protocol, GCP, and 
applicable regulatory requirements.   
All protocol deviations and the reasons for such deviations are to be documented in the source 
documents and reported to Nektar Therapeutics.   
11.1 Changes to the Protocol 
The Investigator may not deviate from the protoc ol without a formal pr otocol amendment having 
been established and approved by [CONTACT_4215]/IEC, except when necessary to eliminate 
immediate hazards to the subject.  Any deviation may result in the subject having to be 
withdrawn from the study and renderi ng that subject non-evaluable.   
11.2 Monitoring 
In accordance with 21 CFR § 312.56, ICH GCP and local regulations, the clinical monitor will periodically inspect all study documents, research facilities, and clinical  laboratory facilities 
associated with this study at mutually convenient times during and after completion of the study.  As required by 21 CFR § 312 Subpart D, ICH GCP and local regulations:  Responsibilities of 
Sponsors and Investigators, the monitoring visits  provide the Sponsor with the opportunity to 
evaluate the progress of the study; verify th e accuracy and completeness of submitted data; 
ensure that all protocol requirements, applic able FDA, ICH GCP and local regulations, and 
Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled; and resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  This includes inspecti on of all documents and records that  are required to be maintained 
by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to me dical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for 
the subjects in this trial.  The na mes and identities of all research subjects will be kept in strict 
confidence and will not appear in the CRFs or other records provided to or retained by [CONTACT_1034].  The IND regulations also require the Investigator to allow auth orized representatives 
of the FDA and European Union Re gulatory Authorities to inspect and make copi[INVESTIGATOR_329620].  The names and identities of the subj ects need not be divulged to the Sponsor; however, 
the records must nevertheless be inspected.  This can be accomplished by [CONTACT_329655]’s name [CONTACT_329668]’s study id entification number.  If these 
requirements are in conflict with local regulatory  restrictions or institutional requirements, the 
Investigator must inform the Sponsor of these re strictions prior to init iation of the study.

 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:  The safety population consists of all subjects who receive NKTR-102 for 
Injection.  Unless otherwise stated, all safety analyses will be based on this population.   
12.2 Endpoints and Planned Analyses 
The primary endpoint of this study is assessment of safety for subjects receiving continued 
NKTR-102 therapy.   
The MedDRA medical dictionary will be used to map the AE/SAE verbatim terms to specific 
system organ classes and preferred terms.  The incidence and duration of AEs will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_6213], system  organ class, severity and relationship to study drug.  The 
maximum intensity and frequency of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] (dose level).  
By-subject listings will be provide d.  No formal statistical tes ting is planned for AE or other 
safety and tolerability data.   Tumor response will be summarized by [CONTACT_329656]-subject 
listings based on disease assessments from this protocol.   Other data will be tabulated using by-subject listings.

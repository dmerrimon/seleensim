Seven items focus on activities of daily living. These 347 sections include statements related to personal care, lifting, recreational activities, work, driving, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 348 Two items focus on the patient’s pain. There is one section that evaluates pain directly. The NDI is easy to 349 complete and score.

The PCS is reported as a total score, with higher scores indicating greater catastrophizing, and is 375 composed of three sub-scales: Rumination (four items; e.g. ‘When I am in pain, I keep thinking about how 376 badly I want the pain to stop’), Magnification (three items; e.g. ‘When I am in pain, I become afraid that the 377 pain will get worse’), and Helplessness (six items; e.g. ‘When I am in pain, I feel I can’t go on’)  The PCS has [ADDRESS_235269]-Operative Use of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_197930]: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

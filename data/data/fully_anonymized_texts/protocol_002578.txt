 1  Introduction 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is a decellularized, predegener ated and sterilized extracellular matrix (ECM) 
processed from donated human peripheral nerve tissue (see Figure 1-1). The structure is the ECM of 
native peripheral nerve and is comprised of bundl es of small diameter endoneurial tubes (as shown in 
Figure 1-2).  The tissue is processed to remove cellu lar and non-cellular factors such as Schwann cells, 
fat, blood, axonal debris and c hondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), while preserving the three-
dimensional scaffold, vascular structure, basal lami na laminin, fibronectin, and glycosmainoglycans.

® Nerve Graft showing the general overall tubular 
structure (scale bar=429um) and a close up view of the multiple empty tubes within the structure (scale 
bar=20um). 
 
 Avance
® Nerve Graft is intended to reconstruct and re pair peripheral nerve discontinues; and support 
axonal regeneration of peri pheral nerves following transection injury .  Processing results in a flexible, 
pliable, open multi-tubular ECM structure that can be  sutured in place and allows for a tension free 
approximation of the proximal and distal nerve stum ps (see Figure 1-2).  The graft revascularizes and 
remodels into the patients’ own tissue while supporting axonal growth across the nerve discontinuity.  The resulting axonal growth can lead to functional rec overy of the target organ.  Furthermore, because 
Avance
® Nerve Graft is decellularized, it does not require immunosuppressive therapy, which had 
previously limited the clinical use of cellular nerve allografts [1-4]. 
 

Protocol No. ANG-CP-[ADDRESS_496307] for gap repair, it in itself pr esents challenges to the surgeon and patient including: 
additional surgery and the risks associated with it, don or site morbidity and limited tissue availability (e.g. 
during a large traumatic nerve injury), as well as, in creased operative time and cost associated with tissue 
harvest.  The nerve cuff (Medical Device Product Code JXI) was made available in the 1990’s as an 
alternative to sacrificing healthy nerve.  While the ne rve cuff has been used as an  alternative nerve repair 
option, its mono-tubular structure and rigidity limit its use for repairs with branching nerves or across 
joints in the digits where early mobilization was prescribed due to concomita nt tendon repairs.  The 
flexible, pliable, multi-tubu lar structure of the Avance® Nerve Graft overcomes these limitations to 
provide the surgeon with an additional treatment option. 
 This study will evaluate the difference in functiona l recovery outcomes between the study groups to 
assess the non-inferiority and superiority of the Avance
® Nerve Graft to nerve cuffs  
 a Type I Bovine Collagen nerve cuff). 
 
1.[ADDRESS_496308].  The nerve 
processes or fibers (called axons) extend from the cell bodies and travel down little tubes (endoneurial tubes or basal lamina) in the nerve trunks and in the peripheral nerves, until they make contact [CONTACT_395017], such as muscle or skin.  A signal generated in the brain travels down the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], into the axons, then to the muscle where it is converted  into a muscle contraction, which 
results in arm motion.  After a nerve is transect ed, many of the nerve cell bodies in and around the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_394990].  All nerve fibers in the distal (or 
downstream) nerve stump, that are now separated fro m their cell bodies, die and are quickly broken 
down by [CONTACT_168369] a process called Wallerian Dege neration.  Almost immediately after a nerve 
transection, all sensory and motor function directed by [CONTACT_395018].  These types of 
injuries can severely impact patients in many different  ways.  For example, a nerve laceration in the 
hand may result in loss of movement or sensation in  the fingers.  In prostate cancer, the necessary 
removal of the prostate and associated cavernous nerves can result in erectile dysfunction and/or 
incontinence and injuries to the facial nerve can result in the patient losing the ability to smile. 
  Transected axons almost immediately start the regeneration process by [CONTACT_395019], however, these branches can only find their wa y into the distal nerve stump if an adequate 
surgical repair has been performed.  Many nerve lacerations can be primarily repaired by [CONTACT_395020].  Other times, either due to ne rve tissue loss or nerve end retraction, a bridging 
material is required to connect the two ends 
[1].  This bridging material must be able to support 
regenerating axons.  Recovery is not possible if the nerve is left unrepaired or if the method or 
material used to reconstruct the nerve discontinu ities fails to support axonal regeneration across the 
nerve discontinuity [1,5,6].  
 Adequate repair of the nerve discontinuity is not th e sole factor in ensuring the return of function.  
Patient demographics, general health  of the patient, age of injury, location of injury, mechanism of 
injury, extent of trauma to surrounding and targ et tissue, patient compliance with rehabilitation 
regimen, and brain plasticity, all play  a role in the clinical outcome. 

Protocol No. ANG-CP-[ADDRESS_496309] be bridged using a biological or 
artificial material 
[1, 2, 7].  Currently, there are several “bridging”  options including autograft nerve, 
Avance® Nerve Graft, and nerve cuffs (tubes).  Unfort unately, use of autograft nerve tissue requires a 
secondary surgical procedure, which increases anesthesia time and facility cost, and sacrifices a 
healthy functioning nerve.  This not only leads to functional (usually sensory) loss and scarring, but 
can also result in painful neuroma formati on or other complications such as infection [1, 2, 5, 8-10].  The 
paucity of “expendable” nerves within the human bo dy results in a limited supply of autograft and 
may necessitate size mismatching between donor and native nerve.  
Spurred by [CONTACT_395021], nerve cuffs, first introduced in the 1990’s, 
have seen a steady increase in popularity and, currently, multiple nerve cuffs are available for 
commercial use. Hollow tubes made from collagen or  synthetic materials are designed to entubulate 
the proximal and distal ends of the transected nerve.   A fibrin clot forms between the two nerve ends 
and is contained within the nerve tube.  Axons can re generate within this fibrin clot and cross the gap 
to the distal nerve stump.  Single lumen nerve cuffs, however, have a lim ited effective length and 
undesirable handling characteristics, which limits  their clinical application and acceptance. 
 Modern usage of viable, cellular nerve allograft was developed by [CONTACT_395022], M.D., in the 
1990s.  The results of her work were published in  2001 and detailed the outcomes of seven patients 
[4].  While the results of this study showed promise,  cellular nerve allografting as a strategy for nerve 
reconstruction is hampered by [CONTACT_395023].  
Cellular nerve allograft remain s commercially unavailable. 
 A more recent addition to the armamentarium of the nerve surgeon, processed acellular nerve 
allograft, does not require the immunosuppressive therap ies associated with cellular nerve allografts.  
Avance
® Nerve Graft was introduced as a [ADDRESS_496310].  Since that release date, Axogen has 
distributed over 7,000 grafts.  Avance® Nerve Graft has been utilized in the reconstruction of 
traumatic and iatrogenic peripheral nerve transection injuries in the upper and lower extremities, head 
and neck, chest and pelvis.  Mechanisms of injury have included, but are not limited to, laceration, blunt trauma, amputation, avulsion, gunshot wound,  shrapnel, improvised explosive product (IED) 
blast trauma, neuroma resection, ch emical burns, and oncologic resection. 
 Clinical Outcomes with Nerve Cuffs 
 Currently, there are very few controlled outcomes studies that compare the different peripheral nerve 
repair options 
[11].  Inherent challenges associated with th is type of data collection include the 
heterogeneous nature of traumatic injuries, of which include varying degrees of nerve damage and 
concomitant injuries [12].  Conclusive comparative clinical effi cacy evaluations require standardized, 
homogeneous samples [13].  
 Nerve cuffs, are regulated as class II medical devi ces under 510(k) exemption and are defined in the 
code of federal regulations (C FR) at 21 §CFR 882.5275 as “a tubular  silicone rubber sheath used to 
encase a nerve for aid in repairing the nerve (e.g., to prevent in growth of scar tissue) and for cappi[INVESTIGATOR_394991] (tumors)”.  Since they are regulated as

Avance® Nerve Graft is a decellularized, cleansed, and sterilized extracellular matrix from donated 
human peripheral nerve.  The cleansing process pr eserves the inherent and relevant structural 
characteristics of the tissue. 
 Avance
® Nerve Graft is intended to be used to repair  nerve discontinuities anywhere in the body at 
lengths of up to 70mm.  It has a flexible, pliable, multi-tubular ECM structure (See Figures 1-1, and 
1-2) and handles similarly to nerve autograft allowing for versatile utilization including repairs across 
joints and shallow would beds; a limita tion seen with the use of nerve cuffs[14, 15, 18].  These 
advantages provide the surgeon with a clinically beneficial off-the-shelf nerve graft option that avoids the disadvantages of autograft harvest or nerve cuff limitations.  
 
Avance
® Nerve Graft is provided frozen and sterile.  Af ter thawing the graft, implantation should be 
completed using the same tensionless surgical techni que used when implanting a nerve autograft. The 
graft is positioned within the nerve gap and coapted to the proximal and distal stumps of the host 
nerve.  See Figure 1.2-1.

ends of the injured nerve.  For the purpose of this clinical study,   a Type I 
bovine collagen nerve cuff, will be utilized as the c ontrol treatment.  Implantation is to be done 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Appendix 4.0).  
 
1.4 Risk Analysis 
 
Inherent risks of any surgical procedure include: infection, blood loss, and anesthesia-associated 
complications.  Complications specific to nerve reconstruction include pain, decreased or increased sensitivity, and impaired motor or sensory function.  As with all peripheral nerve surgeries, there is a 
risk that the nerve may fail to regenerate.    Hypersensitivity, allergic reactions, or other adverse immune responses have not been seen in 
preclinical studies or reported clin ically with the use of Avance
® Nerve Graft.  Because Avance® 
Nerve Graft is composed of proteins such as colla gen and laminin; the potential may exist for such 
reactions.  All adverse outcomes potentially attributed to Avance® Nerve Graft are to be promptly 
reported to Axogen, Inc, in accordance with state and federal regulations. 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is processed human nerve tissue.  As with all donated human tissue products the 
risk for transmission of communicable disease does exist.  Robust donor screening and selection is 
completed as required by [CONTACT_395024] 
(AATB), state, and federal guidelines. Processing c ontrols and terminal sterilization with gamma 
irradiation greatly reduce but cannot totally elimin ate the risk of disease transmission.  As disease-
screening methods are limited, there is the potential for certain diseases to not be detected.  The 
following complications of tissue transplantation may occur: 
 
– Transmission of diseases of unknown etiology;  
– Transmission of known infectious agents incl uding, but not limited to viruses, bacteria, and 
fungi. 
 
The processing of Avance
® Nerve Graft was developed with a robust safety and efficacy profile to 
include extensive preclinical testing, established manufacturing controls, and documented previous 
human clinical experience.  
Risks associated with the use of   include adverse events related to the 
implantation of a foreign body and reactions associated  with the xenogeneic prot ein that is used to 
construct the nerve cuff.  The implantation of a 
foreign body (such as a nerve cuff) in a non-sterile 
environment may increase the risk of infection.  Inflammation or surgical site reaction has been 
observed with the use of nerve cuffs and can o ccasionally be severe enough to cause extrusion of the 
cuff through the skin.  Additionally, use of  is contraindicated in individuals at risk of 
localized reaction or anaphylaxis due to known or suspected sensitivity to bovine proteins.  
1.4.1 Preclinical Testing for Avance® Nerve Graft 
Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo biocompatib ility evaluations provide support that Avance® Nerve 
Graft is safe for use in humans.  Additionally, in vivo testing utilizing well established and validated 
animal models has demonstrated efficacy in its inte nded use to reconstruct a nd repair peripheral nerve 
discontinues; and support axonal regeneration of peripheral nerves following transection injury.

Of Neuroscience, Gainesville, FL.  Both designed and conducted preclinical efficacy studies and are 
recognized as leaders in peripheral nerve research (summarized in Table 1.4.1-1). 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft has been subjected to well establis hed and accepted test panels for preclinical 
product safety evaluation and has been found to be  a non-toxic, non-reactive, non-sensitizing, non-
pyrogenic, non-mutagenic, and non-irritant.

1.4.3 Previous Clinical Experience 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   General Use 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is a commercially available product that has been and continues to be 
marketed as a HCT/P tissue product in accordan ce with 21 CFR §1271 regulations since July 
2007.  Since that release date, Axogen has distri buted over 7,000 grafts.  Utilization of Avance® 
Nerve Graft has allowed for the reconstruction of traumatic and iatrogenic peripheral nerve 
transection injuries in the upper and lower extremitie s, head and neck, chest and pelvis.  Injuries 
have included, but are not limited to, lacerati on, blunt trauma, amputation, avulsion, gunshot 
wound, shrapnel, improvised explosive product (IED)  blast trauma, neuroma resection, chemical 
burns, oncologic resection such as facial nerve r econstruction following r esection of parotid gland 
tumor, reconstruction of neurovascular bundle follow ing radical prostatectomy, and reinnervation 
of breast reconstructions following mastectomy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Published Clinical Studies 
 
In 2009, Mayo Clinic published their r esults regarding the performance of Avance® Nerve Graft [3]. This 
investigator initiated study repor ted on segmental nerve defects in  the hand and digits. Functional 
recovery was evaluated by [CONTACT_395026][INVESTIGATOR_394992] (m2PD) and static (s2PD) two point 
discrimination tests. All subjects recovered near normal two-point discrimination. Avance® Nerve Graft 
was demonstrated to be safe and effective with no reported  signs of infection, rejection, or graft extrusion. 
 
Ducic et al reported on outcomes from 54 discreet nerv e repairs that were treated with various repair 
techniques [22] .The authors found that Avance® Nerve Graft returned functional improvements similar to 
those of other test groups. No safety concerns were discussed. 
   Shanti and Ziccardi reported on a single uncontrolled case of Avance
® Nerve Graft for reconstruction of 
the Inferior Alveolar Nerve in the face [23]. Recovery of function was documented. No safety concerns 
were discussed.  The investigators from the Axogen sponsored RANGER
® registry have independently reported on their 
experiences with the Avance® Nerve Graft in two separate peer-reviewed publications. 
Brooks et al reported on 132 individual nerve injuries [24]. Twelve sites with 25 surgeons contributed data 
to this registry database. Data was analyzed to determine the safety and functional outcomes from the use of Avance
® Nerve Graft. Sufficient data for efficacy anal ysis was reported in 76 injuries (49 sensory, 18 
mixed, and 9 motor nerves). Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistency, with no significant differences 
with regard to recovery outcomes between the groups (P>0.05 Fisher’s  Exact Test). No implant related 
adverse experiences were reported. These outcomes we re found to compare favorably to the established 
historical controls from the literature for nerve aut ograft and nerve cuffs. This  work was expanded by [CONTACT_395027] a subgroup analysis on outcomes, specifically for upper extremity nerve repairs with outcomes data from the RANGER
® registry database [25]. In this analysis an upper 
extremity specific population was identified within the RANGER® database presenting with [ADDRESS_496318]-operative follow-up visits at 
1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  This study will be conducted in accordance with the FDA, ICH/GCP requirements and regional IRB Regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, respectively).

4.1 Procedures for Eliciting Reports and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
The primary safety endpoint is intended to evaluate a dverse events associated w ith the surgical repair 
of the injured nerve and is not intended to evaluate  the adverse events of the trauma that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_394995].  Both the Avance® Nerve Graft and the   are commercially 
available products and are restricted to the implantation at the nerve injury site. The effect of each 
product is localized to the area of the nerve discontinu ity only. Ther
efore, the intent is not to capture 
all adverse events that may occur in a subject thr oughout the follow-up period but only events directly 
relating to the study product and/or surgical interventi on.  Given the nature of traumatic hand injuries, 
in-depth medical management approach will be requi red for a majority of the subjects enrolled in the 
clinical study.  Assessment of adverse events may be  limited, to some degree, to those adverse events 
that are related directly to the injured hand, however, to prevent under reporting of potentially associated adverse events, the following may be collected: 
 
Adverse events associated with the affected  hand, may include but is not limited to: 
 bleeding; 
 infection in the affected hand; 
 painful scar at the nerve reconstruction site; 
 extrusion on nerve repair product; 
 delayed wound healing; 
 allergic reaction; 
 hypersensitivity at or distal to the repair site; 
 anaphylaxis; 
 communicable diseases; 
 any change in medical or overall health condition that results in the withdrawal of the subject from the study;

  any adverse event meeting the criteria for Serious Adverse Event; and/or any 
other event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_394996]. 
  
Concurrent illnesses that are present at or before study product implantation, which manifest with 
the same severity, frequency, or duration, subseque nt to study product implantation, need not be 
recorded as AEs.  Similarly, signs or symptoms related to a pre-existing disease need not be recorded as AEs.  However, incidents where there is an increase in severity or duration of the concurrent illness or pre-existing disease that meet the above criteria must be reported.  
 
Adverse events should be reported by [CONTACT_395031] 
21CRF part 312.32 and Guidance for Industry and Investigators:  Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_496323] 
been caused by [CONTACT_33641].   
Disability.  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
Life-threatening adverse drug experience.  Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth de fect.  Important medical events that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
drug experience when, based upon appropriate medica l judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
 
Unexpected adverse drug experience:  Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  For example, under this definition, hepa tic necrosis would be unexpected ( by [CONTACT_14213]) if 
the investigator brochure only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the 
investigator brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience th at has not been previously observed (e.g., included 
in the investigator brochure) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.  
4.[ADDRESS_496324] (whether or not considered product-related by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_10157]), or any even t that has changed adversely in nature, severity, or 
frequency.  An untoward AE or any event that has changed adversely in nature, severity, or frequency 
during the course of study product administration is considered to be a treatment-emergent adverse 
event.  An AE can be, but is not limited to, subjective symptoms experienced by a subject, or objective 
findings that may or may not include subjective symptoms.  Examples of objective findings are clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.  All AEs that occur during or after study product implantation/device insertion must be recorded in the subject’s medical record (progress notes) and 
then transcribed onto the CRF.  The investigator’s  assessment of the AE’s relationship to the study 
product is unrelated to its characterization as an AE.  For example, an anomaly that the investigator 
judges to be unrelated to the investigational/control product may nonetheless be identified as an AE.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that cau ses death, is life threatening, is permanently 
disabling, or requires (or prolongs) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394997].   
4.4.[ADDRESS_496325]’s informed consent form  and the risk analysis section of this protocol, 
the following adverse events are anticipated and may potentially occur during the subject’s 
participation in this investigation: 
 mild incisional redness; 
 tenderness of surgical area; 
 mild edema of surgical area; 
 decreased pain at surgical area; 
 numbness 
These adverse events are considered expected and are not required to be recorded on the Adverse 
Events eCRF unless they increase in severity.  
4.4.2 Severity of Adverse Events 
 
Adverse events will be graded for severity and noted in the description of the event.  The NCI (NIH)-developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI_CTCAE), Version 
4.0, will be used.  In addition, any AE associat ed with subject termination from the study must be 
reported to the sponsor or sponsor-approved designee within [ADDRESS_496326] 
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_394998]/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_394999], using the criteria 
outlined in Table 4.4.3-1.

Relationship  Description 
 
 
Unrelated  An AE that is clearly and uncontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
                  and does not meet the criteria for study product relationship listed under possible or   probable. 
 
 
Possible  An AE may be considered as possibly related if: 
    
  1) it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_46897]’s clinical state by [CONTACT_395032]; or  
  2) it follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration of study product; or, 
   3) it follows a known patter n of response to the study product. 
 
 
Probable  An AE considered, with a high degree of certa inty, to be related to the study product. An AE may  
                  be considered probably related to study product if:  
  1) it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_395033] t’s clinical state or  
   by [CONTACT_395034];  
  2) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study product; 
 
  3) it follows a known pattern of response to study product; 
 
  4) it disappears or decreases upon removal.

4.4.4 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
 
Subjects who present with unresolved or new adver se events at the final scheduled visit will be 
followed by [CONTACT_458]: 
 
 until the adverse event has resolved; or 
 
 until the subject is lost to follow-up; or 
 
 until the adverse event is stabilized or deemed a permanent disease or condition.

 “Resolution” of an AE occurs when  the subject has returned to his/her baseline state of health or 
when the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395000].  
On the last clinical study day, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395001]’s physician believes might reasonably be caused by, or probably caused by, the study product.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395002]-up information to the sponsor or authorized designee.  All SAEs that occur up to [ADDRESS_496328]’s last study assessment must be reported immediately to 
the medical monitor.  
 
4.5 Serious Adverse Event 
 
4.5.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
  Results in death; 
 
 Is life threatening – a “life-threatening” event is  present when the subject is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_104271], at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs.  Note that this definition does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might 
have caused death; 
 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] – 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395003]-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is not considered an adverse event.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395004].  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395005], and if a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is considered serious; 
 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability /incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or 
 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395006], based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  
 
4.5.[ADDRESS_496329] level of SAE reporting.  Thus, it is necessary to report all SAEs following any exposure to study that: 
 
 Result in death, regardless of  relationship to study product; 
 
 Result in persistent or significant disabilities or incapacities, regardless of relationship to study product;

- 
 
  Are an adverse reaction, definitely, probably, or possibly related to study product, that 
requires or prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or requires intervention to prevent 
significant/permanent disability or death; or 
 
 Are life threatening, including all Grade [ADDRESS_496330] data surrounding the event, e.g., the natu re of the symptom(s), 
time of onset in relation to placement of study product, and whether or not treatment with study 
product was interrupted or discontinued.  The principal investigator’s assessment on the probable cause of the event will also be included. 
 
Subjects experiencing a SAE or emergency situa tion should be examined by a physician as soon 
as possible.  The physician in attendance should do  whatever is medically necessary for the safety 
and well-being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation for as long as medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_395007]/or attending phys ician.  The SAE will be 
followed until resolved or until medically stabilized.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395008] (and the IRB/Ethics Committee and appropriate regulatory body, if necessary) 
within [ADDRESS_496331] and Study Procedure 
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395009]/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_395010].  The investigator 
should follow the same criteria outlined above when determining product- or procedure-relatedness.  
4.6 IND Safety Reports 
 
4.6.1   Written reports 
 The sponsor shall notify FDA and all participating investigators in a written IND safety report of: 
 
 Any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and 
unexpected; or 
 
 Any findings from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, te ratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  Each 
notification shall be made as soon as possible a nd in no event later than 15 calendar days 
after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Each written notification may be

- 
 
 submitted either on an FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format (foreign events may be 
submitted either on an FDA Form 3500A or, if  preferred, on a CIOMS I form; reports 
from animal or epi[INVESTIGATOR_395011] a narrative format) and shall 
bear prominent identification of its contents , i.e., “IND Safety Report.”  Each written 
notification to FDA shall be transmitted to the FDA product review division in the Center 
for Biologics Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND.  If 
FDA determines that additional data is needed, the agency may require further data to be submitted. 
 
In each written IND safety report, the sponsor sha ll identify all safety reports previously filed 
with the IND concerning a similar adverse experience, and shall analyze the significance of the adverse experience in light of the previous, similar reports. 
 
4.6.2   Telephone and facsimile tr ansmission safety reports 
 The sponsor shall also notify FDA by [CONTACT_756], by [CONTACT_395035], or by [CONTACT_395036] (eCTD) transmission of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening 
experience associated with the use of the produc t as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 
calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Each telephone call or 
facsimile transmission to FDA shall be transmitte d to the FDA to the product review division in 
the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND. 
 
4.6.3   Follow up 
 Follow up information to a safety report shall be submitted as soon as the relevant information is 
available.  If the results of a sponsor’s investig ation show that an adverse experience was initially 
determined to be not reportable  according to the applicable regulations , but is later deemed 
reportable, the sponsor shall report such experi ence in a written safety report as soon as possible, 
but in no event later than 15 calendar days after th e determination is made.  Results of a sponsor’s 
investigation of other safety information shall be submitted, as appropria te, in an information 
amendment or annual report. 
5 Statistical Considerations 
 Descriptive statistical methods will be used  to summarize the data from this study,  
with hypothesis testing performed for the primary a nd other selected efficacy endpoints.  Unless stated 
otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of events (n), mean, median, standard 
deviation (SD), standard error, minimum, maximum,  and coefficient of variation (CV) for continuous 
data and frequencies and percentages for categorical da ta.  The term “repair type” refers to randomized 
treatment assignment of either 
  or Avance® Nerve Graft.  All data collected 
during the study will be included in data listings.  Un less otherwise noted, the data will be sorted first by 
[CONTACT_395037], subject number, and then by [CONTACT_395038]. 
 Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing w ill be two-sided and will be performed using an overall 
significance (alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS
® System, version 9.1.[ADDRESS_496332]’s visit, the investigator or d esignee should document all significant observations.  
Information from the source documents will be prom ptly transcribed to into the electronic data 
capture system (EDC) via electronic case report forms.  
 Any changes in information in the study progress notes or other source documents will be initialed 
and dated on the day the change is made, by a site study staff member authorized to make the change.  
Changes will be made by [CONTACT_2724] a single line throu gh erroneous data, and clearly entering the correct 
data.  If the reason for the change is not apparent , a brief explanation for the change will be written 
adjacent to the change on the source document and updated accordingly in the EDC system.  
7.[ADDRESS_496333] shall 
be filed with a patient’s clinical record at the s ite and a copy shall be given to the subject and/or 
legally authorized representative.

 7.3 File Management at the Study Site 
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the site files are ma intained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and FDA regulations.  
7.[ADDRESS_496334].  However, essential documents may be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_395039].  
It’s the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395012].  
8 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
 
8.1 Data Management Considerations 
 
Data Management will be overseen by [CONTACT_165562] t CRO contracted and qualified by [CONTACT_456].  
All data points in the study will be held to a globa l Data Management Plan.  Original study logs will 
remain secured at the clinical site and a copy will be transmitted to the data manager.  Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_395013] a nd electronically saved as a Portable Document 
Format (pdf).  The scanned copy will be compared to the paper copy to assure all pages are accounted for and quality meets expectations.    
Data will be entered in to the EDC by [CONTACT_395040].  Quality 
control checks will be established for each data mana gement procedure in order to ensure accuracy 
and to preserve the integrity of the data.  Onsite data monitoring visits w ill be conducted by [CONTACT_395041] A ssociates (CRA) employed by [CONTACT_1758]’ s CRO.  Visits will be conducted 
according to an established procedure and occur acco rding to a predetermined schedule for the entire 
length of the study. 
8.[ADDRESS_496335] of the study.  This will include rout ine data monitoring of the study’s critical variables 
that are defined in the data management plan and clinical monitoring plan.  As part of a concerted 
effort to fulfill the requirements of the protocol, the sponsor or designee may visit the center during the study in addition to maintaining frequent telephone and written communication.  
8.3 Auditing 
 
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit or authorized designee may conduct audits at the study site(s).  
Audits will include, but are not limited to, pro duct supply, presence of required documents, the 
informed consent process, and comparison of case report forms with source documents.  The 
investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable 
manner.  

Protocol No. ANG-CP-[ADDRESS_496336] be submitted to the IRB/IEC identified 
with the responsibility to approve research for the st udy site.  Written approval must come from the 
IRB/IEC Chairman or Secretary, either as a letter or  as a copy of the appropriate sections of the IRB/IEC 
meeting minutes where the review of the study protoc ol and associated informed consent form were 
discussed and approved.  The investigator will not partic ipate in the decision.  If the investigator is an 
IRB/IEC member, the written approval must indicate such non-participation. 
 The investigator will submit study status reports to the IRB/IEC no less frequently than annually (when 
applicable).  The investigator must notify the IRB/IE C in writing of the interruption and/or completion of 
the study.  The investigator must promptly report to the IRB/IEC all chang es in research (protocol 
amendments), and will not make such changes w ithout IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subj ects.  In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified 
with 5 working days of the change.  The inves tigator will promptly report to the IRB/IEC all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others.  The inves tigator must maintain accurate and 
complete records of all correspondence written to and received from the IRB/IEC and must agree to share 
all such documents and reports with the sponsor.  
[ADDRESS_496337] written permission from Axogen.  
However, authorized regulatory officials and Axoge n personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed 
full access to inspect and copy study records.  All st udy materials collected shall be used solely in 
accordance with this protocol, unless first agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_395042].   Subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_395043].  Their full names may, 
however, be made known to a regulatory agency or  other authorized officials if necessary.

 12 Regulatory Considerations  
12.1 Amendments 
 
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from the sponsor and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  Any permanent change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific study center(s ), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  
Any amendment to the protocol identified as necessary and occurring during active study conduct, 
will be fully discussed by [CONTACT_093](s) and th e sponsor prior to any protocol updates.  If 
agreement is reached regarding th e need for an amendment, the sponsor will be responsible for 
updating the protocol.  The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB/IEC designated with this responsibility.  Except for ‘adm inistrative amendments’ investigators must await 
IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before  implementing the changes(s).  Administrative 
amendments are defined as having no effect on th e safety of the research subjects, scope of the 
investigation, or quality of the trial.  However, a protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects should be implemente d immediately, and the IRB/IEC notified within 
five working days.  Axogen will submit all offici al protocol amendments to the FDA or other 
regulatory agencies.   
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the I RB/IEC, the investigators and/or the sponsor, the 
amendment to the protocol substa ntially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification.  
In such cases, repeat informed c onsent will be obtained from all subj ects enrolled in the study before 
continued participation.  
12.[ADDRESS_496338]’s continuation in the study.  This decision will be documented by [CONTACT_51243], and reviewed by [CONTACT_2037].  
12.[ADDRESS_496339] of this clinical study 
as specified in 21CRF part 312 Subpart D.  This  clinical investigation will be performed in 
compliance with the protocol, Clinical Study Agr eement, the FDA Good Clinical Practices including 
21CRF part 312, 601, 50, 56, ICH E6, and local applicable regulatory requirements.

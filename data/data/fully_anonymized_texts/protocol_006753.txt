Amendment (b)  21-Jan-2022  
Amendment (a)  15-Dec-2021  
Original Protocol  13-Jan-2021  
Amendment  c 
This amendment is considered to be substantial.  
The amendment is considered to be substantial because of the change in design and 
methodology, and revision to the primary endpoints, which impacts the scientific value of the 
study.  
 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to revise the dual primary endpoints .  
Given the significant weight loss, and associated cardiometabolic improvements, achieved with 
tirzepatide, assessment of CV death and HF events, in addition to KCCQ score as a primary 
endpoint, offers the unique opportunity to evaluate tirzepatide for the benefit of patients with 
HFpEF and obesity. The dual primary endpoints described in GPID Protocol Amendment (b) 
may not be able to capture the full potential benefit offered by [CONTACT_10938].  
Additionally, this amendment broadens  the heart failure endpoint defin ition based on growing 
evidence that supports outpatient intensification of oral diuretics indicating worsening of HF . 
This change results in a new definition of HF event, defined as worsening symptoms or signs of 
HF, which are treated  either as an inpatient (by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_059], treated by [CONTACT_10939]) or as an outpatient (by [CONTACT_10940]) .

3. Objectives and Endpoints  Revised primary endpoints to  
 Change from baseline 
to Week 52 in the 
KCCQ -CSS 
 Occurrence of the 
composite endpoint of 
CV death and/or HF 
events over time  Assessment of CV death and 
HF events, in addition to 
change from baseline to Week 
52 in the KCCQ -CSS score as a 
primary endpoint, offers the 
unique opportunity to evaluate 
tirzepatide for the benefit of 
patients with HFpEF and 
obesity . 
The hierarchical comp onents 
using the win  ratio were 
removed from alpha -adjusted 
endpoints as they present 
significant complexity in 
analytics and interpretation  
 
Key secondary endpoint s 
revised to   
 change from baseline 
to Week 2452 in 
6MWD  
 percent change from 
baseline to week 52 in 
body weight  
 Change from baseline 
to Week 52 in hsCRP  
 NYHA class change 
at week 52  
 Change from baseline 
to week 52 in the 
KCCQ -CSS Revisions aligned with change 
in primary endpoint . hsCRP  
added as key secondary as it is 
considered a clinically 
significant  biomarker in HF 
population

 16 1. Protocol Summary   
1.1. Synopsis   
Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study Comparing 
the Efficacy and Safety of Tirzepatide versus Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure with 
Preserved Ejection Fraction and Obesity (SUMMIT)  
Short Title:  Tirzepatide vs Placebo in Obesity -related HFpEF  
Rationale : 
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogenou s clinical syndrome resulting from 
various pathophysiological processes. Among the broad spectrum of HFpEF clinical 
presentation, obesity -related HFpEF displays a distinct phenotype where increased visceral and 
ectopic adiposity as well as volume expansion  plays a causal role ( Kitzman and Shah 2016; 
Packer 2018 ; Miller and Borlaug 2020). Given tirzepatide’s anti -inflammatory and antifibrotic 
effects and a reduction in circulating plasma volume as a consequence of the treatment of 
obesity, tirzepatide may provide clinical benefit to patients with HFpEF and BMI ≥30 kg/m2.  
Study I8F -MC-GPID, also known as SUMMIT, is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, 
international, placebo -controlled, double -blinded , parallel -arm study. This study will evaluate the 
effect of SC QW injection of tirzepatide , MTD  up to 15 mg , on the health status, risk of death, 
HF events , and exercise capacity  in participants with HFpEF and BMI ≥30 kg/m2.

Overall Design  
Study GPID is a randomized, out patient , multicenter, international, placebo -controlled, double -
blind , parallel -arm, Phase 3 study with 2 study periods. The study is designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of SC QW tirzepatide,  MTD up to 15  mg, compared to placebo, in 
participant s with HFpEF  and obesity.  
Two intervention groups will be studied:  
 Tirzepatide , MTD up to 15 mg , SC QW  
 Placebo  
The starting dose of tirzepatide is 2.[ADDRESS_10449] maintenance dose tolerated by [CONTACT_941] p articipant (see 
Section  6).  
Disclosure Statement : This is a parallel -treatment  study with  2 intervention groups that is 
double  blinded . 
Number of Participant s: 
Approximately 700 participants  will be randomly assigned  to study  drug with approximately  
350 participants per intervention group.  
Intervention Groups  and Duration : 
The study will compare treatment with  tirzepatide and treatment with placebo . Assignment to 
tirzepatide or placebo groups  will be randomly allocated in a 1:[ADDRESS_10450] 
maintenance dose  tolerated by [CONTACT_2299]  (5 mg, 10 mg, QW). 
Study partic ipation for each participant is sectioned into the  following study periods:  
 Study Period 1: screening period, approximately 6 weeks  and no t more than 12 weeks  
 Study Period 2: treatment period, at least [ADDRESS_10451] participant is randomized. 
The maximum duration of an individual’s participation is estimated to be 120 weeks and will 
depend on duration of study enrollment .

a   There are 3 types of Unscheduled Visits (UV):  These visits can occur during the dose -escalation period and maintenance period.  
 Unscheduled Visits (UV) – Unscheduled Visit per investigator discretion. All activities with a check mark  in UV visit are required.  
 Dosing Unscheduled Visit (UV) – these visits will include dose re -escalation . The study drug must be restarted when it is safe to do so and only while at 
the clinic visit. The  subsequent unscheduled  dosing visits will be scheduled every 4 weeks (±7 days) until maximum tolerated dose is achieved.  
 Phone Follow -up Dosing Unscheduled Visit (UV) – these visits are optional phone visits.  
b At least  52 weeks (Visit 1 2) of treatment are planned. Additional visits after Visit 1 2 will occur every 3 months. The visits occurring after Visit 1 2 will follow 
the Extended Maintenance Visit schedule in sequence (EVa, EVb , EVc, and EVd) then repeat.  If the final study  visit is combined, site should only use the 
visit 12 lab kit; please refer to  Study Closeout and Final Visit in  Section 4.1. 
c Telephone visits can become office visits. Site documentation will serve as the source for telephone visits.  Additional , optional telephone visits may be 
conducted at investigator discreti on. If patient requires  study drug  at a telephone visit, the participant will need to come to the clinic to pi[INVESTIGATOR_10892].  
d Perform at ET only if participant early terminates at or prior to Week 52.  
e Two 6MWTs conducted at screening visit.  
f See Section 10.10.1  to determine if the 6MWT needs to be repeated for Visit 2.  
g    This includes glucose monitoring for p articipant s with T2D, weekly study drug injection . 
h Perform PRO at ET only if participant early terminates at or prior to Week 52.  
i Unscheduled Visit s: laboratory tests may be drawn according to investigator discretion . If only re -test labs required, site is not required to complete an 
unsched uled visit and associated procedures.

 [ADDRESS_10457] phenotype where increased visceral and 
ectopic adiposity as well as volume expansion plays a causal role  (Kitzman and Shah 2016 ; 
Packer 2018 ; Miller  and Borlaug 2020) . Given tirzepatide’s potential  to decrease inflammation  
and fibrosis and a to reduc e circulating plasma volume as a consequence of the treatment of 
obesity , tirzepatide may provide clinical  benefit to patients with HFpEF and BMI ≥30 kg/m 2. 
Study I8F -MC-GPID, also known as SUMMIT, is a Phase 3, randomized, multicente r, 
international, placebo -controlled, double -blinded , parallel -arm study. This study will evaluate the 
effect of SC  QW injection of tirzepatide, MTD up to 15 mg, on the health status,  risk of death, 
HF events, and exercise capacity in participants with HFp EF and BMI ≥30 kg/m2. 
2.2. Background   
Obesity is one of the main attributes to worsen quality of life in patients with HFpEF (Reddy et 
al. 2020). There is a significant  unmet need in treatment of patients  with HFpEF. Tirzepatide , a 
GIP and GLP -[ADDRESS_10458],  has the potential to provide benef it to patient s with HFpEF and 
BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Tirzepatide may improve symp toms and exercise capacity and may also a 
reduce in HF  events  and/or increase survival. Supporting a causal association between obesity 
and HFpEF, bariatric surgery improved NYHA class, patient -reported outcomes, and echo 
parameters (LV wall thickness , LV relaxation) in patients with HFpE F and obesity  (Mikhalkova 
et al. 2018). A met a-analysis of bariatric surgery also showed improvement in functional 
capacity 6 to 12 months after surgery in patient s with obesity (Herring et al. 2016). In patient s 
with HFpEF  and obesity , diet -induced weight loss (Δ=−7 kg, 20 weeks) significantly impro ved 
symptoms (KCCQ) and exercise capacity (6MWD and peak oxygen uptake ) (Kitzman et al. 
2016). Furthermore,  weight reduction is proven to be effective in reducing HF risk and HF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. A large observational study has demonstrated a 62% decrease  (over 8 years)  of 
HF incidence after bariatric surgery in patient s with T2DM (Aminian et al. 2019). The reduction 
of HF risk after bariatric surgery has been consistently demonstrated in broader patient  
populations and considered to be mediated by [CONTACT_8497] l oss with a hazard ratio for a 10 -kg weight 
loss being 0.77 (Sundström et al. 2017; Jamaly et al. 2019). Moreover, a self -controlled case 
study showed a 29% (0 to 12 months) and a 43% (13 to 24 months) risk reduction of HF  events  
in patient s with HFpEF afte r bariatric surgery (Shimada et al. 2016).  Finally, in a recently 
published placebo -controlled study (STEP -HFpEF), semaglutide reduced body weight by 10.7% 
and improved KCCQ -CSS by 7.8 points at 52 weeks, both with p <0.001 (Kosiborod et al. 2023; 
Borlaug e t al. 2023). In addition, superiority on the hierarchical composite endpoint (death, HF 
events, differences in the change in KCCQ -CSS, and 6MWD) was achieved, including the 
proportion of patients who had improved KCCQ score by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_10459]

 43 12 patients in the placebo group, but only in 1 patient in the semaglutide group (HR 0.08; 95% 
CI 0.00 to 0.42)  
It has been demonstrated that tirzepatide  can provide significant body weigh t loss and 
improvement  of lipid and glucose metabolism in patients with and without  T2DM (Frias et al. 
2018 ; Wilson et al. 2020; Jastreboff et al. 2022 ). It is known that the body weight reduction  with 
GLP -1 RAs in patients without T2DM is higher than in patient s with T2DM (Davies et al. 2015; 
Pi-Sunyer et al. 2015; Lingvay et al. 2018). If Study GPID is assumed to incl ude 40% to 50% of 
patient s with T2DM, the mean placebo -adjusted body weight percent reduction that tirzepatide 
can provide in 52 weeks in this study is estimated to be 15% to 16%. This is based on tirzepatide 
clinical data and the understanding of body wei ght loss differences between patient s with and 
without T2DM treated with GLP -1 RAs. Thus, the predicted body weight loss with treatment 
with tirzepatide is close to that shown with bariatric surgery.  
Tirzepatide may provide benefit to patient s with HFpEF and obesity  by [CONTACT_10945] (Wilson et al. 2020). Given the wide distribution of GIP receptor in the adipose 
tissue , GIP is  thought to be actively involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.  As suggested by 
[CONTACT_10946] (Kosiborod et al. 2023) and the  significant weight loss achieved with 
tirzepatide, the effect of tirzepatide on HF events in an obesity -related H FpEF population are 
expected to be robust. Therefore, it will be meaningful to assess the impact of tirzepatide not 
only on functional and symptomatic endpoints but also on the reduction in the risk of HF events 
in SUMMIT, thereby [CONTACT_10947].

 47 4. Study Design   
4.1. Overall  Design   
Study GPID is a randomized, outpatient, multicenter, international, placebo -controlled, double -
blinded , parallel -arm, Phase 3 study with 2 study periods. The study is designed t o evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of SC QW tirzepatide, MTD up to 15  mg, compared to placebo, in 
participant s with HFpEF  and obesity.  
Two intervention groups will be studied:  
 Tirzepatide MTD up to 15 mg SC QW  
 Placebo  
The study will compare treatment with tirzepatide and treatment with placebo . Assignment to 
tirzepatide or placebo groups will be randomly allocated in a 1:[ADDRESS_10463] maintenance dose tolerated by [CONTACT_2416] (see Section 6).  
 
The study will consist of 2 periods:  
 Study Period 1: screening period, lasting no more than 12 weeks .  
 Study Period 2 : treatment period, with a [ADDRESS_10464] participant is randomized. 
The maximum duration of an individual’s participation is estimat ed to be 120 weeks and will 
depend on duration of study enrollment.  
Participant Visit Scheme  
Study participants will undergo screening assessments and procedures, randomization, 
and double -blinded treatment with tirzepatide  or placebo. Assessments and procedures to 
be conducted in each treatment period are described in the SoA (Section  1.3) and in Study 
Assessments and Procedures (Section 8). 
Screening  
Screening procedures will be performed at Visit 1. Visit 1  procedures may be conducted over 
more than 1 day as long as all activities are completed within the allowable visit tolerance  for 
each visit. The duration of Visit 1 is anticipated to be <[ADDRESS_10465] ing the second  6MWT ( at least [ADDRESS_10466]). The screening 6MWT s may be conducted over more than 1 day .  
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 48 Randomization  
At Visit 2, prior to randomization,  the participant needs to complete  the 6MWT. Visit 2 may 
need to be conducted over 2 in -clinic visits (considered Visit 2a and Visit 2b) if a repeat 6MWT 
is necessary to assess participant eligibility. If the participant is required to return to repeat the 
6MWT, the remaining procedures should be con ducted at the second in -clinic visit for 
randomization (Visit 2b), more than [ADDRESS_10467]  not receive study drug until all 
eligibility criteria, including the 6MWT, are met.   
Treatment  
Starting from randomization, the participant receives study drug and procedures are conducted as 
described in the SoA (Section  1.3). Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_10950] . 
Study drug dose will be escalated as illustrated in the study schema (Section 1.2). Dose 
escalation will continue until the participant reaches the maintenance dose of either [ADDRESS_10468] dose escalation (that is, from 2. 5 mg to 5 mg 
[or placebo equivalent]) will need to discontinue from study drug.  
Participants begin treatment with either tirzepatide  or placebo starting at 2.5 mg given as a 
subcutaneous ( SC) injection every week (QW). The dose level is increased by 2.[ADDRESS_10469] 20 weeks according to the participant’s tolerability, 
reaching a MTD up to 15 mg. Once a MTD has been achieved, participants will continue at this 
MTD until study end, treatment discontinuation, or stud y discontinuation . Dose modifications 
will be permitted during the study under the circumstances specified in Section 6.6. 
During the study treatment period , if an unscheduled visit or telephone visit is deemed necessary 
to support pa rticipant  compliance, this is allowable at the discretion of the investigator site 
personnel.  Optional telephone visits can be performed approximately 2 weeks after starting 
study drug and after each dose increase.  
Participants will continue into the extended maintenance period with the same treatment 
assignment starting with Visit 13. Extended visits (EV) continue until criteria for study 
discontinuation is met or st udy ends  (see Study Closeout and Final Visit below).  
Study Closeout and Final Visit  
The study will continue until approximately 52 weeks after the final participant is randomized  
The final study visit (V isit 99) for the study is based from the date of whe n the last patient for the 
trial was randomized.   
Approximately [ADDRESS_10470] patient randomized 
to the study . During the study closeout, a final visit (Visit 99 ) will be planned for each 
participant , with the exception of those  who have died or prematurely discontinued from the 
study (Section  7.2). Any participant that has completed at least 5 2 weeks of study duration 
should  be scheduled to complete the final visit (Visit 99) during this 3 -month period  prior to the 
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 [ADDRESS_10471] will be dispensed at this final visit.  Study 
procedures for the final visit will be performed as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). Subjects 
completing  [ADDRESS_10472] a combined 
Visit 12 (52 -week treatment visit) and Visit 99 (final visit) on the same day. During this 
combined visit, sites should only use the Visit 12 lab kit for blood draws and processing.   
All unused study drug (unused single -dose pens) must be returned for compliance and final drug 
accountability. The sh arp items container should also be returned to site or disposed of per local 
regulations.  
Any participant who has discontinued the study prior to completing 52 weeks of study duration 
is expected to complete an early termination visit per the SoA.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design   
Study GPID is a Phase 3 study designed to examine the efficacy and safety of SC QW tirzepatide 
MTD compared with placebo in participant s wit h HFpEF  and BMI  ≥30 kg/m2. 
A placebo comparator was selected for this trial in accordance with regulatory guidance 
(FDA  2007; EMA 2016).  Inclusion of a placebo comparator in Study GPID will allow for a 
direct assessment  of the safety and efficacy of tirzep atide in participant s with HFpEF and 
obesity .  
Additionally, there is currently no approved therapy to be used as an active comparator  in this 
population . 
An endpoint assessment at [ADDRESS_10473] of changes to concomitant medications, participants will be permitted to use 
the stable dose of concomitant medications that they require during the study. Medications that 
may interfere with the assessment of efficacy and safety characteristics of the study drug will not 
be allowed (see Section  6.5). 
Assessment of HF  events  is relevant to HFpEF, which is characterized by a high frequency of 
recurrent HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Moreover, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10894] , both of readmission and death (Solomon et al . 2007 ). 
Recent studies have shown that outpatient oral diuretic intensification in ambulatory care carries 
similar risk as an urgent HF visit and  is independently associated with subsequent cardiovascular 
events , including death  (Chatur  et al. 2023 ; Ferreira et al. 2022 ; Madelaire et al. 2020 ).  
 Obesity is associated with  important degrees of exercise intolerance and a markedly impaired 
quality of life and health status (Reddy et al. 2020).  In patients with HFpEF, due to increased 
filling pressures, functional capacity is severely impaired , and patients can develop symptoms 
with light exercise. As a result, the ability to perform activities of daily living is deteriorated. 
Therefore, KCCQ  is a meaningful endpoint to evaluate the clinical benefit of ti rzepatide in 
patients with HFpEF and obesity.

 50 Given the significant weight loss, and associated cardiometabolic improvements, achieved with 
tirzepatide, assessment of CV death and HF events, in addition to KCCQ -CSS as a primary 
endpoint, offers the unique opportunity to evaluate tirzepatide for the benefit of HFpEF patients 
with obesity .  
4.2.1.  Patient  Input into Design   
The sponsor involved pati ents in the design of this study by [CONTACT_10951]. The insights gained from these events were used to ensure that the study 
design is supportive of the well -being of the study participants and that the study procedures c an 
be implemented effectively at the investigative sites.  
4.3. Justification for Dose   
Tirzepatide doses of up to 15 mg administered SC QW will be evaluated in this study.  
Participant s may be treated with lower maintenance doses of 5 mg or 10 mg if they do not 
achieve full dose escalation to 15 mg and/or do not tolerate 15 mg.  
These doses and associated escalation schemes were selected based on assessment of safety, 
efficacy (glycemic and weight loss benefit), and GI tolerability data followed by [CONTACT_10952] s with T2DM in Phase [ADDRESS_10474] been tested and compared with dulaglutide 1.5  mg

There are no restrictions on the time of day each weekly dose of study drug is given, but it is 
advisable to administer the SC injections on the same day and same time each week. The actual 
date, time , and injection site location of all dose administrations will be recorded in the diary by 
[CONTACT_2299]. If a dose of study drug is missed, the participant should take it as soon as 
possible , unless it is within [ADDRESS_10491] study drug subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh using the injection 
supplies provided; a caregiver may also administer the injection in the participant’s upper arm. 
The injection site location of all dose administrations will be recorded by [CONTACT_2299]. A n ew 
autoinjector will be used for each injection. If study drug is to always be injected in the same 
body region, participants should be advised to rotate injection sites each week . 
6.1.1.  Medical Devices   
The combination product provided for use in the study is a tirzepatide or matching placebo  
autoinjector .  
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability   
 The inves tigator or designee must confirm appropriate storage conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study drug received and any discrepancies are reported 
and resolved before use of the study drug. 
 Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study drug. Only study personnel  may 
supply study drug.  
 All study drug must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled stor age conditions with access 
limited to the investigator and authorized  study personnel . 
 The investigator, institution,  or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is  
responsible for study drug (includes study drug and autoinjector or single -dose pen) 
accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance ( that is , receipt, reconciliation, and 
final disposition of records).  
 Study site staff must regularly assess whether the participant is correctly administering 
the assigned study drug and stori ng study drug according to the provided instructions.  
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 59 Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study drugs are 
provided in the study training materials.  
The investigator or designee is responsible for the following:  
 Explaining t he correct use of the study drug to the participant  
 Verifying that instructions are followed properly  
 Maintaining accurate records of study drug dispensing and collection as well as records of 
interruptions in study drug administration  
 Instructing the part icipant to discard all used autoinjectors for study drug in a closeable, 
puncture -resistant container and dispose according to local regulations , and  
 Considering  dose adjust ment of antihyperglycemic medications (see Section 6.5) at Visit [ADDRESS_10492] administration of study drug . 
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding   
This is  a double -blind study.  
Participants who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized to one of the study treatment  
groups at the end of Visit 2. Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -
generated, random sequence using an IWRS. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive tirzepatide or placebo. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_10961] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10898] ) within 12 months of screening (Y/N), diagnosed T2DM (Y/N), and BMI  ≥35 kg/m2 
(Y/N).  
Before the study is initiated, the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided 
to each site.  
Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits shown in the SoA.  
Returned unused study drug should not be re -dispensed to the participants.  
The IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant ’s drug 
assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first c onsideration in making such 
a determination. If a participant’s drug assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
immediately after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be 
recorded in the source documentation and CRF , as applicable.  
If an investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or participant is unblinded, the 
participant must be discontinued from the study. In cases where there are ethical reasons to have 
the participant remain in the study, the inves tigator must obtain specific approval from a sponsor 
CRP for the  participant to continue in the study.  
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance   
Participant compliance with study drug and adherence to study visits and procedures will be 
vitally important to meet the study objectives. This will be emphasized through comprehensive 
site training and consistently monitoring participant  retention throughout the du ration of the 
study.   
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 60  
Study drug compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_716]:  
 Study drug administration data will be recorded by [CONTACT_10962].  
 The participants will be instructed to return any unused study drug and/or empty cartons 
at the next visit to the study site for the purpose of performing drug accountability.  
Treatment compliance is defined as taking at least 75% of the required doses of study drug. 
Similarly , a participant will be considered significantly noncompliant if he or she is judged by 
[CONTACT_10963]  (more than 125%) .  
In addition to the assessment of a participa nt’s compliance with the study drug administration, 
other  aspects of compliance with the study drug will be assessed at each visit based on the 
participant ’s adherence to the visit schedule, completion of study diaries, and any other 
parameters the investigator considers necessary.  
Participant s considered to be poorly compliant with their medication and/or the study procedures 
will receive additional traini ng and instruction, as required, and will be reminded of the 
importance of complying with the protocol.  
6.5. Concomitant Therapy   
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) or other specific categories of interest that the participant is receiving 
at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with:  
● Reason for use  
● Dates of admin istration including start and end dates  
● Dosage information including dose and frequency  for concomitant therapy of 
special interest  (drugs used for diabetes, diuretics, drugs used for obesity, and 
cardiovascular drugs)  
The sponsor  should be contact[CONTACT_10964].  
Initial doses of tirzepatide delay gastric emptying and have the potential to transiently impact the 
rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. Tirzepatide shoul d be 
used with caution in participant s receiving oral medicinal products that require rapid GI 
absorption following the initial doses of tirzepatide , as exposure to oral medications may 
be increased.  
Prevention of Hypoglycemia  
Similar to GLP -1 RAs, tirzepatide  does not generally cause hypoglycemia, but it is 
recommend ed to decrease the dose of concomitant sul fonylurea or insulin to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_10899] T2DM . For participant s with T2DM , specif ic, 
individually tailored adjustments of the respective antihyperglycemic medications should be 
considered during the entire study.  
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 61 At Visit  2, with the initiation of study drug, the dose adjustments to the following concomitant 
glucose lowering medications are recommended.  
Sulfonylureas: Sulfonylurea dose is recommended to be reduced at least 50% or discontinued, 
especially if the participant  is receiving a low dose at randomization.  
Insulins:  For participant s on basal  insulin and with screening HbA1c ≤8.5%, the daily dose is 
recommended to be reduced by [CONTACT_2669] 20%.  
During the dose escalation period, consider adjusting  the total daily dose of insulin, if required 
for controlling worsening hyperglycemia and its acute complications.  
During the ma intenance period, further insulin dose reduction for the prevention of 
hypoglycemia is to be considered at the investigator’s discretion.  
Standard of Care  for T2DM   
The standard of care for diabetes may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator as 
clinically indicated in accordance with local standard of care and professional society guidelines.  
Participant s will be permitted to use concomitant medications that they require during the study, 
except certain medications that may interfere with the as sessment of efficacy and safety 
characteristics of the study drug. Prohibited medications include all GLP -1 RAs and pramlintide. 
Discontinuation of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors at randomization is recommended in line 
with guidelines. Similarly, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_10900] (Davies et al. 2018).   
Regarding the use of insulin, pa rticipant s can be included if treated with basal insulin only ; and 
are allowed to use prandial insulin if needed during the study to attain optimal glucose control.  
Hyperglycemia Rescue  
Other medications for glycemic control for participant s with T2DM  meeting severe, persistent 
hyperglycemia criteria for rescue may be added  during the study at the  investigator’s discretion.  
Rescue therapy with glucose -lowering agents, including basal and prandial  insulins , may be 
medically indicated in  situations after randomization due to severe, persistent hyperglycemia or 
early discontinu ation of  study drug. 
Hyperglycemia rescue criteria will be determined from values recorded in T2DM participant 
diaries. If a diary  value equal to or greater than the glycemic threshold for rescue ( see definitions 
below) is recorded, that value should be co nfirmed by a repeat fasting glucose  text within 
48 hours  (for example, local labor atory ). Intensification of T2DM therapy should be initiated if 
confirmed fasting glucose values are:  
 ≥15.0 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_10493] a 2 -week period (at 
least 2 consecutive values) after randomization  
 ≥13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) from Week [ADDRESS_10494] a 2 -week period (at 
least 2 consecutive values)  
 ≥11.1 mmol/L (2 00 mg/dL) from Week [ADDRESS_10495] a 2 -week period 
(at least 2 consecutive values)

 62 In addition, if HbA1c is >9.0% at Week 12 or >8.0% at Week 24 or later in the study, 
glucose -lowering therapy should be adjusted to improve glycemic contro l as outlined above . In 
the event a participant’s HbA1c values are less than these thresholds but are higher than what the 
investigator feels comfortable leaving untreated, glucose -lowering medication can be adjusted. In 
addition, if participant s develop s ymptoms of hyperglycemia ( for example,  polyuria and 
polydipsia), the investigator should implement measures to determine glycemic control and 
adjust as necessary. For participant s newly diagnosed with T2DM during the trial, appropriate 
glucose -lowering the rapy should be initiated  per standard of care . 
Standard of Care for Heart Failure  
Anticipated treatment for heart failure should be decided prior to randomization.  
Both A merican College of Cardiology /American Heart Association  and E uropean Society of 
Cardiology  guidelines recommend symptom management with diuretic agents in patients with 
excess volume, as well as aggressive risk factor management for comorbidities  for the treatment 
of HFpEF  (van der Meer JACC 2019) . Optimization of volume status and pro active adjustment 
of diuretic doses will help control symptoms and volume overload.  
Participant s should remain on stable doses of medications to treat heart failure condition and 
comorbidities such as hypertension. With the exception of diuretics, d ose modification or 
alteration of such background therapi[INVESTIGATOR_10901] ’s condition . However, if the participant ’s condition warrants a change in 
any of these medications, it will be allowed at the d iscretion of the investigator.  
Management of Participants with Gastrointestinal Symptoms  
In the Phase [ADDRESS_10496] commonly reported TEAEs for participants receiving 
tirzepatide were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. To mitigate GI symptoms and manage 
participants with intolerable GI AEs, the investigator should:  
 Advise participant s to eat smaller meals, for example, splitting 3 daily meals into 4, or 
more smaller meals, and to stop eating when they feel full. Also, participant s may be 
informed that lower -fat meals could be better tolerated.  
 Prescribe symptomatic medication (for example, anti -emetic or antidiarrheal medication) 
per local country availability and individual participant  needs. Use of symptomatic 
medication should be captur ed as concomitant medication in the eCRF.  
 Temporarily interrupt study drug. See Section 6.6.1 . The data related to temporary 
interruption of study drug should be documented in source documents and entered on 
the eCRF.  
 After the interruption, follow the guidance for restarting study drug  (Section  6.6.2 ). 
If intolerable GI symptoms or events persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_10902], other dose 
modifications (see Section 6.6) may be considered .

 63 6.6. Dose Modification   
Interventions to optimize study drug tolerance and adherence may be employed throughout the 
study and include, but are not limited to, brief temporary interruptions  and use of a dditional 
medications  to manage symptoms.  
Dose modifications, including temporary interruption and de-escalation may occur to manage 
issues with tolerability. It is preferred to attempt a temporary dose interruption (at any time) 
(Section 6.6.1) to manage tolerability issues.  After a temporary dose interruption, p articipants 
may resume study drug at the same dose, re -escalate to the prior dose level (if re -escalation is 
desired or required ), or resume at a lower MTD dose level, as tolerated.  Guidance for resuming 
study drug after a temporary dose interruption should be followed (Section 6.6.2). 
Unwarranted excessive weight reduction : Dose interruption is preferred over de-escalation 
for slow ing unwarranted  excessive weight loss ; however , the method used  is at the 
investigator’s discretion . After the dose escalation period and at the investigator’s discretion, 
when excessive  weight reduction is not warranted due to safety concerns, the investigator may 
choose to adjust the study drug dose without first attempting a temporary dose interrupti on. The 
participant’s study drug dose will be permanently reduced to [ADDRESS_10497] 
blinded  study drug temporarily interrupted (Section 6.6.1 ).  
Dose reductions  for unwarranted excessive weight loss  may occur at scheduled and unscheduled 
visits . 
6.6.1.  Temporary Interruption   
Temporary study drug interruption should be utilized to manage tolerability issues . After 
randomization, the investigator may interrupt study drug, for example, due to an AE (such as 
nausea vomiting , excessive unwarranted weight loss  or a clinically significant laboratory value ). 
Guidance for resuming study drug after  a temporary dose interruption should be followed 
(Section 6.6.2 ). If study drug interruption is due to an AE, the event is to be followed and 
documented.   
For cases where increased ALT, AST, or ALP occurs, study  drug may be interrupted  (Section 
6.6.2 ), and close hepatic monitoring must be initiated (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The interruption of study 
drug is not equivalent to discontinuation from study  treatment.  Any interruption of study drug 
does not affect the study visit structure/schedule per the SoA  (Section 1.3 ). Even if study drug is 
interrupted, study procedures should continue during the dose interruption. Every effort should 
be made by [CONTACT_10965] s in the study and to res tart study drug 
promptly after any interruption, as soon as it is safe to do so (see Section  6.6.2. for restarting 
study drug). Dose interruptions are managed through the IWRS. The data related to interruption 
of study drug will be documented in source documents and entered on the eCRF , however  
participant  noncompliance should not be recorded as interruption of study drug on the eC RF. 
Participant s who have a temporary interruption of the study drug will continue participating in 
the trial according to the protocol to collect all planned efficacy and safety measurements 
(Section  1.3).

reached maintenance dose level, the study drug 
dose level will restart at the same prior achieved 
maintenance dose  level.  
3 or more consecutive doses  Participant restarts study drug (at 5 mg, managed 
by [CONTACT_10966]) and repeats dose escalation scheme  until 
maintenance dose  is reached. I f maintenance dose  
has previously been established , the dose  escalation  
cannot  not exceed the prior achieved maintenance 
dose level.  
Due to an AE  The event is to be documented and followed 
according to the procedures in Section 8.3. 
Due to intolerable persistent GI AE  Participants should be tre ated as suggested in 
Section 6.5. 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; GI = gastrointestinal; IWRS = interactive web response service.  
Investigators s hould inform the sponsor that study drug has been temporarily interrupted.  
Participants are not required to re -escalate to the prior maintenance  dose level if a tolerability 
issue recurs during dose re -escalation.  
If this attempted dose re -escalation to the prior maintenance dose  level is not tolerated, the dose 
should be reduced to the next lower 5 mg incremental dose that was tolerated (for example, 5 mg 
or 10 mg). The participant will remain at that dose level for the duration of the study. During re-
escalation after a temporary dose interruption, participants should be followed every 4 weeks  
until either a new lower ma intenance dose level or prior maintenance dose level is reached.   
For participants receiving 5  mg maintenance dose , no dose de -escalation is permitted. Only dose 
interruption is permitted to manage tolerability issues (Section 6.6.2 ). This can be performed 
throug h IWRS.    
In the event that a participant  has a temporary interruption that requires extending the escalation 
beyond Visit 8, unscheduled visits are allowed in the IWRS to facilitate a 4 -week dispensing 
schedule to complete the escalation.  
If an unscheduled visit occurs in the same week or date o f a regular  scheduled visit per the SoA, 
the site should complete all procedures included for the regular scheduled visit . Unscheduled

 66 7. Discontinuation of Study Intervention  and Participant 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal   
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention   
7.1.1.  Permanent Discontinuation from Study Drug   
Before permanently discontinuing study drug, attempts to maintain the participant should be 
documented (see Dose Modification , Section 6.6 and Temporary Dose Interruption, Section  
6.6.1 ). Contact [CONTACT_10968]. It is the goal for 
participan ts to remain on study drug treatment until study ends.  
Permanent discontinuation of study drug will not automatically lead to discontinuation from the 
study.  If study drug is permanently  discontinued, the participant will remain in the study and 
attend al l scheduled visits to be evaluated for safety and efficacy  as described in the SoA.   
Possible reasons leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug:  
 Participant decision  
o The participant or the participant’s designee (for example, legal guardian) reque sts to 
discontinue study drug   
 Investigator Decision  
o The investigator decides that the participant should be discontinued from study  drug 
 Discontinuation due to a hepatic event or liver test abnormality   
Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10903] [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
study drug interruption or discontinuation due to an hepatic event . Participants who 
experience a hepatic event or liver test abnormality should have additional hepatic safety 
data collec ted via CRF  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details ). Resumption of the study drug can 
be considered only in consultation with the Lilly -designated medical monitor and only if 
the liver test results return to baseline and if a self -limited non -drug etiology is identified . 
 
 In addition, participant s will be p ermanently discontinued from the study drug in 
the following circumstances:   
o acute or chronic pancreatitis (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
o if a participant  is diagnosed with thyroid C -cell hyperplasia, MEN -2, or MTC , or 
pancreatic cancer  after randomization  
o if any other TEAE, SAE, or clinically significant laboratory value for which the 
investigator believes that permanent study drug discontinuati on is the appropriate 
measure to be taken  
o if a participant is diagnosed with T1DM  
o if a female participant  becomes pregnant  
o if an investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or participant  is unblinded  
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 67 o if the investigator, after consultation with t he sponsor -designated medical resource, 
determines that a clinically significant systemic hypersensitivity reaction has 
occurred. A clinically significant systemic hypersensitivity reaction is one that occurs 
after administration of the study drug (for exa mple, drug -related symptomatic 
bronchospasm, allergy -related edema/angioedema, or hypotension) and requires 
parenteral medication, does not respond to symptomatic medication, results in clinical 
sequelae, or is an anaphylactic reaction.  
o if the participant undergoes any bariatric surgery during the study  
o if the participant begins treatment with a  GLP -1RA during the study , 
o in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the participant should permanently discontinue the 
study intervention for safety reasons . 
7.2. Participant Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study   
In order to minimize the amount of missing data and to enable assessment of study objectives as  
planned in the study protocol, every attempt will be made to keep participants  in the study,  
irrespective of the following:  
 compliance to study drug 
 adherence to visit schedule  
 missing assessments  
 study  drug discontinuation due to AE (Section  7) 
 development of comorbidities, and  
 development of clinical outcomes . 
The circumstances listed above are not valid reasons for participant discontinuation from 
the study.   
Participant will be discontinued from study in th e following circumstances:   
 enrollment in any other clinical study involving a study  drug or enrollment in any other 
type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with 
this study  
 participation in the study needs to be stopped for medical, safety, regulatory, or other 
reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and GCP , and  
 if the participant becomes pregnant .  
A participant  may discontinue  from the study :  
 at any time at his/her own request  
 at the request of  his/her designee (for example, legal guardian)  
 at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons  
 if enrolled in any other clinical study involving an investigational product, or 
enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or 
medically compatible with this study , or

 68  if the participant, for any reason, requires treatment with a therapeutic agent that 
is prohibited by [CONTACT_10969]. In this case, discontinuation from the study 
occurs prior to introduction of the new agent.  
Study discontinuation is expected to be rare and pa rticipa nts should be provided with options for 
alternative follow -up methods and/or end of study vital status/endpoint ascertainment .   
If the participant is unwilling or unable to return for all scheduled  follow -up visits in person, the 
site will attempt to collect as much follow -up information as possible via telephone or other 
virtual methods of direct patient contact [CONTACT_10970]. Sites are expected to conduct these 
alternative visit methods accordi ng to the visit interval outlined in the Schedule of Activities.  
 An ET visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA . If the participant refuses to have an ET 
visit in the clinic, efforts should be made to collect data via telephone. See the SoA for data to be 
collected at the time of ET visit . If the participant has not already discontinued the study 
intervention, the pa rticipant will be permanently discontinued from the study intervention at the 
time of the decision to discontinue the study.    
If the participant  withdraws consent  for disclos ure of future information, the s ponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data co llected before such a withdrawal of consent . If a participant  
withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested , 
and the investigator must document this in the site study records .  
7.2.1.  Inadvertently Enrolled Participants   
If the sponsor or investigator identif ies a participant who did not meet enrollment criteria and 
was inadvertently enrolled, then the participant should remain in th e study and  be discontinued 
from study drug when continued treatment would not be medically appropriate . If the 
investigator and the sponsor CRP agree it is medically appropriate to continue  the study drug , the 
investigator must obtain documented approval from the sponsor Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to 
allow the inadvertently enrolled participant to continue study  drug. Safety follow -up should be 
performed as outlined in Section 8.2 (Safety Assessments) and Section 8.3 (Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events)  of the protocol.   
7.3. Lost to Follow  up  
A participant  will be considered high risk for lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to 
return for scheduled visits. Site personnel or designee are expected to make diligent attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_10971] a scheduled visit or were oth erwise unable to be 
followed up by [CONTACT_779].  If a participant refuse s all means of completing study visits, contact [CONTACT_10972]’s family or the patient’s primary physician or medical record review during the study

8.1. Efficacy Assessments   
8.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Assessment   
The primary efficacy endpoints are   
 change from baseline to Week 52 in KCCQ -CSS.  
 occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death and/ or HF events over time , and 
Death and heart failure events  will be recorded by [CONTACT_10978] . 
An independent CEC will adjudicate death (CV, non -CV, unknown cause)  and HF  event s. The 
CEC charter will contain the final detailed event definitions for all adjudicated events.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire   
The KCCQ is a 23 -item, participant  self-administered questionnaire that assesses impacts of HF 
“over the past 2 weeks” on the following 7 domains (Green et al. 2000 ; Joseph et  al. 2013):  
 Physical Limitation (6 items)  
 Symptom Stability (1 item)  
 Symptom Frequency (4 items)  
 Symptom Burden (3 items)  
 Self-Efficacy (2 items)  
 Quality of Life (3 items), and  
 Social Limitation (4 items).  
Each of the 23 individual items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths (5 -point, 
6-point, or 7 -point scales). Domain scores are obtained by [CONTACT_10979] 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 [ADDRESS_10501] domain scores:  
 Total Symptom Score: mean of the Symptom Frequency and Symptom Burden scores  
 Clinical Summary Score: mean of the Physical Limitation an d Total Symptom  
scores,  and 
 Overall Summary Score: mean of the Physical Limitation, Total Symptom , Quality of 
Life, and Social Limitation scores.  
The C linical Summary Score  will be used for the primary and key secondary endpoint s.  
KCCQ  collection s are required per the SoA at Visits 8 and 12 for all participants in the study 
regardless study drug status (on or off study drug).  
If Visit 12 is missed or not performed within the SoA window of the Visit 12 KCCQ  
(52 ± 7 days from Visit 2), i t is requested that the KCCQ  be performed within [ADDRESS_10502] be 
conducted at the early termination visit.  
The KCCQ and all other  self-reported questionnaires wi ll be translated into the native language 
of the region, linguistically validated, and administered according to the SoA (Section  1.3). At 
these visit s, the questionnaires should be completed before the participant has discussed their 
medical condition or progress in the study with the investigator and/or site staff.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definition of Heart Failure Events   
The heart failure event definition within the protocol includes worsening symptoms or signs of 
HF, which are meaningful to the pa rticipant  and require intensification of treatme nt characterized 
by [CONTACT_10980]: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10904]; use of intravenous drug, usually an intravenous diuretic, but may include 
intravenous vasodilators or positive inotropic drugs ; or augmentation or increase in oral diuretic 
therapy.  
8.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Assessments   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Six-Minute Walk Test   
Participants will perform an exercise capacity assessment using the 6MWT. Testing of the 
6MWT should be performed as directed in the SoA (Section  1.3). The 6MWT is to be performed 
indoors on a straight, flat, hard surface that is at least [ADDRESS_10503] to familiarize participants with the procedure. Additional 
details can be found in Section 10.10.1 .  
Prior to and at the end of each 6MWT, participants will be asked to rate their breathing  
discomfort and overall fatigue using the Borg Scale, separately, at each timepoint.  
6MWT are required per the SoA at Visits 8 and 12 for all participants in the  study regardless 
study drug status (on or off study drug).

(52 ± 7 days from Visit 2), it is requested that the 6MWT be performed within [ADDRESS_10504] be conducted at the 
early termination visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Body Weight and hsCRP   
Body weight  will be assessed as described in Section 8.2.1 . hsCRP  will be assessed as described 
in Section 8.2.4 . 
8.1.3.  Exploratory Efficacy Assessments   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient  Global Impression of Status    
Three patient global impression items will be assessed  and are described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Patient Global Impression of Status – Overall   
Study participants will be asked to complete a Patient Global Impression of Status – Overall  item 
specifically developed for this study. This is a participant -rated assessment of their overall health 
“in the past 2 weeks” and is ra ted on a 5 -point scale ranging from “1 -Excellent” to “5 -Poor.”  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Patient Global Impression of Status – Physical Function   
Study participants will be asked to complete a Patient Global Impression of Status – Physical 
Function  item specifically developed for this study. This is a participant -rated assessment of 
the overall impact of HF symptoms on their ability to perform physi cal activities “in the past 
2 weeks” and is rated on a 5 -point scale ranging from “1 - Not impacted” to “5 - Extremely 
impacted, cannot perform physical activities.”  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Patient Global Impression of Status – Symptom Severity   
Study participants will be asked to complete a Patient Global Impression of Status – Symptom 
Severity  item specifically developed for this study. This is a participant -rated assessment of the 
overall severity of their  HF symptoms “in the past 2 weeks” and is rated on a 5 -point scale 
ranging from “1 - No symptoms” to “5 - Very severe.”  
[IP_ADDRESS].  EQ-5D-5L  
Generic health -related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ -5D-5L (EuroQoL Research 
Foundation 2019). The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized 5 -item instrument for use as a measure of 
health outcome. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status 
that can be used in  the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as population 
health surveys. The EQ -5D-5L comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The 5L version, introduced in 2005, s cores 
each dimension at 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, 
and unable to perform/extreme problems), for a total of 3125 possible health states. In addition to 
the health profile, a single health state index value ca n be derived based on a formula that 
attaches weights to each of the levels in each dimension. This index value ranges  between less 
than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death; negative values are valued as worse than

 73 dead) to 1 (perfect health).  In addition, the EQ Visual Analog Scale records the respondent’s 
self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 to 100) visual analog scale. In conjunction with 
the health state data, it provides a composite pi[INVESTIGATOR_10905]’s health status.  
The EQ -5D-5L is used worldwide and is available in more than 170 languages. Details on the 
instrument, scoring, organizing, and presenting the data collected can be found in the EQ -5D-5L 
User Guide (EuroQoL Research Foundation 2019).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  NYHA Classification   
The NYHA classification will be assessed and recorded at the time points indicated in the SoA 
(Section  1.3) by [CONTACT_10981], blinded assessor. The NYHA classification is provided in 
Appendix  11 (Section 10.11 ). 
8.2. Safety Assessments   
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA  (Section 1.3). 
8.2.1.  Physical Examinations   
● A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
CV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI and ne urological systems, as well as a thyroid exam ination .  
o Body weight , waist circumference,  and height should be measured. All 
weights for a given participant  should be measured in a consistent manner 
using a calibrated scale (mechanical or digital scales are  acceptable), using the 
same scale whenever possible, and after the participant  has emptied their 
bladder. Participant s should be lightly clothed but not wearing shoes while 
their weight is measured.   
● Symptom -directed physical exam inations  will be conduc ted as described in 
the SoA. 
o Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs and symptoms 
related to HF as well as  related to previous serious illnesses.  Particular interest 
would include  dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema, 
jugular venous distensio n, and rales.  
The physical exam ination  should be performed  before the first 6MWT , if more than one  6MW Ts 
are done .  
8.2.2.  Vital Signs   
For each  participant , vital signs measurements should be conducted according to the SoA 
(Section  1.3). An api[INVESTIGATOR_10906] . The 
vital signs collection associated with the 6MWT should be separate and may be performed using 
automated equipment.  
Any clinically significant findings from vital  signs measurement s that result in a diagnosis and 
that occur after the participant receives the first dose of study drug should be reported to the 
sponsor  or its designee as an AE via the eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 74 8.2.3.  Electrocardiograms   
Single  12-lead ECG s will be obtained locally as outlined in the SoA (see Section  1.3).  
All ECGs should be recorded after the participant  has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_10505] be interpreted by a qualified physician (the investigator or designee) at the site 
as soon after the time of ECG collection as possible, and ideally while the participant  is still 
present, for  immediate participant  management, if needed. The investigator (or qualified 
designee ) is responsible for determining if any change in participant  management is needed, and  
must document his/her  review of the ECG  printed at the time of evaluation . If a cli nically 
relevant abnormality is observed on the participant ’s ECG, then the investigator should assess 
the participant  for symptoms (such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], near syncope, syncope, or chest pain).  The 
investigator must report the presence of AF on the eCRF.  
The original ECG must be retained at the investigative site.  
The investigator or qualified designee’s interpretation will prevail for immediate participant  
management purposes.  
8.2.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments   
With the exception of laboratory test results that may unblind the study, the sponsor  or its 
designee will provide the investigator with the results of laboratory tests analyzed by a central 
vendor, if a central vendo r is used for the clinical trial.  
See Appendix 2 (Section 10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed . The SoA 
describes the timi ng and frequency.  
The investigator must review the laboratory results , document this review, and report any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study as an AE . The laboratory results must be 
retained with source documents unless a Source Documen t Agreement or comparable document 
cites an electronic location that accommodates the expected retention duration. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's 
condition.  
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline  levels or are no 
longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982].  
 If such values do not return to normal/baseline levels within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and t he sponsor notified.  
 All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2  (Section 10.2), 
must be conducted in accordance with the S oA, standard collection requirements , and 
laboratory manual . 
If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at an 
investigator -designated local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] ( for example , SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then  report the information as an AE .

5. Discontinuation of study drug due to a hepatic event  
Note: the interval between the two consecutive blood  tests should be at least 2 days.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Close Hepatic Monitoring   
Close hepatic monitoring should include these actions:  
 Laboratory tests (Appendix 8 [Section 10.8]), including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, D. Bil, 
GGT, CK, and CBC with differential, should be checked within 48 to 72 hours of the 
detection of elevated liver tests to confirm the abnormality and to determine if it is 
increasing or decreasing.  
 If the abnormality persists, clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue at a 
frequency of 2 -3 times weekly until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline 
values.  
 In addition to lab tests, basic evaluation for possible causes of abnormal liver tests should 
be initiated by [CONTACT_10985] -designated medical monitor. 
At a minimum, this evaluation should include physical examination and  a thorough 
medical history, including current symptoms, recent illnesses (for example, heart failure, 
systemic infection, hypotension, or seizures), recent travel, concomitant medications 
(including over -the-counter), herbal and dietary supplements, histo ry of alcohol drinking 
and other substance abuse.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Comprehensive Hepatic Evaluation   
Comprehensive hepatic evaluation should include these actions:  
 At a minimum, comprehensive hep atic evaluation should include physical examination 
and a thorough medical history, as outlined above, as well as tests for PT -INR; tests for 
viral hepatitis A, B, C, and E; tests for autoimmune hepatitis; and an abdominal imaging 
study , for example, ultra sound or CT scan.  
 Based on the participant’s history and initial results, further testing should be considered 
in consultation with the Lilly -designated medical monitor, including tests for hepatitis D 
virus (HDV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein -Barr viru s (EBV), acetaminophen levels, 
acetaminophen protein adducts, urine toxicology screen, Wilson’s disease, blood alcohol 
levels, urinary ethyl glucuronide, and blood phosphatidylethanol.  
 Based on the circumstances and the investigator’s assessment of the pa rticipant’s clinical 
condition, the investigator should consider referring the participant for a hepatologist or 
gastroenterologist consultation, and additional tests including magnetic resonance 
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde chola ngiopancreatography 
(ERCP), cardiac echocardiogram, or a liver biopsy.

 78  Clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue at a frequency of 1 -2 times weekly 
until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline values.  
 All the medical information and test results related to the hepatic monitoring and 
comprehensive hepatic  evaluation should be collected and recorded in a hepatic safety 
case report form (CRF).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Drug Interruption or Discontinuation  due to a Hepatic Event   
Interruption or discontinuation of study drug  should include these actions:  
 While the participant is not receiving the study drug, clinical and laboratory monitoring 
should cont inue at a frequency of 1 to 2 times weekly until liver tests normalize or return 
to approximate baseline values.  
 If the hepatic event continues past the anticipated end of the study (that is, data lock) , the 
investigator should consult with the Lilly -designated medical monitor to determine the 
need for further data collection beyond the end date of the study (that is, data lock date).  
 All the medical information and test results related to the close hepatic monitoring and 
comprehensive hepatic evaluation s hould be collected and recorded in a hepatic safety 
case report form (CRF).  
 Resumption of the study drug after interruption for a hepatic reason can be considered 
only in consultation with the Lilly -designated medical monitor and only if the liver test 
results returned to near baseline and if a self -limited non -study -drug etiology is 
identified. Otherwise, the study drug should be permanently discontinued.  
 
8.3. Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events , and Product Complaints   
The definitions of the following events can be found in Appendix 3  (Section 10.3): 
 Adverse events (AEs)  
 Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
 Product complaints (PCs)  
These events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the partici pant's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet these definitions and remain responsible for following up events that 
are serious, considered  related to the study drug or study procedures, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue the study drug or study  (see Section  7). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting events. Open -ended and non -leading 
verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about event occurrences.  
After the initial report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SA Es will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).

supplemental investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality. Further 
information on follow -up procedures is provided in Appendi x 3 (Section 10.3).  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed  
in the IB and that the investigator identifies  as related to study drug  or procedure. [LOCATION_002] 
21 CFR  312.32, European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, and the associated 
detailed  guidance or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the 
reporting of  S[LOCATION_003]Rs. The sponsor  has procedures that will be followed for the identification, 
recording, and  expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with global regulations and the 
associated  detailed guidance.

drug, the drug delivery system, or study procedure. Potential endpoints that are serious and  
consider ed as possibly related to study drug, the drug delivery system, or study procedure must  
also be reported as an SAE using the SAE eCRF:  
 all-cause mortality  (death ), and 
 HF events.  
In the case where 1 of the above endpoint events is reported but does not mee t a prespecified  
event definition detailed in the CEC charter, as reviewed by [CONTACT_10987], no further

Sites should collect additional details and data regarding AESI, as instructed on the applicable 
eCRFs, and detailed in Section 10.5. 
The details on the definition of AESI will be provided in SAP . 
8.4. Treatment of Overdose   
Considering the mechanism of action of tirzepatide , potential overdose effects can be GI 
disorders and hypoglycemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should 
be initiated according to the participant’s clinical signs and symptoms.  
Study drug overdose (defined as injection of stud y drug more than 1 time within 72 hours) will 
be reported as an AE.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should  
 contact [CONTACT_10990]  
 evaluate the participant to determine, in consultation with the medical monitor, whether 
study intervention should be interrupted or whether the dose should be reduced , and  
 closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities as 
medically appropriate . 
8.5. Pharmacokinetics   
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from all participant s in this study.  
Tirzepatide plasma  concentrations will be determined from blood samples obtained from 
participant s receiving tirzepatide treatment . Blood samples collected from participant s assigned 
to the placebo arm will not be included in the bioanalysis of drug concentrations.  
Blood samples for PK assessment will be collected prior to the dose administration and at the 
same time as the planned i mmunogenicity samples (that is, at Week 0 and then at Week s 4, 12, 
24, and 52 per the Study Schedule or additionally at follow -up and ET  (reference SoA).

exploratory analyses such as metabolism work, protein binding, and/or bioanalytical method 
cross -validation.  
8.6. Pharmac odynamics   
Pharmacodynamic parameters will not be evaluated in this study . 
8.7. Genetics   
A whole blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis where local regulations 
allow.  
See Appendix 2, Clinical Laboratory Tests  (Section 10.2), and Section  1.3 (SoA) for sample 
collection information.  
See Section 10.6 for genetic research, custody, and sample  retention information . 
8.8. Biomarkers   
Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug disposition, target 
engagement, pharmaco dynamics , mechanism of action, variability of participant respo nse 
(including safety), and clinical outcome. Sample collection is incorporated into clinical studies to 
enable examination of these questions through measurement of biomolecules including DNA , 
RNA, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and other cellular elements.  
Serum and plasma for exploratory biomarker research will be collected at the time specified in 
the SoA (Section 1.3) where local regulations allow.  
All samples will be coded with the participant number. These samples and any data generated 
can be linked back to the participant only by [CONTACT_10991].  
Samples will be stored and analysis may be performed on biomarkers  thought to play a role  in 
disease process es, mechanism of action of tirzepatide,  pathways associated with HFpEF , and/or  
research method s validating diagnostic tools or assay(s) related to HFpEF  and associated  
diseases . Biomarker s may be  evaluate d to deter mine  their association with observed clinical 
responses to tirzepatide and the disease state . 
Samples will be retained at a facility selected by [CONTACT_10992]  10.1.10 , or for a shorter period if local regulations and ERBs impose shorter 
time limits. This retention period enables use of new technologies, resp onse to regulatory 
questions, and investigation of variable response that may not be observed until later in the 
development of tirzepatide or after tirzepatide becomes commercially available.

 84 8.9. Immunogenicity Assessments   
At the visits and times specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), venous blood samples will be collected 
to determ ine antibody production against tirzepatide . Antibodies may be further characterized for 
cross -reactive binding to endogenous counterparts (native GIP and GLP -1) and their ability to 
neutralize the activity of tirzepatide and endogenous counterparts.  To interpret the results of 
immunogenicity, a veno us blood sample will be collected at the same time points  to determine 
the plasma concentrations of tirzepatide . All samples for immunogenicity should be taken 
predose when applicable and possible . 
 
Samples will be retained for a maximum of [ADDRESS_10514] participant visit, or for a 
shorter period if local regulations and ERBs allow, at a facility selected by [CONTACT_456]. The 
duration allows the sponsor to respond to future regulatory requests related to tirzepatide. Any 
samples remaining after 15 years will be destroyed.

 85 9. Statistical Considerations   
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses   
Two primary hypotheses will be tested in this study:  
 Tirzepatide MTD is superior to placebo for the change from baseline to Week 52 in 
KCCQ -CSS.  
 Tirzepatide MTD is superior to placebo for the occurrence of the composite endpoint of 
CV death and/or HF events over time .  
Key secondary hypotheses (all under mu ltiplicity control)  are that tirzepatide MTD is superior to 
placebo with regards to  
 change from baseline to Week 52 in 6MWD  
 percent change from baseline to Week 52 in body weight , and  
 change from baseline  to Week [ADDRESS_10515] the key secondary endpoints. If any of the primary endpoints 
is not significant, then the appropriate alpha after the key secondary endpoints testing will be 
recycled to th at primary endpoint.  The detailed  graphical testing scheme will be outlin ed in the 
SAP. 
9.2. Sample Size Determination   
A sample size of 7 00 participants (350 in each treatment g roup) will provide roughly 80% power 
for the change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_10516] 
deviation of 19 in tirzepatide group  at a 2 -sided alpha of 0.01 significance level . The expected  
events at the end of the study will provide roughly  80% power to demonstrate the superiority of 
tirzepatide MTD to placebo in occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV  death and/or HF 
events  at a [ADDRESS_10517] estimate  
assumption of 0. 5. The study power is calculated using nQuery Version 9.1.

 86 9.3. Populations for Analyses   
The following populations are defined:  
Analysis Population  Description  
Entered  All participants who sign the informed consent form  
Randomized/Intent -to-Treat 
(ITT) Population  All participants assigned to treatment, regardless of whether 
they take any doses of study treatment , or if they took the 
correct treatment. Participant s will be analyzed according to the 
treatment group to which they were assigned.  
Safety Population  All participants in ITT population  who take at least 1 dose of 
study treatment . Participants will be analyzed according to the  
treatment group to which they were  assigned . 
9.4. Statistical Analyses   
9.4.1.  General Considerations   
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of  sponsor  or its designee.  
Unless specified otherwise, a ll tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2-sided alpha 
level of 0.05  and all confidence intervals will be given at a 2 -sided 95% level . Efficacy will be 
assessed using ITT Population and s afety will be assessed using the S afety Population.  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the c hange, will be described 
in the SAP and the CSR . Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as 
deemed appropriate.  
The SAP will be completed prior to first unblinding and any subsequent amendments will be 
documented, with final amendment s finalized prior to final database lock . The SAP will include 
a more technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This 
section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints 
including primary and key secondary endpoin ts. 
9.4.2.  Primary Endpoint (s)  
The primary estimand for primary endpoints is to assess the treatment difference between 
tirzepatide  and placebo relative to the efficacy measures for all  randomized participants , and 
treatment policy strategy will be used to handle all intercurrent events , which is, all the observed 
value s for the variable of interest are used regardless of whether the intercurrent event occurs.  
The endpoint and population -level summar y for the estimand is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for each primary endpoint.

 87 [IP_ADDRESS].  Change from Baseline in KCCQ -CSS  
For the primary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 52 in KCCQ -CSS, a stratified 
Wilcoxon (Van Elteren) test will be used as the primary analysis method, controlling for the 
stratification factors of HF decompensation  within 12 months of screening (Y/N), diagnosed 
T2DM (Y/N), and baseline BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (Y/N) . Population -level summary of Hodges -
Lehmann estimate for the median difference and corresponding confidence interval will be 
reported.  
The last measurement prior t o randomization KCCQ -CSS will be used as baseline. Missing 
KCCQ -CSS at Week 52 will be imputed through multiple imputations based on the reason of 
missingness with details described  in the SAP. The statistical inference over multiple 
imputations will be gu ided by [CONTACT_10993] (1987).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Occurrence of CV Death and/ or HF Event over time   
The primary analysis model will includ e fixed factors of  treatment and the stratific ation factors 
of HF decompensation within 12 months of screening (Y/N) , diagnosed T2D (Y/N) , and baseline 
BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (Y/N) . The analysis model with a full list of covariates will be specified in the 
SAP. The censoring date for a participant is the date of participant’s end of follow -up. The 
missing data due to censoring will be implicitly handled by [CONTACT_10994], assuming  censoring  is 
independent of the outcome . The treatment effect estimate , with its 95% CI and p -value, will be 
provided using  the primary analysis model.  
The estimate d cumulative event curve over time  will be provided . Counts and proportions of 
participants who experience a primary endpoint event will be calculated  as well as counts of 
primary endpoint events . The total person -years of follow -up, the incidence rate per 100 person -
years of follow -up, and the absolute risk difference will be provided.  
9.4.3.  Key Secondary Endpoint (s)  
Analyses for the key secondary endpoints will also be guided by [CONTACT_10995].  
Change from baseline in 6MWD at Week  52 will be analyzed using the same  nonparametric 
approach  as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
Percent change from baseline in body weight will be analyzed using an analysis  of covariance 
(ANCOVA) analysis.  The ANCOVA  model will include the categorical effect of treatment, 
stratification factors, and the continuous covariate of baseline body weight value.  Missing  data 
will be imputed through multiple imputations based on the reason of missingness with details 
described  in the SAP .  
Change from baseline in hsCRP  will be analyzed using an ANCOVA  model . The ANCOVA  
model will include the categorical effect of treatment, stratification factors, and the continuous 
covariate of basel ine hsCRP  value. The ANCOVA  model will be based on the log -transformed 
values of  hsCRP . Missing data will be imputed through multiple imputations based on the reason 
of missingness with details described in the SAP.

The analyses for exploratory endpoints will be described in the SAP. Statistical tests will be 
performed at the two -sided significance level of 0.05. There will be no multiplicity adjustment 
for any analysis of exploratory variables  unless specified otherwis e. Missing values will not be 
explicitly imputed unless specified otherwise.  
9.4.5.  Other Safety Analyse s  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_10996], special safety topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], laboratory 
analytes, and vital signs . All safety analyses will be made on the Safety Population. Unless 
specified otherwise, all data obtained during study period from Safety Population, regardless of 
adherence to study drug, will be used for safety analyses. The det ails for safety analysis will be 
described in the SAP.  
Adverse events will be coded from the actual term using MedDRA and reported with preferred 
terms and system organ class.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of Immunogenicity   
The frequency and percentage of participants with preexisting ADA s and with treatment -
emergent ADA s to tirzepatide will be tabulated. Treatment -emergent ADA s are defined as those 
with a titer  2-fold (1 dilution) greater than the minimum required dilution of the ADA assay if no 
ADAs were detected at baseline (treatment -induced ADA), or those with a 4 -fold (2 dilutions) 
increase in titer compared with baseline if ADAs were detected at baseline ( treatment -boosted 
ADA). The details of analyses for immunogenicity will be specified in SAP.  
9.4.6.  Subgroup Analyses   
Subgroup variables to be evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint may include demography  
(for example,  race, eth nicity) , baseline disease characteristics  (for example, diagno sed T2DM)  
and others. Subgroup analyses may also be performed for selected secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Details for the subgroup analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
9.5. Interim Analyses   
Based on the projected enrollment, approximately  [ADDRESS_10518] interim analysis  is planned to occur when approximately 20% of the anticipated number 
of participants are randomized or [ADDRESS_10519] participant  is randomized, whichever 
occurs later, followed by [CONTACT_10997] 6 months throughout 
the study.  
The DMC  is authorized to evaluate unblinded interim analyses. Study sites will receive 
information about interim results only if they need to know for the safety of their participants .

 98 10.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting   
The definitions and procedures detailed in this appendix are in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE].  
Both the investigator and the sponsor will comply with all local medical device report ing 
requirements.  
The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply to all sponsor 
medical devices provided for use in the study. See Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_10524] of sponsor 
medical devices).  
10.3.1.  Definition of AE   
AE Definition  
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrenc e in a participant administered a 
pharmaceutical product and  which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the study  drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disea se (new or exacerbated)  
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in study participants, users, or 
other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. This 
definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or comparator 
and events related to the procedures involved except for events in users or other 
persons, which only include events related to investigational devices.   
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( for ex ample , ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator ( that is , not related 
to progression of underlying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed afte r study drug administration even though they 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either st udy drug 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE 
unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. 
Such an overdose should be reported regardless of sequelae.   
 “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action ” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 99 However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported  as an AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE.   
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.  
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for th e participant’s 
condition.  
 Medical or surgical procedure ( for example , endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition 
that leads to the procedure is the AE.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.   
10.3.2.  Definition of SAE   
If an event is not an AE per the definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met ( for example , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, 
death due to progression of disease).  
SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
 In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10910]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur du ring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10911]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10912] a preexisting condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.  
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 100 d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life f unctions.  
 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma ( for example , sprained ankle) which may interfere with or  
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( for example , spontaneous abortion, fetal death, 
stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
f. Other situations:  
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10913]. These events should usually be considered 
serious . 
 Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers ; intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias , or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.   
g. Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.   
Definition of Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
An SADE is defined as an adverse devi ce effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
An UADE is a serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investi gational plan or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application) or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of the participant.

 [ADDRESS_10525] Complaint  
 A product complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness , 
or performance of a study drug. When the ability to use the study drug safely is 
impacted, the following are also product complaints:  
o Deficiencies in labeling information, and  
o Use errors for device or drug-device combination products due to ergonomic 
design elements of the product.  
 Product complaints related to study drugs used in clinical trials are collected in order to 
ensure the safety of participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and product 
improvements.  
 Investigators will  instruct participants to contact [CONTACT_11010] a product complaint or problem with the study drug so that the situation can be 
assessed.  
 An event may meet the definition of both a product complaint and an AE/SAE. In such 
cases, it should be reported as both a product complaint and as an AE/SAE.  
10.3.4.  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE  and Product Complaints   
AE, SAE , and Product Complaint  Recording  
When an AE/SAE /product complaint  occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to 
review all documentation ( for example , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and 
diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/ SAE /product complaint  information in the 
participant’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s norm al clinical practice. 
AE/SAE information is reported on the appropriate eCRF page and product complaint  
information is reported on the Product Complaint Form . 
Note: An event may meet the definition of both a product complaint and an AE/SAE. In such 
cases, it should be reported as both a product complaint  and as an AE/SAE.  
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to sponsor or designee  in lieu of completion of the eCRF page  for AE/SAE and the 
Product Complaint Form for product complaints . 
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_10915] . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_10916] . 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event b ased on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.   
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 102 Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study and assign it to one of the following categories:   
 Mild:  A type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
 Moderate:  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviate d with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
 Severe: A type of adverse event that interru pts usual activities of daily living, or 
significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a n SAE. Severe is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity o f an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.   
Assessment of Causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study drug and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
 A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather t han a relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the e vent to study drug administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
 The investigator will also consult the IB  in his/her assessment.  
 For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provide d an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred,  and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to sponsor or designee . However, it 
is very important that the investigator always make an ass essment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to sponsor or designee . 
 The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a n SAE follow -up report with the updated causal ity assessment.  
 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.   
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 103 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_11011]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible . 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
10.3.5.  Reporting of SAEs   
SAE Rep orting via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE will be the electronic data collection 
tool. 
 If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.   
 The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available . 
 After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next 
section) or to the  sponsor by [CONTACT_756].  
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  the study training .  
10.3.6.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements   
SAE Regulatory Reporting  
 Prompt notification by [CONTACT_11012] a n SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study drug under clinical investigation are met.  
 The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory auth ority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study drug under clinical investigation. 
The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to 
safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC) , and investigators.  
 An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a n SAE or other 
specific safety information ( for example , summary or listing of SAEs) from the 
sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.   
 As required by [CONTACT_427], the investigator will report to their IRB/IEC any 
UADE (unanticipated problem that resulted in an SAE), or any product complaint that 
could have led to an SAE had precautions not been taken.

 104 10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information   
10.4.1.  Male participant s:  
Men, regardless of their fertility status, with nonpregnant WOCBP partners must agree to eithe r 
remain abstinent (if this is their preferred and usual lifestyle) or use condoms, as well as 1 
additional highly effective ( ˂1% failure rate) method of contraception (such as combination oral 
contraceptives, implanted contraceptives, or intrauterine devi ces) or effective method of 
contraception (such as diaphragms with spermicide or cervical sponges) for the duration of the 
study and until their plasma concentrations are below the level that could result in a relevant 
potential exposure to a possible fetu s, predicted to be [ADDRESS_10526] injection.  
a) Men and their partners may choose to use a double -barrier method of contraception. 
(Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not an effective 
or acceptable method of contraception. Thus, each barrier method must include use of a 
spermicide. It should be noted, however, that the use of male and female condoms as a 
double -barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when 
these barrier methods are combined. ) 
b) Periodic abstinence ( for example , calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  
Men with pregnant partners should use condoms during intercourse for the duration of the study 
and until the end of the estimated , relevant potential exposure in WOCBP ( 4 months ). 
Men shoul d refrain from sperm donation for the duration of the study and until their plasma 
concentrations are below the level that could result in a relevant potential exposure to a possible 
fetus, predicted to be [ADDRESS_10527] dose of study drug, which is 
approximately 4 months .  
Men who are in exclusively same -sex relationships (as their preferred and usual lifestyle) are not 
required to use contraception.  
10.4.2.  Female participant s:  
Women of childbearing potential who are abstinent (if this is complete abstinence, as their 
preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same -sex relationship (as part of their preferred and usual 
lifestyle) must agree to either remain abs tinent or stay in a same -sex relationship without sexual 
relationships with males. Periodic abstinence ( for example , calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
or postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of a trial, and 
withdrawal a re not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Otherwise, WOCBP participating must agree to use [ADDRESS_10528] 1 form is highly effective ( ˂than 1% failure rate), for the entirety of the study. 
Contraception must continue f ollowing completion of study drug administration for the entirety 
of the study and for [ADDRESS_10529] injection .

 105 a) WOCBP participating must test negative for pregnancy prior to initiation of treatment as 
indicated by a negative serum pregnancy te st at the screening visit followed by a negative 
urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to exposure.  
b) Two forms of effective contraception, where at least 1 form is highly effective (such as 
combination oral contraceptives, implanted contraceptives,  or intrauterine devices) will 
be used for the duration of the trial and for [ADDRESS_10530] injection . Effective 
contraception (such as male or female condoms with spermicide, diaphragms with 
spermicide, or cervical sponges) may be used as the sec ond therapy. Barrier protection 
methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a reliable or acceptable method. 
Thus, each barrier method must include use of a spermicide ( that is , condom with 
spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, or female condo m with spermicide). It should be 
noted that the use of male and female condoms as a double -barrier method is not 
considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these methods are combined.  
c) Not be breastfeeding.  
Women not of childbearing potentia l may participate and include those who are:  
a) Infertile due to surgical sterilization, or  
b) Postmenopausal . 
Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear ( for example , amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirmed before first dose of study drug, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female wit h 1 of the following:  
 Documented hysterectomy  
 Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
 Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(for example , mullerian agenesis, androgen  insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Determination can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal fem ale is defined as  follows : 
a. A woman at any age at least [ADDRESS_10531] uterus, not on 
hormone the rapy*, who has had cessation of menses for at least 12 consecutive 
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 106 months without an alternative medical cause, AND with a follicle -stimulating 
hormone >40 mIU/mL; or  
c. A woman [ADDRESS_10532] 55 years of age with a diagnosis of menopause prior to starting 
hormone replacement therapy . 
* Women should not be taking medications during amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives, 
hormones, gonadotropin -releasing hormone,  anti-estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators 
(SERMs), or chemotherapy that could induce transient amenorrhea.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Highly Effective Methods of Contraception:  
 Combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_10917]  
 NuvaRing ® 
 Implantable contraceptives  
 Injectable contraceptives (such as Depo -Provera®)  
 Intrauterine device (such as Mirena® and ParaGard®)  
 Contraceptive patch – ONLY women <198 pounds or 90 kg  
 Total abstinence (if this is their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a  same -sex relationship 
with no sexual relationship with males (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle).  
Note: periodic abstinence (for example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,  postovulation 
methods), declaration of abstinence just for the durat ion of a trial, and withdrawal are not  
acceptable methods of contraception . 
Note : Implantable contraceptives and injectable contraceptives (such as Depo -Provera) are only 
permitted if started prior to screening. Participants should not start these methods of 
contraception after being enrolled in the study.  
 Vasectomy - for men in clinical trials  
Effective Methods of Contraception (must use combination of 2 methods):  
 Male condom with spermicide  
 Female condom with spermicide  
 Diaphragm with spermicide  
 Cervical sponge  
 Cervical cap with spermicide  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Male participants wi th partners who become pregnant  
 The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while t he male participant is in this study.  
 After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
Approved on 14 Feb 2024 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  I8F-MC-GPID (c) 
 107 submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours o f learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. 
Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6  to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female participants who become pregnant  
 The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial information will be 
recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours  of 
learning of a participant's pregnancy.  
 The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate , and the 
information will be forwarded to the sponsor. General ly, follow -up will not be required 
for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of 
pregnancy will be reported , regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) 
or indication for the procedure.  
 While pregnanc y itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  
 A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <2 0 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurrin g 
at >20 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported 
as such.  
 Any poststudy , pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study drug 
by [CONTACT_11013]  8.3.1 . 
While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
 Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study drug and be withdrawn from the study.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypoglycemia   
Upon ICF signing, all participants will be educated about signs and symptoms of hypoglyc emia,  
how to treat hypoglycemia, and how to collect appropriate information for each epi[INVESTIGATOR_10918].   
Hypoglycemia may be identified by [CONTACT_11014]  
(whether confirmed or unconfirmed by [CONTACT_11015] v alues) or by  [CONTACT_11016].   
All participants with T2DM and who develop diabetes during the study will be provided with 
glucometers.  
Participants with T2DM  will be provided a diary to record relevant information (for example, 
glucose values,  symptoms).  
All h ypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_10919] a specific eCRF and should not be otherwise 
recorded as AEs  unless the event meets severe criteria. If a hypoglycemic event meets severe 
criteria (see  definition below), it should be r ecorded as serious on the AE eCRFs, and reported to  
the sponsor  as an SAE.  To avoid duplicate reporting, all consecutive BG values <70 mg/dL 
(<3.9 mmol/L) occurring  within a 1 -hour period may be considered to be a single hypoglycemic 
event  (Weinberg et al. 2010; Danne et al. 2013).  
Investigators should use the following definitions and criteria when diagnosing and categorizing  
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_10920] (the BG values in this section  refer to values 
determined by a l aboratory or International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and  Laboratory 
Medicine blood -equivalent glucose meters and strips) in accordance with the 20 20 American 
Diabetes Association position statement on glycemic targets ( ADA  2020): 
Glucose Alert Value  (Level 1):  
 Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is defined as any time a participant  feels that  he 
or she is experiencing symptoms and/or signs associated with hypoglycemia and  has a 
BG level of <70 mg/dL ( <3.9 mmol/L).  
 Documented asymptomatic hypoglycemia is defined as any event not accompanied  by 
[CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_10921], but with a measured BG <70 mg/dL  (<3.9 mmol/L).  
 Documented unspecified hypoglycemia is defined as any event with no information  about

Nocturnal Hypoglycemia:  
Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a hypoglycemia event (including severe hypoglycemia) that occurs at 
night , presumably during sleep.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pancreatitis   
Acute pancreatitis is defined as an AE of interest in all trials with tirzepatide, inc luding this trial.  
Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas that may also involve  
peripancreatic tissues and/or remote organ systems (Banks and Freeman 2006). The diagnosis of  
acute pancreatitis requires 2 of the following 3 feat ures:  
 abdominal pain, characteristic of acute pancreatitis (generally located in the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_10925]) (Banks and  Freeman 2006; 
Koizumi et al. 2006); the pain is often associated with nausea and  vomiting  
 serum amylase (total and/or pancreatic) and/or lipase ≥3X ULN , and  
 characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on CT scan or  MRI.  
If acute pancreatitis is suspected, appropriate laboratory tests (including levels of pancreatic  
amylase and lipase ) should be obtained via the central laboratory (and locally, if needed).  
Imaging studies, such as abdominal CT scan with or without contrast, MRI, or gallbladder  
ultrasound, should be performed. Abdominal ultrasound may be used as an alternative method  
only if CT and MRI cannot be performed. If laboratory values and/or abdominal imaging  support 
the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, the participant must discontinue therapy with  tirzepatide but 
will continue in the study. A review of the participant’s concomi tant medications  should be 
conducted to assess any potential causal relationship with pancreatitis.  
Each AE of pancreatitis must be reported. If typi[INVESTIGATOR_10926]/or symptoms of pancreatitis are  
present and confirmed by [CONTACT_11018] (lipase or amylase  [total and/or pancreatic]) and  
imaging studies, the event must be reported as an SAE. For a potential case that does not meet  all 
of these criteria, it is up to the investigator to determine the seriousness of the case (AE or  SAE) 
and the relatedness of t he event to study drug(s).

laboratory) as shown on the SoA (Section  1.3) to assess the effects of the  investigational doses of 
tirzepatide on pancreatic enzyme levels. Serial measurements of  pancreatic enzymes have limited 
clinical value for predicting epi[INVESTIGATOR_10927] (Nauck 
et al. 2017; Steinberg et al. 2017a, 2017b). Thus, further  diagnostic follow -up of cases of 
asymptomatic pancreatic hyperenzymemia (lipase and/or  pancreatic amylase ≥3X  ULN) is not 
mandated but may be performed based on the investigator ’s clinical judgment and assessment of 
the participant’s overall clinical condition. Only cases of  pancreatic hyperenzymemia that 
undergo additional diagnostic follow -up and/or are  accompanied by [CONTACT_11019].  
All suspected cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_11020]. In addition, AEs of severe or serious abdominal pain of unknown  
etiology will also be submitted to the adjudication committe e to assess for possible pancreatitis  
or other pancreatic disease. Relevant data from participants with acute or chronic pancreatitis  and 
those with severe or serious abdominal pain will be entered into a specifically designed  eCRF 
page. The adjudication c ommittee representative will enter the results of adjudication in a  
corresponding eCRF page.

Individuals with personal or family history  of MTC and/or MEN -2 will be excluded from the  
study. Participants who are diagnosed with MTC and/or MEN -[ADDRESS_10534].  
The assessment of thyroid safety during the tria l will include reporting of any case of thyroid  
malignancy (including MTC and papi[INVESTIGATOR_10928]) and measurements of calcitonin. This  data 
will be captured in specific eCRFs. The purpose of calcitonin measurements is to assess the  
potential of tirzepatid e to affect thyroid C -cell function, which may indicate development of  
C-cell hyperplasia and neoplasms.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Calcitonin Measurements   
If an increased calcitonin value (see definitions b elow) is observed in a participant who has been  
administered a medication that is known to increase serum calcitonin, then this medication  
should be stopped , and calcitonin levels should be measured after an appropriate washout period.  
For participants who require additional endocrine assessment because of increased calcitonin  
concentration as defined in this section, data from the follow -up assessment will be collected in  
the specific section of the eCRF.  
Calcitonin Measurements in Particip ants with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73  m2 
A significant increase in calcitonin for participants with eGFR ≥60 mL/min is defined below. If  a 
participant’s laboratory results meet these criteria, these clinically significant laboratory results  
should be recorded as an AE.

Calcitonin Measurement in Participants with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  m2 
A signi ficant increase in calcitonin for participants with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  m2 is defined as  
a calcitonin value ≥35 ng/L AND ≥50% over the screening value. If a participant’s labs meet  
these criteria, these clinically significant labs should be recorded as an AE.  
In these participants, study drug should be discontinued (after first confirming the value) , and the  
participant recommended to immediately undergo additional endocrine assessments and  longer -

nonfatal CV AEs to be adjudicated include : 
 myocardial infarction  
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929]  
 coronary interventions (such as coronary artery by[CONTACT_11023]), and  
 cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient  
ischemic attack.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Supraventricular Arrhythmias and Cardiac Conduction Disorders   
Participants who develop any event from these groups of disorders should undergo an  ECG , 
which will be retained at the site as a source document . Additional diagnostic tests to determine 
exact diagnosis should be  performed, as needed. The specific diagnosis will be recorded as an 
AE. Events that meet  criteria for serious conditions as described in Section 10.3.[ADDRESS_10536] be 
reported as SAEs.  If a clinically significant finding is identified by E CG (including, but not 
limited to, AF or changes  from baseline in corrected QT interval), the investigator or qualified 
designee  will determine if any change in study participant management is needed. This review of 
the ECG printed at the time of collectio n must be documented. Any new clinically relevant 
finding  should be reported as an AE.

(Section  10.8). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Events   
Tirzepatide may cause severe GI AEs such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Information  about 
severe GI AEs as well as antiemetic/antidiarrheal use will be collected in the eCRF/AE  form. For 
detailed information concerning the management of GI AEs, please refer to  Section 6.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Acute Renal Events   
Renal safety will be assessed based on repeated renal function assessment as well as  assessment 
of AEs suggestive of acute or worsening of chronic renal failure. Gastrointestinal  AEs have been 
reported with tirzepatide, including nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. This is  consistent with other 
GLP -1 RAs (Aroda and Ratner 2011). The events may lead to  dehydration, which could cause a 
deterioration in renal function, including acute renal failure.  
Participants should be advised to notify investigators in case of severe nausea, frequent vomiting,  
or symptom s of dehydration.

Use/Analysis of DNA  
● Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study drug, susceptibility 
to, severity , and progression of  disease. Variable response to study drug may be 
due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or 
molecular subtype of the disease being treated. The refore, where local regulations 
and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from 
consenting participants.  
● DNA samples will be used for research related to tirzepatide  or HF and related 
diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic tests 
related to  tirzepatide or HF. Genetic research may consist of the analysis of one or 
more candidate genes , the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome , or 
analysis of the entire genome  (as appropriate).  
● DNA sample analy sis may be  performed on pharmacogenetic variants thought to  
play a role in T2DM  or CV disease  to evaluate their association with observed 
clinical outcomes to tirzepatide in this study . In the event the observation of a

investigations may be limited to a focused , candidate -gene study or, if  
appropriate, genome -wide association studies may be performed to identify 
regions o f the genome associated with the variability observed in drug response. 
Samples may be used for  investigations related to the disease , drug, or class of 
drugs under study in the context of this  clinical program ; however , samples  may 
not be used for broad , exploratory , unspecified disease or population  genetic 
analysis . Additional  analyses may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may 
help further understand the clinical data.  
● The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic 
factors involved in the response to tirzepatide  or study drugs of this class to 
understand the study disease or related conditions.  
● The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the CSR or in a separate

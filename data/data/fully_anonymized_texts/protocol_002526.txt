 SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title : 
 
Reach Out: Randomized Clinical Trial of Emergency Department -Initiated Hypertension Behav-
ioral Intervention Connecting Multiple Health Systems  Objectives  
 Through Reach Out, a health system focused, multicomponent, health theory based, mobile health behavioral intervention to reduce blood pressure (BP) among hypertensive patients evalu-ated in a safety net ED. We aim to  determine which behavioral intervention components or 
‘dose’ of the components contribute to a reduction in systolic BP  at one year (Aim 1). We will 
also determine the effect of primary care provider appointment scheduling and transportation on primary care follow up of hypertensive patients treated in an urban, safety net ED (Aim 2). Ulti-mately, b y connecting ED patients to primary care providers, Reach Out can serve as a model for 
safety net hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199438]-ment in underserved communities.  
 Design and Outcomes  
 Reach Out  is a health system focused, multicomponent, multiphase optimization strategy 
(MOST), health theory based, mobile health behavioral intervention to reduce BP  among hyper-
tensive patients evaluated in a safety net ED. This trial will take place in Flint, Michigan, an ur-ban, under-resourced, predominately African American community with which the researchers have long-standing partnerships. Reach Out consists of three components, each with two levels: 1) healthy behavior text messaging (yes vs. no), 2) prompted home BP  self-monitoring (weekly 
vs. daily ), and 3) facilitated primary care provider appointment scheduling and transportation 
(yes vs. no). Participant s will be randomized into one of the eight experimental arms and fol-
lowed for 12 months.   The primary endpoint is the change in systolic BP  from baseline to 12 months. By [CONTACT_199474]-
variable modeling within the context of a 2x2x2 factorial design, we will learn about the relative contributions of each of the three components to BP  reduction. Our overarching objective is to 
demonstrate that an ED initiated, multicomponent, health system intervention can meaningfully reduce BP  in a traditionally underserved population. 
 Interventions and Duration  Reach Out consists of three, bi- level , mobile health components:  
 1) healthy behavior text messaging (yes vs.no) 2) prompted BP  self-monitoring and associated tailored and targeted  text messages ( daily  vs. 
weekly)  
3) facilitated primary care provider appointment scheduling and transportation (yes vs. no).

After demonstrating persistent hypertension and responsiveness to texting, participant s will be 
randomized into this  2x2x2 factorial design and followed for 12 months. 
 Sample Size and Population  We originally planned to enroll approximately 960 patients into the eligibility phase. From this group, we estimate that 480 participant s will report qualifying BPs and will be randomized to 
one of the eight intervention arms. We anticipate 240 participant s will fully complete the 12 
month, in person follow up visits. However, after accruing approximately 400 randomized par-ticipants, we noted lower than expected retention at 6 month visits. Therefore, we adjusted the maximum total number of enrollments and randomizations upwards by 50% each. The overall intention is to achieve approximately 240 protocol completers (attendees at 12-month visit). We will continue to monitor accrual and retention in order to achieve this target.

[ADDRESS_237905] prevalence of hyper-tension of any race/ethnic group in the [LOCATION_002] which largely contributes to their increased burden of stroke compared to non-Hispanic whites. In addition, uncontrolled hypertension is more common among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations than their counterparts.   The Emergency Department (ED) represents a missed opportunity to identify and treat hyperten-sion in difficult–to -reach populations. Currently, there are [ADDRESS_237906] one BP  measured and recorded. African Americans and socioeconomi-
cally disadvantaged patients are disproportionally represented in the ED patient population and both are increasing. In the age of electronic health records (EHR) and mobile health, the ED can 
feasibly become an integral partner in chro nic disease management by [CONTACT_199475] a mobile health behavioral intervention. Facilitating ED follow up at primary care clinics is a key feature of the proposed intervention. Through lev-eraging the strengths of the ED and its large patient volume of uncontrolled, difficult- to-reach, 
hypertensive patients, with the strengths of the primary care clinics’ continuity of care, we aim to 
improve community wide utilization of health services.  
 We propose, Reach Out, a health system focused, multicomponent, health theory based, mobile health behavioral intervention to reduce BP  among hypertensive patients evaluated in a safety 
net ED. This trial will take place in Flint, Michigan, an urban, under-resourced, predominately African American community with which the researchers have long-standing partnerships.

 Reach Out consists of three components, each with two levels: 1) healthy behavior text messag-
ing (daily  vs. none), 2) prompted home BP  self-monitoring (weekly vs. daily ), and 3) facilitated 
primary care provider appointment scheduling and transportation (yes vs. no). Participant s will 
be randomized into one of the eight experimental arms and followed for 12 months.   Our overarching objective is to demonstrate that an ED initiated, multicomponent, health system intervention can meaningfully reduce BP  in a traditionally underserved population. 
2.1.1 Management of hypertension in, and following, the ED 
 
Given variable ED hypertension management and low ED follow up rates, ED visits are missed 
opportunities for the identification and management of hypertension. Each year there are over 130 million ED visits, of which hypertension is identified in about 45% (60 million visits). While ED guidelines recommend BP  screening, the recommendations for management of asympto-
matic hypertension in the ED vary widely from no intervention, referral for primary care follow up, or initiation of antihypertensive to be followed by [CONTACT_199476]. However, adherence with recommended primary care follow up by [CONTACT_199477]; ranging from 26% and 56% depending on the community served. Strategies such as those proposed in Reach Out, which facilitate ED patient follow up with primary care providers via appointment schedul-ing and transportation, are vital given the burden of hypertension and disproportionate ED use in disadvantaged populations, as well as low rates of primary care follow up after  an ED visit.  
 
2.1.2 Mobile health technology offers ubiquity and scalability for hypertension treat-
ment  
Mobile messaging is nearly ubiquitous—ninety-two percent of adult Americans have a mobile phone with over 80% using their devices to send or receive text messages. Overall, African Americans are more likely to  own a mobile phone than non-Hispanic whites. Text messaging, or 
short- message service (SMS), is a widely  used technology that sends messages of up to [ADDRESS_237908], ease of adoption, scalability, and ability to reach people in real -time yet remain flexible and convenient. Text messaging does not require costly smart 
phones or expensive data plans—adding to the practicality and generalizability of Reach Out.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_237909] in Flint, Michigan, an urban, underserved, predominately African American community.  Flint has a population of 102,434, of which 57% are African Americans; 
37% live below the poverty level. About 40% of Flint residents self -report hypertension.  
 Hurley Medical Center is a 540 -bed teaching hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and it is the only Level I Trauma Center 
and safety net hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199439] (Genesee County). The Hurley ED cares for about 110,[ADDRESS_237910], 20% of working age Americans had an ED visit in the last yea r. Afri can Americans have nearly twice the ED visits 
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237911] 2022 
 
13 
 compared to non- Hispanic whites; and individuals with Medicaid have the highest ED visit rate 
of any type of insurance.  
 Hamilton Community Health Network, a FHQC network in Flint, cares for over 30,000 patients, 
about 65% of whom are African American, in multiple clinics throughout the city.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_237912] of medications is also a barrier that will be addressed in Reach Out. For participants who establish care with the FQHC, medications are provided on a sliding fee scale. Additionally, healthy behavior text mes-sages will provide information about pharmacies with $4 generic drug programs in the area.  
2.2 Supporting Data (Preliminary studies)  
 The scientific premise of Reach Out is to test an innovative, mobile health, behavioral, health system intervention  to reduce BP in hard- to-reach high -risk populations. 
 An American Heart Association scientific  statement on the use of mobile health for cardiovascu-
lar disease prevention found only 13 trials of which only three (all performed outside of the US) used primarily text messaging to promote BP control. Two of the three trials showed a reduction in BP but the results were limited by [CONTACT_199478]- 
to-treat analysis. The American Heart Association scientific statement also identified limitations 
in trials  with short duration of follow up, interventions less than [ADDRESS_237913]: 1) developed and tested health theory-based healthy behavior text messages and road map; 2) confirmed the feasibility of prompted BP self-monitoring; 3) created automated, real -time EHR alerts to identify possible eli-
gible ED patients; 4) established  a recruitment strategy and protocol; and 5) conducted behav-
ioral clinical trials.  
2.2.1 Reach Out -
 Flint Churches (HUM00082454)  
Using a community- based participatory research (CBPR) approach, several mobile health compo-
nents were developed including prompted BP self -monitoring, healthy behavior text messages, 
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237914] 2022 
 
14 
 and a text messaging roadmap. We then tested healthy behavior text messages and weekly 
prompted BP self -monitoring in three African American churches for 6 months. All text messages 
were delivered automatically through a text messaging platform developed by [CONTACT_199479], who is also the vendor for this application.53 A total of 48 participant s received the intervention with a mean 
age of 58 (sd=9.8) years, all of whom were African American. Notably, 15% of the participant s 
did not have a primary care provider. Par ticipants responded to BP prompts 587 (47%) of the 
available 1248 person- weeks. All (100%) participant s reported satisfaction with the Reach Out 
intervention. Overwhelmingly, participant s did not want the mobile health intervention supple-
mented with phone calls, workshops, cooking demonstrations or internet modules. 
2.2.2 Reach Out -ED (
 HUM00091668) 
This was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199440] -moni-
toring in the University of Michigan ED. In this study, we created real -time automated alerts using 
the EHR to identify potentially eligible participant s. We also created procedures for recruitment 
of ED patients. Real -time automated EHR alerts identified patients with systolic BP ≥160 or a 
diastolic BP ≥100 (stage II hypertension) who were likely to be discharged from the ED. During the 7 -month enrollment period, over 9,300 patients with elevated BP were identified through the 
alerts. Given that this was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199441], 163 patients were approached and 104 patients enrolled (64%), confirming the feas ibil-
ity of automated real -time ED screening followed by [CONTACT_199480]. 
Of the [ADDRESS_237915] one elevated BP and were activated into the study.

CONTEMPORARY CONTROL GROUP  
To better understand how the intervention will or has affected  Reach Out participants , we will 
retrospectively create a contemporary control group. This control group will encompass HMC 
ED patients who had follow-up visit (outpatient or ED) within 12 months of their ED visit.  Pa-tients will be identified  through review of the HMC EMR, during a similar period to when the 
Reach Out intervention was being conducted (March 2019-August 2020). If not possible to make adequate comparisons during the trial time period, it may be expanded. All data will be outgoing from HMC to the study team. We request a waiver of HIPAA authorization and waiver of con-sent.  We will exclude all patients  that were consented into the study, the contemporary control 
group will be de-identified following participant exclusion. We will collect the minimum amount of personal data possible to accomplish the comparison including similar variables to : 
 
- Stratifying variables (sex, age, antihypertensive use) 
- Demographics (race, ethnicity)  
- Date of ED visit  
- ED complaint 
- ED BPs  
- Date of follow-up 
- BPs at follow -up 
- Time to follow -up

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
As we did successfully through our two pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (HUM00082454/ HUM00091668), we will integrate the two strategies together to now recruit participants from the emergency department of Hurley Medical Center in Flint, MI. We will conduct a randomized, controlled, 2x2x2 facto-rial design clinical trial that will allocate participants to eight different combinations of mobile health components ( Table 2). The proposed trial will identify which mobile health components, 
or ‘dose’ of the components (healthy behavior text messaging, prompted BP self-monitoring and facilitated primary care provider appointments and transportation) contribute to a reduction in BP among hypertensive participants recruited from Hurley Medical Center, an urban, safety net ED (Table 1) . A baseline assessment will occur at enrollment. Outcome assessments will also occur 
at 6 months and 12 months.   We will monitor the efficacy and resources required for the intervention using system level data obtained from the ED, the FQHCs, and clinics.

5.3 Study Enrollment Proce d ures 
5.3.1 Identification of Cases  
As we did through EPIC at the University of Michigan in HUM00091668, we will implement an 
automated screening algorithm used by [CONTACT_199482], to identify pa-tients with blood pressures over a threshold. The threshold for activation is established by a sys-tolic BP (SBP)≥160, or a diastolic BP (DBP)≥[ADDRESS_237918] this screening threshold if the 
proportion of patients with persistent hypertension in follow up texting is towards either extreme (for example, less than 40% or above 80%).  This  threshold activation will alert the study team 
member(s)  a patient  meets the BP eligibility criteria, and should be further screened.   
 Patient BP is obtained during normal patient screening dur ing any ED visit. We will use this alert 
through their EMR to automatically notify the study team members to the presence of potentially eligible patients. If the alert system is not functional at any point, it may be supplemented by [CONTACT_199483]. Auto-mated identification of patients may commence up to [ADDRESS_237919] demographics such as, age, gender, race/ ethnicity, reason for ineligibility or refusal  and ED BP.  
 Research assistants will be based in the Hurley emergency department, and thus familiar and comfortable with their system.  Flyers/ announcements may be made to the emergency depart-
ment staff at events such as, staff meetings, or common area board, to notify them of study pur-pose and recruitment (Appendix C). This document may be visually modified as resources be-come available, but the messaging , and content will remain consistent.

 All adults meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be approached for consent, if a  study team 
member is available . Research staff will then perform in -person screening of these patients based 
on the remaining  enrollment criteria (see inclusion/ exclusion criteria). Cognitive ability will be 
assessed through the question, “Are you able to stay home alone for 24 hours?” Patients will re-
ceive routine clinical care at the local emergency departments , and eligibility will be confirmed 
as previously described . We will use a n informational flyer to help provide information about the 
study (Appendix C, Appendix E ). If possible, the consent process will be performed in a private 
room or sectioned area as to provide the most privacy possible. This process will always be per-formed in person, however we may use electronic pdf forms of the consent document (may build this into Redcap) , and collect electronic signatures through a secure mechanism. A copy of the 
informed consent document with signature [CONTACT_199525]. Following consent, participants will receive a validated, automated, oscillometric BP monitor ( XREXS Au-
tomatic Digital monitor or similar) , and be asked to complete a baseline assessment. We will col-
lect baseline characteristics, including the data needed for targeting and tailoring the text mes-sages. The research staff will teach the participant  how to use the BP cuff and text the readings to 
the study team, including the timing of BP self -monitoring, body position, and resting prior to 
testing  (Appendix A). Participants may also b e given a comic book (Appendix G) to improve un-
derstanding of the study and hypertension, as well as a Reach Out BP Feedback sheet (Appendix F).  Additionally, these documents may be visually modified as resources become available, but 
the wording, and content will remain consistent. Participants  will be given $[ADDRESS_237921] a study newsletter that is available to participants so they remain up-
dated on the study. 
5.3.2 Telephone Recruitment 
As an alternative to in -person recruitment and consent procedures, remote recruitment may also 
be utilized instead of in -person. We may screen ER patients that meet age range and blood pres-
sure inclusion criteria via EMR, and then call to complete eligibility screening. The research staff will follow a phone screening and recruitment script for remote recruitment (Appendix O). We may also mail letters to these patients, letting them know if their potential eligibility (Appendix P). We will attempt to call E R patients once they are discharged home, within the next week, 
given patients often do not have their own telephone in the ER. The research staff will contact [CONTACT_199484]’s ED medical records (same records view ed as during in- person recruitment).  
5.3.3 Telephone Consent Procedures 
If adults are found to be eligible by [CONTACT_199485] , we will proceed to a telephone con-sent process, and will follow a phone consent script (Appendix O), this may be done with what-ever means best possible for participant (telephone, video, etc). The research staff will ask for the last name, and month and year of birth as confirmation that we are speaking to expected patient. Only once confirmed, will the research staff begin the process of consent. The consent process will be performed by [CONTACT_199486] a private environment to provide the most privacy pos-sible The research staff will explain the study to participants during the consenting process. In-terested participants will be enrolled in the study after providing verbal consent (for re mote re-
cruitment). The research staff will discuss questions with the participant, and research would only begin after informed consent is obtained.

For feasibility reasons, within our already approved waiver of hipaa authorizing we add waiver of documentation of informed consent to allow for the study enrollment consenting to be ob-tained in multiple ways (i.e., in -person when feasible, or verbal consent for those completing re-
motely).  
 We will attempt to provide a copy of the consent to potential participant at beginning of obtain-ing consent via email, text message to download, or texted link to website. If requested, we will give the participant a copy of the informed consent document via postal mail.  Following con-sent, participants will be asked to complete a baseline assessment. We will collect baseline char-acteristics, including the data needed for targeting and tailoring the text messages. The research staff will postal mail a validated, automated, oscillometric BP monitor (XREXS Automatic Digi-tal monitor or similar), and will teach the participant how to use the BP cuff and text the readings to the study team, including the timing of BP self-monitoring, body position, and resting prior to testing (Appendix A). This training may be done after participant has receive BP cuff. Partici-pants may also be mailed all training materials noted in the in -person consent process. Partici-
pants will be given $[ADDRESS_237923] a study newsletter that is available to participants so they remain updated on the study. All following enrollment training discussed would then be done over the phone or through video services, and materials (incentive, blood pressure cuff, in-structions sheet(s), swag, etc) would be either emailed, texted, or postal mailed to participant. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_237924] isolated hypertension in the ED, partici-
pants will undergo a 3- week eligibility phase (beginning after informed consent, and participant 
has received blood pressure cuff) to determine if they have persistently elevated BP. All partici-pants enrolled in the study will be given an automated BP  cuff, American Heart Association  or 
American College of Cardiology information about high blood pressure (Appendix B), and  re-
ceive a text message one day  in a week asking to text in their own BP. If a participant has not re-
sponded by [CONTACT_199487] [ADDRESS_237925] up to 2 
times to assure it is not a technical issue. This is based on feedback from our previous studies, where participant’s primary reported reason for unresponsiveness was unaddressed technical complications.   If participants  have 1) persistent  high blood pressure (any self -reported BP (SBP)≥14 0 or a BP 
(DBP)≥ 90), and 2) responded to texts at least once, they will be randomized into the trial. If par-
ticipants do not meet both criteria, they will receive no further communication from the study team following the eligibility phase. These participants may be texted a final text message thank-ing them for participation.

 The overall study period will be approximately 12 
months. After the 3- week eligibility phase, as-
sessing for persistent hypertension and responsive-ness to text messages, participant s who meet all 
eligibility criteria will then be randomized.  
 Participants will be randomized via 2x2x2 block randomization. Participants will be randomized into an experimental arm containing one of the two levels of the three interventions (eight unique com-binations) (Table 2).  
 Importantly, the intervention components may have important associations with participant s’ 
baseline characteristics. We are most interested in three baseline characteristics: age, sex, and antihy-pertensive use. Thus, to ensure scientific rigor, in randomization we will reduce imbalance within our treatment arms by [CONTACT_199488]: 1) age (<64, ≥65); 2) sex, as reported by [CONTACT_3445]; 3) taking an antihypertensive within the last 6 months (yes vs. no).   In the instance of any lost data, including but not limited to proof of consent through signature, participant responses, assessment data, or anything necessary for study procedures and/or IRB protocol, the participant will be contact[CONTACT_199489]. Because this is not an FDA regulated study, we desire to do what is least burdensome for the participant, the IRB, as well as most eq-uitable as to not deprive the participant of the opportunity to have access to the study. If this in-stance arises, and they ch ose, or the study team is not able to contact [CONTACT_109140] a reasonable time, 
we may consider them withdrawn and submit this to the IRB.

STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
6.1 Intervention  and strategy components 
 
As stated, Reach Out tests three intervention components: 1) healthy behavior text messaging (daily vs. none); 2) prompted BP self- monitoring ( daily  vs. weekly); 3) facilitated primary care 
provider scheduling and transportation (yes vs. no). Participant s will be randomized into one of 
eight arms (Table 2 ) for the [ADDRESS_237927] intensity group (weekly prompted self-monitoring and reporting of BP) and will serve as t he effective control group. There is no “untreated” control group given the efficacy 
of prompted blood pressure self-monitoring and feedback from the community following the pre-liminary studies.  In all of these intervention groups, throughout the duration of the study, if a

technology or study assistance.   Additionally, if any requests are sent in by [CONTACT_199490], pause, or stop any of their intervention components , we will give the  participant the option if they may still be contact[CONTACT_199491], if possible. Certain interven-tion components deemed not possible because of coronavirus or institutional guidance, may not be able to be implemented.

 antihypertensive medications, text messages will also address medication adherences (e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_199442], schedules, etc.).  
6.1.[ADDRESS_237930] received a BP self -monitoring device at enrollment in the ED, and 
training for use and text-message response formatting. Participants will be randomized into ei-ther a high intensity or low intensity.  
• The high intensity group will receive message reminders to check and text their BP back 
daily  
• The low intensity group will be asked to check and text it weekly   
By [CONTACT_199492], participants have a record of their BPs that they can bring to their primary care provider appointments. They may also be able to prompt the text messaging system to ac-quire a list of their self -reported blood pressures from the text messaging system. Participants 
will receive a monthly pi[INVESTIGATOR_199443]-reported blood pressures for feedback. Our plat-form will allow the participants to provide preferences regarding the time of day for the BP re-minders, and the ability to adjus t these as needed.  
 The text -messaging system may make up to a total of  [ADDRESS_237931] a BP >180/[ADDRESS_237932] pain, weakness, difficulty talking, or confu-sion to call 911.. Additionally, if a message is sent to the system that doesn’t make sense in the context of a BP reading, an automated error message will be sent back for them to resubmit their BP in the previously taught method.  Participants will have the option to modulate their own reminder frequency by [CONTACT_199493], weekly message reminders, or setting them back to where they were assigned at baseline.

 on their behalf, REACH OUT may provide that to them for their files, or complete the office’s 
specific permission forms (Appendix H).   For participant s without a primary care provider, medical care will be established at a Hamilton 
Community Health Center within about 6 weeks of discharge from the ED. After initial enroll-ment, for all randomized participants, our research team will initially identify up to 3 available appointments that will be texted to the participant  who will reply with his/her selected appoint-
ment.  If a participant does not identify an available appointment time of the 3 selected, a member 
of the research staff may call  to confirm availability and troubleshoot with participant by [INVESTIGATOR_17174]-
sessing barriers .   
 Preceding the appointment, automated text messages may  be sent to the participant to remind  
him/her of the appointment. On, or prior, to the day of the appointment, a transportation credit  
will be issued  to the participant  via a driving service, which is most readily available in that tar-
geted neighborhood (taxi, public transportation, or ride share services are all possibilities). Though rare, a study team member may contact [CONTACT_2299] (phone call or text message) through this process if necessary to clarify or complete appointment scheduling.  These appointment and transportation procedures will occur monthly (on average) until BP  con-
trol is achieved. Following BP control, which is defined by a certain number of instances of self-reported < [ADDRESS_237934] their  primary 
care provider to schedule an appointment. Transportation will not be provided.

OUTCOMES AND  EVALUATIONS   
7.1 Outcome Assessments  
7.1.1 Outcomes  
A baseline assessment will occur at enrollment. Outcome assessments will also occur at 6 
months and 12 months. Outcome assessments will occur at a provider office to coincide with a 
scheduled provider appointment, in the ED research space, or a mutually convenient location (e.g. home, library, or restaurant). The primary endpoint is the change in systolic BP (SBP) from baseline to 12 months. At baseline, BP will be measured by [CONTACT_199494] a validated blood pressure cuff, in accordance with national standards for measurement. BP will also be taken with the participant’s  home blood pressure cuff measurement and compared to the out-
come assessment measurements to assess accuracy of the home device. Participant s will be given 
$25 for completing the 6 month outcome assessment , and $30 for completing the 12 month out-
come assessment . 
 At these 6 and 12 month assessments, text messages and/or phone calls will be sent to all partici-pants to facilitated the outcome assessment scheduling of the  [ADDRESS_237935] readily available in that targeted neighborhood (taxi, public trans-portation, or ride share services are all possibilities) , to be able to assess our primary outcomes of 
BP in person. Outcomes may be built into REDCap. Outcomes may be visually modified, ques-tions removed, rearranged, or re- worded as resources become available, but the messaging, and 
content will remain consistent. Outcomes will be assessing such topi[INVESTIGATOR_199444]/tailoring infor-mation, provider topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], medication, medication adherence, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399], the impact of corona-virus, and Reach out study feedback/ utilization. To increase retention for outcomes, and as al-ready addressed within our enrollment process with participants, we may also be mailing 6/12 outcome reminders (Appendix K), and/or newsletters (Appendix L). Outcome reminders will be updated for either 6 or 12 month outcomes as needed. These materials are included as appendices in the protocol, and will be submitted to the IRB as outlines of materials. However, the dates, time sensitive information, and content may change as needed to better communicate and stay up to date with participants. For example, within the newsletters that may be periodically sent out and updated, it will always contain topi[INVESTIGATOR_199445], 6/[ADDRESS_237936] in -person assess-
ments during COVID-19 precautions. We may resume in-person outcomes once COVID-19 rec-ommendations are lifted.  
 We would ask participants to send a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199446]. Around these 6 and 12 month assessments, text messages and/or phone calls will be sent to participants to facilitated the tele -outcome assessment schedul-
ing. Participants may be mailed a reminder, and instructions sheet of how to complete this as-sessment appropriately, with the least amount of PHI possible (Appendix M and N ). These mate-
rials may be mailed out by a HIPAA  compliant mail service. Participants may also be directed to 
a video through text message link or website which is demonstrating how to take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199447], and sending it in ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCup3LoqlxtMw9sYHQEX7AIA  
available at reachouted.com ). These resources may be visually modified, rearranged, or re-
worded as resources or COVID-[ADDRESS_237937] in these outcomes and promote equity in completion between participants (this may include phone, text, facetime, blue-jeans, text link to youtube tutorial, etc). Participants will also be instructed to text message in [ADDRESS_237938] practices for measu ring 
blood pressure. Reach Out will attempt to complete  the outcome survey via phone, mail, or simi-
lar means. If participants are unable to send pi[INVESTIGATOR_199448], we may use methods such as mailing a disposable camera with returned mai ling for their use, or having them 
ask a friend to text it to us.   Once outcome is completed, we will send a confirmation of completion to participants, and ask them to confirm their current mailing address. Incentives may be mailed or texted (link to equiv-alent value for gift card) out upon receiving these tele-outcomes.

 BP medication adherence will be assessed using several different methods: 1) Hill-Bone and 
one-question modified Hill-Bone question; 2) pharmacy and provider notes; 3) text participants to message pi[INVESTIGATOR_199450] [ADDRESS_237943] of 
the interventions, and a brief survey regarding participant feedback on the specific intervention components they received (will be added in a future amendment).  
7.2.1 Incentives  
In appreciation of participants’ time  all participants  will be given a blood pressure cuff at enroll-
ment (about $20 value), and $20 at the completion of baseline data collection. Participants  will 
be given $25 for completing the 6 month outcome assessment  and $30 for completing the 12 
month outcome assessment.   Participants randomized to receive f acilitated primary care provider appointment scheduling will 
also be provided transportation  for their necessary appointments (about $15- 30/ ride). All partici-
pants will be offered facilitated transportation in order to reach outcome assessment appoint-ments. We will track all incentives allocated to participants through the intervention.    Participants may
 be given a variety of items designed to help promote enthusiasm and obvious contact 
[CONTACT_199495] s such as pens, a project t -shirt, and other assorted 
“stuff” with the Reach Out logo . The additional project stuff is pending available funds. 
 
7.3 Estimation of resources necessary  to implement protocol  
We will track the operational aspects of conducting the intervention. This will include: 1) the 
number of contacts to providers for the research team to schedule the appointments; 2) time re-quired from the research team to  schedule follow up; 3) optimal methods to contact [CONTACT_3445] s 
to schedule follow up. In addition, our research team will actively develop and optimize our manual of procedures and the design of the subsequent follow up study.

MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EXPERIENCES  
Several types of safety issues and serious adverse events may occur in REACH -OUT and partici-
pants will be monitored for these regularly throughout the study. 
8.1 Definition of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event and Scope of AE reporting  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, proba-ble, or definite). Each AE is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical docu-mentation and scientific analysis.   
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237944] 2022 
 
29 
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that is fatal or life threatening, is permanently or sub-
stantially disabling, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in a congenital anomaly, requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, or any event that the treating clinician 
or internal medical monitor judges to be a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or pre-caution. Reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) are based on the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).   We will only track adverse events definitely , probably, or possibly related to the intervention. 
8.2 Unexpected (Unanticipated) Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is defined as an event that is not anticipated or known to occur as an estab-lished risk of either the study intervention or the participant ’s underlying medical condition. Ex-
pected events include, but are not limited to, those specifically identified and described or listed in the study protocol and/or informed consent document. 
8.3 Severity of an Adverse Event  
‘Severity’ is not the same as ‘serious.’ Serious is based on patient/event outcome or action crite-
ria usually  associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or health. The term ‘severe’ 
is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, severe myocardial infarction); the  event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache). Seriousness  (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. Most AEs include clinical criteria  that describe patient/event outcomes or 
indicated interventions to more clearly substantiate seriousness.  
8.4 Classification of an Adverse Event 
All serious adverse events occurring during study participation will be documented on the AE 
case report form. Adverse events will be documented using the NCI Common Terminology Cri-teria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (CTCAE). The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology that will be used for recording and reporting adverse events that occur. The CTCAE provides a grading (severity) scale for each AE term and AEs are listed alphabetically within categories based on anatomy or pathophysiology. The CTCAE (v 3.0) displays Grades 1-5 with unique clin-ical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guidance: 
•          Grade 1:        Mild AE  
•          Grade 2:        Moderate AE

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Data analysis 
The primary analysis (aim 1) will fit a linear regression model with the outcome of SBP change 
(baseline minus 12 months) and main effect-coded binary predictors of healthy behavior texts (yes vs. no), prompted BP self-monitoring frequency (high vs. low), and primary care provider visit scheduling and transportation (active vs. passive). Initial analyses will focus on the main ef-fects. Additional analyses will include all the two -way interactions of the three intervention com-
ponents (only considering interactions where at least one of the factors in the interaction demon-strates a sufficiently large main effect). As the goal of this exploratory trial is to find interven-tions and combinations with activity, we will use an alpha level  of 0.[ADDRESS_237948] (i.e. the combination of facili-tated transportation and high frequency home BP monitoring), we plan to implement the combi-nation of elements that has the highest expected reduction in SBP – assuming we achieve signifi-cance at the p=0.1 (main effects) or 0.2 (interaction) level for the  components. In the event of an 
overall “null” trial, we would examine the expected change in SBP for arm 1, which would be represented by [CONTACT_199496]. If this was significantly greater than 0 at the p=0.1 level we would propose a very simple subsequent multi-center trial using only weekly prompted BP self- moni-toring.  The main secondary analyses (aim 2) will use time -to event (Cox Proportional Hazards) and lo-
gistic regression. For the endpoint of interest, (either time to first primary care visit, or the binary variable indicating attendance at two or more primary care visits within 1 year of randomiza-tion), we will fit an adjusted regression  model. The main predictor of interest for these models is 
assignment to the active primary care provider scheduling and transportation arm (50% of all 
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237949] 2022 
 
32 
 participant s randomized in the trial), while adjusting for the assignment into other groups similar 
to aim 1 (healthy behavior text messages and prompted BP self-monitoring).  
 We will conduct additional exploratory analyses using the stratification factors (age, sex, and an-tihypertensive use) as covariates. As uncertainty exists on the distribution of enrolled participant s 
within these strata (e.g.  young men taking antihypertensive medication), we cannot estimate the 
preliminary statistical power for these exploratory  aims. Thus, we will estimate the power based 
on the strata sizes prior to conducting the exploratory analyses. Interaction terms (e.g. age with behavioral interventions, sex with behavioral interventions, etc.) will be utilized to determine if specific groups respond well to specific intervention elements. Baseline BP may also play an im-portant role. We will examine its impact by [CONTACT_199497]. We will repeat the above prim ary and exploratory modeling within each of the three initial BP strata to determine if 
there is heterogeneity  of effect (e.g. do patients with the highest baseline BPs get the most bene-
fit from the intervention components?). We will similarly assess the impact of the intervention components on the exploratory and process outcomes using linear, Poisson, logistic, or ordinal regression depending on the distributions. In addition, we will conduct longitudinal analyses that include all BP measurements over tim e (including those by [CONTACT_199498] -person visits) to as-
sess the temporal profiles of response in the intervention components. 
9.2 Endpoint s
  
• Average change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months 
• Time from ED visit to arrival at first primary care visit (in days)  
• Attendance at two or more primary care visits within [ADDRESS_237950] the maximum total number of enroll-ments and randomizations upwards by 50% each. The overall intention is to achieve approxi-mately 240 protocol completers (attendees at 12- month visit). We will continue to monitor ac-
crual and retention in order to achieve this target.  
 In the work by [CONTACT_199499], methods for sample size estimations for factorial design, MOST based interventions, have previously been reported. It is important to note, that the pri-mary hypotheses driven by [CONTACT_199500]-
ventions, but instead is the overall estimate of the effects of each of the individual intervention components, and their combinations. This smallest standardized effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_237951] deviation of 2.8 mm Hg for each parameter. We be-lieve this is the minimal clinically significant change for each component; and to achieve im-provements of 3-[ADDRESS_237952] 2022 
 
33 
 would need a component or combination of components to perform better than an expected 1 
mm Hg change. For 80% power to detect the smallest main expected effect of 0.35 based on the Collins method of a 3-factor experiment analyzed using a second order mode l (i.e. main effects 
and 2-way interactions), we require 196 participants. Assuming 480 randomized participant s, and 
allowing an additional 50% loss to follow up after the eligibility phase, we expect at least 240 participant s, exceeding 80% power with an alpha level of 0.10 (inflated to reduce likelihood of 
dismissing active components with modest BP reducing effect) – we used the FactorialPower-Plan SAS macro to calculate power. For the secondary analyses, considering an alpha of 0.05 and a baseline proportion attending 2 or more primary care provider visits within one year of 40%, with a total sample size of [ADDRESS_237953] 87% power to detect an increase to 60% attending 2 or more visits. The time to event analysis (considering an alpha of 0.05, power of 99%, and 240 participant s enrolled over 720 days, followed for 30 days) can detect a change from 20% of par-
ticipants in the non-facilitated group to 20.4% of participant s in the facilitated group. This high 
power allows ample room to adjust for covariates and loss to follow up. Sample size calculations for secondary outcomes performed with STPLAN (version 4.5). 
 
The challenges of recruiting racial minorities and people with socioeconomic disadvantage for clinical research studies are well documented. Reach Out participant  recruitment will be facili-
tated by [CONTACT_71411]: 1) the study is no more than minimal risk; 2) culturally and community sensitive recruitment materials were created using a CBPR approach; 3) enrollment in an urban, safety net ED; and 4) monetary incent ives.  
 
9.4 Data Monitoring 
 
The trial does not employ formal efficacy or futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. An independent medical  monitor (IMM) will be appointed with responsibility to monitor data and oversee participant  safety. IMM  will be approved by [CONTACT_199501]. The Reach  
Out IMM will be an expert in the care of hypertension and may either be an emergency medicine  
physician or a primary care physician. The frequency of IMM meetings will be determined by [CONTACT_145858], IC, and PI. Given the planned period  of data collection we anticipate about 8-[ADDRESS_237954] into the participant ’s research chart. Iden-
tifying information will be collected for each individual in the study (phone numbers, name, age, 
address and additional contact [CONTACT_3031]). This will be used to coordinate the outcome assess-

10.2 Role of Data Management 
A sub set of study participant  data outcomes  will undergo additional review to assess data quality. 
A second assessor , will review a random subset. Range checks and content validation will be uti-
lized in the database to ensure high quality data entry.  10.3 Quality Assurance 
When applicable, source documents will be uploaded for remote verification. Based on the re-
sults of the additional review, retraining of the abstractors will occur if issues with accuracy arise.  
11 
HUMAN PARTICIPANT S 
In general, the research team will adhere to the following principles:  
• We will protect and safeguard HIPAA defined Protected Health Information.  
• We will respect the confidentiality of the medical providers and health care facilities.  
• There will not be public disclosure of identifiable medical provider performance. 
• There will not be disclosure or publication of identifiable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199452]. 
• Identities (patient, provider, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be coded in research databases with the linkage file being removed after data analysis.  
11.[ADDRESS_237956] also obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of 
Health. The Certificate can be used to legally refuse to disclose information that may identify a participant.  
11.1.2 Vulnerable populations: pregnant women, prisoners, and children  
We are not enrolling vulnerable populations (pregnant women, children, and prisoners). Hyper-tension is a different disease in pregnancy and in childhood. Prisoners will not generally have ac-cess to text messaging, a BP monitoring cuff, or appointments with outside primary care physi-cians and thus they would not be able to participate or benefit from the study interventions.  All patients of childbearing age will be screened for pregnancy at the time of enrollment. For those who may be pregnant, a pregnancy test may be performed in the Emergency Department (ED) as part of their routine medical care. We are performing research p rocedures and screening 
patients in the ED who are visiting for a variety of medical problems and cannot mandate that the clinical care teams perform pregnancy tests. However, in the screening and enrollment process, our research staff will ask potential participant s if they could be pregnant. If pregnancy testing 
has not been done by [CONTACT_6098], the research team will inform the clinical team that the patient may be pregnant. The research team will not enroll this patient unless there is a negative pregnancy test. The study would not be dangerous for a pregnant woman; however, the results would not be scientifically relevant.  
 Once enrolled, participant s of childbearing age will be instructed to notify the research team if 
they become pregnant. Additionally, we will ask participant s whether they might be pregnant 
during the research visits. If the research team learns the participant  is pregnant at the research 
visits or is notified at other times during the intervention, the intervention elements would be dis-continued, and we will work with their usual medical care provider to help them establish pre-natal care. This will be don e because hypertension management differs in pregnancy. In general, 
by [CONTACT_153717], we will keep pregnant women in our cohort to monitor and collect outcomes; we will not use the active intervention components.  Enrolled patients may become prisoners while in our study. The study team will not actively screen for this, however if we learn this during the course of participation we will place study procedures on hold while the patient is a prisoner. We may  resume their participation after the 
period of incarceration, assuming the one-year follow up period has not been expended. We will not extend the follow up window in these cases.   While not a traditionally defined vulnerable population, the people of the city of Flint have faced unique challenges recently given the water crisis. The University of Michigan Department of Emergency Medicine has a long -standing relationship with Hurley Medical Center and the city 
of Flint. Our faculty group has staffed the emergency department there for almost [ADDRESS_237957]. Cunningham’s infrastructure at Hurley Medical Center and

  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237958] Risk  
11.2.1 Physical risks  
The BP cuffs could cause skin irritation or bruising – this is unlikely given the FDA approved devices used and will most likely be of low seriousness. In addition, it is possible that the partici-pants will experience a medical emergency and elect to text the research number instead of seek-
ing care. All text messages sent into the Reach Out system will receive a standard message simi-lar to, “Remember: this is an automated messaging system, and texts other than your BP are not read. If you have questions, as k your [CONTACT_199531] this is an emergency call 911.”  
 If BP received is outside of parameters, participants will receive something akin to the following message, “You sent a BP that is very high or low. If this is right, please contact a Dr. very soon to check your BP. If you sent it by [CONTACT_21317], please text us a new BP. ” 
11.2.[ADDRESS_237959] unlimited text messaging plans. We do not use any sort of app or da ta (which is more likely to incur costs for participants). Addi-
tionally, we believe it will be unlikely that anyone will have limited minute mobile voice plans, and thus it will be unlikely that our study protocol will induce overage fees for participant s. Ad-
ditional financial risks would include identity theft due to the loss of sensitive information by [CONTACT_3476]; we are minimizing the personal data that we collect to what is necessary for our re-search strategy so this should be unlikely. 
11.2.4 Legal risks  
We are not collecting location -based data relating to text messages and we do not anticipate that 
our research protocol will induce any additional legal risks for participants. Alternative proce-dures that may confer less risk: we are conducting a prospective, clinical trial of several low risk  
interventions to improve BP. Alternatives to our research strategy would generally be for the par-ticipants to self -monitor their BP and follow up with their doctors outside of our protocol. This 
will be included as an  alternative to participation during the informed consent process.

  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237960] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
 
This protocol and the consent and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_109753].   
11.4 Participant  Confidentiality  / Data Retention 
 
All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet  or on secure computer systems .  Clinical infor-
mation will not be released without written permission of the participant , except as necessary for 
monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, or the NIMDH. In accordance with NIH regulations, we may  cre-
ate a permanent de -identified, public use database. We will remove linkages to protected health 
information, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_199453]. The purpose of the retention of this data 
is for future research and to comply the NIH regulations for datasets created during the conduct of NIH funded research grants.   
 
11.5 Study Modification/Discontinuation  
 The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIMDH , or other gov-
ernment agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.

  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237981] study within a trial (SWAT). [CONTACT_199534]  is the lead investigator. This SWAT has been registered as “SWAT 
82: Sending Christmas cards to trial participants to improve retention – studies within tri-
als (SWATs)” and has the Prometheus reference MR/R013748/1/SWAT 82  and was ap-
proved by [CONTACT_199505] e & The Humber – Leeds West Research Committee under pro-
ject ID [ZIP_CODE].    
 Within the main protocol of REACH -OUT, sending retention materials is allowable. We 
propose to use this SWAT methodology to send holiday cards (Appendix J) to a random sample of participants currently active on the REACH -OUT protocol.    
 No data with protected health information or personal identifiers will be transferred out-side of the REACH -OUT. Aggregate response rates per arm of the SWAT will be shared 
to the organizers of the SWAT in York.   
 Design   
 Inclusion:   
 The launch date is pending approval of this amendment, but we anticipate sending the cards in Winter 2020. All subjects currently active on the REACH -OUT protocol are eli-
gible.   
 Exclusion:   Participants who have withdrawn from follow up visits.    
 Intervention:   
 We will create a randomization list of the current REACH -OUT participants, stratified by 
[CONTACT_199506] (groups 1- [ADDRESS_237982] 1:[ADDRESS_237983]).  In addition, within each of the [ADDRESS_237984] by [CONTACT_25890] (<65 versus 
>65).  Cards will be mailed.    
 Analysis – From SWAT:   
 The primary endpoint is retention – defined attendance at the next follow up visit. The 
secondary endpoints are cost per participant retained and response rate.   
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237985] or 2nd visit next, and those 
who did not return the previous 4- week survey.    
 We will report proportions and differences in proportions with 95% confidence intervals for the primary endpoint and repeat this for all subgroups, including gender and age.   
  Analysis – Additional  Specific to  REACH- OUT   
 We will estimate additional subgroups using the defined stratification variables of REACH- OUT   
 The REACH- OUT specific primary endpoint is text -messaging engagement. This is a 
count variable, which for the [ADDRESS_237986] delivery is de-fined as the number of blood pressures reported by [CONTACT_199507]-sures that were requested.  Participants near the beginning (less than 4 weeks in) or end 
(less than 4 weeks from final visit) of REACH- OUT will be excluded from this analysis.    
The main analysis of this will be using repeated measures binary logistic regression with a random effect. Each participant will have a line of data for each eligible blood pressure request. We will include an indicator variable for  REACH- OUT assigned frequency of 
texts (weekly versus every other day) and SWAT group assignment (will be one in par-ticipants who were sent a card, for the eligible BPs that occurred after estimated receipt of card, and will be zero in all participants not randomized to card, and will be zero for 
all pre -delivery texts in the group randomized to card.) A random intercept for individual 
will be included. In addition, we will add a variable to account for the number of weeks before or after the estimated delivery of the card.  Depend ing on model fit and number of 
observed outcome events, we will add in adjustment for the other two main REACH -
OUT interventions (healthy behavior texts versus none, PCP facilitated transportation versus none), along with the gender, age, and pre- existing hypertension medications 
baseline stratification variables from the main REACH -OUT study.

Hello, my name [CONTACT_832] __________ from the University of Michigan and Hurley Medical Center. Am I speaking to ____________?   I’d like to tell you about a research study that uses text messaging to help you lower your blood pressure (BP), and then ask you a few questions to see if you are interested and eligible to partic-ipate in the study.   Taking part in this study is completely voluntary.  You do not have to take part if you don't want to.  Your medical treatment will not be affected in any way if you choose not to take part. You may also leave the study at any time.  If you leave the study before it is over, you will not lose any benefits to which you are owed.  
 
(Purpose of the study) We are asking you to be in this study because you were a patient in the 
ER of Hurley Medical Center recently, and while you were there, had elevated BP. Many people have high blood pressure. We are doing this study because we want to know if sending text mes-sages and reminding people to check their blood pressure can help people to lower their blood pressure. People who volunteer to be in this research study will be asked to complete some sur-veys about yourself, and you’ll be asked to take your own blood pressure throughout the study while receiving t ext messages.  
 Would you be interested in hearing more about our study and how you can help? [If yes, con-tinue with script. If no, thank the patient and code him/her as a screen refusal]  
Great!  
 I have a few simple questions to ask to first.   Can you confirm your last name? And the month and year you were born?  Thank you!  [If PT gives information that matches the medical record, continue with script. If the information does not match/ the person on the phone is NOT the patient, ask the person on the phone if they know the patient, and a better time or way to contact [CONTACT_476]]

ormed Consent Phone Script:  
(Information about Study Procedures) If you agree to participant in the study, you will start by 
[CONTACT_12550] a survey telling the research team about yourself.  
Once in the study, you will also be given materials about BP. A BP monitor will be given to you 
to use to take your BP at home. You will be taught how to take your own BP using the monitor given, and how to text these results back to the study team On a weekly basis for [ADDRESS_237989] high BP, the REACH OUT Program will start. There are three differ-
ent types of text messages you could receive while participating in the REACH OUT program 1) healthy behavior texts; 2) reminder texts to take your BP at home ; 3) texts to help with primary 
care provider appointment scheduling and transportation. 
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237990] the amount of time you will participate in the  study will be about 12 months.  
(Risks and Potential Benefits of the Study) There can be risks associated with joining any re-search study. For this study, some of these risks may include asking you about your current rec-orded BP. The messages are meant to be motivational, but there is a small chance you may be distressed by [CONTACT_476]. You do not need to answer any question that you don’t want to, and you can stop the text messages at any time. There is a small chance that participants in this study could have information about their health status, such as information about their BP levels, or general health activities, given to people they don’t want to know.  You also need to understand that all information received from you will be confidential and will be kept under lock and key or secure, password protected documents and computers. Your name 
[CONTACT_199526]. Your name [CONTACT_199527].  
As with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected. This study may not offer any benefit to you , but may benefit others in the future by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_199459]. (Financial Information) You will be given an automated BP cuff and $20 at your enrollment. You will be given $25 after completion of your 6-month follow-up visit, and $30 after comple-tion of your 12-month follow-up visit. REACH OUT will provide transportation, if needed, to the 6 month and 12 month visits. Some participants may also be provided transportation to their primary doctor for REACH OUT appointments. Participants asked to participate in the focus groups may receive food and up to $[ADDRESS_237991]. 
(Confidentiality )
 You may be worried about the confidentiality of your information . We won’t share 
answers with anyone except the researchers of this study.  The risks to participating are minimal, but 
there is  risk associated with transmitting data, including loss of confidentiality.  
 
Taking part in this study will involve collecting private information about you. If there are physi-cal copi[INVESTIGATOR_199460], it will be stored in a locked area, accessible only to research staff, and will not be made part of your medical record. Your research information will be en-
tered 
into a password protected computer and your name [CONTACT_199528]. We will not 
share data that identifies you with anyone outside of the study. The study uses a SSL encrypted web -
based application with secure log -ins to access. There is a very small risk that someone could obtain 
your contact [CONTACT_199508].

 Appendix Q- Supplement: Reach Out Cognition  
  
Introduction and Background  
 
We propose Reach Out Cognition which will extend Reach Out data collection past the current 
12 months to 15 and 18 months. During Reach Out Cognition, we aim to assess novel ap-proaches to mobile health (mHealth) self -administered cognition and blood pressure (BP) meas-
urements. These approaches may include cognitive assessments via mobile applications (apps) and Web -based surveys, and wireless BP measurements via Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure 
cuffs and apps. The launch date is pending approval of a supple ment and /or amendment and par-
ticipant completion of the parent study 12- month outcome assessment (we anticipate July 2020).   
 
Design   
 Recruitment:  
 
The study population for Reach Out Cognition will be drawn from Reach Out participants who com-plete the Reach Out intervention and are defined as: participants who complete the 12-month out-come assessment. We anticipate about [ADDRESS_237995] completed Reach Out’s 12 -month 
outcome assessment and will be eligible for Reach Out Cognition. At the time of the final (12 -
month) outcome assessment, par-ticipants will be introduced to the opportunity of continuing for an-other ~6 months with the added mHealth measures.  
 
Inclusion:  
 
Participants of the  Reach Out protocol that are no more than [ADDRESS_237996] smartphones. However, our goal 
is inclusivity and generalizability and will allow for inclusion of all cell phones with the capability to send pi[INVESTIGATOR_199461] -messages. Thus we designed Reach Out Cognition wit h the capability to include these partici-
pants, albeit outcome assessments procedures will differ.   
 
Exclusion:  
 Participants who have withdrawn or not completed follow up visits.   
 

  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237997] 2022 
 
68 
 Screening:  
 
Prior to consent, participants may be screened for baseline cognition via the mini-Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA)  or similar. This would be preceded by [CONTACT_199512] (Appendix 
V). Participants may either be given a feedback sheet in person, via postal mail, or text message 
to link regarding their MoCA score if fully completed (Appendix S). If score <11, or similar test 
specific cognitive threshold, we will state  the MoCA suggested response to this range, and par-
ticipant will not be consented for the study. It will be suggested that participant may wish to 
share the MOCA score with their doctor to discuss memory and thinking.  Participant’s doctor will be able to answer questions and decide whether more testing or treatments are right. These tests are not diagnostic.  
 
Consent:  
 
If 12 -month outcome is in-person, and the participant agrees to continued participation, an in-
formed consent will be signed (may be electronic and built into redcap as previous informed con-
sent) by [CONTACT_199513].  
 
However, in the time of COVID-19, the consent process and subsequent surveys may also be 
done virtually, if performing a 12-month outcome via tele-outcome per Reach Out protocol. In 
this circumstance, we would perform remote recruitment and consent. The research staff will fol-
low a phone consent script (Appendix R), this may be done with whatever means best possible 
for participant (telephone, video, etc). The research staff will ask for the last name, and month 
and year of birth as confirmation that we are speaking to expected patient. Only once confirmed, 
will the research staff begin the process of consent. The consent process will be performed by [CONTACT_199514] a private environment to provide the most privacy possible. The research staff 
will explain the study to participants during the consenting process. Interested participants will 
be enrolled in the study after providing verbal consent (for remote recruitment). The research 
staff will discuss questions with the participant, and research would only begin after informed 
consent is obtained. 
  
For participants who are within [ADDRESS_237998] them to 
perform remote recruitment and consent.   
For feasibility reasons, within our already approved waiver of hipaa authorization, we add 
waiver of documentation of informed consent to allow for the study enrollment consenting to be 
obtained in multiple ways (i.e., in -person when feasible, or verbal consent for those completing 
remotely).  
  
We will give the participant a copy of the informed consent document. Given this is a study of 
no more than minimal risk of harm, and seeking in-person written consent may prove more 
harmful to participants, we will also seek a waiver of documentation of consent in the case tele-
outcomes are being done. In this circumstance, we would read an informed consent script over 
the phone, discuss questions with the participant, and research would only begin after participant 
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_237999] 2022 
 
69 
 verbally consents. All following enrollment training discussed would then be done over the 
phone or through video services, and materials would be either emailed, texted, or postal mailed 
to participant.  
  
Enrollment:  
 
After enrollment participants may complete a brief survey assessing their eHealth literacy via the 
eHealth Literacy Scale or similar and baseline cognition via the Self -Administered Gerocogni-
tive Exam (SAGE) . Participants will either be given a feedback sheet in person, via postal mail, 
or text message to link regarding score , which may only be sent out if the survey is fully com-
plete, or it is determined than an appropriate score can be calculated based on missing values  
(Appendix S). If score <17, we will state the SAGE suggested response to this range. It will be suggested that participant may wish to share the SAGE score with their doctor to discuss memory and thinking.  Participant’s doctor will be able to answer questions and decide whether more testing or treatments are right. These tests are not diagnostic.   Par
ticipants will receive a BP arm cuff and incentives for completing the outcome assessments. 
They may also receive materials helpful in technology assistance and instructions. These may be mailed or emailed to participants if performing tele-outcomes.  
 
At enrollment, participants will undergo about a 60-minute technology introduction tailored to if they have a smart phone or a feature phone. Reach Out Cognition assessments will differ based on whether the participant has a feature phone or smartphone (Table 1). If participant phone ca-pabilities change throughout the duration of the study, we will work with them to re-train on their new phone.   
• Feature phones include capabilities such as built- in cameras.  
• Smartphones, in comparison, have touch-input and advanced computing software, in 
addition to built- in cameras, apps, and Web -browsers.  
 
Participants will re-
ceive a Bluetooth -
compatible BP moni-tor, the Omron Evolv Wireless Upper Arm Home BP Monitor or similar model which 
may depend on phone 
capability .   
 We will review procedures and trainings for all groups and phone capabilities.  Those with smartphones may download the necessary app associated with the Bluetooth- compatible BP 
monitor. This will allow participants’ blood pressures to directly sync the BP cuff to the app. Table 1: Overview of Reach Out Cognition and BP Assessments

ne survey link for survey questions. This link can be used directly, or typed into a web -
browser. The participant and the study coordinator may complete a mock round of cognitive and 
BP measures in the practice environment to identify and solve any technological issues. If enroll-
ment is not able to be done in-person, training would then be done over the phone or through 
video services, and materials would be e ither emailed, texted, or postal mailed to participants. 
We will have participants download the app (if able) while we are communicating with them, so 
we may train them in set-up and use of both app, text messages. We will postal mail the blood 
pressure monitor to participants, and then may also have another virtual training with participant 
in blood pressure monitor use.   
We will also have resources and trainings available on the Reach Out website (reachouted.com ) 
accessible to participants  (for example, Appendix T and Appendix U).  
 
Intervention   
 
Participants who agree to continue in Reach Out Cognition will continue to receive the Reach 
Out intervention at a moderate intensity; this may include daily healthy behavior text messages and weekly prompted blood pressure self-monitoring. We elected to f orego facilitating the pri-
mary care appointment scheduling and transportation as that was not automated and thus requires substantial study team resources and is not consistent with Reach Out Cognition’s solely mHealth intervention.    Reach Out Cognition, will extend data collection to include 15 and 18 month assessments +/- [ADDRESS_238001] for outcomes. These assessments may include mHealth cognition and blood pressure assessments (Figure 1). Cognitive measures may be assessed using two different vali-
dated measures (or similar methods): 1) SAGE ; and 2) Neuro- QoL-Cognition (Quality of Life in 
Neurological Disorders) . Self -reported blood pressure outcomes will be based on either pi[INVESTIGATOR_199463] a Bluetooth- enabled BP cuff.  
 
 
Outcomes  (smartphone and feature phones)  
 
At around 15 and 18 months, participants will receive reminder text message(s) and/or email(s) 
to complete a survey link and/or variations of computer adaptive assessment , or paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_199464], to either be mailed back or take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199465]/ email to return . In either scenario, the 
survey information does not contain sensitive information, and our attempt is to be flexible in re-ceiving outcomes as is preferable and feasible from participants . The survey link may  directly 
import data into RedCap or another equivalently secure database. Participants may also be 
  Reach Out ED  
  Version 14.[ADDRESS_238002] 2022 
 
71 
 mailed and called as reminder(s) for these outcomes, and to assist with technology troubleshoot-
ing.    Participants with smartphones will be sent a reminder text message to complete a Bluetooth ena-bled BP measurement. In order to get the data, we will train participants on how to download their data via the Bluetooth app, and send the data to the study team either text or email to a se-
cure study team email. If the sending of data method is unavailable, or is found to be too difficult 
for participants, the study team will conduct an in -person or virtual outcome visit to download 
final blood pressures from the Bluetooth app or collect BP measurements over the phone.   Participants with feature phones will be sent a reminder text message prompting the photograph blood pressure procedure. We will ask the participant to include a photograph of themselves tak-ing their blood pressure when they text in their BP. We will instruct participants to send the pic-ture, and text message [ADDRESS_238003] -protected web -based application, REDCap and/or qualtrics , for 
data collection and surveys. The text messages and pi[INVESTIGATOR_199466] a SSL encrypted web -
based application with secure log -ins to access. The Bluetooth app is subject to the terms and conditions 
of the particular company, which will be presented to the participant. The data being utilized on these apps (blood pressures) will only be connected with personal information if the participant chooses to use 
their name [CONTACT_199529]. Regardless, additional personal 
identifiable information will not be associated with the blood pressures or the app from Reach Out. Addi-
tionally, any data submitted by [CONTACT_199515] a secure study team email. Only Reach Out study team members 
will have access to the study email account. All data submissions received on the study email account will

  Version 14.[ADDRESS_238004]-protected database. All Reach Out study team members will receive data 
security training.  
 
 Outcomes  
 
We will measure acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction which are necessary for large scale use 
of mHealth BP and cognition measures. We will use these scales or similar validated measures of acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction.   
 Acceptability  i
 s the perception among participants that the mHealth assessments are achievable 
and agreeable. Acceptability will be assessed by [CONTACT_199516] 12-month outcome participants who continue into Reach Out Cognition.   Feasibility  i
s the extent to which the mHealth assessments can be successfully carried out. Feasi-
bility will be assessed by [CONTACT_199517]-sessment and the BP assessments separately. We will declare feasibility if greater than 50% of participants provide at least one cognitive measure.  Satisfaction  is
  the perception that upon completion of the mHealth assessments participants 
found them agreeable. Satisfaction will be measured with a text survey to all participants. The satisfaction survey is 4- item, written at a [ADDRESS_238005] about 60 minutes and will be conducted at a location convenient to the participants or virtually via secure means provided by [CONTACT_199518]-gan (https://safecomputing.umich.edu/dataguide/?q=home). Focus groups will be based on a semi -structured interview guide. Given this is minimal risk, and conversational, this will not be 
submitted to the IRB. During the focus group team members will assist in taking structured notes. Participants will be given $25 in appreciation of their time.  
Analysis 
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction. The de-
nominator is the number of Reach Out participants who complete the 12 month assessments. Re-garding feasibility, we will separately determine the feasibility by [CONTACT_199519] (i.e. cogni-tion vs. BP), phone type (i.e. smartphone vs. feature phone) and operating system type (iOS vs. Android vs. Windows) as a continuous and dichotomous (>50% completion of each assessment type) measure. The satisfaction scale wil l be assessed for all participants. Given the difference in 
procedures by [CONTACT_199520], we will compare satisfaction between the smartphone and feature phone users using a Kruskal- Wallis test.

 Minorities and women: Per NIH policy, the primary outcomes will be analyzed for evidence of 
differential treatment effects in subgroups determined by [CONTACT_4321]/gender, race, and ethnicity. 
 Upon r
ecruitment during the parent study final outcome visit, we may collect a Montreal Cogni-
tive Assessment (MoCA). We anticipate that approximately 10 -20% of our participants will have 
previously undiagnosed mild cognitive impairment. In addition, using the Neuro -QOL cognition 
battery, we will determine how much the Reach-Out Cognitive cohort differs from the expected values for the patient reported outcomes. Using existing data on trajectory of change in MoCA based on age, we will develop estimates of th e likely cognitive status of ED patients with hyper-
tension 12 months prior to enrollment in Reach Out Cognitive (i.e. at the time initially seen in ED and enrolled in the parent Reach Out trial).

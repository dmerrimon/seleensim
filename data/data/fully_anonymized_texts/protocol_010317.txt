Page 2 Objectives: 
1. To determine whether L- DOPA- carbidopa supplementation can improve visual function,
within 30-90 days, in patients with neovascular AMD (nAMD) , by [CONTACT_874809]-

•Subjects who are not fluent in English.
Treatments:  Patients will receive open label carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg one tablet QHS  for 
one month, followed by [CONTACT_874810] , in the morning, with supper and at bedtime  for one 
month, followed by [CONTACT_874811] , in the morning, with supper and at bedtime  for one month 
(100-600 mg of levodopa daily). This is the equivalent of very low to moderate doses of 
carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease (daily dose of levodopa 200-800 mg). Patients entering this study after completing Study 001 will receive one month of the dose that he or she received in Study 001, and one month each of any doses higher than the dose that he or she received in Study 001. Examples:   
1. If the patient received carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg once daily in Study 001, he or she
will receive one month of treatment with each of the 3 daily doses of carbidopa -levodopa.
2. If the patient received carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg TID in Study 001, he or she will
receive one month of carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg TID, followed by [CONTACT_874812]-levodopa 25-100 mg, 2 tablets TID.
Each patient will receive an injection of anti -VEGF medication on the day carbidopa-levodopa 
dosing begins in this study. Each patient will be evaluated at monthly (25-35 day) intervals and in conjunction be evaluated by [CONTACT_874813]- VEGF injection, based on clinical practice standard of care.  
What are the risks of taking carbidopa -levodopa? 
•Body as a whole: chest pain, feeling weak and fatigued.

upon standing, high blood pressure, fainting, vein inflammation and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].
•Gastrointestinal: dark saliva, ulcers, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, heartburn, dry mouth, altered taste and gastrointestinal bleeding.
•Hematologic: anemia, low white blood cells, low platelets.
•Hypersensitivity: skin rash, itching, face or throat swelling.
•Musculoskeletal: back pain, shoulder pain, muscle pain.
•Nervous system/Psychiatric: delusions, hallucinations, confusion, agitation, dizziness,sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], abnormal dreams, insomnia, abnormal sensations, headache, depression,
abnormal movements, mental difficulties, urge to gamble, increased sexual desire,problems with impulse control.
•Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: shortness of breath, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].
•Skin: Rash, increased sweating, hair loss, dark sweat.
•Urogenital: urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, dark urine.
Dealing with Adverse Events: Study Participants will be asked about any adverse events at each visit, and asked to tell the study doctor or study staff right away if they have any side effects, or if they have any other problems with their health or the way they feel during the study, regardless of whether or not they think these problems are related to the study drug. The answers will be recorded in the source documents. For minor and easily tolerated events, the participants 
will continue in the study, unless they request to be withdrawn from the study. For serious or poorly tolerated events, the patient will be withdrawn from the study. Appropriate medical care will be instituted for any serious adverse events (SAEs). Number of subjects:  52 completed

Page 6 Recruiting:  In order to enhance recruiting, ophthalmology technicians in the offices of the 
Retina Specialists will be asked to identify patients who meet the criteria for the study and bring 
them to the attention of the Retina Specialist, who will decide whether or not to refer the patient. If the patient is referred and meets the criteria for the study, the technician will be paid $25. Duration:  Up to 105 days of treatment.   
Measurements and Activities:  
•Written informed c onsent at Baseline.
•Ophthalmic history and comprehensive eye examination; including visual acuity, wearing 
any prescription lenses, using an EDTRS chart, in both eyes prior to randomization, and
ophthalmoscopic examination, and OCT.
•Repeat assessment of visual acuity using an EDTRS chart, ophthalmoscopic examination,and OCT at monthly visits.
•Subjective Vision Questionnaire at monthly visits.
•Demographics at Baseline.
•Medical History, Vital Signs and Physical Examination at Baseline.
•ECG, CBC, Chem 20 and HbA
1C at Baseline.
•Dispense study medication at visits, 1,2 and 3.
•Pi[INVESTIGATOR_269573].
•Non-directed assessment of adverse events at each visit, including classification as to
severity, seriousness and body system.
•Concomitant medications at each visit.
•If a patient had the baseline evaluation in Study 001, that will be used as the baselineevaluation for this study.
Criteria for repeat anti-V EGF  injections:  
This will be based on monthly evaluation of: BCVA (decrease of 5 letters from previous visit); 
increased central macular thickness (compared to normal and previous visit as measured by 
[CONTACT_63396]; new blood (hemorrhage) on direct retinal examination; or subjective decrease in vision. If 
any of these criteria are met, or if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_874808], the patient requires 
anti-VEGF therapy, the patient will have an anti-VEGF intraocular injection. If none of these 
criteria are met at visits 2, 3 or 4, with patient agreement, anti-VEGF injection will not be done, 
and the patient will be reevaluated in 1 month. 
Result sharing with subjects:  
After the conclusion of the study, patients will be notified of the results, regarding safety, 
tolerability and vision-related outcomes.

• Assess the effect of morning bright light versus dim light therapy (control) 
on fatigue and sleep continuity disturbance in lung cancer survivors.  
• Predict efficacy to morning bright light therapy versus dim light therapy 
(control) on fatigue and sleep continuity disturbance in lung cancer 
survivors.  
• Evaluate, in a preliminary way, the extent to which time from treatment 
(as a proxy iatrogenic effect s), sleep homeostatic “de- prime” (mismatch 
between sleep opportunity and ability), and circadian factors (phase and 
amplitude) predict illness severity and treatment response.  
 
 
1.1 Hypothesis  
 
Hypothesis 1: Subjects in the Bright Light Treatment group will exhibit 
significant improvements as compared to Dim Light Treatment in fatigue, 
sleep and circadian activity rhythms.  
Hypothesis 2: Subjects typed during baseline as having circadian dysrhythm ia 
using actigraphy (circadian phase and amplitude abnormalities) will be 
significantly more likely to exhibit treatment responses.  
 
 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current 
knowledge.  
 
Fatigue and sleep disturbance are commo n in cancer survivors  (Berger et 
al., 2009; Roscoe et al., 2007; Pachman et al., 2012) . Fatigue is reported in 
up to 97% of patients receiving cancer treatment and in 34% of cancer 
survivors  (Goedendorp et al., 2013; Kapo et al., 2015) . Sleep disturbance 
is reported in up to 88% of patients receiving cancer treatment and 56% of 
cancer survivors  (Ancoli -Israel, 2009; Barsevick et al., 2010; Berger et al., 
2009; Palesh et al., 2010) . When compared to other patients diagnosed 
with cancer, patients with lung ca ncer have more than double the 
prevalence of fatigue and sleep disturbance (Davidson et al., 2002; 
Gooneratne et al., 2007) .  
  
 Page 5 of 36  Revis ed: November 15, [ADDRESS_1108278] etiologic pathways and require (or best 
respond) to different treatment approaches. Fatigue refers to mental and 
physical weariness and exhaustion, where performance is compromised. 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802812]: patients are 
also vulnerable to falling asleep at inappropriate times and places. Sleep 
disturbance is a generic term for all sleep complaints and disorders 
including sleep continuity disturbance  (i.e., difficulty f alling and staying 
asleep), respi[INVESTIGATOR_716777]  (e.g., sleep apnea and 
nocturnal hypoxia/hypoxemia), and/or motor disturbances during sleep 
and parasomnias . For this study, sleep disturbance will specifically refer to 
sleep continuity disturbance (SCD) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_802813] (RD) 
during sleep. 
The rather singular focus on cancer related fatigue and the assumption that 
this occurs with cancer treatment, suggests that fatigue should abate either 
with the response to, and discontinuation of, treatment. As noted above, 
this is largely true for fatig ue (~60% reduction from treatment to 
survivorship) but less true for sleep disturbance (30% reduction from 
treatment to survivorship). In both cases significant, the survivorship 
prevalence is high and is comparable to, or exceeds, the population 
general population rates. The lack of resolution in both cases suggests that 
additional treatment is necessary, particular during survivorship. The 
question is “where and how to follow -up?” In the absence of mature data 
on sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802814], the higher  prevalence rates of sleep 
disturbance suggests that this may be the best first therapeutic target. 
Given, a large literature on circadian rhythm disturbance in cancer patients 
and survivors (Golombek et al., 2013), this suggests that chronobiologic 
treatm ents in general, and Bright Light Treatment (BLT) in particular is an 
ideal option.  
Preliminary testing of BLT has been conducted in a variety of cancer 
patients to improve cancer -related fatigue, but not in patients with lung 
cancer. Additionally, the ef ficacy of BLT on improving sleep continuity 
disturbances, daytime functioning and quality of life has not been assessed 
in lung cancer survivors. Accordingly, we proposed to conduct a 
preliminary study of the effects of BLT in patients who are lung cancer 
survivors.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1108279] has conducted three 
studies that involved lung cancer survivors (ref). These studies established 
that lung cancer survivors (n=76) experienced middl e insomnia (i.e. 
difficulty maintaining sleep) and determined that patients receiving 
 Page 6 of 36  Revis ed: November 15, 2016  chemotherapy for lung cancer (n=50) had early (i.e. difficulty falling 
asleep) and middle (difficulty staying asleep) insomnia (Gooneratne, Dean 
et al. 2007, Dean, Finnel l et al. 2010). Our most recent mixed method, 
longitudinal study with 4 measures over 6- months (n=29) found that 89% 
reported the occurrence of fatigue and 67% reported fatigue was persistent 
across treatment. In addition, poor sleepers (72%) had less acti vity, 
weaker rhythmicity and more phase delay compared to good sleepers 
before and during treatment for non- small cell lung cancer. Acrophase, 
where peak activity in a [ADDRESS_1108280] ional subscales and total 
scores indicating later peak activity is related to poorer QOL. These 
findings support the occurrence of fatigue, sleep continuity disturbance 
and circadian activity rhythm disturbance in lung cancer survivors and 
support for the rationale for testing BLT. 
 
2.3 Provide the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and 
significance of the research based on the existing literature and how will it add to existing knowledge.  
The guiding theory for this proposal is the Two- Process Model of Sleep 
Regulation, a leading theory of sleep regulation (Borbely 1982). It 
suggests that sleep occurs when the homeostatic drive to sleep (process S) 
approaches an upper threshold, and awakeni ng from sleep occurs when 
process S reaches a lower threshold. The need to sleep increases the longer 
you are awake. The second process, process C, is a sinusoidal rhythm that 
fluctuates across the 24hour day and is driven by a clock -like mechanism 
in the brain (suprachiasmatic nucleii). The circadian system communicates 
time of day (light and dark cues from the retina) and thereby [CONTACT_802834]. For example, in an individual awake during the day and 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_21693], the circadian process C is highest from 3am to 5am, 
when it is very difficult to overcome the need to sleep and is lowest from 
4pm to 6pm, where sleep propensity is minimal. The circadian process C 
and the homeos tatic process S both contribute to sleep consolidation. The 
interaction between these two processes forms the basis for a remarkably 
standardized period of sleep at night and a consolidated period of 
wakefulness throughout the day. However, mechanisms that  oppose or 
enhance process S or process C can have a significant effect on the timing, 
duration and structure of sleep as well as daytime functioning.  
In the context of cancer and cancer survivorship, the question is “are one 
or both of these processes” altered by [CONTACT_90050], its treatment, or by 
[CONTACT_802835]/or manage their fatigue and 
sleep disturbance. Homeostatic dysregulation may occur as a result 
curtailed time awake during the day and increased time in bed at nigh t. 
The trigger for these behavioral changes (which de- prime sleep 
homeostasis) may be the patient’s sense of fatigue (which may occur with 
 Page 7 of 36  Revis ed: November 15, 2016  the disease process or as a result of treatment) and signal to the patient that 
they need more sleep when what they a re experiencing is fatigue and not 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The end result is a mismatch between sleep ability and sleep 
opportunity and that this results in sleep continuity disturbance, daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and an exacerbation of extant daytime fatigue. Circadian 
dysregulation may also occur because of altered sleep wake schedules 
and/or to changes in how much and when the patient is exposed to bright 
light (Berger and Farr 1999, Berger, Farr et al. 2007, Ancoli -Israel, 
Rissling et al. 2012). Further, the circadian sys tem may be dysregulated 
owing to intrinsic factors. Cancer, or its treatment, may directly alter core 
body temperature rhythms or amplitude, suppress, enhance or phase shift 
melatonin secretion, and/or fundamentally alter and dysregulate other 
neuroendocri ne functions that have a circadian periodicity and influence 
fatigue, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and sleep (Armaiz- Pena, Cole et al. 2013).   
Most cancer research on fatigue (and to a lesser extent sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802815]) has focused on circadian dysregulation. To date it has 
been found that cancer patients exhibit circadian rhythm 
desynchronization of cortisol and melatonin (Dogliotti, Berruti et al. 1990, 
Dolberg, Hirschmann et al. 1998, Davis, Mirick et al. 2001), disrupted 
phase -delayed activity acrophase (A ncoli -Israel, Rissling et al. 2012, 
Berger, Hertzog et al. 2012), lower circadian quotient (Levin, Daehler et 
al. 2005, Berger, Hertzog et al. 2012) and that cancer survivors exhibit 
flattened biomarkers of circadian rhythms (Bower, Ganz et al. 2005, 
Bower  2006, Bower, Ganz et al. 2006, Bower 2007, Bower, Ganz et al. 
2007). These data strongly suggest that circadian factors are associated 
with fatigue and sleep -wake disturbances (Levin, Daehler et al. 2005) and 
that chronobiologic interventions may be useful for the management of 
cancer related fatigue, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and/or sleep disturbance (Ancoli -Israel, 
Rissling et al. 2012, Berger, Hertzog et al. 2012, Redd, Valdimarsdottir et 
al. 2014). Circadian rhythm disturbances are managed according to the 
specific type of disorder, but three common therapi[INVESTIGATOR_802816]: Chronotherapy, Melatonin Therapy, and Bright Light Therapy.   
Chronotherapy is a behavioral intervention to progressively re -align one’s 
biologically based and preferred sleep phase with s tandard clock time 
(Eckerberg, Lowden et al. 2012). Melatonin Therapy entails the 
administration of exogenous melatonin (melatonin is also a neurohormone 
produced in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_263575]) to exert chronobiotic effects (Burgess, Savic 
et al. 2003, Burgess and F ogg 2008, Burgess, Revell et al. 2008). That is, 
melatonin is used to produce phase shifts in the biological clock. These 
shifts, like those produce with chronotherapy, are used to re -align one’s 
biologically based and preferred sleep phase with standard c lock time. 
Bright Light Therapy uses an environmental cue to phase advance or 
phase delay circadian rhythms. Bright light therapy (BLT) has been shown 
to be effective in reducing sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances 
associated with a variety of disorder s (e.g. jet lag, seasonal affective 
disorder, depression, delayed or advanced sleep phase and other sleep 
 Page 8 of 36  Revis ed: November 15, 2016  disorders). Preliminary testing of BLT has been conducted in a variety of 
cancer patients to improve cancer -related fatigue, but not in patients with 
lung cancer. Additionally, the efficacy of BLT on improving sleep 
continuity disturbances, daytime functioning and quality of life has not 
been conducted with lung cancer survivors. Of the previously mentioned 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the proposed BLT delivered via eye mask may increase 
compliance, since the mask can be aimed directly at the eyes and 
treatment requires minimal effort. Light masks may be a more energy -
efficient (through the use of only eight LEDs) and portable method, 
compared to traditional light boxes.

3.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria 
3.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included or excluded in 
your final study sample.  
Fifty-two lung cancer survivors with sleep continuity disturbance will be 
recruited over 2 years. Eligibility c riteria include  the following: age >21, 
stage I -III, non- small cell lung cancer, > 6weeks and < 3years post -surgical 
resection who are medically and psychiatrically stable. Subjects must be 
able to give consent.  An NCI -designated comprehensive cancer center  
with a well -established thoracic surgery practice will be the recruitment 
site. A collaborative recruitment arrangement in the past has resulted in 
successful recruitment goal achievement .  
3.2 Describe how individuals will be screen ed for eligibility.  
 Page 12 of 36  Revis ed: November 15, 2016  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_98436] (RA) will screen all eligible participants for 
sleep apnea using the ApneaLink device. Participants who screen positive 
for sleep apnea will receive 2 printed report s of the ApneaLink results: one 
for themselves and a copy for thei r provider , who will be advised to refer 
the participant for further sleep evaluation. Following a negative screen 
for sleep apnea, participants will be evaluated for sleep continuity 
disturbance through the use of Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_802817] 14 -day sleep diaries. Participants will also be 
screened for circadian activity rhythm disturbance with 14 -day actigraphy 
and Morningness -Eveningness Questionnaire. A folder will be provided 
with each of the pretreatment instruments to complete and an actigraph to 
wear 24/7 at home. Following completion of pretreatment measures, 
participants will be randomized using a random number assignment to 
either red -yellow (control dim light) versus blue -green (experimental  
bright light) directed light therapy. Participants will be trained on how to 
wear the directed light therapy for 6 0-minutes within 30 -minutes upon 
awakening for 1- week (Redd et al., 2014).  
3.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include or exclude each of the 
following special populations:  (You may not include members of 
these populations as subjects in your research unless you indicate 
this in your inclusion criteria.)  
• Adults unable to consent  
• Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)

These populations  will not be included in the study.  
3.4 Indicate whether you will include non- English speaking individuals.  
Provide justification if you will exclude non -English speaking 
individuals.  
(In order to meet one of the primary ethical princ iples of equitable 
selection of subjects, non- English speaking individuals may not be 
routinely excluded from research.  In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent or is designed to investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populat ions who may not speak English, 
the researcher is required to make efforts to recruit and include non -
English speaking individuals.  However, there are studies in which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak English: e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_197820] s, small unfunded studies with validated instruments 
not available in other languages, numerous questionnaires, and some non- therapeutic studies which offer no direct benefit.)  
Non-English speaker s will not be included in the study because this is a

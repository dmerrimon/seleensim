 Page 6 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Response:  
Adherence to medications in persons with prediabetes , type 2 diabetes  or related 
como rbidities (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035])  can help prevent the 
development/progression of type 2 diabetes . However, adherence to diabetes 
medications1,2 and medications for its comorbidities is relatively low,3 with a 
commonly cited reason in those wi th prediabetes being “forgetting”1. The ability 
to recall and successfully engage in an action at an appropriate time in the future 
is referred to as prospective memory (PM). Accumulating research shows that 
poorer prospective memory is related to medicati on non -adherence among 
individuals using various types of medications;4 and as such, improving PM 
represents a potentially fruitful means of increasing medication adherence.  
An important facet of behavior that may contribute to medication non -adherence 
is delay discounting (DD). Delay discounting refers to the extent to which an 
individual devalues an outcome due to its delay in time. Prior research has shown 
that greater DD is related to poor glycemic control, and this relationship is 
partially mediated b y medication adherence.5 Previous research by [CONTACT_10732]6, which serves as the platform for 
the NIH Science of Behavior Change Initiative7, has shown that DD is related to 
HbA1c levels in those with prediabetes, th at changes in DD over a year are 
associated with changes in HbA1c, and that we can manipulate DD with epi[INVESTIGATOR_10683] (or the prospection of one’s self in future scenarios; EFT). These 
findings set the stage for our UH3 grant on using EFT to modif y DD and HbA1c 
levels. Several laboratory studies have shown EFT is a successful approach to 
improving PM8–11. Given that EFT also produces robust effects on DD12–14, EFT 
may be an especially efficacious intervention in that it has the potential to 
improve  two different processes related to poorer medication adherence. Current 
research examining the effects of EFT on PM have been confined to laboratory 
tasks, and research is needed to assess EFT effects on medication adherence.  
We propose an RCT that will assess the effects of EFT on medication adherence, 
general PM, and DD among those with pre - or type [ADDRESS_10273] one oral medication for diabetes or 
related comorbidities. We will recruit  participant s who are relatively non -adherent 
to an oral medication ( < 80% of prescribed doses taken in the past month; to 
accommodate over -reporting)  for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes or other 
conditions that commonly co -occur with these conditions (e.g., hypertensi on, 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]).  Medication adherence will be monitored using electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_10684] (MEMS caps, which record bottle openings with date and time 
stamps), pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], and pharmacy records. Medications for glucose control as 
well as control of hype rtension and/or hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_10686] . Participants self -rated as non -adherent ( < 80% 
prescribed doses taken), and report difficulty remembering to take one’s 
medication as a p rimary reason for non -adherence, will undergo a 6 week, 8 
week, or 10 week baseline period. After the staggered baseline periods, all 
participants will receive EFT intervention . In total, participants will be in baseline 
and treatment for a total or 15 wee ks.  
 Page 7 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19  
Randomized participants will complete bi-weekly in person sessions  plus phone 
sessions for the weeks in which they do not come to the lab,  in which they learn 
toengage in EFT for medication adherence . Initial  EFT for medication adherence 
will focus o n taking the targeted medication on a typi[INVESTIGATOR_5707] (e.g., a weekday 
when the participant usually works), and in subsequent sessions EFT will be used 
to assist participants in adapting to unusual circumstances that may interrupt 
adherence or have been report ed as contributing to non -adherence.  
At an initial baseline session , post -intervention, and follow -up, participants will 
complete measures of working memory, lab -based PM, and DD. Dependent 
measures include change in targeted medication adherence (based o n MEMS 
data), change in non -targeted medication adherence (for participants initially 
reporting non -adherence to multiple medications; based on self -report and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10687]), DD, and PM. Moderators to be tested include working . The goal 
of the study  will be to collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_10688], as well as e ffect sizes for a subsequent R01 .

5.0 Study Design*  
5.1 Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. case -control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
Response:  
This study is a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design; participants will be 
randomized to a 6 week, 8 week,  or 10 week staggered baseline periods followed 
by 4-8 weeks of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10691] (EFT).  
6.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
6.1  Describe the study intervention and/or investigational agent (e.g., 
drug, device) that is being evaluated.  
Respons e:  
The intervention being researched is called epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681] (EFT), which 
consists of imagin ing specific instances of one’s future. In this study, participants 
will engage in EFT focused on imagining taking one’s medication, guided by a 
researc h staff member in their intervention sessions  in addition to bi -weekly 
 Page 9 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /[ADDRESS_10276] 
the intervention session using a semi -structured interview format in which the 
staff member works to iden tify situations/circumstances in which the participant 
encounters challenges with taking their medication, and subsequently asking 
questions to prompt the participant to imagine what successful medication 
adherence would consist of (and “look” like). Sessi ons may also involve 
imagining positive events resulting from successful medication adherence and the 
details surrounding those events. For example: if the research staff member finds 
that a participant struggles to take their medication on weekends, the s taff 
member will ask the participant to visualize what successfully doing so might 
entail (getting the medication bottle and putting it next to the waffle iron, which is 
frequently used on the weekends) and to imagine the sensory aspects of the 
experience of doing so (pi[INVESTIGATOR_10693], taking out the waffle 
iron, placing it on the counter —and noting any typi[INVESTIGATOR_10694], items 
one sees, etc.).

7.0 36 Local Number of Subjects  
7.1 Indicate the total number of subjects t hat will be enrolled or records that 
will be reviewed  locally.  
Response:  
 Page 10 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /[ADDRESS_10277] to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate).   
Response:  
We expect to initially screen  approximately 60 subjects (online or by [CONTACT_10735]) and complete about [ADDRESS_10278] access to? What percentage of those potential subjects 
do you need to recruit?  
Response:  
Given that we will be taking advantage of CTSI resources for recruiting based on 
individuals’ diagnosed medical conditions, we a nticipate that recruiting this 
relatively small number of participants for our final sample will be feasible within 
a 4-month period. The Buffalo Research Registry has 200 -some potentially 
eligible individuals based on a diagnosis of Pre - or Type 2 Diabete s, and TriNetX 
an additional 15,110 with these diagnoses (with 5,150 of these prescribed an oral 
blood glucose -regulating medication).  
8.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria * 
8.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included  in your final study 
sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response:  
Adults over the age of [ADDRESS_10279] one oral medication for blood glucose regulation,  or for related 
comorbidities e.g., hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and are relatively non -adherent 
to taking them (< 80% of prescribed doses taken), but are motivated and/or have 
the intent to better comply with their medication regimen, will be studied.  
During the Baseline Period, if participants are adhe rent to their medications 
(>80%), their participation in the study may be terminated.  
 
Prediabetes  and Type 2 Diabetes : Participants must  report having  have a 
diagnosis of prediabetes  or Type [ADDRESS_10280] 2 years or meet criteria 
for prediabe tes or Type 2 Diabetes . The American Diabetes Association 
guidelines (Group, 2003) defines prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes as Fasting 
Plasma Glucose (FPG) 100mg/dl  or greater , 2h glucos e 140 mg/dl or greater after 
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or hemo globin A1c (HbA1c)  of 
approximately 5.4%  or greater . We will also include individuals who have 
 Page 11 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /[ADDRESS_10281] a BMI of 30 of higher with one or more related 
comorbidities ( e.g., hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]).  
 
8.2 Describe the criteria that define who will be excluded  from your final study 
sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response:   
Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from 
participation.  
Substance use, abuse, or dependence: Individuals that currently have problems 
with substance dependence, addiction, or problematic substance use that would 
limit participation (e.g., binge drinkers, alcoholics, daily stimulant/opi[INVESTIGATOR_10695]) 
will be excluded.  
Conditions that affect adherence: Participants should not have a condition that 
would limit participation which include medical conditions that would affect 
individuals’ ability to use the computer for prolonged period of time; leave the 
individual unable to ambulate; unmanaged psychiatric disorder ( e.g., depression, 
anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity  disorder,  schizophrenia), cognitive 
impairment that would impact memory (e.g., symptomatic concussion), or an 
intellectual impairment  that would impact study adherence. Additionally, 
participants should be able to attend to all intervention  sessions  (Due to Covid -19 
all sessions will be completed remotely/virtually) and have reliable access to 
technology required to complete the measure s in this study.  If a participant is not 
able to make most sessions (e.g. participant is out of town during most of the 
study for work or vacation travel),  or does not have reliable access to technology, 
they may be excluded from the study .  
Prior particip ation in similar studies:  Individuals who have recently participated 
in a laboratory study using similar methods may also be excluded.   
Use of medication adherence aids: individuals who currently use aids to assist 
with medication adherence (e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_10696], reminder apps)may be excluded.  
 
8.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include any of the following special 
populations  in your study using the checkboxes below.

☐ N/A:   This is a records review only, and subjects will not be 
recruited.  NOTE:  If you select this option, please make sure that 
all records review procedures and inclusion/exclusion screening 
are adequ ately described in other sections.  
11.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.   
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and 
introducing them to the study.  Include specific methods you will use (e .g. 
searching charts for specific ICD code numbers, Research Participant Groups, 
posted advertisements, etc.).  
Response:  
The different types of recruitment methods to be used are the following:  
1. We will post and/or disseminate recruitment materials (e.g., flyers, letters, and 
handouts/postcards) both in the community (e.g., health clinics, stores, public 
spaces, community and organizational events) and online (e.g., craigslist, 
social media websites/apps, division website).  
2. We will use the  i2b2 and TriNetX  database through UB’s Institute for 
Healthcare Informatics (IHI) to recruit participants from the UBMD medical 
data base.  
3. The study team may also utilize the University at Buffalo’s Clinical and 
Translational Science Institute (CTSI) for recruitment assis tance and 
consultation. The CTSI’s Recruitment Team provides resources, guidance on 
appropriate recruitment strategies, and assistance in linking out study team 
with partners to effectively reach recruitment goals and target populations. We 
may also work w ith CTSI Community Engagement Team (CET) to create 
awareness of the study through their professional and community contacts. 
The tools they have available may include the Buffalo Research Registry 
(BRR, IRB Approved STUDY00000806), the Patients Voices Netw ork 
(PVN), the Conventus CTSI/PVN Research Table, and conducting outreach at 
various community events. The BRR is a voluntary registry which can 
connect us to community members who have completed a health profile and 
are interested in participating in rese arch. These community members have 
agreed to be contact[CONTACT_10736]-reported information.  These tools are method by [CONTACT_10737] -approved recruitment information to community members.  As 
described in the BRR’s IRB Approved Protocol (STUDY00000806), the 
BRR’s Community Recruitment Liaison (CRL) will complete the process of 
sorting BRR data to reflect the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study if 
 Page 15 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 it is appropriate to utilize the BRR f or this study. The CRL may reach out to 
potentially eligible participants in the BRR to provide information about our 
research study. After receiving proof that IRB has approved BRR’s use in this 
study, the CRL can then provide our study team with name [CONTACT_10780] 
[CONTACT_10738]. No 
recorded health information will be shared from BRR data. Our research team 
will proceed to reach  out to interested potential participants regarding 
eligibility and moving forward in the study.  
      The CET also tables at many events in the community throughout the year and 
may display the IRB approved flyer for this project at their table at 
communi ty events. Examples of events the CET attends include Good for the 
Neighborhood hosted by [CONTACT_10739], UB on the Green, 
Juneteenth, Elmwood Arts Festival and many others.  
      The CET also hosts a standing table at the Conventus Building  on the 4th 
floor of UBMD where the IRB approved flyer  and other handouts  can be 
made available to community members and patients. This will occur only after 
agreement between the CRL and UBMD Conventus partners that the study is 
appropriate for the Conven tus space.  
4. A database of participants that have been involved in previous studies at the 
University at Buffalo Behavioral Medicine laboratory that expressed interest 
in future studies will be used. Participants who have indicated interest in 
contact [CONTACT_10740]. The database is used by [CONTACT_10741], for phone/email contact (38 5420, 389912, 385442). No data 
or identifying information is collected prior to a potential participant’s 
expression of interest in the research study.  In addition, there are several 
similar but smaller databases maintained by [CONTACT_10742]. These labs also conduct studies with type II diabetic and/or 
prediabetic patients, and maintain a list of individuals who were interested in 
participating, but did not meet the eligibility criteria for the given study. We 
plan to collaborate with  these labs, sharing information about our study with 
these potential participants who indicated an interest in hearing about other 
study opportunities, and also sharing information about these colleagues’ 
studies with individuals who were interested in, b ut not eligible for, the 
present study.  These interested individuals’ contact [CONTACT_10743]. Following this, these potential participants will be 
contact[CONTACT_10744].  
5. Urban Family Practice: Used in previous IRB approved studies (030 -796526, 
STUDY 00000936), the physicians from Urban Family Practice have 
provided us with a list of patient names, addresses, contact [CONTACT_3031], and 
brief medical history (e.g., diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035],  previous HbA1c measurements, BMI) for recruitment 
purposes of the MINDD Grant. We plan to use this same recruitment method 
 Page 16 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /[ADDRESS_10284] th e 
research team.  Potential participants who were mailed a letter jointly signed 
by [CONTACT_10745]’s physician at Urban Family Practice may also 
be contact[CONTACT_10746] a resp onse from the individual after one week. Since this is 
the first time we will be using Urban Family Practice to recruit from, we will 
follow their recruitment protocol, which allows us to contact [CONTACT_10747].  
6.  Trialfacts: A recruitment service that creates advertisements and information 
on landing page. Potential participants will then complete an online 
prescreening questionnaire ( which is identical to the prescreen used by [CONTACT_10748] ) to determine if eligible to  continue to a phone screening. Potential 
participants chose an appointment time for their phone screening to connect 
with the study staff. Potential participants also have the option to either email 
us or phone us for further information.  All information collected through this 
service will be made available to the research team using google spreadsheets 
on Trialfacts protected servers.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_10285] the privacy interests of prospective subjects 
during the recruitment process.   
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.    
Response:  
Individuals who contact [CONTACT_10749].  
Individuals from our Division’s database and other databases as described in 
section 11.[ADDRESS_10286] learned are not interested.  
The privacy of patients recruited using the i2b2 /TriNetX  and Urban Family 
Practice  data will be protected by [CONTACT_10750] -approved procedure. A 
letter will be sent to the eligibl e patient’s physician  (see attached). After a 
minimum of one week , if the physician doesn’t contact [CONTACT_10751], a recruitment letter will be sent to participants via mail (see attached). If 
we don’t hear from the patients within a minimum of one week , one follow -up 
call will be made (see attached phone script). If at any point the physician or the 
patient declines, the patient will be removed from the contact [CONTACT_4111].   
 Page 17 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 The privacy of patients recruited  through Trialfacts : Trialfacts  adheres to  the 
Principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in all of its recruitment activity. All 
recruitment materials are provided to the research staff  to ensure accuracy and 
seek relevant independent review board (IRB) or human research ethics 
committee (HREC) a pproval. Trialfacts will  pass referrals to the research team  
using Google spreadsheets, for which they have a BAA in place to ensure HIPAA 
compliance.  
 
11.3 Identify any  materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for telephone calls, in person announcements / 
presentations, email invitations.  
For advertisements, include the final copy of printed advertisements with your 
submission. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attac h the final 
audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior 
to tapi[INVESTIGATOR_10697] -required revisions, provided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version.  
 Response:  
Web-based advertisements, emails, flyers, handouts, telephone calls , using the 
approved text , and mailed letters and postcards, will be used to recruit subjects.

12.0 Procedures Involved * 
12.[ADDRESS_10287] is screened and 
determined to be eligible . Provide as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and include enough detail 
so that an other investigator could pi[INVESTIGATOR_10698].  
For studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response.  
Response:  
Individuals who pass the initial  inclusion/exclusion screen and wish to enroll in 
the study will be invited to complete the in -lab or virtual screen/initial assessment. 
Participants invited to this session will be asked to share a copy of their 
medication refill history*. This can be sha red either through email or fax.  
*Participants will be able to request these from their local pharmacist . Refill records may 
also be obtained through web or app accounts for their current pharmacy. We may also 

 Page 18 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 ask participants to fill out a pharmacy releas e form to receive the information directly 
from their pharmacy/ pharmacist.   
In-Lab Screen/Initial Assessment Session:  
Upon arrival to the Division of Behavioral Medicine (G56 Farber Hall), 
participants will be greeted and escorted to a private interview room where they 
will be given a more in -depth explanation  about the study and provide 
documented consent  if they agree t o participate . Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_10699] (p erson obtaining consent and the 
participant ). One copy will be obtained by [CONTACT_10752].  
Covid -19 Altern ative Procedure: Participants will complete this session virtually 
over the video call and remote computing program Zoom. This program allows 
for research staff and participants to communicate, as well as for participants to 
access study measures remotely.  Firstly, research staff will provide participants 
with a more in -depth explanation about the study. A consent form will be 
provided on the screen, and participants will have a chance to read through and 
provide an e -signature [CONTACT_10781]. A c opy of the completed consent 
form will be emailed to participants for their records.  
After the consent process, participants will provide their prescription refill history 
and target prescription medication as well as complete measures of decision 
making a nd questionnaires including demographics, medical history, alcohol, 
tobacco, and other substance use, participation and medication adherence 
motivation, and schedule availability for study participation.  
Covid -19 Alternative Procedure: After the consent p rocess, participants will 
complete measures of decision making and questionnaires including 
demographics, medical history, alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use, 
participation and medication adherence motivation, and schedule availability for 
study par ticipation.  
In order to confirm that participants are non -adherent, we may request that 
participants conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_10700]. This may be done 
through sharing a short survey with participants in which they count the 
remaining quantity of relevant medications or sending research staff a photo of 
their medications, so that pi[INVESTIGATOR_10701]. Non -adherence will 
also be confirmed through pharmacy records and self -report.  
The research staff will conduct pi[INVESTIGATOR_10702] e adherence measures from 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_10703], and that they meet eligibility criteria. The research staff 
will also provide the participant with up to 4 MEMS bottles for the medications 
they are non -adherent to. Measures and questionnaires may be completed on 
either the computer or paper/pencil labelled only with the participant’s ID number 
and date. In addition, participants may sign forms for release of their relevant 
medical records to confirm their eligibility (e.g., diagnosis with prediabetes  or 
Type 2 Diabetes, prescription drug use, refill history ).). Participants may sign a 
release form for relevant pharmaceutical records (e.g. refill history of medications 
 Page 19 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 used to treat pre -diabetes, diabetes, and comorbid disorders such as 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_10704]) from their current pharmacy.   Participants may 
also complete a urine drug screen to confirm non -substance abuse and female 
participants may complete a urine pregn ancy test to ensure eligibility. If 
throughout the study there is reason to believe a participant has become pregnant 
(i.e. the participant expresses that is their belief), we will provide pregnancy 
testing. If the pregnancy results are positive, the parti cipant will be informed and 
they will not be eligible to continue with the study. If in-lab measures of 
adherence and substance use indicate that the participant does not meet study 
criteria, the research staff may choose to end the In -Lab Screen/Initial A ssessment 
session early and compensation will be pro -rated (see compensation section below 
in protocol for details).  
If participants still meet eligibility criteria and have availability for sessions, they 
will complete the assessments described below in t he Assessment Sessions 
description. Then, the research staff will give the participant a pharmaceutical 
medication vial and a MEMS track -cap (an electronic medication vial cap that 
records and time -stamps medication vial openings). The research staff will 
instruct the participant to transfer their medication into the study bottle and adhere 
the copy of the prescription label onto the study bottle. The staff member will 
then review appropriate use of the study bottle and MEMS cap; and schedule the 
participan t’s intervention sessions. Participants will also have their height and 
weight measured.  
Covid -19 Alternative Procedure:  If participants still meet eligibility criteria and 
have availability for sessions, they will complete the assessments described below  
in the Assessment Sessions description. Then, the research staff will give the 
participant a pharmaceutical medication vial and a MEMS track -cap (an 
electronic medication vial cap that records and time -stamps medication vial 
openings). This will be given to participants via mail. The research staff will 
instruct the participant to transfer their medication into the study bottle and adhere 
the copy of the prescription label onto the study bottle. The staff member will 
then review appropriate use of the stud y bottle and MEMS cap via Zoom or 
telephone; and schedule the participant’s intervention sessions.  
 
Baseline Sessions:  
All participants complete a 6 -week baseline in which they will use the MEMS 
bottles. At week 6, all participants will attend an in -person  lab session to assess 
their adherence levels through looking at data from the MEMS bottles and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10705].  
Covid -19 Alternative Procedure: All participants will complete a [ADDRESS_10288] 
mobile d ata collection, and simply pi[INVESTIGATOR_10706], and using sanitation 
 Page 20 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 procedures, remotely download the data from the MEMS cap.The cap will then be 
returned to the participants mailbox.  
Participants will then be randomly assigned to either the 6 -week, 8 - week or 10 -
week baseline. If a participant’s medication adherence is not below 80%, they will 
be asked to come in at week 8 to reassess their adherence level (similarly, if their 
adherence is not below 80% at week 8, they will be asked to come back at week 
10. If their adherence is not below 80% at this point, they will be dismissed from 
the study). If a participant is below 80% adherence within this 6 -week period and 
their adherence is stable, meaning that there is no increasing trend in their 
adherence lev el, they will be randomly assigned to either a 6 -week, 8 - week or 
10-week baseline. Participants who were assigned 6 - week baseline, will now be 
eligible to start the intervention, those in the 8 -week will complete two more 
weeks of baseline prior to the i ntervention, and those in the 10 -week will 
complete four more weeks of baseline prior to the intervention *.  
*Participants must be considered stable based on their pi[INVESTIGATOR_10707]. For this study stability will be define d as no increasing 
trend (3 data points) in their adherence level. If a participant was assigned to a 
group but is not stable during that time period, they will be assigned to the next 
group (if disqualified for 6 -week they will go to the 8 -week and so on) . 
Assessment Sessions:  
Participants will complete the major life events assessment and a variety of 
assessments pertaining to executive function/memory. Similar to the 
screening/baseline session, these measures will all be administered via Zoom. 
Some of these tasks may only be administered in certain assessment sessions 
(e.g., the initial and/or final).  
The types of tasks participants may complete are:  
• Prospective memory tasks   
• A working memory task  
• An impulsive choice task  
Participants will also have their height/weight taken, and the research staff will 
obtain self -report and objective measures of medication adherence (e.g., 
information such as data from MEMS caps, pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], reasons for non -
adherence, and reasons for opening medication bottles).  
Intervention Sessions:  
During the Covid -[ADDRESS_10289] for 
EFT/IC activities, so as to reduce the total time the participant must be in the lab . 
 Page 21 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Participants assigned to EFT will be asked to generate epi[INVESTIGATOR_10708], similar to 
the tasks used in our previous studies on EFT’s effect (Danie l et al., 2013); unlike 
in prior studies, however, cues will be specific to instances of taking one’s 
medication  and/or positive events resulting from successful medication 
adherence.  The epi[INVESTIGATOR_10709] s while the 
participants are asked to describe the perceptual details of the medication -taking 
(e.g., taking medication at home on a ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_5707], or while out of town on 
vacation) or medication -outcome event  (feeling better and more energetic after 
medication, etc. ). Participants will be asked open -ended questions to prompt more 
detail (such as what they are seeing, hearing, smelling, fee ling), and to identify 
what successful adherence may look like if the initial event description does not 
go as planned (e.g., if you normally take your medication when you make coffee, 
what would successfully taking your medication look like on a day when you run 
out of time to make it?). Participants  may record their EFT events into audio cues, 
so that they can practice using EFT using different modalities at home.  
Participants assigned to IC will be asked to generate cues about newly -learned 
health inform ation. For this activity, the research staff will provide participants 
with a weekly learning module that will consist of presenting information on 
relevant health -related topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (e.g., information about diagnosed conditions that 
made them eligible for par ticipation), which may include brief quizzes, 
informational videos, and other learning -oriented activities that may help with 
information retention (e.g., playing a memory game incorporating information 
about glucose metabolism). Participants will be asked  to generate cues about the 
course content which may include imagining different ways the information could 
be useful, how it could be applied in different contexts, with different people, etc. 
As in EFT, participants will be asked open -ended questions as needed to prompt 
more details, and IC participants may also audio record their cues.  
Participants will be asked to rate their cues on different dimensions (e.g., 
vividness, usefulness, valence, salience), which will be used to calculate a 
richness score ( average of dimension ratings) .  
EFT participants may be provided the same information that IC participants are 
provided, to ensure both groups are equally knowledgeable on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]; this 
information may be provided in a different format for ease of use/r eference 
outside of the laboratory (e.g., on a study website, pamphlet, or booklet).  
Participants will be trained to use EFT/IC outside of the lab  using the ecological 
momentary intervention (EMI) computer based program that we have developed: 
the Mobile Audio Management and Response Tracker (MAMRT). This program, 
which is part of the study website, can be accessed by [CONTACT_10753], tablet or 
computer. This application stores participants’  EFT/IC cues, prompts their use  
(e.g., re minder text message, reminder email) , asks questions about use  of their 
cues, and records their use. Participants will be instructed to practice using 
EFT/IC daily. The MAMRT software was previously approved in 
STUDY00000936 , and appears in Sze,  Daniel, Ki lanowski, Collins, and Epstein, 
2015 . In addition to the above, the MAMRT website may also  be used to provide  
health  information  (i.e., that provided to the IC group),  and other activities such as 
 Page 22 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /[ADDRESS_10290] of guiding 
the participant through the use of their EFT/IC cues; calls will last about 15 mins, 
and will be scheduled with participant. Check -ins (practice and reminders) may 
occur both during the intervention weeks and during the study follow -up period 
prior to the final assessment. Participants may also receive reminder 
texts/email/or phone calls to use their EFT/IC cues.  
 
During CDC recommended travel restrictions due to flu, respi[INVESTIGATOR_10710], we are enacting preventative measu res to ensure both participants 
and employees limit exposure.  
(1)  Participants will be asked during reminder calls/emails/text 
messages/scheduling contacts questions regarding their health and their 
child’s health before in -person meetings.  This language can  be used in any 
contact [CONTACT_10754], in -person or phone, email, text, 
letter,etc  
Example of ..”With the current situation involving the flu, respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711],

date of incident (or the current CDC/health department time recommendations).  
If necessary, attempts will be made to administer study materials and measures 
remotely. Th is may include administering surveys that are already used in current 
study materials online, as well as conducting phone calls in lieu of face to face 
meetings as needed.  
In the event a participant/staff member tests positive for coronavirus, we will 
work  with Erie County Health department to provide any information they need; 
including names, address and phone numbers, of potential contacts as per the 
Health department policies. NYS law indicates that it is mandatory to provide this 
information in the cas e of an identified infectious disease:

For all session types above, the tasks and procedures may be completed in an 
order different from that outlined as feasibility and efficiency warrants.  
 
12.2 Describe what data will be collected.   
NOTE:  For studies with multiple data collection points or long -term follow up, 
consider the addition of  a schedule or table in your response.  
Response:  
Data co nsists of audio recordings of participants cues; recordings of the sessions, 
demographic measures;  delay discounting ; prospective, and working memory; 
substance use/consumption; pregnancy status;  medication adherence (pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], 
pharmacy refill records, MEMS -provided medication adherence, self -report 
measures);  and participants’ heights and weights recorded during the 
experimental session s, in addition to medical history and details about past 
medication use . 
 
12.[ADDRESS_10292] data 
(e.g. questionnaire, interview guide, validated instrument, data collection 
form).   
 
Include copi[INVESTIGATOR_10713].  
Response:  
Please see the attachment labeled, “Measures.docx”. Additional questionnaires 
may be added a later time via modification.  

 Page 24 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 Recordings : Intervention sessions will be recorded for to review EFT/IC fidelity 
and provide feedback to Interventionists/research staff.  
Demographics and Health Behavior : Race/ethnicity, household income, and 
educational level will be assessed using a survey -based questionnaire. Participants 
will also be asked about their health behavior, including substance use, mental 
health, and medical history . 
Medication Use and Adherence:  We will obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], reasons for non -
adherence, intent to take medication, and mot ivation to adhere to medications, as 
well as medication adherence data as recorded by [CONTACT_10756].  
Major Life Events : Individuals will be asked to complete the major life events 
questionnaire which measures major life events that may have been experienced 
during their involvement , or just prior to involvement  in the study. Individuals 
who are undergoing major life events such as a move, new baby [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a new job may 
influence their performance on study measures and tasks.  
Height, Weight, BMI : Participants’ height will be assessed using a digital 
stadiometer. Participants’ weight will be assessed using a digital scale. Based on 
the height and weight data, Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated according 
to the following for mula: BMI = kg/m2. These are the current standards set forth 
by [CONTACT_7698] (Kuczmarski et al., 2002).  
Cue Measures : Rating scales  assessing dimensions of the cues (e.g., vividness of 
imagining, or recalling the info, att entiveness to cues) and cue use (e.g., vividness, 
usefulness) will be administered at cue generation and when cues are accessed via 
our software program. Cues will be rated on numerical and/or ordinal scales; e.g., 
on a scale of  1 to 5, where 1 indicates “ not at all” and 5 indicates “very much”.   
Delay Discounting  (DD) : An operational definition of impulsivity is delay 
discounting, the degree to which a person will discount the value of a larger 
delayed reward in favor of a smaller immediate reward. Comput erized/ 
experimenter administered assessments will provide participants with choic es 
between a smaller amount of hypothetical money  available immediately or a 
larger amount of hypothetical money  available later.

o Those assigned to the EFT  (IC) group may be asked to visualize 
future events (health information) while completing the DD task.  
 
Memory tasks : Different types of memory processes may be involved in the 
intervention effects; these include  working memory, prospective memory, 
retrosp ective memory and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], which will be measured  using 
computerized tasks or paper /pencil  measures. The tasks we will use are the 
following:  
 Page 25 of 43 IRB Version: 5/6 /19 • The “Virtual Week” (Rendell et al., 2007; Rose et al., 2010) is a measure 
of Prospective Memory (PM) and Retrospective Memory (RM). The task 
is styled as a board game, with each round (movement across the board) 
representing one day. Throughout a single day, participants are instructed 
to complete different tasks either as different events occur (e.g., when 
someone comes to the door), at different times of day (e.g., when it is 
4:00pm), or after different durations of gameplay. The game begins with a 
training round, so that the participant learns what is expected through the 
task. While completing the training  round, the participant will be provided 
with any necessary instructions from the study personnel to help them 
complete the task correctly. After the training round, all participants will 
complete test rounds of the “Virtual Week.”  
o Those assigned to the E FT group may be asked to visualize 
completing the daily tasks prior to starting each round (e.g., close 
their eyes and imagine everything that would be involved with 
calling a fictional person in the game at a certain time).

will be used. Only the relevant research staff  and participant will  be present in the 
room during sessions . Data is recorded such that not even the person putting it in 
the file would ever be able to associate the data with the identity of the person 
providing it. Data and files that have been de -identified and encrypted will be 
shared between sites. Therefore, there is no reasonable risk of a breach of 
confidentiality.  
Should an emergency situation occur, access to further medical care is available 
via a telephone located in the laboratory and the following emergency pla n will be 
followed:  
1. Have the subject immediately stop any activity and lay down.  
2. Call for help! ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY (716 -645-2222) or POLICE (911).

Protocol Title: 
A Phase I Study of Cytosine Deaminase-Expressing Neural Stem Cells in Combination with 
Oral 5-Fluorocytosine and Leucovorin for Treatment of Recurrent High- Grade Gliomas  
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable): 
 A dose escalation study of oral 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC) and leucovorin in combination with neural 
stem cells that have been genetically -modified to carry a protein that converts the inactive prodrug, 
5-FC, to the chemotherapy agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), in patients with recurrent high grade 
gliomas.  
Study Phase: 
Phase I 
Participating Sites: 
City of Hope 
Rationale for this Study: 
High-grade gliomas are difficult to treat due to their relative resistance to chemotherapy and 
radiation, as well as their highly invasive nature. Human neural stem cells (NSCs), modified to 
express a therapeutic transgene, hold great promise for brain tumor therapy due to their inherent 
tumor -tropic properties and- potential use as vehicles for delivering chemotherapy directly to 
infiltrating glioma cells and metastatic tumor cel ls in the brain. NSCs have the potential to 
overcome obstacles of drug -delivery that limit current gene therapy strategies to provide an 
effective anti -tumor response.    
Data from animal models have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of NSCs for trackin g to 
invasive tumor cells as well as to distant micro -tumor foci and delivering therapeutic gene products 
to tumor cells. Our recently completed first-in-human pi[INVESTIGATOR_177348] (CD)-
expressing NSCs given in combination with oral 5 -fluorocytosine (5-FC) showed that one dose of 
NSCs followed by a 7 -day course of 5-FC in recurrent high-grade gliomas patients is safe and 
feasible. With intracerebral microdialysis, we documented proof -of-concept —that the NSCs 
convert the prodrug [ADDRESS_207873] exposure. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of iron -labeled NSCs showed preliminary evidence of NSCs migrating 
away from the  injection sites. 
For this phase I clinical trial, we will continue to escalate the dose of the NSCs and now administer 
repeat cycles of study treatment to patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Once dose escalation 
is completed, l eucovorin will be added to the 5-FC, since it is well established that leucovorin can 
potentiate the efficacy of 5 -FU. We hypothesize that repeat cycles of NSCs and 5- FC/leucovorin 
will be safe and well -tolerated. We will continue to monitor patients for development of immune 
reactivity against NSCs  and measure NSC conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU via intracerebral 
microdialysis at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or if the MTD is not met, at the maximum 
feasible dose (MFD), of study treatment.  
Objectives: 
Primary Objectives: 
1)  To define the phase II recommended dose of intracerebrally-administered CD- expressing NSCs 
in combination with oral 5 -FC and leucovorin. This will be based on the maximum- tolerated dose 
(MTD), or if the MTD is not met, the maximum feasible dose and toxicity profile in patients with 
recurrent high-grade gliomas.

Page 6 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 2)  To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs followed 
by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin. 
Secondary Objectives:  
1) To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti- NSC T cell and/or antibody 
responses) with repeat doses of NSCs. 
2) To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of 5- FC and 
5-FU at the MTD/MFD level. 
3) To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete 
response) of this treatment regimen. 
4) To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs. 
Study Design: 
 Based on the encouraging safety data from our first-in-human pi[INVESTIGATOR_158566] [ADDRESS_207874] “3 + 3” dose escalation schema will be used , and [ADDRESS_207875] 
dose of NSCs to be tested will be 1.5 x 108. The 5-FC will not be dose-es calated, but leucovorin, 
which potentiates the efficacy of 5 -FU, will be added after dose escalation of the NSCs is 
completed.  
Initially, the NSCs will be injected intracranially on cycle 1 day 1 when study patients undergo 
tumor resection or biopsy . Afterwards, there will be a waiting period of 3 days to allow time for the 
NSCs to distribute among foci of tumor. Patients will the n take a 7 day course of oral 5- FC (dose 
level 4 patients will also take leucovorin).  Repeat doses of NSCs will be administered through a 
Rickham catheter/reservoir system placed at the time of surgery. The length of a treatment cycle 
will be 28 days. NSC s will be given on days 1 and 15 followed by 5- FC and leucovorin (dose level 
4 patients) on days [ADDRESS_207876] part of cycle 1 to quantify NSC-
mediated conversion of 5 -FC to 5-FU at the MTD/MFD level. 
 
Endpoints: 
Safety and feasibility:   1) For dose escalation: dose limiting toxicities;  
2) Toxicity profile: all attributable toxicities.  
Immunogenicity: evaluate patient blood samples for the development of T cell responses and 
antibodies against the NSCs using TcR Vȕ spectratypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], CD 107 degranulation assays, and flow 
cytometry.  
Pharmacokinetics: the following pharmacokinetic variables will be assessed: Tmax, Cmax, AUC,

aIf a DLT is observed in 2 or more patients at dose level 1, then a de-escalation dose , dose 
level  -1 will be tested. With dose level -1, the doses of NSCs and 5-FC will both be 
reduced by 25%; however, if the DLT can clearly be attributed only to 5- FC, then only the 
dose of 5-FC will be reduced by 25% (likewise for the NSCs if the DLT is clearly 
attributable to only the NSCs) for dose level -1.  
bIf the addition of leucovorin to the highest tolerated dose combination of 5- FC and NSC 
requires a dose de- escalation, then leucovorin will be discontinued and the MTD/MFD will 
be the highest tolerated dose combination of 5- FC and NSCs without leucovorin. A total of 
6 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or if the MTD is not 
reached, at the maximum feasible dose (MFD).  
 Dose level 4 patients will undergo intracerebral microdialysis to measure NSC- mediated 
conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU.  
Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed: 
Blood draws for immunologic correlative studies: To assess for possible development of anti-
NSC T cell and antibody responses, as well as peripheral persistence of the NSCs, blood samples 
will be drawn: prior to the start of study treatment, on day 15 of cycle 1 (prior to the 2nd dose of 
NSCs) , days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, and then only on day 15 of subsequent cycles.  
Brain MRIs to assess response: At the end of cycle 1 and then  after every 2 cycles.  
Collection of dialysate and blood samples to determine the neuropharmacokinetics of 5 -FC 
and 5 -FU: Only in dose level 4 patients —see section 5.4. 
Collection of blood samples to perform RCR testing as part of long -term follow: Prior to 
surgery, at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter.  
 
Statistical Considerations: 
Tables will be created to summarize all toxicities and side effects by [CONTACT_2715], course, organ, severity 
(by [CONTACT_94979] 4.0) and attribution.  Rates and associated 90 % confidence limits will be 
estimated for the DLT rate at the MTD /MFD and the rate of clinical benefit . Descriptive statistics 
will be provided for study patient demographics.   
One secondary objective is to assess the conversion of 5 -FC to 5-FU by [CONTACT_177392] /MFD. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the patients who undergo intracerebral microdialysis 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics and graphical methods. The primary PK parameters

in the brain. Data from animal models have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of NSCs for tracking 
to invasive tumor cells as well as to distant micro-tumor foci and delivering therapeutic gene products to 
tumor cells. Our recently completed first-in-human pi[INVESTIGATOR_177348] (CD)-expressing 
NSCs given in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) has shown that treatment with one dose of NSCs followed by a 7-day course of 5-FC in recurrent high-grade glioma patients is safe and feasible.  
NSCs can overcome obstacles of drug-delivery that limit current gene therapy strategies and provide an 
effective anti-tumor response.  In this phase I clinical trial we will use the same v -myc -immortalized 
human NSC line (HB1.F3.), retrovirally transduced to express CD (HB1.F3.CD NSCs), (Aboody et al., 2000) as was used in our first-in-human pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This HB1.F3.CD NSC line has been well-characterized, favorably reviewed by [CONTACT_177393], and established as a Master Cell Bank at the COH 
Center for Biomedicine & Genetics.  
After intracranial administration to patients with recurrent brain tumors, we hypothesize that, based on 
pre-clinical data, CD-expressing NSCs will distribute throughout the primary tumor site as well as co-
localize with infiltrating tumor cells within 3 days of administration. Study patients will then take oral 5-FC and leucovorin for 7 days. The CD-expressing NSCs will locally convert 5-FC to 5-FU (Figure 1), 
and the 5-FU will diffuse out of the NSCs at tumor sites, thereby [CONTACT_177394]. This CD/5-FC prodrug strategy is known to have a large by[CONTACT_145152]. 
(Huber et al., 1994; Barresi et al., 2003).  
Based on the safety data obtained in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_177350]-grade 
gliomas who received only round of study treatment, in this phase I study we will assess the safety and 
feasibility of administering repeat doses of NSCs followed by 7-day course of 5-FC and leucovorin.

2.2 Obstacles to Successful Brain Tumor Therapy 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_177351], brain tumors remain a serious 
clinical challenge for oncologists. Approximately 22,500 people a year are diagnosed with a malignant 
primary brain tumor in the [LOCATION_002] (CBTRUS 2008). Gliomas account for the majority of these 
tumors and are virtually incurable. High-grade gliomas are difficult to treat due to their relative resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, as well as their highly invasive nature. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_177352], primary brain tumors, particularly high-grade 
gliomas, remain a serious clinical challenge for oncologists. A major obstacle to successful 
pharmacologic treatment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 
which prevents most anti-cancer agents from entering the brain. Another key reason for the lack of success in treating gliomas is their diffuse and highly infiltrative nature; no clear border exists between 
tumor and normal brain. Glioma cells disseminate from the primary site, forming micro-tumor foci 
throughout the brain the brain that often “hide behind”an intact BBB.  
The inability to deliver therapeutic agents to where they are needed likewise inhibits the effectiveness of gene therapy. Cell-mediated vector delivery is limited by [CONTACT_177395]. To make a 
significant impact on the survival of brain tumor patients, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177353], but they should also specifically target the invasive tumor cells 
that escape currently available treatments while minimizing toxicity to normal tissue. 
 
2.3 Human Neural Stem Cells 
Because NSCs (murine and human) demonstrate an inherent ability to distribute throughout a tumor 
mass and can target distant tumor foci, NSCs that are genetically modified to express a therapeutic 
transgene have the potential to overcome many of the obstacles facing current strategies for brain tumor 
therapy. Tumor-tropic human NSCs potentially offer a major therapeutic breakthrough for brain tumors, overcoming limitations of currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177354] a wide range of therapeutic agents directly to invasive tumor cells and distant tumor micro-foci 
throughout the brain.

Page 15 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  [ADDRESS_207884] demonstrated the ability of intracranially administered NSCs that express a 
therapeutic transgene, to significantly reduce tumor burden and/or increase long-term survival.  
Therapeutic agents delivered via NSCs include prodrug activating enzymes (Aboody et al., 2000, 2006; 
Brown et al., 2003; Danks et al., 2007;  Kim et al., 2006a) viral vectors (Herrlinger et al., 2000; Tyler et 
al., 2009), apoptotic agents (Kim et al., 2005a; Shah et al., 2005), anti-angiogenic agents (Kim et al., 
2005b), monoclonal antibodies (Frank et al., 2009), interleukins (Benedetti  et al., 2000; Ehtesham et al., 2002; Yuan et al., 2006), and IFN- ȕ (Dickson et al., 2007). 
HB1.F3 NSCs were generated from human fetal telencephalon, retrovirally immortalized with the v -myc 
oncogene, cloned and extensively characterized over time and passage for tumor tropi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], genetic 
stability and non-tumorigenicity. (Kim et al., 2002, 2004, 2005a; Jeong et al., 2003; Ryu et al., 2003; 
Schmidt et al., 2005). Both parental HB1.F3 NSCs and HB1.F3 NSCs modified to express therapeutic transgenes (Aboody et al., 2000) have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical models of glioma (Aboody 
et al., 2013), breast cancer brain metastases (Joo et al., 2009), medulloblastoma (Kim et al., 2006a; 
Gutova et al., 2012), and metastatic neuroblastoma (Aboody et al., 2006a; Danks et al., 2007).  In 
addition to being used as a vehicle to target therapeutic agents to invasive tumors, this parental HB1.F3 
line has also been modified to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in models of Parkinson’s disease (Kim et al., 2004, 2006b; Ryu et al., 2005) Huntington’s disease (Kim et al., 2004, 2007; Ryu et  al., 2004; Lee 
et al., 2007), cerebral ischemia (Chu et al., 2003, 2004 ; Lee et al., 2007a, 2007b) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] 
(Kim et al., 2007). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_207885] to demonstrate the tumor tropic properties of NSCs with a 
v-myc –immortalized, clonal murine NSC line (C17.2).  When injected either directly into orthotopic 
experimental glioma or at a distance (contralateral hemisphere, contralateral ventricle, or intravasculary via the tail vein), C17.[ADDRESS_207886] been confirmed for multiple NSC lines and primary pools in many laboratories (reviewed in Aboody et al., 
2008). 
NSCs can migrate to tumor sites regardless of tumor size, anatomic location, or tissue of origin 
(reviewed by [CONTACT_177396]., 2008). When administered intracranially or intravenously in pre-clinical 
brain tumor models, NSCs migrate to orthotopic gliomas (Aboody et al., 2000; Herrlinger et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2003;Kim et al., 2005a; Zhao et al., 2008; Ahmed et al., 2011; Thaci et al., 2012), breast 
cancer brain metastases (Joo 2009), medulloblastoma (Kim et al., 2006a; Shimato et al., 2007, Gutova et 
al, 2012), and melanoma brain metastases (Aboody et al., 2006a). Migration of HB1.F3.CD NSCs is not 
affected by [CONTACT_177397] (Aboody et al., manuscript 
submitted and under revision with Science Translational Medicine). The ability of NSCs to efficiently 
cross the BBB provides an attractive advantage in treating CNS tumors.   
Transduction with retrovirus, lentivirus, or adenovirus does not affect their migratory potential, as 
similarly assessed (Najbauer et al., 2008; Aboody et  al., 2008; Kendall et al., 2008). Studies with 
HB1.F3 cells that were adenovirally-transduced with a transgene to express rabbit 
carboxylesterase(rCE), (HB1.F3.C1) showed that NSCs localized to neuroblastoma metastases in the liver, lung, ovaries and bone marrow. NSCs were rarely found in non-tumor-bearing tissues (lung, liver, 
and spleen) at 3-[ADDRESS_207887]- tail vein injection, and none were detectable in non-tumor-bearing brain, 
kidney, heart, intestine, or skin (Aboody, et al., 2006c)

therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177355] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]-Overzet et al., 2007). All of our studies 
have included tissue assessment for potential NSC-induced tumors.  To date, NSCs have not initiated 
tumors in any of the normal control or tumor model animals, when followed up to [ADDRESS_207889] reported no 
HB1.F3 tumorigenicity, even up to one year following NSC administration (Kim et al., 2004, 2005a, 
2005b, 2006a; 2006b, 2007; Lee et al., 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Yasuhara et al., 2006; Danks et al., 2007). 
2.4.3  NSC immunogenicity data 
Aboody and colleagues (Aboody et al., 2013) investigated whether HB1.F3.CD NSCs induce an 
immune response from the host, resulting in possible rejection of the NSCs.  In an immunocompetent, 
syngeneic orthotopic glioma model (Gl261 glioma in C57BL/6 mice), although HB1.F3.CD NSCs do elicit a subacute, localized immune response characterized by [CONTACT_177398] T-cell infiltration (similar to 
the reaction generated by [CONTACT_177399]), viable HB1.F3.CD NSCs persisted for at 
least [ADDRESS_207890] 2–3 weeks after 
administration, during which time a round of NSCs and a 7 days course of 5-FC/leucovorin will be 
completed. When NSCs are used as delivery vehicles, they do not need to engraft. They need only 
survive long enough to mediate the effective therapy. Therefore, although the NSCs may be rejected 
over time, this would not likely happen before finishing a treatment sequence of 5-FC/leucovorin. 
HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_177356]1.F3 cells found that while these NSCs doexpress HLA class I antigens 
(A*01, A*31, B*07, B*15, C*07), they do not express their HLA class II antigens (DRB1*10, 
DRB1*13, DQB1*05, DQB1*06, DPB1*02, DPB1*15).. In the presence of tumor, the NSCs do not 
appear to differentiate, and therefore, they would not express HLA class II antigens. However, other 
investigators (Kim et al., 2009) have reported low expression levels of HLA Class II antigens by 
[CONTACT_177400]1.F3 cells. To be cautious, we will exclude potential study patients who hve antibodies to any of the 
NSC HLA class I or II antigens listed above. Whether or not the clinical utility of these NSCs will be 
limited by [CONTACT_177401]  (and will be studied in this phase I clinical trial), but preclinical data indicate that the 
immunogenicity of the HB1.F3.CD NSC line is not prohibitive. 
2.4.4 Iron particle cellular MRI for real-time assessment of NSCs biodistribution 
Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) preparations can enable non-invasive, real-time 
tracking of NSCs by [CONTACT_9268]. In previous studies, we demonstrated the effectiveness of MRI to track NSCs labeled with a clinical grade SPIO, ferumoxide (Feridex®) in orthotopic glioma-bearing mice (Thu et 
al., 2009). Safe use of SPIO MRI contrast agents in patients has been demonstrated for central nervous 
system tumor visualization and diagnostic MRI purposes (Neuwalt et al., 2007). We have now 
developed a cell labeling technique that can be safely and effectively used in the clinical setting for MRI 
tracking of NSCs in the brain. Specifically, we modified a previously developed protocol (Thu et al., 
2012) for cell labeling with a clinical grade USPIO, ferumoxytol (Feraheme® ), to optimize labeling of 
the HB1.F3.CD NSCs. We have demonstrated in orthotopic glioma xenograft mouse models that 
Feraheme-labeled HB1.F3.CD NSCs that also expressed carboxylesterase (HB1.F3.CD.hCE NSCs or 
Fehe-NSCs) can be detected in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 7 Tesla mouse imaging voxel as a hypointense signal (black) 
following intracranial (i.c.) administration (Fig. 2A-D). (Note that HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.hCE 
NSCs are equivalent in terms of viability, proliferation, and migration in vitro and in vivo ). Note that the 
Fehe-NSCs (blue) distributed within tumor (dark pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]) and at invasive tumor edges and foci (Fig. 2E-H), corresponding with hypointense signal by [CONTACT_9268]. Tumor cells confirmed by [CONTACT_177402]-DAB

Three days later, varying numbers of Fehe-NSCs (1 × 104, 5 × 104, 1 × 105, 2 × 105), were injected ipsilaterally, 
caudal-lateral to the tumor. ( A-D): T2-weighted MR images of mouse brains were obtained 4 days after NSC 
administration. Red arrows indicate hypointense (black) signal associated with Fehe-NSCs. Boxed areas are

The iron-labeled cells do not exhibit significant changes in viability, proliferation, and migratory 
properties, or transgene expression compared to non-labeled cells (Gutova et al, Stem Cells Transl Med, 
in press, 2013). Preclinical safety/toxicity studies in mice using intracranially injected Feraheme-labeled HB1.F3.CD NSCs, demonstrated no clinical adverse effects, and histopathologic analysis revealed no 
evidence of neurotoxicity or toxicity to other organs (Gutova et al, Stem Cells Transl Med, in press, 
2013).  
2.4.5 Efficacy of NSC-mediated therapy in glioma preclinical models 
Both parental HB1.F3 NSCs and HB1.F3 NSCs modified to express the therapeutic transgenes, CD 
and/or rCE, have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical models of glioma (Aboody et al., 2000 and 
unpublished data), medulloblastoma (Kim et al., 2006a; Gutova, et al., 2012) and metastatic 
neuroblastoma (Aboody et al, 2006c; Danks et al., 2007).

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 The IND-enabling efficacy study of HB1.F3.CD NSCs and 5-FC (Aboody et al., manuscript submitted 
and under revision with Science Translational Medicine) was performed using the Master Cell Bank 
HB1.F3.CD line, and the NSCs were prepared for administration according to the clinical SOP. Ninety-
six nude mice with orthotopic U251 glioma were treated with 1 cycle of either CD-expressing NSCs (3 
escalating doses, groups 1-3) and 5-FC; CD-expressing NSCs alone (3 escalating doses, groups 4-6); 5-
FC alone (group 7) or no treatment (group 8). At the first planned time point of day 30, 32 mice (4 from 
each group) were sacrificed for analysis. Tumor volumes were measurable in [ADDRESS_207891] was seen at the day 30 time-point with tumor volumes ~3-
fold smaller in mice who received HB1.F3.CD NSCs and 5-FC treatment (groups 1-3) compared to

days later by a 7-day course of 5-FC (500 mg/kg i.p. BID).  Animals receiving combination of HB1.F3.CD 
NSCs + 5-FC therapy had 3-fold less tumor volume compared to control animals (Groups 4-6, NSCs only;

(Table 1).

 2.5.1 Safety data 
A total of 18 patients were consented for the study. Three of these patients were determined to be 
ineligible prior to the start of study treatment due to testing positive for an antibody to one of the NSC HLA antigens, which was one of the study’s exclusion criteria. Of the 15 patients who received study 
treatment, 3 had to be replaced due to being inevaluable for toxicity: [ADDRESS_207894]-in-human study the FDA would only allow patients to be treated with one round of NSCs 
and 5-FC, thus clinical benefit was not a primary or secondary objective of the study. The starting dose 
of NSCs was approximately 60% lower than the human equivalent of the lowest dose tested in 
safety/efficacy studies in mice. Although in most study patients, tumor growth was seen on the one month follow-up MRI, [ADDRESS_207895] evidence of progressive disease until 5 
months after tumor resection and start of study treatment. He was followed with serial brain MRIs and 
did not start another chemotherapy regimen until after the MRI at 5 months documented tumor 
recurrence.  
2.5.2 Establishing proof-of-concept 
Using the technique of intracerebral microdialysis (please see section 2.8 for details of this technique), 
we demonstrated proof-of-concept —that the CD-expressing NSCs are converting 5-FC to 5-FU in the 
brain—by [CONTACT_177404] 5-FC and 5-FU and comparing them to concentrations in 
plasma). Intracerebral microdialysis data from all 3 dose levels (Figure 4) document that the NSCs are 
converting 5-FC to 5-FU in the brain. At the highest dose level of NSCs, the average steady-state concentrations of 5-FU in the brain was 63.9±7.9 nM. The average maximum 5-FU level in brain was 
104±88 nM compared to 24±36 nM in plasma, indicating local production of 5-FU in the brain by [CONTACT_177405].

Figure 4.  5-FC and 5-FU Intracerebral Microdialysis data. 
 
Analysis of the plasma samples revealed 5-FC concentrations similar to previously reported values in 
patients taking 5-FC to treat infections. Brain interstitial 5-FC levels were approximately 20-30% of plasma levels. Plasma 5-FU was detectable in roughly one third of patients studied, but plasma levels 
were always well below the brain interstitial 5-FU concentrations in these patients. We conclude that 5-
FU is produced by [CONTACT_177406] a subset of patients taking 5-FC; however, the resulting 
systemic levels of 5-FU cannot explain the levels measured in the brain. Therefore, most, if not all, of 
the 5-FU measured in brain interstitium must be coming from local production by [CONTACT_8671]-transduced neural stem cells. Figure 5 shows documentation that the NSCs continued to convert 5-FC to 5-FU 
during the entire 5-FC dosing interval.

convert 5-FC to 5-FU in the brain throughout the 7-day course of oral 5-FC. In this particular patient there 
were no detectable levels of 5-FU in the plasma, indicating that all of the 5-FU measured in the brain came from 
NSC conversion of 5-FC.  1101001000100001000001000000

[CONTACT_177411] (SWI) sequences (Figure 8, panel A) for visualizing the 
ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) in the NSCs. In order to facilitate anatomical

Early changes (i.e., from post-operative days 1 to 10) would likely be too soon to be explained by 
[CONTACT_177412] (Muldoon et al., 2005). Preliminary post-processing analysis of imaging data 
from 2 of the 3 patients who received Feraheme-labeled NSCs shows a 20-30% decrease in the volume 
of NSCs at the injection sites between days [ADDRESS_207904] from injection sites. Blue arrow indicates air bubble 
resolving over time.  
No toxicity from the Feraheme-labeled NSCs has been observed in the 3 study patients. In this next 
clinical trial of CD-expressing NSCs in combination with 5-FC/leucovorin, we will refine our MRI 
protocol and optimize post-processing methods to improve our ability to visualize and quantify the 
Feraheme-labeled NSCs on MRI in order to non-invasively assess NSC migration.

treated with resection, radiation and chemotherapy. She then developed recurrent tumor in her right 
frontal lobe more than 10 years later. She died 44 days after tumor resection and start of study treatment. 
She received a total of 10 million NSCs divided into 10 injections (1 million cells/100 ul per injection)

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 Nested PCR for v- myc to identify the presence or absence of NSCs was performed on 38 cassettes 
containing brain tissue from all regions of the brain. Five tissue block samples were positive for v- myc. 
Results showed no evidence of NSCs in the immediate proximity of the resection cavity. The v- myc 
positive areas were distant from the primary injection site and included tissue with scattered infiltrating 
tumor cells (right frontal parietal lateral and right posterior basal ganglia) and tissue devoid of obvious 
tumor cells, displaying moderate to marked anoxic ischemic changes (left parietal lateral, left parietal 
medial and right temporal posterior).  
The second autopsy patient was a man who died 79 days after biopsy of tumor in the right parietal lobe 
and start of study treatment. He received 10 million NSCs in 1 ml, administered into the biopsy site.  
Detection of NSCs by [CONTACT_145161] v- myc was positive in three tissue block samples, 2 of which were 
located in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere (left frontal lobe/corpus callosum and left occipi[INVESTIGATOR_177360]). Microscopic evaluation showed diffuse tumor in each of these blocks. 
Since the NSCs were derived from female fetal tissue, XY FISH analysis was performed on [ADDRESS_207906] cells (Figure 9). These data support the conclusion that NSCs migrated away from the injection site 
to distant tumor foci.  
Staining was then done for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cell division marker.  To 
determine the genotype of PCNA-positive cells in these tissue blocks, PCNA cells were mapped and 
sequential FISH was performed with XY probes. The slides were then scanned on a BioView Duet 
Image Analyzer to capture immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, and PCNA-positive cells were 
selected/mapped for targeted FISH analysis. FISH slides were realigned with IHC brightfield images and comparison images were acquired. One hundred PCNA-positive cells were classified for each 
block, and all cells were male. There was no evidence of actively dividing female cells in any of the 
tissue analyzed.  These data support the conclusion that the identified remaining NSCs were not 
dividing and creating secondary tumors.

Aspergillus  species (Vermes et al., 2000a, 2000b).  5-FC is also an inactive prodrug that gets converted 
to 5-FU by [CONTACT_177413].  Systemic toxicity from 
5-FU is mini mized because the host’s cells do not convert significant amounts of 5 -FC to 5-FU.  5-FC is 
a small molecule that is not highly protein-bound, and there are data showing that it penetrates well into cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), with CSF levels reaching approximately 80% of serum levels (American 
Medical Association, 1986). Major side effects of 5-FC include bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity, but it is generally well-tolerated in patients who have normal renal function. In this 
study, 5-FC will be administered at a dose of 37.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 7 days following each dose 
of NSCs (i.e. on days 4-10 and 18-24 of every 28 day cycle). This dose is at the high end of  range of 
standard daily dosing when 5-FC is used to treat fungal infections, and this dose was well-tolerated by 
[CONTACT_177414]-expressing NSCs and oral 5-FC.   
2.6.[ADDRESS_207908] a variety of solid tumors, including gastrointestinal (GI) cancers and breast cancer. 
In contrast to 5-FC, 5-FU does not efficiently cross the BBB. Results of two phase II studies of 5-FU in 
patients with recurrent primary brain tumors showed 5-FU had only minimal activity in this setting 
(Stewart et al., 1995; Cascino et al., 1996).  Combining data from these studies, among the 44 recurrent 
glioma patients who were treated with 5-FU and leucovorin, there were only 4 responses. However, in 
vitro  cytotoxicity studies showed that glioma cells are as sensitive to 5-FU as GI tumor cells (Miller et 
al., 2002), with IC 50’s in the micromolar range, which is considered the general threshold for 5 -FU 
cytotoxicity. Thus, the lack of efficacy seen in the brain tumor clinical trials of 5-FU is likely due to the 
limited ability of systemically-administered 5-FU to cross BBB and achieve therapeutic levels in the 
brain rather than an inherent resistance of gliomas to 5-FU.  
A randomized phase II study of 95 patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade gliomas who were treated 
with locally-delivered 5-FU-releasing microspheres plus radiation versus radiation alone, found an 
overall survival of 15.2 months in the 5-FU-releasing microspheres plus radiation arm compared with 
13.5 months in the control arm of RT alone (Menei et al., 2005).  This trend toward improvement in 
survival with the addition of the locally-delivered 5-FU-releasing microspheres was not statistically 
significant; however, the study was neither designed nor sufficiently powered to demonstrate a survival 
difference between the treatment groups.  One issue raised by [CONTACT_177415] 5-FU may be more effective against brain tumors than systemic administration, and mechanisms for local delivery of 5-FU, e.g., via microspheres, implantable polymers, or NSCs, should 
be investigated further. 
The NSC delivery approach that will be studied in this protocol has the advantage of tumor localization, 
potentially reaching tumor cells that have infiltrated beyond the immediate vicinity of the resection 
cavity.  Following 5-FC administration, HB1.F3.CD NSCs are expected to release 5-FU within close 
proximity to tumor cells, resulting in a localized concentration of 5-FU that could potentially be higher 
than that achieved by [CONTACT_177416] 5-FU from microspheres. 
2.6.3 Leucovorin (folinic acid) 
Leucovorin is a reduced folic acid. It is used in combination with 5-FU in the treatment of cancers of the 
GI tract because it enhances the effects of 5-FU (Advanced Colorectal Cancer Meta-Analysis Project, 1992) by [CONTACT_177417] 5- FU’s metabolite (fluorodeoxyuridylic acid) to thymidylate 
synthase, an enzyme important in DNA repair and replication. Leucovorin readily crosses the blood-CSF barrier (Thyss et al., 1989) and also is used for management of cerebral folate deficiency. There are 
data in the GI cancer literature showing that the combination of the oral 5-FU prodrug uracil-tegafur and 
oral leucovorin, given in a dose of 75-90 mg/day or in divided doses, is at least as effective as infusional 5-FU/leucovorin (Lembersky et al., 2006). For this phase I clinical trial, oral leucovorin will be given

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 along with the 5-FC. Since oral absorption of leucovorin is saturable at doses above 25 mg, study 
patients will take divided doses of leucovorin: 25 mg every 6 hours with 5-FC for 7 days following each 
dose of NSCs (i.e. on days 4-10 and 18-24 of every 28 day cycle).   
2.7 Use of a Rickham Reservoir/Catheter System for Repeat Intracranial Administration of NSCs 
In this next study we will administer repeat infusions of NSCs every 2 weeks using an indwelling 
Rickham reservoir/catheter system (a Rickham). The catheter will be inserted into the tumor mass at the 
time of tumor resection or biopsy and connected proximally to a 6 mm diameter reservoir (6 mm diameter).  
The Brain Tumor Program at City of Hope has significant experience with this delivery system. In a 
recently completed immunotherapy study of genetically-modified T cells, we successfully infused 
repeat intracranial doses of these T cells during a 2 week period via a Rickham placed within tumor 
tissue (Badie, unpublished data).  
In order to determine whether it would be feasible to use a Rickham to deliver repeat doses of NSCs 
intracranially, an experiment was performed to assess the viability and binding of the HB1.F3.CD NSCs 
when administered through a Rickham: 9.55 x 10
7 NSCs were suspended in 1.94 ml of artificial CSF (to 
achieve a concentration equivalent to the highest dose of NSCs that will be administered in the phase I 
study: 1.5 x 108/2.25 mL). The NSCs were then administered at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/hour through 
extension tubing attached to a Gripper Plus needle that was inserted into the reservoir of a Rickham 
system and collected over 4 hours followed by a 1 mL flush of artificial CSF over 2 hours. 
Table 2 shows that there was no loss of NSCs from binding to tubing, and the viability of the NSCs 
remained constant over 6 hours of delivery. This experiment demonstrated that our planned system for 
delivering repeat doses of NSCs intracranially works well, resulting in 100% recovery of the NSCs through the Rickham after flushing, and that NSC viability does not decrease for at least 6 hours after 
thawing and administering through a Rickham.

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 2.8 Intracerebral Microdialysis for Performing a Pharmacodynamic Assessment by [CONTACT_177418]-
Mediated Conversion of 5-FU and 5-FC in the Brain 
Microdialysis is a technique for continuously analyzing the concentration of a drug or biomolecule in 
the extracellular fluid (ECF) of body tissues, without significantly disturbing tissue function. This 
technique, first developed in the 1970s, consists of implanting into a body tissue a catheter that contains 
a semi-permeable membrane at its tip. The dialysis membrane acts as an artificial capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], so that when 
perfusion fluid is slowly, continuously pumped through the microdialysis catheter, diffusion of molecules occurs down their concentration gradients as the ECF equilibrates with the perfusion fluid. 
The dialysate, i.e. solution that exits the probe, is then collected at regular intervals for analysis. The 
dialysate will contain a representative proportion of the molecule or drug that is in the ECF. The 
concentration of drug in the dialysate is not the true concentration in the tissue because full equilibration 
does not take place across the dialysis membrane when the flow of perfusion fluid is constant. However, the fraction of drug that is recovered in the dialysate is an indirect measurement of the free drug 
concentration in the interstitium.  
Microdialysis has mainly been applied clinically to the study of head trauma (Goodman et al. 1999; 
Vespa et al., 2003,2005, 2006) subarachnoid hemorrhage (Staub et al., 2000; Sarrafzadeh et al., 2002; 
Kett-White et al., 2003) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (During et al., 1993; Lindberger et al., 2002; Scheyer et al., 1994). In these settings, intracerebral microdialysis catheters are used to monitor metabolic changes (for 
example, varying levels of lactate, glucose, and glutamic acid) in order to detect possible complications 
and to evaluate the effects of a therapeutic intervention. Intracerebral microdialysis is also a suitable 
method for measuring levels of chemotherapy in the brain (De Lange et al., 2000; Blakeley and 
Portnow, 2010) because microdialysis catheters can serially sample free drug concentrations in the peritumoral cerebral cortex or within the brain tumor itself (Bergenheim et al., 2005; Blakeley et al., 
2009). 
The Brain Tumor Program at City of Hope has developed expertise in performing intracerebral 
microdialysis. Having now placed microdialysis catheters in nearly 40 patients with brain tumors 
(Portnow et al., 2009, 2010, 2013a, 2013b), we have the largest experience in the [LOCATION_002] with the 
applying this technique to perform neuropharmacokinetic and neuropharmacodynamic assessments of 
chemotherapy agents. 
Unique and compelling data about new anticancer drugs can be obtained in vivo  from patients with brain 
tumors using intracerebral microdialysis. Unlike studies in which the tumor is removed in order to 
measure intratumoral drug concentrations at one time point, intracerebral microdialysis can not only 
determine the time course of changes in drug concentrations in the brain; since tumor is left in place, it 
also allows observation of the clinical outcomes associated with the drug concentrations measured in 
vivo.  
2.8.1 Intracerebral microdialysis catheters  
 The 70 Brain MD Catheter (M Dialysis, Solna, Sweden) has a semi-permeable membrane with a 
molecular weight cut-off of 20,000 daltons, and has received 510(k) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration as a Cerebral Tissue Monitoring System for adjunct use in monitoring brain trauma 
patients at risk for ischemia. This microdialysis catheter is smaller in caliber than the catheters that are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_177362]. With the use of 
image guidance, the catheter can be safely and accurately placed in brain interstitium. Stereotactic 
placement of intracerebral microdialysis catheters has been shown to be a safe procedure, with bleeding 
and infectious complication rates similar to those seen with stereotactic biopsy, craniotomy, and other types of intracerebral monitoring (Benjamin et al., 2004).  In a study of intracerebral microdialysis 
catheter use in neurointensive care patients (Poca et al., 2006), 4 of 97 patients (3%) were found to have 
a small ( 1mL) collection of bl ood around the catheter on follow-up CT scans. None of these bleeds 
were clinically significant, and no catheter-related infections were reported.  
 Each catheter has a gold tip that makes it visible on CT scan. Thus, confirmation of correct   of the 
catheters can readily be obtained with a non-contrast CT scan of the brain. These catheters have safely

are awake and mobile. 
2.8.2  In Vitro Microdialysis Recovery Data for 5-FU and 5-FC   
 Prior to performing intracerebral microdialysis in study patients, in vitro  studies were done to 
estimate the fractional recovery of 5-FU and 5-FC at a given flow rate.  Slower perfusion rates 
produce a higher fractional recovery (i.e. a concentration of drug in the dialysate that is close to the 
true interstitial drug concentration), but a longer sample collection interval is needed.  The in vitro  
assessments were performed with the same microdialysis equipment that will be used in this clinical 
trial. A 70 Brain MD Catheter was placed into a reservoir containing a solution with a known 
concentration 5-FU and 5-FC.  The inlet tubing of the catheter was attached to a syringe containing 
artificial CSF, and the syringe was placed in a variable flow rate pump (107 MD Pump). Artificial 
CSF perfused through the microdialysis catheter at different flow rates (0.5 – 5  l/min) and serial 
samples of dialysate were collected. We also performed an experiment to determine how much 5-
FU and 5-FC bind to the tubing of the microdialysis equipment.  A solution of known 
concentrations of 5-FU and 5-FC perfused a 70 Brain MD Catheter, while it sat in a reservoir 
containing a solution of the same concentrations of 5-FU and 5-FC. 
 The City of Hope Analytical Pharmacology Core Facility (APCF) developed a quantitative assay for 
5-FU and 5-FC, and the concentration of these drugs in the dialysate samples were determined by 
[CONTACT_60628]/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). At a flow rate of 1 Pl/min, the 
fractional recoveries of 5-FC and 5-FU were 92 r.2.1% and 91 r 1.5%, respectively.  Binding of 
either drug to the catheter tubing was negligible (< 5%). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_207909] 
“3 + 3” dose escalation schema will be  used, and [ADDRESS_207910] dose of NSCs to be tested 
will be 1.5 x 108. The 5-FC will not be dose-escalated, but leucovorin, which potentiates the efficacy of 
5-FU, will be added after dose escalation of the NSCs is completed. 
Initially, the NSCs will be injected intracranially on cycle 1, day 1 when study patients undergo tumor 
resection or biopsy. Afterwards, there will be a waiting period of 3 days to allow time for the NSCs to 
distribute among foci of tumor.  Patients will then take a 7 day course of oral 5-FC (dose level 4 patients 
will also take leucovorin). Repeat doses of NSCs will be administered through a Rickham placed at the time of surgery. The length of a treatment cycle will be 28 days. NSCs will be given on days 1 and 15 
followed by 5-FC and leucovorin (dose level 4 patients) on days 4-10 and 18-24. Brain MRIs will be 
performed at the end of every even cycle of study treatment to evaluate response.  
Immunologic correlative studies will be performed to assess for the possible development of NSC 
immunogenicity after repeat exposure to the allogeneic NSCs, and we will measure conversion of 5-FC to 5-FU by [CONTACT_177419]. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination therapy is 
predictedor, if the MTD is not met, the maximum feasible dose (MFD), patients in this cohort will 
undergo intracerebral microdialysis during the first part of cycle 1 to quantify NSC-mediated conversion 
of 5-FC to 5-FU at the MTD/MFD level.

5.2.2  Cycle 1 Day 1:  Intracerebral administration of NSCs during surgery 
All study patients must have confirmation of recurrent tumor documented on frozen section at the time 
of surgery before proceeding with direct intracerebral injection of the NSCs.  
 
The maximum concentration of NSCs is 6.7 x 107/ml (or 1 x 108/1.5 ml).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who undergo a craniotomy for tumor removal:  
When the study neurosurgeon has finished resecting tumor, he will directly inject CD-
expressing NSCs into the brain tissue of the resection cavity.  
Dose level -1 (if a decision is made to dose reduce the NSCs): 3.75 x 107 NSC will be 
suspended in 0.6 ml of 2% human serum albumin (HSA)/artificial CSF (Perfusion Fluid CNS; 
ref no. P000151, M Dialysis, Solna, Sweden).  
 Dose level 1 :  5 x 107 NSCs will be suspended in 0.75 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF.  
Dose level 2 : 1 x 108 NSCs will be suspended in 1.5 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF. 
Dose level 3 : 1.5 x 108 NSCs will be suspended in 2.25 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF. 
Dose level 4: As per dose level 3.  
The  total dose of NSCs will be injected  in divided 100-150 l volumes, as evenly spaced as 
possible, throughout the wall of the resection cavity; administering them only into areas that are 
surgically safe and feasible. The NSCs will be injected 2.5 cm deep and tracked up to 
approximately 1 cm deep, (slowly injecting as the needle is withdrawn, so as to distribute the 
NSCs from 2.5 cm – 1 cm depth).  
After the NSCs have been administered, a 9.5 mm Rickham reservoir attached to an open-
ended catheter (a Rickham) will be placed  in residual tumor tissue or peritumoral tissue to 
deliver subsequent doses of NSCs. 
A post-operative MRI of the brain will be done on day 2 to serve as a baseline scan with which 
to compare subsequent MRIs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients who undergo a stereotactic brain biopsy:  
After performing the tumor biopsy, the study neurosurgeon will place a Rickham into brain 
tissue through the biopsy track. 
Dose level -1 (if a decision is made to dose reduce the NSCs) :  3.75 x 107 NSCs in 0.6 ml of 
2% HSA/artificial CSF will be manually injected in the operating room over 10 minutes through 
the Rickham, followed by a 0.3 ml artificial CSF flush.  
Dose level 1 :  5 x 107 NSCs in 0.75 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF will be manually injected in 
the operating room over 10 minutes through the Rickham, followed by a 0.3 mL artificial CSF 
flush.  
Dose level 2 : 1 x 108 NSCs will be administered as follows: 5 x 107 NSCs in 0.75 mL of 2% 
HSA/artificial CSF will be manually injected in the operating room over 10 minutes through the 
Rickham, followed by a 0.3 mL artificial CSF flush. After the patient is out of Recovery and in 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], the remainder of the dose, 5 x 107 NSCs in 0.75 ml 2% HSA/artificial CSF,

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 will be administered via the Rickham followed by a 1 ml flush of artificial CSF. The rate of the 
infusion will be 0.5 ml/hr, and the total length of time for infusing the NSCs and the flush will 
be approximately 2 hours. 
Dose level 3 1.5 x 108 NSCs will be administered as follows: 6.7 x 107 NSCs in 1 ml of 2% 
HSA/artificial CSF will be manually injected in the operating room over 10 minutes through the 
Rickham, followed by a 0.3 ml artificial CSF flush.  
After the patient is out of Recovery and in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], the remainder of the dose, 8.3 x 107 
NSCs in 1.25 mL of 2% HSA/artificial CSF, will be administered through the Rickham 
followed by a 1 ml flush of artificial CSF. The rate of the infusion will be 0.5 ml/hr, and the 
total length of time for infusing the NSCs and the flush will be approximately 3 hours. 
Dose level 4: As per dose level 3.  
A non-contrast CT scan of the brain will be performed after surgery. Patients will have a brain 
MRI performed on post-operative day 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Perioperative prophylaxis 
Prophylactic anti-convulsants will be administered to study patients. Those who have never had 
a seizure will continue taking anti-seizure medication for at least [ADDRESS_207922] of care for the surgical procedure.  
5.2.3 Cycle 1 Day 2: MRI 
All patients will undergo an MRI on day 2 (the day after surgery).  This MRI will serve as the 
baseline MRI.   
 
5.2.4 Cycle 1 Days 4-10: Administration of 5-FC (and leucovorin for dose level 4 patients) 
If the patient has recovered well from any immediate post-operative effects, is tolerating oral 
intake, and  requiring less than 16 mg/day of dexamethasone by [CONTACT_4475] 4, then s/he will take oral 
5-FC, 37.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (dose level 4 and expansion cohort patients will also take oral 
leucovorin, 25 mg every 6 hours) on days 4-10.  
The patient will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_177363] 7-day course of 5-FC (and leucovorin if on dose level 4) as an outpatient. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti-emetic medication 
 If nausea develops, prochorperazine 10 mg p.o. every 6 hours (or a similar strength anti-emetic) 
will be used as needed.  
5.2.5 Cycle 1 Day 15: Intracerebral administration of NSCs via the Rickham 
Please see section 6.[ADDRESS_207923] meet in order to proceed with a second 
dose of NSCs on day 15.  
The NSCs will be administered in the outpatient setting through the Rickham at a rate of 0.5 
ml/hr.  
The maximum concentration of NSCs is 6.7 x 107/ml (or 1 x 108/1.5 ml). 
Dose level -1 (if a decision is made to dose reduce the NSCs):   3.75 x 107 NSCs will be 
suspended in 0.6 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF, and the infusion tubing will be primed with the 
NSC suspension before beginning infusion of the NSCs. A 1 ml artificial CSF flush will follow

over 3 hours. 
Dose level 1:   5 x 107 NSCs will be suspended in 0.75 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF, and the 
infusion tubing will be primed with the NSC suspension before beginning infusionof the NSCs. 
A 1 ml artificial CSF flush will follow the infusion of NSCs. The total length of time for 
infusing the NSCs and flush will be approximately 2  hours. 
Dose level 2:   1 x 108  NSCs will be suspended in 1.5 ml  of 2% HSA/artificial CSF, and the 
infusion tubing will be primed wth the NSC suspension before beginning infusion of the NSCs. 
A 1 ml artificial CSF flush will follow the infusion of NSCs. The total length of time for 
infusing the NSCs and flush will be approximately 3 ½  hours.   
Dose level 3: 1.5 x 108  NSCs will be suspended in 2.25 ml of 2% HSA/artificial CSF, and the 
infusion tubing will be primed wth the NSC suspension before beginning infusion of the NSCs. A 1 ml artificial CSF flush will follow the infusion of NSCs. The total length of time for 
infusing the NSCs and flush will be approximatelyl 5  hours.  
Dose level 4: As per dose level 3. 
 
5.2.6 Cycle 1 Day 15: Immunologic correlative studies 
While data from the first study of these CD-expressing NSCs showed no evidence of NSC 
immunogenicity after first exposure, since patients in this study will receive more than 1 dose of 
NSCs, we will monitor for development of immune responses after repeat exposure to the NSCs 
by [CONTACT_177422], on day 15 of 
cycle 1, as well as during subsequent treatment cycles (please see section 5.3.1 for further details) to assess for the development of anti-NSC T-cell and/or antibody responses and to look 
for peripheral persistence of the NSCs (please see section 9.1 for further details). 
Additionally, aliquots of serum will be saved from the blood samples drawn for 
immunologiccorrelative studies prior to start of study treatment and on day 15 of cycle 1 to 
serve as a baseline comparison if a patient were to develop signs/symptoms of a possible 
immune response to the NSCs during a subsequent treatment cycle. These serum samples, along 
with additional serum samples drawn at the time the patient develops clinical findings  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177364], will be analyzed via Luminex cytokine panels (please see 
sections [IP_ADDRESS], 9.1.4, and [IP_ADDRESS]). 
5.2.7 Cycle 1 Days  18-24: Administration of 5-FC (and leucovorin for dose level 4 patients) 
Dosing of 5-FC (and possibly leucovorin) as per the dose level the patient is on (see the dose 
escalation schema table in section 5.1) 
Prochorperazine 10 mg p.o. every 6 hours (or a similar strength anti-emetic) will be used as 
needed.  
Study patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_177423] 22 (as per section 
10.0 Study Calendar). 
5.3 Repeat Cycles of  Study Treatment  
A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. 
Repeat cycles of study treatment will be administered as long as there is no evidence of progressive 
disease, and treatment with the NSCs and 5-FC (and leucovorin, as indicated) is well tolerated.  
Please see section 6.[ADDRESS_207924] meet in order to or proceed with study treatment 
on days 1 and 15 of a cycle, as well as instructions for dose modifications if needed with repeat doses of study treatment.

Page 37 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 There will be no intra-patient dose escalation of NSCs, 5-FC, or leucovorin. 
The NSCs will be administered in the outpatient setting via a Rickham on days 1 and 15 of a cycle, as 
per section 5.2.4. 
5-FC (and leucovorin, as indicated) will be taken by [CONTACT_177424] 4-10 and days 18-24 as per the 
dose level the patient is in (see the dose escalation schema table in section 5.1). 
Prochorperazine 10 mg p.o every 6 hours (or a similar strength anti-emetic) will be used as needed.  
5.3.1 Immunologic correlative studies 
In addition to the blood samples drawn prior to the start of study treatment and on cycle 1 day 
15, blood samples will be drawn on days 1 and 15 of cycle 2 and then on day 15 of 
subsequent cycles  for continued assessment of possible development of anti-NSC T cell and/or 
antibody responses (please see section 9.1 for further details).  
A decision to stop study treatment will be based on development of clinical signs/symptoms of 
an immune response rather than a particular level of anti-NSC T cells or antibodies (please see 
section 6.3.3 for further details). 
5.3.2 Assessment of response 
A brain MRI will be performed at the end of even cycles of study treatment (Day 28 (-3 days) 
of cycle 2, 4, 6 etc.). 
 
5.4 Intracerebral Microdialysis (Dose Level 4 Patients Only) 
. 
5.4.1 Cycle 1 Day 1: Placement of the microdialysis catheters  
Before a catheter is placed into brain it will be flushed with artificial CSF. The catheter will be 
tunneled subcutaneously and then inserted into the brain tissue adjacent to the tumor resection 
margin. If feasible, a second catheter will be added. The wound will then be closed in standard 
fashion, anchoring the catheter to the scalp with suture and sterile dressings.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]   Patients who undergo a craniotomy for tumor removal 
Once the study neurosurgeon has finished resecting as much tumor as safely possible, 
he will insert a 70 Brain MD Catheter (membrane length 10 mm; shaft length 100 
mm, ref. no. P000050, M Dialysis, Solna, Sweden) in residual tumor or within 5-[ADDRESS_207925] aliquots of NSCs will be injected.  The total dose of NSCs, (1.5 x 108)—
will be administered as per section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
After the NSCs have been administered, a Rickham will be placed in residual tumor 
or peritumoral tissue to deliver subsequent doses of NSCs. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]   Patients who undergo a stereotactic brain biopsy  
After performing the tumor biopsy, a [ADDRESS_207926] the Rickham through the same biopsy track, and the dose of NSCs (1.5 x 
10

the surgical cavity but not in brain tissue, it will be removed. 
5.4.3 Cycle 1 Day 1: Microdialysis setup   
Once the CT scan confirms correct placement of the microdialysis catheter, the inlet tubing of 
the catheter will be connected to a 2.5 mL syringe (106 Pump Syringe, ref. no. 8010191, M Dialysis, Solna, Sweden) filled with sterile artificial CSF (Perfusion Fluid CNS). The syringe 
will be placed in a portable syringe pump (107 MD Pump, ref. no. P000127, M Dialysis, Solna, 
Sweden). The flow control on the pump will be set at 1L/min , and the pump will be turned on.  
A plastic microvial (Ref. No. P000001, M Dialysis, Solna, Sweden) will be placed in the vial 
holder at the end of the outlet tubing to collect dialysate. This microvial can hold up to [ADDRESS_207928] the dialysate samples as outlined in sections 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_207929].  
5.4.4 Cycle 1 Days 4-10:  Collection of dialysate and blood samples for measurement of 
intracerebral and plasma levels of 5-FC, leucovorin, and 5-FU. 
 With patients who undergo intracerebral microdialysis, the first dose of 5-FC/leucovorin will be 
administered at 6 am on day 4 and continue every 6 hours for the 7 day dosing period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Collection of dialysate samples  
On day 4, just prior to the first dose of 5-FC/leucovorin, a new microvial will be placed in the holder of the outlet tubing of the microdialysis catheter. The microvial 
will be changed to a new one every 60 minutes for the next 24 hours , and thereafter 
the microvial will be switched every 3 hours until the patient has completed the 7 day 
course of 5-FC/leucovorin. Please see section 9.2.[ADDRESS_207930]. During the period of dialysate collection, a patient may be mobile within the 
confines of the collection system. For example, s/he may move from bed to chair or commode and so on.  
If the catheter stops functioning and is removed before the patient has completed the 
7-day course of 5-FC/leucovorin, then s/he can be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_177365] 5-FC/leucovorin as an outpatient. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Removal of the microdialysis catheter 
Approximately [ADDRESS_207931] dose of 5-FC has been administered, the 
microdialysis catheter will be removed percutaneously at the bedside. Xylocaine for 
local anesthesia will be used as needed. The entry site of the catheter will be closed 
with a suture or steri-strips as necessary and a clean dressing applied.   
[IP_ADDRESS]   Collection of plasma samples. 
During collection of the dialysate samples, blood samples will be drawn in order to 
compare systemic and intracerebral levels of 5-FC, leucovorin, and 5-FU.

Page 39 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be performed before and after 5-FC and 
leucovorin have reached steady-state.  
On days [ADDRESS_207932] prior to the 6 am dose of 5-
FC/leucovorin and then every [ADDRESS_207933] before the 6 am dose of 5-
FC/leucovorin and then 90 minutes later.  
Please see section 9.2.2 for further details about collection of the PK blood samples. 
If the microdialysis catheter becomes non-functional, then blood draws for plasma 
PKs will stop. 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. 
All patients receiving any number of NSCs will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicity criteria. 
A DLT is defined as an adverse event that:  
(a) is related to the administration of NSCs, 5-FC, or leucovorin, or any combination of the agents, with 
an attribution of possible, probable, or definite, and  
(b) occurs during the first treatment cycle (including Cycle 2 Day 1 safety assessments), and  
(c) meets any of the following criteria:    
Discontinuation toxicities 
1. Receives less than 80% of study treatments due to a toxicity related to NSCs, 5-FC, or 
leucovorin, except CNS toxicities that are present at baseline or attributable to the location 
of the tumor or the neurosurgery. 
Hematological toxicities 
1. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
2. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days 
3. Grade 4 anemia  
4. Febrile  neutropenia if ANC < 0.5 x 109/L  
Nervous system disorders 
5. Grade 3 CNS disorder lasting > 7 days that is not present at baseline and is not attributable 
to the location of the tumor or the neurosurgery. 
6. Second occurrence of a grade 3 CNS disorder that is not present at baseline and is not attributable to the location of the tumor or the neurosurgery.  
7. Any grade 4 CNS disorder that is not present at baseline and is not attributable to the 
location of the tumor or the neurosurgery. 
Non-hematological, non-nervous system toxicities 
8. Grade 3 toxicity despi[INVESTIGATOR_177366] > 7 days. 
9. Grade 3 toxicity resulting in study agent discontinuation (permanently removed from study 
treatment). 
10. Grade 4 toxicity, except grade 4 diarrhea that responds to maximal medical therapy within 3 days. 
Please note: An allergic reaction to the NSCs is excluded from the DLT definition, because NSC dose reduction is not appropriate in this situation. The possible occurrence of allergic reactions to the NSCs is addressed by [CONTACT_177425][INVESTIGATOR_004] (Section 5.9).

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  [ADDRESS_207934] 3+3 design. The goal will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD), which is defined as the highest dose level tested in which fewer than 33% of patients experienced a 
DLT attributable to the treatment regimen of NSCs with 5-FC and leucovorin, when at least 6 patients were 
treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. If the MTD has not been reached with 1.5 x 108 NSCs, 37.5 
mg/kg q6h 5-FC and 25 mg q6h leucovorin (dose level 3 plus leucovorin), then that dose will be termed the 
maximum feasible dose (MFD).   
5.6.[ADDRESS_207935] 3 patients be separately observed for 4 weeks (or until the DLT assessment period has 
ended) before the next patient can start treatment on that dose level.  
5.6.5  
5.6.6  Dose escalation rules: 
[IP_ADDRESS]   If 0/3 study participants experiences a DLT, the next cohort of 3 study patients will be 
treated at the next higher dose level. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  If 1/3 study participants experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded by [CONTACT_20904] 3 
study participants who will be treated at the same dose level for a total of 6 study participants.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  If 1/6 participants experiences a DLT, the next cohort of 3 study participants will be 
treated at the next higher dose level. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  If 2 or more participants of either a 3 participant or 6 participant cohort encounter a 
DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded. If applicable, three (more) participants will be enrolled 
at the next lower dose level. 
[IP_ADDRESS] At least 6 patients will be treated at the MTD (or MFD, if the MTD is not reached). 
 
For a patient to be counted for dose escalation, s/he must receive at least 80% (+/- 5%) of the assigned NSCs on 
days 1 and 15 and 80% (+/- 5%) of the 5-FC (and leucovorin, as indicated) on days 4-[ADDRESS_207936] experienced a DLT.  
All study patients enrolled are to be fully followed for toxicity; any study patients who are not evaluable for 
dose escalation will be replaced. Intra-patient dose escalation is not allowed. 
Dose level 4 patients will undergo intracerebral microdialysis, along with collection of blood samples, for 
pharmacokinetic analysis in order to characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic 
concentrations of 5-FC and 5-FU at the MTD level, as well as to assess intracerebral concentrations of 
leucovorin.

aIf a DLT is observed in 2 or more patients at dose level 1, then a de-escalation dose , dose level   -1 will 
be tested. With dose level -1, the doses of NSCs and 5-FC will both be reduced by 25%; however, if the 
DLT can clearly be attributed only to 5-FC, then only the dose of 5-FC will be reduced by 25% 
(likewise for the NSCs if the DLT is clearly attributable to only the NSCs) for dose level -1.  
bIf the addition of leucovorin to the highest tolerated dose combination of 5-FC and NSC requires a 
dose de-escalation, then leucovorin will be discontinued and the MTD/MFD will be the highest 
tolerated dose combination of 5-FC and NSCs without leucovorin. A total of 6 patients will be treated at 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or if the MTD is not reached, at the maximum feasible dose 
(MFD).  
cPatients on dose level 4 will undergo intracerebral microdialysis to measure NSC-mediated conversion 
of 5-FC to 5-FU.  
 
 
5.8 Criteria for Removal from Treatment  
5.8.1   At the beginning of cycle 1, if a patient requires more than 16 mg/day of dexamethasone to 
control cerebral edema by [CONTACT_29623] s/he is ready to begin treatment with 5-FC (and leucovorin, as indicated), then s/he will be considered neurologically unstable and will not continue with study 
treatment; however, the patient will still be evaluable for toxicity.

combination. If the adverse event resolves as per criteria in section 6.3, then the patient will be allowed to proceed with the next treatment of NSCs and 5-FC (and leucovorin, as indicated), with dose 
modifications as outlined in section 6.3. If the adverse event does not resolve within the timeframe 
specified in section 6.3, or if more than 2 dose reductions are required, then study treatment will be 
stopped. 
 5.8.3   Evidence of progressive disease. 
5.8.4  Patient needs any treatment not allowed by [CONTACT_760]. 
5.8.5 A patient may always be removed from treatment whenever s/he wishes. 
5.8.6 If a patient needs to start full dose anticoagulation while receiving study treatment, s/he will be 
taken off study.

Page 44 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 As listed in the package insert (updated July 2014) the expected toxicities for oral and 
parenteral leucovorin are:   
 Allergic Reactions:  anaphylaxis and generalized allergic reactions 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  hives (urticaria) associated with anaphylactoid 
reactions  
Leucovorin with 5-FU:   
Leucovorin can enhance the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. Although the toxicities observed 
in patients treated with the combination of leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil are qualitatively similar to those observed in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil alone, 
gastrointestinal toxicities (particularly stomatitis and diarrhea) are observed more 
commonly and may be more severe and of prolonged duration in patients treated with the combination. 
  
6.2.4 Microdialysis catheter toxicities 
Bleeding along the catheter track, infection localized to or clearly emanating from the catheter. 
Minor bleeding (less than 1 ml) has been observed in 3% of patients, and there have been no 
documented microdialysis catheter-related infections.  
6.3 Dose Modifications/Delays/Start of Cycle Criteria 
6.3.1  General Information 
[IP_ADDRESS] The study will use the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 to grade toxicities.  A copy of the version 4.0 can be downloaded from: 
 http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html 
[IP_ADDRESS] Whenever treatment is held pending resolution of toxicity to grade 1 or return to baseline, this 
criterion may also be met if the toxicity resolves to within 1 grade of the baseline value for a 
pre-existing laboratory abnormality. Baseline values are from screening assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study agents are always held together, regardless of the attribution of the toxicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS] NSC or 5-FC dose re-escalation and leucovorin restarting are never permitted in this study. [IP_ADDRESS] If, for the best interest of the patient, the investigator wants to hold the study agent(s) or dose 
reduce (including increasing the dose reduction) after an adverse event in a manner not outlined 
in Table 7.2.4, this is permissible following discussion with and written approval the Principal 
investigator.* 
[IP_ADDRESS] For situations where a participant experiences a toxicity which the treating investigator feels is 
unlikely related to treatment with either study agent, but which requires hold or reduction of 
either agent according to Table 7.2.4, maintaining treatment or maintaining treatment dose is allowable per discussion with and written approval by [CONTACT_079].* 
[IP_ADDRESS] For holds due to toxicities related to study agent(s), if the participant does not meet criteria to 
resume treatment within [ADDRESS_207942] permanently discontinue study treatment (all agents). However, if the participant is clearly 
benefiting from the study, the investigator may contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_177368]. Agreement of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_177369].*

Page 45 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 [IP_ADDRESS] For holds for reasons other than treatment related toxicities, such as inclement weather or 
adverse events unrelated to study agents, if the participant does not meet criteria to resume 
treatment within [ADDRESS_207943] NSC administration, the study agent(s) may be restarted 
with written approval from the Principal Investigator, as long as there has been no significant 
evidence of disease progression during the treatment interruption.*  
[IP_ADDRESS] Section 6.4 details resuming agent administration following a treatment hold. 
*The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_177370], objectives and endpoints or risk to participants. If any modifications to the treatment 
plan might affect the study design, objectives, and endpoints, or impact the risk of participants, a 
single subject exception will be sought from the IRB.  If the treating investigator is the principal 
investigator, the determination and the rationale for the determination will clearly be documented in the medical record. 
6.3.2  Start of Cycle Criteria 
In order to proceed with the next cycle of study treatment: 
x adverse events (except for alopecia) that occurred in the preceding cycle must have improved to 
a CTCAE v 4.0 grade  1 (or w ithin 1 grade of starting values for pre-existing laboratory 
abnormalities), 
x ANC must be  1500 cells/mm
3,  
x platelet count  100,000 cells/mm3, and  
6.3.[ADDRESS_207944] Administration of 5-FC (and leucovorin)   
For Cycle 1 Day 4 5-FC (and leucovorin) administration to proceed, the participant must have recovered 
well from any immediate post-operative effects and requires no more than 16 mg/day of 
dexamethasone. Otherwise the participant will be removed from treatment.  Criteria found in Section 6.3 (Dose modifications) also apply. 
6.3.4 Dose Modifications  
Table 6.3.4 details the criteria for disrupting treatment, dose modification and treatment discontinuation 
following an adverse event. See section 6.3.1 for general guidelines. The agent listed in Table 6.3.4 
indicates the drug to which the toxicity is likely attributed based on previous trials of 5-FC (with leucovorin) and possible anticipated toxicities to the CD-NSCs.

6.4 Adjustments to the Treatment Cycle Following an Interruption in Agent Administration 
The day count continues despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a hold in agent administration.   
Should a hold or delay in treatment occur, evaluations required by [CONTACT_760] (see Section 5 and 10) will be 
conducted at the original times during the cycle and safety assessments relevant to the toxicity will be repeated 
prior to resuming agent administration.  
The timing of resumption (whether in the same cycle or as part of the subsequent cycle) depends on where in the 
cycle agent was held, and when criteria to resume are met.  Details are described in the sections that follow. 
6.4.1 Holding Day 15 NSCs  
If Day 15 NSCs and subsequent 5-FC (with leucovorin) are held, resultant start dates are as follows:  
x If participant is able to resume treatment by [CONTACT_177431] 22, he/she will resume study agents as soon 
as logistically feasible during the same treatment cycle.  The cycle length would be extended accordingly, so that 14 days between NSC administrations would be maintained.  
x If participant is not able to resume treatment by [CONTACT_177431] 22, he/she will continue the current cycle 
without a second NSC administration and resume study agents at the start of the next treatment 
cycle. The current cycle would be 28 days in length and the participant will forgo the Day 15 NSCs/ 
Day 18-24 5-FC (w/ w/o leucovorin).  
6.4.2 Holding Any of the 5-FC (with Leucovorin) Administrations After NSC Administration   
If the 5-FC (with leucovorin) administration is held after the participant has received the corresponding 
NSC administration, held doses of 5-FC and leucovorin will may be made up by [CONTACT_177432] 5-FC 
administration for up to one day so that there is a minimum of three days without an agent being 
administered between 5-FC administration and NSC administration. (Example: Pt receives C2D1 NSCs

Reporting  
7.1 Data and Safety Monitoring 
This is a Risk Level 4 study, as defined in the “ City of Hope Data and Safety Monitoring Plan ”, 
http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Pages/forms-and-procedures.aspx  involving COH as IND holder and gene 
therapy. 
7.2 Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring 
The City of Hope Protocol Management Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, collaborating investigators, 
CRA, protocol nurse, and statistician is responsible for monitoring the data and safety of this study, 
including implementation of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58106].  
This study will utilize the Phase I tracking log to monitor data and safety for dose escalation, recording 
doses administered and resultant adverse events. The tracking log will contain dose levels administered, 
DLT-defining adverse events, and documentation that the data from a dose level is complete before dose 
escalation.  Those data and safety elements will be reported to the COH DSMC as applicable with the 
PMT report, which will be submitted quarterly from the anniversary date of activation, as noted in Table 1 below. Protocol specific data collection will include the following items: adverse events per dose 
level, patient outcomes, and protocol deviations.  
A decision to escalate to the next dose level will be made by [CONTACT_177433] 28. Enrollment of the first 3 patients to dose levels 1-
3 will be staggered by [CONTACT_177434] 28 days before the next patient can begin treatment on a particular dose level.

 Adverse event (AE) - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the 
protocol intervention.  
 Unexpected Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a)  – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the adverse event. 
 Expected  Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected event OR is an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the adverse event 
 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as any expected or unexpected adverse 
event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
x Is life-threatening event (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred); 
x Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (not required as part of the treatment) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
x A persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Secondary Malignancy, or 
x Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Unanticipated problem (UP)  – Any incident, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied; AND  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by [CONTACT_177435], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND

Medical Device Reportable Events 
Medical devices that will be used in this study include intracerebral microdialysis catheters 
and Rickham reservoir/catheter systems.   Medical Device Reportable (MDR) Events are the AEs or problems that the medical device regulation requires to be reported.  These events include patient deaths and serious injuries that the medical devices have or may have caused or contributed to, i.e., the devices may have directly caused the events or played a role in the events.  The timely reporting of MDR reportable events is required by [CONTACT_1622], and will be handled 
by [CONTACT_177436]. 
 
National Institutes of Health-Office of Biotechnology Activities (NIH-OBA) and FDA Reporting 
Since this study involves gene therapy, and City of Hope holds the IND, adverse events must also be reported to the NIH-OBA. 
 The PI/designee will submit the adverse event report through the City of Hope electronic reporting 
system, and then OIDRA will take responsibility for reporting of the adverse event to NIH-OBA.  
 
Follow up of study participants 
As required by [CONTACT_1622], study patients will be followed long term (up to 15 years) and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177375], DSMC, and IRB as they arise during this follow-up period.

9.0 Correlative/Special Studies 
9.1 Immunological Correlative Studies  
In order to assess for possible development of anti-NSC T cell and antibody responses with repeat 
exposure to the NSCs, blood samples from study patients will be collected for isolation and storage of 
PBMCs and serum prior to the start of study treatment, on day 15 of cycle 1, days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, 
and then on day15 of subsequent cycles (please see section 9.1.5 for further details). We will also be 
assessing study patients for peripheral persistence of the NSCs (section [IP_ADDRESS]) and testing for 
replication competent retrovirus (RCR) (section 9.1.6).  
The following studies, which have been successfully performed in our first neural stem cell study of 
CD-expressing NSCs and oral 5-FC, will be done by [CONTACT_177438] (COH CICSL).  
9.1.[ADDRESS_207958] the potential to be specific for and to eliminate the 
administered NSCs. The specificity of the clonally-expanded T cells for the NSCs will be 
evaluated by 1) incubating pre- and post-infusion PBMC samples with the NSCs, followed by 
[CONTACT_177439] T cells and 2) assessing surface CD 107 (a 
measure of cytotoxicity) on the surface of those T cells. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_207959] been heat treated to 
inactivate complement. Following incubation the NSCs will be washed and bound antibodies detected using a secondary goat anti-human Fc antibody conjugated to FITC. After a second 
Phase 1 CD-Secreting NSCs with 5-FC and Leucovorin for High Grade Glioma 
Page 58 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 washing step, the NSCs will be analyzed by [CONTACT_177440] a flow cytometer in the COH 
Analytical Cytometry Core. Binding of human antibodies to the NSCs will be detected as a shift 
in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) compared to NSCs not treated with human serum. All 
samples obtained from individual subjects prior to and after therapy will be evaluated in parallel 
to evaluate possible development of humoral anti-NSC responses over time. The statistical 
significance of any detected MFI shifts will be evaluated by [CONTACT_177441] a reference panel of normal human sera. The assay will include as a control the parental NSC (not transduced with the CD gene) to evaluate whether antibody responses are 
directed against the CD gene product.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_207960] curve will be generated using DNA isolated from the 
administered NSCs titrated into DNA from PBMCs (negative for v-myc ); in parallel reactions, 
DNA isolated from patient samples will be subjected to amplification.  The % NSC DNA (i.e. 
the % of total nucleated cells in samples that contain v-myc  DNA) in patient PBMC samples 
will be determined from the standard curve.  A parallel set of amplification reactions using 
genomic p21 primers (amplifying equivalently from all samples) will be used to normalize 
across samples. 
 
9.1.4 Assessment of serum cytokine levels in the event that a patient develops a suspected 
immune response to the NSCs 
 The Human Cytokine Thirty-Plex Antibody Bead Kit (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) will be used 
to analyze serum samples for 30 cytokines: epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF); eotaxin; basic 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF-basic); granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); 
interferon alpha (IFN- Į); IFN -gamma (Ȗ); interleukin -1 beta (IL- 1ȕ); interleukin -[ADDRESS_207961] (IL-1RA); IL-2; interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R); IL-4; IL-5; IL-6; IL-7; IL-8; IL-10; 
IL-12p40/p70; IL-13; IL-15; IL-17; IFN- Ȗ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10); monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); monokine induced by [CONTACT_20129]- Ȗ  (MIG); monocyte 
inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP- 1Į); monocyte inflammatory protein -1 beta (MIP- 1ȕ); 
regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted cytokine (RANTES); tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- Į; and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The assay plate will 
then be transferred to the Bio-plex HTF Luminex System (Bio Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, 
CA) instrument for analysis. Cytokine concentrations will be calculated using Bio-plex 
Manager 3.[ADDRESS_207962] curve 
calculations for duplicate samples. 
 
9.1.5 Collection of blood samples for performing the immunological correlative studies 
[IP_ADDRESS] To assess for possible development of anti-NSC T cell responses and evaluate for 
peripheral persistence of the NSCs, approximately 30 ml of blood will be collected 
from each patient in lavender top tubes (liquid potassium EDTA) prior to the start of 
study treatment, on day 15 of cycle 1, days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, and then on day 15 of subsequent cycles. The samples will be sent to the City of Hope Clinical 
Immunobiology Correlative Studies Laboratory and processed, with PBMCs being 
isolated and stored according to established laboratory SOP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To assess for possible antibody responses, approximately 10 ml of blood will be 
collected from each patient in red top tubes (free of any anti-coagulant reagent) prior to 
the start of study treatment, on day 15 of cycle 1, days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, and then day 
15 of subsequent cycles. The samples will be sent to the City of Hope Clinical 
Phase 1 CD-Secreting NSCs with 5-FC and Leucovorin for High Grade Glioma 
Page 59 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 Immunobiology Correlative Studies Laboratory and processed to yield serum that will 
be frozen in several aliquots at -80°C. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  If a patient develops an adverse event that is suspected of being due to an immune 
response to the NSCs, 3-[ADDRESS_207963] twice (separated by [CONTACT_3450] 2 days) during the event for analysis of serum cytokine 
levels via Luminex cytokine panels, as described in section 9.1.4. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_207964] 10 ml of blood will be collected from each patient in EDTA treated (lavender top) tubes 
and sent to CICSL. Samples will be processed with DNA being isolated and stored, according 
to established laboratory SOP, until RCR testing is performed by [CONTACT_954]. 
All blood samples collected for the immunologic correlative studies as per section 9.1.5 and 
9.1.6 will be sent to the COH CICSL. 
 
 
9.2 Measurement of Intracerebral and Plasma Levels of 5-FC, Leucovorin, and 5-FU 
In order to characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of 5-FC and 5-FU at the MTD/MFD of study treatment, all 6 patients in the expansion cohort, who will be treated at 
the MTD/MFD, will undergo intracerebral microdialysis and collection of blood samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis.  
9.2.1 Collection of Dialysate samples  
[IP_ADDRESS]  A microvial can hold up to 200 Pl of fluid. It will need to be replaced with a new one 
every 3 hours (except during the first [ADDRESS_207965] doses of 5-FC and 
leucovorin are taken on day 4, as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  A new syringe containing sterile artificial CSF will be placed in the microdialysis pump 
daily. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  A new microvial will be placed in the holder of the catheter’s outlet tubing just before 
the patient takes the 6 am doses of 5-FC (and leucovorin) on day 4. A new microvial 
will be placed in the holder every 60 minutes for the next 24 hours ; thereafter 
microvials will be switched every 3 hours until the patient has completed the 7-day 
course of 5-FC/leucovorin and the microdialysis catheter is removed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Once the patient has started taking 5-FC/leucovorin, it is important not to flush the 
catheter unless it becomes clogged, as indicated by [CONTACT_177442].  
 While the pump is running, whenever the lid of the microdialysis pump is opened and 
then closed, the pump automatically goes into a flushing cycle. If the lid of the pump 
needs to be opened during the 7 day course of 5-FC/leucovorin (eg. in order to place the daily new syringe of artificial CSF in it), then first stop the pump by [CONTACT_177443], not by [CONTACT_177444]. After the new syringe is in place, close the lid and put the 
batteries back in. The pump will then resume its flow rate of 1 L/min without going 
into a flushing cycle. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Microvials containing the dialysate samples will be placed on dry ice until they can be 
moved to an ultralow temperature freezer ( d-70°C) in the Gonda Building, room 1017, 
where they will be stored until brought to the COH Analytical Pharmacology Core 
Facility (APCF) for analysis by [CONTACT_44127] (LC-MS/MS).   
9.2.2 Collection of blood samples in patients undergoing intracerebral microdialysis 
Phase 1 CD-Secreting NSCs with 5-FC and Leucovorin for High Grade Glioma 
Page 60 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 [IP_ADDRESS]  Sampling will be performed to define the plasma concentration-time profiles of 5-FC, 
leucovorin, and 5-FU. On day 4, prior to the patient taking the first doses of 5-FC and 
leucovorin, a large gauge peripheral catheter (e.g., 19 or 20 gauge angiocath straight set 
with T-connector, or similar IV access device) will be placed within a vein in the arm of 
the patient for the collection of pharmacokinetic blood samples. Patency of the sampling 
catheter should be maintained between blood draws using either a heparin lock (e.g., 10 
U/ml in normal saline) or a slow drip of Normal Saline for Injection, USP (e.g., 10 ml/hr). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Please see the schedule of blood draws on days 4-8 in section [IP_ADDRESS].3.  
At each sample time point a discard blood volume appropriate for the IV access device 
must be drawn prior to the sample.  Blood (3 ml) will be drawn from a peripheral vein 
in the patient’s arm and collected in plasma tubes c ontaining sodium heparin 
anticoagulant. Promptly mix the plasma collection tube by [CONTACT_5987] 6-times and 
then place it on wet ice, until centrifuged at 1,300 x g for 10 min at 4°C.  Samples will 
be centrifuged for harvesting plasma as soon as possible after collection (within 1 hour). 
Upon centrifugation, separate the plasma from the blood cells using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_177378].  Plasma will be stored frozen at < -70°C until subsequent batch analysis can be performed by [CONTACT_177445]-MS/MS. 
If the microdialysis catheter becomes non-functional, then blood draws for plasma PKs 
will stop.  
 
9.43 Brain Tissue Correlates 
 
9.3.1 Determining the fate of the NSCs at time of autopsy 
 
As part of the consenting process, study patients will be asked to give permission for a brain autopsy. The brain autopsy will focus on detecting the presence or absence of NSCs, their location and tumor pathology. Specifically, brain tissue samples will be collected from the 
center and periphery of the tumor, as well as grossly affected and unaffected areas from distant 
and contralateral sites. Tissue samples will be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for 
sectioning and analysis.  When possible, fresh frozen tissue samples will be taken.  
 
NSCs will be detected by [CONTACT_177446] v- myc (only present in the 
transplanted NSCs).  Fluorescence in situ  hybridization and immunocytochemistry techniques 
will also be used for the detection and further characterization of the NSCs (including 
proliferation and differentiation markers).
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collecting tumor tissue for future research  
If there is resection material available in excess of that needed for standard pathologic 
studies, this excess material will be used for research purposes. 
Excess surgical material will be grown as a dissociated primary cell culture in the 
Aboody laboratory for NSC migration and toxicity assays under IRB #[ZIP_CODE].  Additional material will be banked (fixed and frozen) for potential future research under 
IRB #[ZIP_CODE].  Such research may include: 1) comparison of gene expression profiles in 
the tumor and adjacent tissue (if available) prior and after treatment with HB1.F3.CD 
NSCs/5-FC; 2) presence of immune cells (B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, microglia,

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 11.0 Endpoint Evaluation Criteria/Measurement of Effect 
11.1 Response Criteria  
The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (Wen et al., 2010) will be used to assess 
response: 
Complete Response (CR) Complete disappearance of all enhancing disease (measurable and non-
measureable) that is sustained for at least 4 weeks, stable or improved non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 
lesions, no new lesions, off corticosteroids (physiologic replacement doses allowed), and neurologically 
stable or improved.  
Partial Response (PR)  50% decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions , sustained for at least 4 
weeks, no progression of non-measurable disease, stable or improved non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 lesions, 
no new lesions, corticosteroid dose stable or reduced (compared to baseline), and neurologically stable 
or improved.  
Stable Disease (SD) Does not qualify for CR, PR, or PD, stable non-enhancing FLAIR/T2 lesions, 
stable or reduced corticosteroids (compared to baseline), clinically stable.   
Progressive Disease (PD)  25% increase in enhancing lesions despi[INVESTIGATOR_177379], 
increase (significant) in non-enhancing T2/FLAIR lesions that is not attributable to other non-tumor 
causes, any new lesions, clinical deterioration (not attributable to other non-tumor causes and not due to steroid decrease).  
RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) version 1.1 criteria [36] will be used to assess 
the response of study patients’ systemic disease to eribulin.

12.2 Protocol Deviations 
12.2.1 Deviation Policy 
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol 
Deviation Policy” located at 
http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Documents/Institutional%20Deviation%20Policy.pdf. 
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter protocol integrity require prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request.  In addition, if contractually obligated, the sponsor must also approve the deviation.  IRB pre-approved SSE 
protocol modifications are considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation.  The 
submission of a deviation report is not required. 
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can also extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease 
progression.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_91597].  Examples 
include, but are not limited to:  a) dose adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) 
alteration in treatment schedule due to non-availability of the research participant for treatment; c) laboratory test results which are slightly outside the protocol requirements but at levels that 
do not affect participant safety.  These instances are considered to be deviations from the 
protocol.  A deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRB within five days. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_207979] to 
report to the IRB following review. 
12.2.3 Resolving Disputes 
Phase 1 CD-Secreting NSCs with 5-FC and Leucovorin for High Grade Glioma 
Page 67 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a 
protocol deviation without approval by [CONTACT_978].  Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key 
point, the IDS should rely on the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177380]. 
In situations where there is misperception or dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the 
persons involved in implementing the protocol, it is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_91598] (or designee) to arrive at resolution. 
  
13.0 Statistical Considerations  
13.1 Sample Size  
The expected sample size is 15-18 patients (minimum=6, maximum= 33, allowing for [ADDRESS_207980] unevaluable/ineligible patients). A sample size of 6 at the MTD will allow us to i) achieve a 
maximum margin of error for the 90% confidence limits for the DLT rate of 0.35 and ii) see a toxicity 
with a true rate of 0.25 in approximately 82% of trials.  
13.[ADDRESS_207981] 3 patients entering  dose levels 1-3 will enter sequentially after the prior patient 
completes cycle 1, the study time is mostly determined by [CONTACT_177448]. It is anticipated that this study 
will complete accrual within approximately 30-36 months. 
 
13.3 Statistical Design and Analysis   
13.3.1 Design:  
The dose escalation plan is based on a standard 3+3 design and is described in sections 5.6 and 5.7.  
13.3.2 Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
x To define the phase II recommended dose of intracerebrally administered  CD-expressing 
NSCs in combination with oral 5-FC and leucovorin.  This will be based on the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) , or if the MTD is not met, the maximum feasible dose (MFD), and 
toxicity profile in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.  
x To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin. 
Secondary Objectives: 
x To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti-NSC T cell and/or 
antibody responses) with repeat doses of NSCs. 
x To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of 5-FC 
and 5-FU at the MTD/MFD level. 
x To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete response) of this treatment regimen. 
x To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs. 
13.3.3 Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
x Safety and feasibility:   
Phase 1 CD-Secreting NSCs with 5-FC and Leucovorin for High Grade Glioma 
Page 68 of 76 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 02/13/17  Version:  09 o For dose escalation: dose limiting toxicities; 
o Toxicity profile: all attributable toxicities. 
x Feasibility:   
o Clinically significant allergic reaction to NSCs 
o Mechanical issues with repeat administration of NSCs via Rickham 
 
Secondary Endpoints: 
x Immunogenicity: evaluate patient blood samples for the development of T cell responses and 
antibodies against the NSCs using TcR V ȕ spectratypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], CD 107 degranulation assays, and 
flow cytometry. 
x Pharmacokinetics: the following pharmacokinetic variables will be assessed: Tmax, Cmax, 
AUC, t ½, and the ratio of the AUC of 5-FU in dialysate to plasma, and the ratio of the AUC 
of 5-FC in dialysate to plasma. 
x Tumor response. 
x Determine the fate of the NSCs: NSC persistence. 
13.3.4 Analysis:  
Tables will be created to summarize all toxicities and side effects by [CONTACT_2715], course, organ, severity (by [CONTACT_94979] 4.0) and attribution.  Rates and associated 90% confidence limits will be estimated 
for the DLT rate at the MTD/MFD and the rate of clinical benefit. Descriptive statistics will be provided 
for study patient demographics.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the patients who undergo intracerebral microdialysis will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics and graphical methods. The primary PK parameters of interest 
will be the Cmax and AUC of 5-FC and 5-FU, measured both in the dialysate samples and in plasma. 
Leucovorin levels in dialysate samples will likewise be compared to plasma leucovorin levels. The 5-FC 
and 5-FU PK data will also be compared to the PK data obtained from patients who underwent 
intracerebral microdialysis in the first study of CD-expressing NSCs (IRB# [ZIP_CODE]) to determine if there 
is a dose effect at the MTD/MFD compared to lower doses of NSCs. All summaries will be exploratory in spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040], with the goal of developi[INVESTIGATOR_177381], or regarding 
reasons for efficacy or lack of efficacy.  
Data from assessing for possible development of NSC immunogenicity with repeat exposure  and 
performing  autopsies to determine the fate of the NSCs, will be presented in an exploratory fashion 
using descriptive statistics and graphical methods. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_207982] (IRB) that complies with the 
federal regulations at [ADDRESS_207983] be fulfilled.

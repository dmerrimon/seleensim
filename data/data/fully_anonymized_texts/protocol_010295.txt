Title of Study: A Phase 1B Study to Evaluate the Safety and Induction of Immune Response of CRS -207 in 
Combination with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as Front -line Therapy in Adults  with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma  
Primary Investigator: Raffit Hassan, M.D.  
Number of Sites:  Up to 7  
Phase of Development: Phase 1B  Treatment Period: 25 Weeks  Study Duration: 7 years  
Objectives:  
Primary:  To determine the safety of CRS -207 (with or without low -dose cyclophosphamide  [Cy] given one day prior  
CRS -207) when administered in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin and to evaluate the induction of immune 
response to mesothelin as measured by [CONTACT_20129] -gamma ELISPOT assay prior to treatment and at time points during and 
after treatment.  
Secondary:  To evaluate o bjective tumor response,  progression free survival,  time to progression,  overall survival,  and 
the predictive value of serum mesothelin for therapeutic response  for each treatment regimen . 
Exploratory:  i) conduct  immune subset analysis (e.g. CD4, CD8, T reg) and gene expression profiling of tumor tissue 
pre- and post -vaccination; ii) to assess  induction of anti -mesothelin humoral immune response; iii) to measure tumor 
marker kinetics  as biomarkers of tumor response ; iv) evaluate the association between pulmo nary function 
improvement and tumor response; v) evaluate the relationship of tumor response to overall survival .  
Methodology:  
This is a phase 1B  study to evaluate the safety and induction of immune response of CRS -207 (with or without Cy) in 
combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin in front -line therapy of adults  with malignant pleural m esothelioma  
(MPM) . 
 
Up to  16 subjects were original ly planned to be enrolled in this study.  Up to an additional 44 subjects will be enrolled 
in an expans ion phase of this study  (for a total of up to 60 subjects) to obtain additional safety , immune  and efficacy 
data.  Subjects will be enrolled into 2 mutually exclusive cohorts described below.   
 Cohort 1: At least 32 subjects will receive 2 infusions (prime vaccinations; PV) of CRS -207 (1 × 10
9 CFU given 
intravenously [ i.v.] over approximately 1  hour) 2 weeks apart followed 2 weeks later by [CONTACT_8622] 6 cycles of pemetrexed 
and cisplatin 3 weeks apart.  Three weeks after completion of chemotherapy, subjects  will receive an additional 2 
infusions (boost vaccinations; BV) of CRS -[ADDRESS_262508] 16 subjects enrolled into the expansion phase.  
 Cohort 2: The r emaining subjects enrolled in the expansion phase (up to 28 total) will receive CRS -207 in 
combination with chemotherapy at the dose and schedule described above, h owever, these subjects will also receive 
low-dose Cy (200 mg/m
2) intravenously over 30 minutes one day prior to each CRS -207 infusion ( i.e. prior to each 
PV and BV infusion).   Low-dose Cy inhibits regulatory T cells and enhances immune responses when given in 
context with vaccine s1-3.  Preclinical  studies of low -dose Cy given prior to CRS -[ADDRESS_262509]  
shown improve d immunogenicity and survival ( Section 1.3). 
 All subjects will return to the clinic [ADDRESS_262510] vaccination for an End of Course (EOC) visit.  
Subjects will have follow -up visits 4 weeks after the EOC visit and every 8 weeks thereafter until treatment I

Safety and follow -up: 
The i nitial safety of CRS -207 (with or without Cy), pemetrexed  and cisplatin  treatment  will be monitored closely.  
Subjects  will be followed for AEs and dose -limiting toxicities ( Section 3.6 ) which may warrant either CRS -207 dose  
reduction or halting treatment after review by [CONTACT_7613], sponsor and medical monitor.  A  7-day course of 
oral amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in penicillin -allergic subjects ) will be administered to eliminate  
any residual CRS -207 beginning 7 days following the second dose (prime vaccination) of CRS -207 during the 
induction phase  and after the final study  dose of CRS -207.  All subjects will complete an End of Study (EOS ) visit no 
more than four weeks following the final dose of study medication or prior to receipt of other cancer -related CRS-207

1.1.2 Mesothelin  
Mesothelin is a cell surface tumor differentiation antigen present on normal mesothelial cells that is highly expressed in many human tumors including 
virtually all mesothelioma and pancreatic cancers, 55% to 71% of ovarian cancers 
and 41% to 55% of lung adenocarcinomas .
13-[ADDRESS_262531] previously shown that a mesothelin -specific IgG antibody response is present in 39% and 42% of patients 
with mesothelioma and ovarian cancer respectively, suggesting that immune tolerance to mesothelin can be overcome .
[ADDRESS_262532] demonstrated that in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, positive clinical outcomes following vaccination with an irradiated 
allogeneic whole cell vaccine encoding granulocyte/macrophage-colony 
stimulating factor ( GM-CSF; GVAX) correlated with induction of mesothelin -
specific cellular immunity .
23,24  In a Phase 1 study, a vaccine with two allogeneic, 
GM-CSF-secreting pancreatic cell lines induced a dose-dependent delayed type 
hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response and CD8+ T cell response to multiple human 
leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-A2, - A3, and –A24 restricted mesothelin epi[INVESTIGATOR_218551] 3 of 14 patients.  Patients with DTH and CD8+ T cell responses had increased disease -free survival, remaining disease- free at least [ADDRESS_262533]. Jeff Schlom at 
the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) elucidated the immunogenic ep itopes of 
mesothelin and showed that mesothelin- specific T cells cause lysis of 
mesothelioma tumor cells .

bacterium Listeria monocytogenes  (Lm) encoding human mesothelin (hM eso).26,27 
1.1.3  Listeria monocytogenes  (Lm)-Based Vaccine Therapy  
Lm is an attractive platform for presentation of tumor -associated antigens and 
activation of immune response directed against cancer cells.  Lm provides both a 
potent stimulation of innate immunity and also stimulates an adaptive immune response through recruitment and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell immunity 
specific for encoded heterologous antigens .

developed a live -attenuated Lm platform strain ( Lm ∆actA/∆inlB), known as 
ANZ -100 (previously CRS -100), which has deletions of two genes, actA and inlB, 
that encode the virulence -determinant proteins ActA  and Internalin B, 
respectively27.  These two proteins facilitate cell- to-cell spread and invasion of 
nonphagocytic cells, and deletion of actA and inlB in ANZ -100 results in

immunity in mice and  nonhuman primates and demonstrates therapeutic efficacy 
in tumor -bearing mice (refer to the Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for details).  
Findings in a Good Laboratory Practice repeated- dose study in cynomolgus 
monkeys showed that treatment with up to 3 × 1010 CFU of CRS -207 resulted in 
no changes related to body weight, food consumption or body temperature and in no findings related to ocular or functional cardiovascular evaluations.  CRS -207 
was detected in the blood at 24 hours after administration, but w as undetectable at 
72 hours.  There were transient and dose -dependent decreases in red blood cell, 
platelet and white blood cell  (WBC)  counts.  Hepatic and renal function changes 
were transient and generally less than two -fold from that at baseline status.   A 
Phase 1 study (VAC07001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has been completed with CRS -207 to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose and to explore the safety profile in subjects with advanced mesothelioma, non–small- cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer 
or pancreatic adenocarcin oma who had failed standard therapy .
26  CRS -207 was 
found to be well tolerated at doses up to 1 × 109 CFU.  Adverse events (AEs) such 
as fevers, chills,  and nausea reported as the most common, immediate, transient, 
mild, and temporally related to CRS -207 administration were self -correcting and 
were resolved by [CONTACT_218601]’ discharge.  Lymphopenia was observed in all doses (1 × 10
8, 3 × 108, 1 × 109 and 1 × 1010 CFU), and transaminase 
elevations were observed at doses of 3 × 108, 1 × 109 and 1 × 1010 CFU.  Both 
were dose -dependent, although transient and not considered clinically significant.  
Two CRS -207- related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported.  One SAE of 
moderate constipation occurred in one subject after the second dose of CRS -207 
at 1 × 108 CFU.  The second SAE, a significant decrease in blood pressure (BP)

baseline status within 24  hours.  This dose level was subsequently discontinued 
and confirmed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as 1 × 109 CFU .  No shedding 
of CRS -207 in urine or stools was observed at any dose.   
While the VAC07001 study enrolled subjects with multiple disease types and was not powered to assess survival, 6 of 17 subjects  survived for ≥ 15 months.  Of 
these 6 “long- term” survivors, [ADDRESS_262538] at day 91 (end of study).    
As 3 of the 6 “long -term” survivors were pancreatic cancer patients had 
previously received GVAX pancreas vaccine in separate clinical studies, CRS -
207 in combination with GVAX pancreas vaccine  (with low -dose 
cyclophosphamide [ Cy]) is currently being evaluated in a Phase [ADDRESS_262539] received or refused chemotherapy 
(Protocol ADU -CL-01; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Enrollment has been completed in this 
study and a recent interim analysis showed a signi ficant improvement in median 
overall survival in subjects who received  GVAX pancreas vaccine and CRS -207 
compared to subjects  who received GVAX  pancreas vaccine alone ( 6.0 months 
vs. 3.4 months; one-sided p=0.0.0057).  The se interim data were reviewed by a n 
independent data monitoring committee who recommended that the study be stopped for efficacy and subjects on the GVAX pancreas vaccine arm offered 
rollover treatment with GVAX pancreas vaccine and CRS -207.  FDA concurred 
with this decision.  Subjects in the study continue to receive treatment and all 
subjects are being followed for survival, safety and clinical and immune responses.  Safety findings have been consistent with prior clinical experience .  
The most frequent Grade 3/4 related toxicities were f ever, lymphopenia, 
hypophosphatemia, elevated liver enzymes and fatigue following CRS -207 in 
<5% of subjects.  To date , there have been no treatment -related SAEs, significant 
laboratory abnormalities or safety signals.

CRS -207 in the Phase 1 study.  The proposed dose level for this study (1 × 109

Phase 1 and Phase 2).  In addition, 3 of 4 evaluable patients at this dose level in 
the Phase 1 study demonstrated CRS -207- induced mesothelin- specific CD8+ T

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 7 1.3 RATIONALE  FOR USE  OF LOW -DOS E CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AND 
CRS -207 
Cyclophosphamide (Cy) is currently approved as a high -dose chemotherapy 
agent, however, when administered at low -doses, it has exhibited immune -
modulatory effects, namely in the suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs).[ADDRESS_262546] that immune -modulating doses of Cy may enhance vaccine -induced 
antitumor immune responses by [CONTACT_119956]4+ CD25+ regulatory T  cell activity.   
Several studies have demonstrated this concept and shown prolonged survival of 
patients receiving low -doses of Cy 24-72 hours prior to vaccination with minimal 
side effects .1,2,45,46  
Increased vaccine-induced T cell responses and  improved survival has been 
demonstrated in nonclinical studies of CRS -207 administered  with immune -
modulatory doses of Cy.  In mice administered 50 mg/kg Cy (equivalent to 140 
mg/m2 human dose), immune responses measured seven days after administration 
of CRS -207 demonstrated that the combination of Cy and CRS -207 increased 
mesothelin -specific T cell responses compared to saline and CRS -207 alone.  In a 
lung tumor model, tumor -bearing mice received  50 or 100 mg/kg Cy 
(corresponding to 140 to 280 mg/m2 of the human dose equivalent, respectively) 
followed one day later with 2× 106 CFU CRS -207 or ANZ -100 ( the empty LADD 
platform strain , also named Lm11) and were monitored for survival over 90 days.  
The combination of low -dose Cy and CRS -207 increased the rate of survival to 
100% compared to CRS -207 alone (60% survival) or Cy alone (0%, mOS = 33.5 
days)  (Figure 1 ).  The combination of Cy and LADD- based vaccines has been 
shown to improve anti -tumor efficacy compared to LADD -vaccine alone in 
several models.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 9 2.0 OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To determine the safety of CRS -207 (with or without Cy) when administered in 
combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin and to evaluate the induction of 
immune response to mesothelin as measured by [CONTACT_20129]-γ enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent spot  (ELISPOT ) assay prio r to treatment and at time points 
during and after treatment.    
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE S 
To evaluate objective tumor response, progression free survival, time to 
progression, overall survival  and the predictive value of serum mesothelin for 
therapeutic response  for each treatment regimen . 
2.3 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES  
i) to conduct immune subset analysis (e.g. CD4, CD8, T reg) and gene expression 
profiling of tumor tissue pre - and post -vaccination ; ii) to assess induction of anti -
mesothelin humoral immune response; iii) to measure tumor marker kinetics as biomarkers of tumor response ; iv) evaluate the association between improvement 
in pulmonary function and tumor response; v) evaluate the relationship of tumor 
response to overall survival.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 10 3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 BASIC DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS  
This is a phase 1B  study to evaluate the safety and induction of immune response 
of CRS -207 with or without low-dose Cy in combination with pemetrexed and 
cisplatin in front- line therapy in subjects  with MPM.  
Up to 16 subjects were originally planned to be enrolled in this study.  Up to an 
additional 44 subjects will be enrolled in an expansion phase of this study (for a 
total of up to 60 subjects) to obtain additional safety, immune and efficacy data.  
Subjects will be enrolled into 2 mutually exclusive cohorts described below.   
Cohort 1: At least 32 subjects will receive 2 prime vaccinations (PV) of CRS -207 
(1 × 109 CFU given i.v. over approximately 1  hour) 2 weeks apart followed 2 
weeks later by [CONTACT_8622] 6 cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin 3 weeks apart.  Three 
weeks after completion of chemotherapy, subjects will receive an additional 2 
infusions (boost vaccinations; BV) of CRS -207 3 weeks apart (Figure 1 ). Subjects 
enrolled in Cohort [ADDRESS_262548] 16 subjects enrolled into the expansion phase. 
Cohort 2: The remaining subjects enrolled in the expansion phase (up to 28 total) 
will receive  CRS -207 in combination with chemotherapy at the dose and schedule 
described above, however, these subjects will also receive low -dose Cy (200 
mg/m
2) over 30 minutes one day prior to each CRS-207 infusion (i.e. prior to each 
PV and BV infusion).   
All subjects will return to the clinic [ADDRESS_262549] vaccination for 
an End of Course  (EOC ) visit.  Subjects will have follow -up visits 4 weeks after 
the EOC  visit and every 8 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation .  
Subjects will continue to receive maintenance vaccinations (MV) with (Cohort 2) 
or without Cy (Cohort 1) following their original schedule at each  follow- up visit 
if they are clinically stable  and continue to meet dosing eligibility .  Subjects may 
continue on treatment with radiographic disease progression if subject is clinically 
stable and investigator believes the treatment may be  providing benefit. 
The study will consist of  a screening p eriod (within [ADDRESS_262550] 
administration of study drug), followed by [CONTACT_218603] 2.  Tumor assessment by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) with optional

off study.  Tumor biopsies, which are optional, will be performed pre -treatment, 
before start of chemotherapy (i.e. after initial 2 infusions of CRS -207) , after 
completion of chemotherapy, and after  CRS -207 to evaluate tumor lymphocytic 
(e.g. CD4, CD8 , T reg) infiltrate.   A seven -day course of antibiotics  will be 
administered to eliminate any residual CRS -207 beginning 7 days following the 
second infusion of CRS -207 during the induction phase, and after the final study 
dose of CRS-207.

To monitor initial safety of the sequential vaccine regimen, no more than  [ADDRESS_262552] 6 subjects.   Dose -limiting toxicities 
are defined in Section 3.6.  If >33% of subjects (i.e. 1 out of 3 subjects) 
experience a dose- limiting toxicity  during the study , the dose will be lowered to 3 
× 108 CFU for all subsequent dosing with CRS -207.  Blood will be collected at 
EOS to assess the clearance of CRS -207.

and clinically meaningful, it will be considered a dose- limiting toxicity.  Grade 3 
laboratory abnormalities should be repeated within 24- 72 hours  if clinically 
indicated and monitored as necessary to determine if event meets DLT criteria. 
DLTs  will be continuously monitored per cohort and across cohorts .  If more than 
33% of subjects  (i.e. 1 in 3 subjects) experience a DLT  at the starting dose of 1 × 
109 CFU, the dose will be lowered to 3 × 108 CFU for all subsequent dosing with 
CRS -207.  Subjects currently receiving treatment  may continue to receive CRS -
207 dosing at the lower dose  and all  subsequent subjects will receive CRS -207 at 
the lower dose.  DLTs  will continue to be monitored  at the lower dose.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 50 6.0 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING AES AND SAES  
6.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
The following definition of an AE will be used for this study: 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an 
investigational product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an  
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) product.  
Examples of AEs include the following: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the indication under 
study 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product 
administration, even if they were present before the start of the study 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with 
another medical product 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigatio nal product or a concurrent medication  
An overdose should not be reported as an AE or SAE; instead the symptoms 
resulting from the overdose should be reported as the AE or SAE. 
Examples of AEs do not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy) (Instead, 
the medical condition that led to the procedure is an AE.) 
• Situations that are unwanted but in which an untoward medical occurrence 
did not occur, for example social inconvenience after admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218563] , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 51 • Anticip ated day -to-day fluctuations of a preexisting disease or condition 
(present or detected before enrollment) that does not worsen overall 
• Expected progression of the disease being studied, including signs or 
symptoms of the disease being studied, unless progression is more severe 
than expected for the subject’s condition 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to perform periodic and special assessments for AEs.  The investigator and clinical staff will note all AEs offered by [CONTACT_218626], during administration of the CTM, and at the follow -up 
visit.  All clinical complaints volunteered by, or elicited from, the subject during the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the CRF for the study period indicated.  If any AE occurs, the s ubject will receive appropriate treatment and 
medical supervision.  
All AEs judged to be clinically significant, including clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities, will be followed until resolution.  All AEs will be summarized in the annual report or more frequently, if requested by [CONTACT_61462].  SAEs require special reporting in addition to documentation in the CRF 
as described below.  
6.2 DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  (SAE) 
In this study, the definition of an SAE is an AE that mee ts any of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
Note: The term life-threatening in the definition of serious  refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163506]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218564]’s office or out -patient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218565] , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 52 SAEs.  An occurrence or complication that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218566].  When there is doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should be considered an SAE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218567] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from its original baseline severity is not considered an SAE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218568] -207 infusion 
will not be considered an SAE unless the event me ets criteria for seriousness 
other than hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Note: The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include 
AEs of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g. 
sprained ankle), that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Other important medical event  
Note: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether reporting is appropriate for other i mportant medical events that may 
not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218569].  These events should also be considered serious.  
An SAE requires additional detailed reports and follow -up.  The content of these 
detailed reports must address the investigator’s estimate of causality.  
6.[ADDRESS_262625] (PV1 for Cohort 1 or XP1 for Cohort 2) through [ADDRESS_262626], any new event or experience that was not present at 
screening, or worsening of an event present at screening, is considered to be an 
AE.  Unchanged, chronic conditions are not AEs and should not be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review 
all documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostic reports) 
relative to the event.  The investi gator is to record all relevant information about 
any AE (including SAEs) on the AE page of the CRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records in lieu of the 
proper completion of the appropriate AE (or SAE) CRF pages.  However, there 
may be instances where copi[INVESTIGATOR_63475].  In such instances, all subject identifiers and PHI will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_218570].  
The investigator will also attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, should be documented on the appropri ate 
CRF as the AE or SAE.  In addition, SAEs need to be reported on the SAE report 
form provided in the  study procedures manual ( SPM ). The SPM provides 
additional guidelines. 
6.4 ASSESSMENT OF GRADE  
The investigator will make an assessment of grade for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, which will be recorded in the CRF.  The assessment will be 
based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTC AE, Version 4.03, and graded as 
shown below: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnos tic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately 
life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; 
disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living

highest level experience by [CONTACT_423].  
6.[ADDRESS_262627] labeling information for marketed products in the determination of the assessment. 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is very important that the investigator always assess causality for every event before the transmission of the SAE.  The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_218571] -up information, amending the SAE report.  The 
causality assessment ( Table 3 ) is one of the criteria used to determine regulatory 
reporting requirements and should not be left blank.

3. To facilitate Aduro’s rapid dissemination of information about AEs to other 
investigators or sites in a multicenter study by [CONTACT_218628]  
4. To facilitate investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk 
to human subjects to the IRB and institutional biosafety committee  
In the event an SAE is observed, the SAE report will be completed as thoroughly 
as possible including the following: 
• All available details about the event  
• Signature [CONTACT_218682].  If the investigator does not have all information about an 
SAE, the investigator will not wait to receive additional information before 
notifying the  sponsor of the event and completing the form.  The form will be 
updated when additional information is received.  
Aduro will report all SAEs that are unexpected and considered possibly or 
probably related to the administration of the investigational agents to the Food and Drug Administration in the form of an expedited safety report within 15 calendar days after receiving information on the SAE.  Aduro will also report 
to the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes

6.8.1 S uspected Infection with CRS -207 or Listeria 
Suspected infection with CRS -207 and/or Listeria are considered adverse events 
of special interest (AESI) and should be reported following SAE reporting 
procedures irrespective of temporal relationship to study drug administration.  In 
the event a subject has a positive Listeria or CRS -[ADDRESS_262633] be sent to Sponsor or designee for testing to confirm CRS -207. Instructions on collection, 
storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_70689] -207 testing are provided in the Central 
Laboratory Manual.  
If Listeria ha s been confirmed at the clinical site or an external laboratory, all 
efforts should be made to obtain a sample of the bacterial isolate from the original 
positive culture and submit to the Sponsor for strain confirmation; records on all 
samples cultured during this period must be obtained and provided to the Sponsor.  
Refer to the Central Laboratory Manual for sample collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
If infection with CRS -207 is confirmed or suspected, IV antibiotics ( Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) should be initiated as soon as possible and follow -up cultures obtained 
periodically to confirm absence/clearance of any CRS -[ADDRESS_262634] 
DISCONTINUATION 
7.1 PREMATURE STUDY OR STUDY SITE TERMINATION 
If Aduro, the investigator, the medical monitor, the study monitor, or appropriate 
regulatory officials discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study center should be terminated, this 
action may be taken after appro priate consultation among Aduro, the investigator, 
the medical monitor, and the study monitor.  Conditions that may warrant 
termination of the study include, but are not limited to the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects 
enrolled in the study 
• A decision on the part of Aduro to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the product for any reason          
A study conducted at a single study site in a multicenter study may also warrant  
termination under the following conditions: 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable 
rate 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulations of 
appropriate regulatory authorities  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to 
Aduro, the study monitor, or appropriate regulatory authority 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements  
Study termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with the 
conditions set forth in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6, 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, Sections 4.12, 4.13, 5.20, and 5.21.

after CRS -207 (with or without Cy), (2) after receiving chemotherapy, and (3) 
after receiving two subsequent doses of CRS -207 (with or without Cy) following 
chemotherapy.  Change from baseline will be compared via paired t -test of log -
transformed post/pre ELISPOT values and assessed for statistical significance via 
Hochberg multiplicity alpha adjustment.   T cell responses to mesothelin will be 
considered positive when the f requency of specific responses  are ≥ 1 in 10
5 CD8+ 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) above the control sample and increased by [CONTACT_12697] 2 -fold compared to baseline.  T cell responses to Lm (LLO) will be 
considered positive when specific T cell frequencies were ≥ [ADDRESS_262643] 2 -fold compared to baseline.   In addition, if change from  
baseline in the logarithmic scale  is not normally distributed (that is, if p<0.[ADDRESS_262644]) then a Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed instead. 
Analyses of other efficacy endpoints including changes in PFTs, objective tumor 
response, progression free survival, time to progression and overall survival will 
be conducted on the full analysis and per protocol populations.  Time to event 
data will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods and will be calculated from 
date of first dose of study treatment.  Further details on the analyses  including 
censoring strategies  will be described in a statistical analysis plan.  
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate t he relationship between PFT 
improvement and tumor response, as well as to evaluate the relationship between 
overall survival and tumor response.

to retrieve these records or arrange for the transfer of these records to an alternate 
electronic format or to paper. 
Changes to any electronic records requires an audit trail, in accordance with 
21 CFR 11.10(e), and should include who made the changes and when and why the changes were made.  An audit trail is defined as a secure, computer -generated, 
time-stamped electronic record that will allow reconstruction of the course of 
events relating to the creation, modification, and deletion of an electronic record.  Audit trails must be created incrementally, in chronological order, and in a manner that does not allow new audit trail information to overwrite existing data.  
Finally, audit trails should be in a readable format and readily available at the 
study site and any other location where electronic study records are maintained.  
Audit trails are generated automatically for electronic CRFs.  The investigator is responsible for maintaining audit trails of all electronic data systems used for

Background: The growth pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma makes the use of RECIST (response
evaluation criteria in solid tumours) response crite ria difficult. We have developed and validated Modified
RECIST criteria adapted to the growth pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Patients and methods: We evaluated 73 patients from two clinical trials of cisplatin/gemcitabine chemo-
therapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum
was measured in two positions at three separate levels on thoracic CT scans. The sum of the six measurements
defined a pleural unidimensional measure. Bidimensionally measureable lesions were measured unidimension-ally as for RECIST. All measurements were added to obtain the total tumour measurement. A reduction of
at least 30% on two occasions 4 weeks apart defi ned a partial response; an increase of 20% over the nadir
measurement, progressive disease. The validity of the modified criteria was gauged by [CONTACT_218643].
Results: Response according to these criteria predicted for superior survival (15.1 versus 8.9 months; P = 0.03)
and forced vital capacity (FVC) increase during treatment ( P <0.0001). A significant correlation between
change in linear tumour measurement and FVC was seen ( R = 0.63; P = 0.0001).
Conclusion: These Modified RECIST criteria for tumour response correlate with survival and lung function
and can be used to measure outcome in pleural mesothelioma.

Introduction
The ability to measure reproducibly tumour response to treatment
is vital in the development of new drugs and therapeutic combina-tions, particularly for the conducting of phase II studies. Con-
ventional response criteria have always been difficult to apply to
malignant mesothelioma due to its unique pattern of growth.
Malignant mesothelioma most  commonly grows as a ‘rind’
around the pleural surface, and on computed tomography (CT)scan may not produce spherical lesions with bidimensionallymeasurable diameters. The WHO criteria [1] are poorly suited toevaluating response in mesothelioma, as they were developedprincipally to assess bidimensionally measurable disease. Whenused for unidimensional measurement, these criteria require a 50%decrease in the sum of unidimensional measurements to define apartial response (PR). This equates to a 75% decrease in the sumof the products of perpendicular diameters rather than the 50%decrease required to define response in bidimensionally measur-
able lesions.The recently developed RECIST (response evaluation criteria
in solid tumours) criteria [2] are more suited to tumour assessment
in mesothelioma, as they specify the use of unidimensional measure-
ments, with PR defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the
longest diameter for all target lesions. However, the selection of
measurement sites in mesothelioma is difficult, and without fur-
ther definition of the method of measurement, the RECIST criteriacould be applied differently by [CONTACT_218644] (Figure
1A). Early experience suggests that modification of the criteria
may be required in the special case of mesothelioma [3].
We have developed a modification of the RECIST criteria
specifically to address the diffi culties of measurement inherent in
assessing changes in tumour bulk in pleural mesothelioma. We
have previously performed two phase II clinical trials of the use ofcisplatin and gemcitabine in patients with measurable pleuralmesothelioma; a single centre st udy [4] and a subsequent confirm-
atory multicentre study [5]. In these studies, response rates of
47.6% [4] and 33% [5] were seen. Response criteria that incor-
porated both unidimensional and bidimensional measurements
had been developed and used to assess response in these two trials(‘original response criteria’). Using Modified RECIST criteria,we have now reassessed the response to treatment for a total of

Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8 CRS-[ADDRESS_262662] scans
were performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy, and then twice a month
until disease progression. Forced vital capacity (FVC) had been measuredprior to study entry and on day [ADDRESS_262663] measurement. For unidimensionally
measurable lesions, thickness of pleural  tumour was measured at two separate
sites on each of the three levels and the six measurements summated to pro-
duce a total measurement. Palpable mass es were measured clinically on day 1
of each cycle as for bidimensionally  measurable lesions. A pleural effusion
was not considered a measurable lesion.
Tumour response was defined as: (i) complete response (CR): disappear-
ance of all known disease, determined by [CONTACT_218645] 4 weeksapart; (ii) PR: a ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular
diameters of bidimensionally measured lesions on two occasions not less than4 weeks apart, or a ≥30% decrease in the sum of linear tumour measurements
on two observations not less than 4 weeks apart; (iii) no change: a decrease in
bidimensional tumour area of <50% or an increase of <25%, or a decrease in
the sum of unidimensional measurements of <30% or an increase of <25%,provided no new lesions have appe ared; (iv) progressive disease: a ≥25%
increase in the size of the tumour be ing measured (unidimensi onal or bidimen-
sional) or the appearance of new lesions.
Where response at sites measured bidimensionally differed from that at
sites measured unidimensionally, the overall patient response was assessed by[CONTACT_218646]. The sites with dominant tumour bulk were favoured.
The protocols for each study were approved by [CONTACT_218647][INVESTIGATOR_218575]. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient before entry.
Modified RECIST criteria
Modified RECIST criteria were developed.  The major problems in applying
the RECIST criteria to malignant ple ural mesothelioma are in the interpreta-
tion of the meaning and placement of th e ‘longest unidimensi onal diameter’ of
the target tumour mass to be measured. The longest diameter of a tumour mass
is frequently that which follows the inner curve of the chest wall. Defining thelimits of such a diameter  is often problematical. When the tumour regresses
with treatment the line may cross an area outside the tumour margin because ofthe curve of the chest wall. This may produce difficulty with reproducibility ofmeasurement. Furthermore, the longest tumour diameter may be between two
fixed structures, such as the thoracic vertebrae and the carina, and measure-
ment in these areas may not fully reflect tumour response.The Modified RECIST criteria we have developed were as follows. Tumour
thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum was measured in two
positions at three separate levels on transverse cuts of CT scan (Figure 1B).The sum of the six measurements defi ned a pleural unidimensional measure.
Transverse cuts at least [ADDRESS_262664] a 30% reduction in the
total tumour measurement. A confirmed response required a repeat obser-vation on two occasions 4 weeks apart. Progressive disease (PD) was definedas an increase of at least 20% in th e total tumour measurement over the nadir
measurement, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Patients withstable disease (SD) were those who ful filled the criteria for neither PR nor PD.

Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8 CRS-[ADDRESS_262665] criteri a. Patients were assigned to one of
two groups: responding patients (‘responders’) and patients with SD or PD
(‘non-responders’). Overall su rvival from the start of treatment and serial
changes in FVC were analysed for these two groups as a surrogate measure ofpatient benefit.
Results
Tumour measurements from a total of [ADDRESS_262666]. Of 81 time points originally showing PR, 72remained classified as PR, five became SD and four became PD.Of 105 time points originally showing SD, 93 remained as SD, 11became PR and one became PD. Of 50 time points originallyshowing PD, 47 remained PD, two became SD and one becamePR (Table 1). The overall confir med response rate as assessed by
[CONTACT_218649], as two patients classified as SDbecame PR and two patients classifi ed as PR became SD (Table 2).
Median survival was plotted as  a Kaplan–Meier curve for the
responding and non-responding patients (Figure 2). There was
a statistically significant difference in survival between thetwo patient groups (log rank test P = 0.03). Median survival was
15.1 months for responding patients and 8.9 months for non-responding patients.
FVC was plotted as a percentage of starting FVC for the
responding and non-responding patients (Figure 3). FVC improvedsignificantly over the course of treatment for responding patientsas compared with non-responding patients ( P = 0.0001).
The change in FVC against change in linear tumour measure-
ment was plotted for each patient (Figure 4); a significant cor-
relation was seen ( R = 0.63, P = 0.001).
Discussion
The response criteria used in our previous two trials of chemo-therapy in mesothelioma inc orporated bidimensional measure-
ments, as the WHO response criteria were widely used when thefirst of these trials began accrua l. These response criteria were
not altered for the second trial, which sought to broaden theapplicability of our findings in the first single-centre study into aTable 1.  Comparison of response at individual time point observations

··• ·- Respond ing patients 
-o- Non-responding patients [ADDRESS_262669] criteria could, however, be variably interpreted by
[CONTACT_218650], and this may lead tounsatisfactory results [3]. We have developed Modified RECISTcriteria that are specifically designed to address the unique growthpattern of pleural malignant me sothelioma. Use of these modified
response criteria did not materially alter the response rates in ourtwo previous trials. However, the modified criteria avoided diffi-cult and ambiguous situations that arose in response interpretationin the two previous trials; for example, how to evaluate responsewhen discordance between unidi mensional and bidimensional
lesions occurred.
Whilst tumour response and progression directly reflect changes
in tumour bulk, they are most clinically useful when they relateclosely to other measures of a patient’s condition. Response is asurrogate for patient benefit in the evaluation of new drugs and
combinations. Patient benefit in pleural mesothelioma may include
an improvement in survival or lung function, and improvement insymptom control or quality of life. Thus, it is important that anyvalid measurement of response should reflect changes in theseparameters. We have demonstrated that these Modified RECISTcriteria successfully distinguish between responders and non-responders for the parameters of survival and change in FVC, thusdemonstrating their validity.
Further evaluation of these modified criteria should be per-
formed before they can be incorporated routinely into future clin-ical trials. The development of an automated measurement formatmay enhance the speed and reproducibility of the measurements[6] and go some way to overcoming the potential problem of inter-observer variability. We have avoided this issue by [CONTACT_218651]. Testsof inter-observer variability are important, however, as has beendemonstrated in the assessment of response in lung cancer [7]. Toconfirm the practicality of the criteria they should be applied to agroup of clinicians who lack extensive experience in the measure-ment of mesothelioma in clinical trials.

1.3 Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung  Cancer - After Prior Chemotherapy
ALIMTA is indicated as a single-agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-
small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy.1.4 Mesothelioma
ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma whose 
disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.1.5 Limitations of Use
ALIMTA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer. [see Clinical Studies 
(14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
2.1 Combination Use with Cisplatin
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m2administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 
21-day cycle. The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2infused over 2 hours beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end
of ALIMTA administration. Patients should receive appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin. See cisplati n
package insert for more information.
2.2 Single-Agent Use
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m2administered as an intravenous infusion over [ADDRESS_262679] dose of ALIMTA; and dosing should continue during the full course of therapy and for [ADDRESS_262680] also receive one (1) intramuscular injection of vitamin B 12during the week preceding the first dose of ALIMTA and 
every [ADDRESS_262681] commonly used dose of oral folic 
acid in clinical trials was 400 mcg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .
Corticosteroid
Skin rash has been reported more frequently in patients not pretreated with a corticosteroid. Pretreatment with dexamethasone 
(or equivalent) reduces the incidence and severity of cutaneous reaction. In clinical trials, dexamethasone 4 mg was given by [CONTACT_218653], the day of, and the day after ALIMTA administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .
2.4 Laboratory Monitoring and Dose Reduction/Discontinuation Recommendations
Monitoring
Complete blood cell counts, including platelet counts, should be performed on all patients receiving ALIMTA. Patients should 
be monitored for nadir and recovery, which were tested in the clinical study before each dose and on days 8 and 15 of each cycle . 
Patients should not begin a new cycle of treatment unless the ANC is ൒1500 cells/mm3, the platelet count is ൒100,000 cells/mm3, and 
creatinine clearance is ൒45 mL/min. Periodic chemistry tests should be performed to evaluate renal and hepatic function [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] .
Dose Reduction Recommendations
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir hematologic counts or maximum nonhematologic 
toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery, pat ients 
should be retreated using the guidelines in Tables 1-3, which are suitable for using ALIMTA as a single-agent or in combination with 
cisplatin.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc.

Nadir ANC <500/mm3and nadir platelets ൒50,000/mm3. 75% of previous dose (pemetrexed and cisplatin).
Nadir platelets <50,000/mm3without bleeding regardless of nadir ANC. 75% of previous dose ( pemetrexed and cisplatin).
Nadir platelets <50,000/mm3with bleedinga, regardless of nadir ANC. 50% of previous dose (pemetrexed and cisplatin).
aThese criteria meet the CTC version 2.0 (NCI 1998) definition of ൒CTC Grade 2 bleeding.
If patients develop nonhematologic toxicities (excluding neurotoxicity) ൒Grade 3, treatment should be withheld until 
resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s pre-therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to guidelines in Tab le 2.

Discontinuation Recommendation
ALIMTA therapy should be discontinued if a patient experiences any hematologic or nonhematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed.
Renally Impaired Patients
In clinical studies, patients with creatinine clearance ൒45 mL/min required no dose adjustments other than those 
recommended for all patients. Insufficient numbers of patients with creatinine clearance below 45 mL/min have been treated to ma ke 
dosage recommendations for this group of patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, ALIMTA should not be 
administered to patients whose creatinine clearance is <45 mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula (below) or GFR 
measured by [CONTACT_21851]99m-DPTA serum clearance method:
Males:[140 - Age in years] × Actual Body Weight (kg)= mL/min72 × Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)
Females: Estimated creatinine clearance for males × 0.85
Caution should be exercised when administering ALIMTA concurrently with NSAIDs to patients whose creatinine clearance 
is <80 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
2.5 Preparation and Administration Precautions
As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion 
solutions of ALIMTA. The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of ALIMTA contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and  
thoroughly with soap and water. If ALIMTA contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Several published 
guidelines for handling and disposal of anticancer agents are available [see References (15)] .
ALIMTA is not a vesicant. There is no specific antidote for extravasation of ALIMTA. To date, there have been few reported 
cases of ALIMTA extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by [CONTACT_093]. ALIMTA extravasation should be managed
with local standard practice for extravasation as with other non-vesicants.
2.6 Preparation for Intravenous Infusion Administration
1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of ALIMTA for intravenous infusion administration.
2. Calculate the dose of ALIMTA and determine the number of vials needed. Vials contain either 100 mg or 500 mg of
ALIMTA. The vials contain an excess of ALIMTA to facilitate delivery of label amount.
3. Reconstitute each 100-mg vial with 4.2 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). Reconstitute each
500-mg vial with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). Reconstitution of either size vial gives aProtocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 87

solution containing 25 mg/mL ALIMTA. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting 
solution is clear and ranges in color from colorless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. 
The pH of the reconstituted ALIMTA solution is between 6.[ADDRESS_262682] be further diluted into a solution of 0.9% Sodium
Chloride Injection (preservative free), so that the total volume of solution is 100 ml. ALIMTA is administered as anintravenous infusion over 10 minutes.
6. Chemical and physical stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of ALIMTA were demonstrated for up to 24 hours
following initial reconstitution, when stored at refrigerated or ambient room temperature [see USP Controlled RoomTemperature] and lighting. When prepared as directed, reconstitution and infusion solutions of ALIMTA contain noantimicrobial preservatives. Discard any unused portion.
Reconstitution and further dilution prior to intravenous infusion is only recommended with 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection (preservative free). ALIMTA is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP and Ringer’s Injection, USP and therefore these should not be used. Coadministration of ALIMTA with other drugs 
and diluents has not been studied, and therefore is not recommended. ALIMTA is compatible with standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  
administration sets and intravenous solution bags.
[ADDRESS_262683] be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B 12as a prophylactic measure to reduce 
treatment-related hematologic and GI toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . In clinical studies, less overall toxicity and 
reductions in Grade 3/4 hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities su ch as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infection with 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B 12was administered.
Corticosteroid Supplementation
Skin rash has been reported more frequently in patients not pretreated with a corticosteroid in clinical trials. Pretreatment wi th 
dexamethasone (or equivalent) reduces the incidence and severity of cutaneous reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .
5.2 Bone Marrow Suppression
ALIMTA can suppress bone marrow function, as manifested by [CONTACT_127867], thrombocytopenia, and anemia (or pancytopenia) 
[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] ; myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based 
on nadir ANC, platelet count, and maximum nonhematologic toxicity seen in the previous cycle [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.4)] .
5.3 Decreased Renal Function
ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged by [CONTACT_13624]. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with creatinine 
clearance ൒45 mL/min. Insufficient numbers of patients have been studied with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min to give a dose 
recommendation. Therefore, ALIMTA should not be administered to patients whose creatinine clearance is <45 mL/min [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.4)] .
One patient with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 19 mL/min) who did not receive folic acid and vitamin B 12
died of drug-related toxicity following administration of ALIMTA alone.
5.4 Use with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) with Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency
Caution should be used when administer ing NSAIDs concurren tly with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
5.5 Required Laboratory Monitoring
Patients should not begin a new cycle of treatment unless the ANC is ൒1500 cells/mm3, the platelet count is 
൒100,000 cells /mm3, and creatinine clearance is ൒45 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .
5.6 Pregnancy Category D
Based on its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pemetrexed 
administered intraperitoneally to mice during organogenesis was embr yotoxic, fetotoxic and teratogenic in mice at greater than 
1/833rd the recommended human dose. If ALIMTA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this 
drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to  avoid Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc.

becoming pregnant. Women should be advised to use effective contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy during treatment with
ALIMTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .
[ADDRESS_262684] common adverse reactions (incidence ൒20%) during therapy with ALIMTA as a single-agent were 
fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. Additional common adverse reactions (incidence ൒20%) during therapy with ALIMTA when used in 
combination with cisplatin included vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, and 
constipation.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
Although ibuprofen (400 mg four times a day) can decrease the clearance of pemetrexed, it can be administered with 
ALIMTA in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ൒80 mL/min). No dose adjustment of ALIMTA is needed with 
concomitant NSAIDs in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .
Caution should be used when administering NSAIDs concurrently with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min). NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethac in)
should be avoided for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, 
nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following 
ALIMTA administration. If concomitant administration of NSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, 
especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
7.2 Nephrotoxic DrugsProtocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 93
10
ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Concomitant 
administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. Concomitant administration of substances that are 
also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
Based on its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no 
adequate and well controlled studies of ALIMTA in pregnant women. Pemetrexed was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic in 
mice. In mice, repeated intraperitoneal doses of pemetrexed when given during organogenesis caused fetal malformations (incompl ete 
ossification of talus and skull bone; about 1/833rd the recommended intravenous human dose on a mg/m2basis), and cleft palate 
(1/33rd the recommended intravenous human dose on a mg/m2basis). Embryotoxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_218655]-fetal 
deaths and reduced litter sizes. If ALIMTA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the 
patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effec tive 
contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy during the treatment with ALIMTA.
8.3 Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether ALIMTA or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human 
milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ALIMTA, a decision should be made to 
discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother.
8.4 Pediatric Use
Efficacy of ALIMTA in pediatric patients has not been demonstrated. ALIMTA was administered as an intravenous infusion 
over 10 minutes on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle to pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors in a Phase 1 study (32 patients) an d a 
Phase 2 study (72 patients). All patients received pretreatment with vitamin B 12and folic acid supplementation and dexamethasone. 
The dose escalation in the Phase 1 study determined the maximum tolerated dose was 1910 mg/m2and this dose (or 60 mg/kg for 
patients <12 months old) was evaluated in the Phase 2 study of patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, Ewing 
sarcoma/peripheral PNET, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma/supratentorial PNET, or non-brainstem high grade glioma. No responses were observed among the [ADDRESS_262692] common toxicities reported were hematological (leukopenia, neutropenia/granulocytopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia), liver function abnormalities (increased ALT/AST), fatigue, and nausea. 
The single dose pharmacokinetics of ALIMTA administered in doses ranging from 400 to 2480 mg/m
2were evaluated in the 
Phase 1 trial in 22 patients (13 males and 9 females) aged 4 to 18 years (average age 12 years). Pemetrexed exposure (AUC and C max)
appeared to increase proportionally with dose. The average pemetrexed clearance (2.30 L/h/m2) and half-life (2.3 hours) in pediatric 
patients were comparable to values reported in adults.
8.[ADDRESS_262693] decreased renal function, care should be  taken 
in dose selection. Renal function monitoring is recommended with administration of ALIMTA. No dose reductions other than those 
recommended for all patients are necessary for patients 65 years of age or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .
In the initial treatment non-small cell lung cancer clinical trial, 37.7% of patients treated with ALIMTA plus cisplatin were 
൒65 years and Grade 3/4 neutropenia was greater as compared to patients <65 years (19.9% versus 12.2%). For patients <65 years, the 
HR for overall survival was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.10) and for patients ൒65 years the HR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.06) in the intent to 
treat population.
In the maintenance non-small cell lung cancer trial 33.3% of patients treated with ALIMTA were ൒65 years and no 
differences were seen in Grade 3/4 adverse reactions as compared to patients <65 years. For patients <65 years, the HR for overall  
survival was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.93) and for patients ൒65 years the HR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.21) in the intent to treat 
population.
In the non-small cell lung cancer trial after prior chemotherapy, 29.7% patients treated with ALIMTA were ൒65 years and 
Grade 3/4 hypertension was greater as compared to patients <65 years. For patients <65 years, the HR for overall survival was 0.95  
(95% CI: 0.76, 1.19), and for patients ൒65 years the HR was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.68) in the intent to treat population.
The mesothelioma trial included 36.7% patients treated with ALIMTA plus cisplatin that were ൒65 years, and Grade 3/4 
fatigue, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were greater as compared to patients <65 years. For patients <65 years, th e 
HR for overall survival was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.96) and for patients ൒65 years, the HR was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.22) in the intent 
to treat population.

ALIMTA is known to be primarily excreted by [CONTACT_8212]. Decreased renal function will result in reduced clearance and 
greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and

[ADDRESS_262695] been few cases of ALIMTA overdose. Reported toxicities included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
mucositis, and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as manifested by [CONTACT_127867], 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia. In addition, infection with or without fever, diarrhea, and mucositis may be seen. If an overdose  
occurs, general supportive measures should be instituted as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1963].
In clinical trials, leucovorin was permitted for CTC Grade 4 leukopenia lasting ൒3 days, CTC Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 
൒3 days, and immediately for CTC Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 
or 4 mucositis. The following intravenous doses and schedules of leucovorin were recommended for intravenous use: 100 mg/m2, 
intravenously once, followed by [CONTACT_13432], 50 mg/m2, intravenously every 6 hours for 8 days.
The ability of ALIMTA to be dialyzed is unknown.
11 DESCRIPTION
Pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate has the chemical name L-Glutamic acid, N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H -
pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-, disodium salt, heptahydrate. It is a white to almost-white solid with a molecular formula 
of C 20H19N5Na2O6•7H 2O and a molecular weight of 597.49. The structural formula is as follows:
ALIMTA is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion available in single-dose vials. The product is a 
white to either light yellow or green-yellow lyophilized solid. Each 100-mg or 500-mg vial of ALIMTA contains pemetrexed 
disodium equivalent to 100 mg pemetrexed and 106 mg mannitol or 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg mannitol, respectively. 
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH.
[ADDRESS_262696] shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS ),

dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltr ansferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes 
involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by [CONTACT_218656]. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to 
polyglutamate forms by [CONTACT_218657]. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibito rs of 
TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, is thought to occur  to 
a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites are thought to have an increased intracellular half-life resulti ng in 
prolonged drug action in malignant cells.
12.[ADDRESS_262697] shown that pemetrexed inhibits the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO-211H, 
NCI-H2052). Studies with the MSTO-211H mesothelioma cell line showed synergistic effects when pemetrexed was combined 
concurrently with cisplatin.
Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) following single-agent administration of ALIMTA to patients not receiving folic acid and 
vitamin B 12supplementation were characterized using population pharmacodynamic analyses. Severity of hematologic toxicity, as 
measured by [CONTACT_13435], correlates with the systemic exposure, or area under the curve (AUC) of pemetrexed. It w as 
also observed that lower ANC nadirs occurred in patients with elevated baseline cystathionine or homocysteine concentrations. Th e 
levels of these substances can be reduced by [CONTACT_13436] B 12supplementation. There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed 
exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles.
Time to ANC nadir with pemetrexed systemic exposure (AUC), varied between 8 to 9.6 days over a range of exposures from 
38.3 to 316.8 mcg• hr/mL. Return to baseline ANC occurred 4.2 to 7.5 days after the nadir over the same range of exposures.
12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorption
The pharmacokinetics of ALIMTA administered as a single-agent in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m

10-minute period have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed total systemic
exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed
do not change over multiple treatment cycles.
Distribution
Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 16.1 liter s. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 
81% bound to plasma proteins. Binding is not affected by [CONTACT_13437].Metabolism and Excretion
Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent a nd is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose 
recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. The clearance decreases, and exposure (AUC) increases, as 
renal function decreases. The total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life of pemetrexed is 
3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min). 
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed in special populations were examined in about 400 patients in controlled and single arm 
studies.
In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 (organic anion transporter 3), a transporter that may play a 
role in active secretion of pemetrexed.
Effect of Age
No effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed was observed over a range of [ADDRESS_262698] not been conducted [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .
Effect of Renal Insufficiency
Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with reduced renal function. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed 
decreases as renal function decreases, with a resultant increase in systemic exposure. Patients with creatinine clearances of 45, 50, and 
80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, respectively in pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .
Effect of Third Space Fluid
The effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion and ascites, on ALIMTA is not fully defined. A study of ALIMTA 
500 mg/m
2was performed in [ADDRESS_262699] space fluid (All but [ADDRESS_262700] space fluid). Moderate pleural effusion was defined in the study as less than 1/[ADDRESS_262701] of Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen doses of 400 mg four times a day reduce pemetrexed’s clearance by [CONTACT_2902] 20% (and increase AUC by 20%) in 
patients with normal renal function. The effect of greater doses of ibuprofen on pemetrexed pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Drug 
Interactions (7.1)] .
Effect of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218577], administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. 
The effect of greater doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218578].
Effect of Cisplatin
Cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics of total platinum are unaltered by 
[CONTACT_13438].Effect of Vitamins
Coadministration of oral folic acid or intramuscular vitamin B
12does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.
Drugs Metabolized by [CONTACT_13439] P450 Enzymes
Results from in vitro studies with human liver microsomes predict that pemetrexed would not cause clinically significant 
inhibition of metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2.
[ADDRESS_262702] been conducted with pemetrexed. Pemetrexed was clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus 
assay in mouse bone marrow but was not mutagenic in multiple in vitro tests (Ames assay, CHO cell assay). Pemetrexed administered 
at i.v. doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day or greater to male mice (about 1/1666 the recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis) resulted in 
reduced fertility, hypospermia, and testicular atrophy.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - Combination with Cisplatin
A multi-center, randomized, open-label study in 1725 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC was conducted to 
compare the overall survival following treatment with ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin (AC) versus gemcitabine in 
combination with cisplatin (GC). ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2with cisplatin 
administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m2after ALIMTA administration, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Gemcitabine was 
administered at a dose of 1250 mg/m2on Day 1 and Day 8, and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m2after 
administration of gemcitabine, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles, and patients in 
both treatment arms received folic acid, vitamin B 12, and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .
Patient demographics of the intent to treat (ITT) popula tion are shown in Table 9. The demographics and disease 
characteristics were well balanced.

14.2 Non-Small Cell Lung  Cancer - Maintenance
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, p lacebo-controlled study was conducted in 663 patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC 
who did not progress after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who did not progress were randomized 2:1 to rec eive 
ALIMTA or placebo immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 
10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, until disease progression. Patients in both study arms received folic 
acid, vitamin B 12, and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .
The study was designed to demonstrate superior progression-free survival and overall survival of ALIMTA over placebo. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by [CONTACT_193384]. Patient characteristics of the intent to treat (ITT) populati on are 
shown in Table 12. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms.

14.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Ca ncer - After Prior Chemotherapy
A multi-center, randomized, open label study was conducted in pa tients with Stage III or IV NSCLC after prior chemotherapy 
to compare the overall survival following treatment with ALIMTA versus docetaxel. ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 
10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2and docetaxel was administered at 75 mg/m2as a 1-hour intravenous infusion. Both drugs were 
given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. All patients treated with  ALIMTA received vitamin supplementation with folic acid and 
vitamin B 12. The study was intended to show either an overall survival superiority or non-inferiority of ALIMTA to docetaxel. Patient 
demographics of the intent to treat (ITT) population are shown in Table 15.

14.4 Malig nant Pleural Mesothelioma
A multi-center, randomized, single-blind study in 448 chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 
compared survival in patients treated with ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin to survival in patients receiving cisplatin alo ne. 
ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2and cisplatin was administered intravenously over 
2 hours at a dose of 75 mg/m2beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of administration of ALIMTA. Both drugs were 
given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. After 117 patients were treated, white cell and GI toxicity led to a change in protocol where by

The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all patients randomly assigned to treatment who 
received study drug (randomized and treated). An analysis was also performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B 12
supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented), as supplementation is recommended [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3)] . Results in all patients and those fully supplemented were similar. Patient demographics are shown in Table 18.

Similar results were seen in the analysis of patients (N=303) with confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. There were too few non-white patients to assess possible ethnic differences. The effect in women (median survival  
15.7 months with the combination versus 7.5 mo nths on cisplatin alone), however, was larger than the effect in males (median survi val 
11 versus 9.4 respectively). As with any exploratory analysis, it is not clear whether this difference is real or is a chance fin ding.
Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Survival Time for ALIMTA plus Cisplatin and Cisplatin Alone in all Randomized and 
Treated Patients.
Objective tumor response for malignant pleural mesothelioma is difficult to measure and response criteria are not universally
agreed upon. However, based upon prospectively defined criteria, the objective tumor response rate for ALIMTA plus cisplatin wa s 
greater than the objective tumor response rate for cisplatin alone. There was also improvement in lung function (forced vital ca pacity) 
in the ALIMTA plus cisplatin arm compared to the control arm.
Patients who received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12during study therapy received a median of 6 and 
4 cycles in the ALIMTA/cisplatin (N=168) and cisplatin (N=163) arms, respectively. Patients who never received folic acid and 
vitamin B 12during study therapy received a median of 2 cycles in both treatment arms (N=32 and N=38 for the ALIMTA/cisplatin 
and cisplatin arm, respectively). Patients receiving ALIMTA in the fully supplemented group received a relative dose intensity of 93% 
of the protocol specified ALIMTA dose intensity; patients treated with cisplatin in the same group received 94% of the projecte d dose 
intensity. Patients treated with cisplatin alone had a dose intensity of 96%.

PLATINOL
(cisplatin for injection, USP) 
WARNING
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) should be administered under the supervision 
of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. 
Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate 
diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. 
Cumulative renal toxicity associated with PLATINOL is severe. Other major dose-related 
toxicities are myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting. 
Ototoxicity, which may be more pronounced in children, and is manifested by [CONTACT_218661], 
and/or loss of high frequency hearing and occasionally deafness, is significant. 
Anaphylactic-like  reactions to PLATINOL have been reported. Facial edema, 
bronchoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypotension may occur within minutes of 
PLATINOL administration. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, and antihistamines have been 
effectively employed to al leviate symptoms (see WARNINGS  and ADVERSE 
REACTIONS ).
Exercise caution to prevent inadvertent PLATINOL overdose.  Doses greater than 
100 mg/m2/cycle once every [ADDRESS_262709] be taken to avoid 
inadvertent PLATINOL overdose due to confusion with PARAPLATIN (carboplatin) 
or prescribing practices that fail to differentiate daily doses from total dose per cycle. 
DESCRIPTION 
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) is a white to light yellow lyophilized powder. 
Each vial of PLATINOL contains 50 mg cisplatin, 450 mg Sodium Chloride, USP, and 
500 mg Mannitol, USP. 
The active ingredient, cisplatin, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder with the 
molecular formula PtCl 2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1. Cisplatin is a heavy

metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by [CONTACT_218662]. It is soluble in water or saline at 
1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207q C. 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Plasma concentrations of the parent compound, cisplatin, decay monoexponentially with 
a half-life of about 20 to 30 minutes following bolus administrations of 50 or 100 mg/m2
doses. Monoexponential decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are also seen 
following 2-hour or 7-hour infusions of 100 mg/m2. After the latter, the total body 
clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin are about 15 to 16 L/h/m
2 and 11 to 12 L/m2.
Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to 
chemical displacement reactions by [CONTACT_218663], such as water or sulfhydryl groups, 
than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M 
NaCl, the predominant molecular species are cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis-
diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by [CONTACT_218664], accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of 
cisplatin to total free (ultrafilterable) plati num in the plasma vary considerably between 
patients and range from 0.5 to 1.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m
2.
Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from 
cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including 
albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two 
hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. 
The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a 
significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or 
more.

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 108
Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m2, the concentrations of platinum are highest 
in liver, prostate, and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and 
spleen; and lowest in bowel, adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is 
present in tissues for as long as [ADDRESS_262710] platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations 
in normal liver. Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 
90 to 150 minutes after a 100 mg/m2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner 
with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days. 
Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions 
varying in length from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered 
platinum is excreted in the urine in 24 hours. Over five days following administration of 
40 to 100 mg/m2 doses given as rapid, 2- to 3-hour, or 6- to 8-hour infusions, a mean of 
35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar mean urinary 
recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily 
administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m2/day. Only a small percentage of the administered 
platinum is excreted beyond [ADDRESS_262711] few hours. Platinum-containing species 
excreted in the urine are the same as those found following the incubation of cisplatin 
with urine from healthy subjects, except that the proportions are different. 
The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% to 17% of 
the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m2. The mean renal 
clearance of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m2 following 
administration of 100 mg/m2 as 2-hour or 6- to 7-hour infusions, respectively. 
The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular 
filtration rate indicating that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively 
secreted by [CONTACT_8212]. The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable 
and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active 
secretion and possible tubular reabsorption.

Reference ID: [ADDRESS_262712] between the renal clearance of either free platinum or 
cisplatin and creatinine clearance. 
Although small amounts of platinum are present in the bile and large intestine after 
administration of cisplatin, the fecal excretion of platinum appears to be insignificant. 
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE 
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) is indicated as therapy to be employed as 
follows: 
Metastatic Testicular Tumors 
In established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in patients with metastatic testicular tumors w ho have already received appropriate surgical 
and/or radiotherapeutic procedures. 
Metastatic Ovarian Tumors 
In established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors who have already received appropriate surgical 
and/or radiotherapeutic procedures. An established combination consists of PLATINOL 
and cyclophosphamide. PLATINOL, as a single agent, is indicated as secondary therapy 
in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors refractory to standard chemotherapy who have 
not previously received PLATINOL therapy. 
Advanced Bladder Cancer 
PLATINOL is indicated as a single agent for patients with transitional cell bladder cancer which is no longer amenable to local treatments, such as surgery and/or radiotherapy. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
PLATINOL is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment. PLATINOL 
should not be employed in myelosuppressed patients, or in patients with hearing 
impairment.

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 110
PLATINOL is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to 
PLATINOL or other platinum-containing compounds. 
WARNINGS
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) produces cumulative nephrotoxicity which is 
potentiated by [CONTACT_210575]. The serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), creatinine clearance, and magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium levels 
should be measured prior to initiating therapy, and prior to each subsequent course. At 
the recommended dosage, PLATINOL should not be given more frequently than once 
every 3 to 4 weeks (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).
There are reports of severe neuropathies in patients in whom regimens are employed 
using higher doses of PLATINOL or greater dose frequencies than those recommended. 
These neuropathies may be irreversible and are seen as paresthesias in a stocking-glove 
distribution, areflexia, and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to peripheral neuropathy (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric 
Use).
Loss of motor function has also been reported. 
Anaphylactic-like reactions to PLATINOL have been reported. These reactions have 
occurred within minutes of administration to patients with prior exposure to PLATINOL, 
and have been alleviated by [CONTACT_121197][INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, and 
antihistamines. 
Since ototoxicity of PLATINOL is cumulative, audiometric testing should be performed 
prior to initiating therapy and prior to each subsequent dose of drug (see ADVERSE 
REACTIONS ).
PLATINOL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. PLATINOL 
is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue 
culture. In mice PLATINOL is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during 
pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant.

Reference ID: [ADDRESS_262713] of PLATINOL was studied in BD IX rats. PLATINOL was 
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to 50 BD IX rats for 3 weeks, 3 X 1 mg/kg body 
weight per week. Four hundred and fifty-five days after the first application, 33 animals 
died, 13 of them related to malignancies: 12 leukemias and 1 renal fibrosarcoma. 
The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of PLATINOL has been 
reported. In these reports, PLATINOL was generally given in combination with other 
leukemogenic agents. 
Injection site reactions may occur during the administration of PLATINOL (see 
ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Given the possibility of extravasation, it is recommended to 
closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. 
PRECAUTIONS
Peripheral blood counts should be monitored weekly. Liver function should be monitored 
periodically. Neurologic examination should also be performed regularly (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ).
Drug Interactions 
Plasma levels of anticonvulsant agents may become subtherapeutic during cisplatin 
therapy.
In a randomized trial in advanced ovarian cancer, response duration was adversely 
affected when pyridoxine was used in combination with altretamine 
(hexamethylmelamine) and PLATINOL.

Geriatric Use 
Insufficient data are available from clinical trials  of cisplatin in the treatment of 
metastatic testicular tumors or advanced bladder cancer to determine whether elderly 
patients respond differently than younger patients. In four clinical trials of combination 
chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma, 1484 patients received cisplatin either in 
combination with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel. Of these, 426 (29%) were older than [ADDRESS_262715] decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function 
should be monitored. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Nephrotoxicity 
Dose-related and cumulative renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, is the 
major dose-limiting toxicity of PLATINOL. Renal toxicity has been noted in 28% to 36% 
of patients treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m2. It is first noted during the second week 
after a dose and is manifested by [CONTACT_218665], serum uric acid 
and/or a decrease in creatinine clearance. Renal toxicity becomes more prolonged and 
severe with repeated courses of the drug. Renal function must return to normal 
7
Reference ID: 3006561 Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 113
before another dose of PLATINOL can be given. Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to nephrotoxicity (see  PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).
Impairment of renal function has been associated with renal tubular damage. The administration of PLATINOL using a 6- to 8-hour infusion with intravenous hydration, 
and mannitol has been used to reduce nephrotoxicity. However, renal toxicity still can 
occur after utilization of these procedures. 
Ototoxicity 
Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients treated with a single dose of 
PLATINOL 50 mg/m2, and is manifested by [CONTACT_30547]/or hearing loss in the high 
frequency range (4000 to 8000 Hz). Decreased ability to hear normal conversational 
tones may occur. Deafness after the initial dose of PLATINOL has been reported. 
Ototoxic effects may be more severe in children receiving PLATINOL. Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated 
doses. Ototoxicity may be enhanced with prior or simultaneous cranial irradiation. It is 
unclear whether PLATINOL-induced ototoxicity is reversible. Ototoxic effects may be 
related to the peak plasma concentration of PLATINOL. Careful monitoring of 
audiometry should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and prior to subsequent 
doses of PLATINOL. 
Vestibular toxicity has also been reported. 
Ototoxicity may become more severe in patients being treated with other drugs with 
nephrotoxic potential. 
Hematologic
Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of patients treated with PLATINOL. The nadirs 
in circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between days 18 to 23 (range 7.5 to 45) with 
most patients recovering by [CONTACT_4475] 39 (range 13 to 62). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia 
are more pronounced at higher doses (>50 mg/m2). Anemia (decrease of 2 g 
hemoglobin/100 mL) occurs at approximately the same frequency and with the same 
timing as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Fever and infection have also been reported 
in patients with neutropenia. Potential fatalities due to infection (secondary to 
myelosuppression) have been reported. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to 
myelosuppression (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 114
In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs’ positive hemolytic 
anemia has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin hemolytic anemia, a further course 
of treatment may be accompanied by [CONTACT_218666]. 
The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of PLATINOL has been 
reported. In these reports, PLATINOL was generally given in combination with other 
leukemogenic agents. 
Gastrointestinal
Marked nausea and vomiting occur in almost all patients treated with PLATINOL, and 
may be so severe that the drug must be discontinued. Nausea and vomiting may begin 
within [ADDRESS_262716] up to 24 hours. Various degrees of vomiting, 
nausea and/or anorexia may persist for up to 1 week after treatment. 
Delayed nausea and vomiting (begins or persists 24 hours or more after chemotherapy) 
has occurred in patients attaining complete emetic control on the day of PLATINOL therapy.
Diarrhea has also been reported. 
OTHER TOXICITIES 
Vascular toxicities coincident with the use of PLATINOL in combination with other 
antineoplastic agents have been reported. The events are clinically heterogeneous and 
may include myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, thrombotic 
microangiopathy (hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]), or cerebral arteritis. Various 
mechanisms have been proposed for these vascular complications. There are also reports 
of Raynaud’s phenomenon occurring in patients treated with the combination of 
bleomycin, vinblastine with or without PLATINOL. It has been suggested that 
hypomagnesemia developi[INVESTIGATOR_218579], 
although not essential, factor associated with this event. However, it is currently 
unknown if the cause of Raynaud’s phenomenon in these cases is the disease, underlying 
vascular compromise, bleomycin, vinblastine, hypomagnesemia, or a combination of any 
of these factors.

Reference ID: [ADDRESS_262717] been reported to occur in patients treated with PLATINOL and are probably related 
to renal tubular damage. Tetany has been reported in those patients with hypocalcemia 
and hypomagnesemia. Generally, normal serum electrolyte levels are restored by 
[CONTACT_218667]. 
Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome has also been reported. 
Hyperuricemia 
Hyperuricemia has been reported to occur at approximately the same frequency as the 
increases in BUN and serum creatinine. 
It is more pronounced after doses greater than 50 mg/m2, and peak levels of uric acid 
generally occur between 3 to 5 days after the dose. Allopurinol therapy for hyperuricemia 
effectively reduces uric acid levels. 
Neurotoxicity 
SeeWARNINGS .
Neurotoxicity, usually characterized by [CONTACT_160603], has been reported. The neuropathies usually occur after prolonged therapy (4 to 7 months); however, neurologic 
symptoms have been reported to occur after a single dose. Although symptoms and signs 
of PLATINOL neuropathy usually develop during treatment, symptoms of neuropathy may begin [ADDRESS_262718] observed. The neuropathy, however, may 
progress further even after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. Preliminary evidence suggests peripheral 
neuropathy may be irreversible in some patients. Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to peripheral neuropathy (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).
Lhermitte’s sign, dorsal column myelopathy, and autonomic neuropathy have also been reported.
Loss of taste, seizures, leukoencephalopathy, and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have also been reported. 
10
Reference ID: [ADDRESS_262719] recommended doses of PLATINOL. Improvement and/or total 
recovery usually occurs after discontinuing PLATINOL. Steroids with or without 
mannitol have been used; however, efficacy has not been established. 
Blurred vision and altered color perception have been reported after the use of regimens 
with higher doses of PLATINOL or greater dose frequencies than recommended in the 
package insert. The altered color perception manifests as a loss of color discrimination, 
particularly in the blue-yellow axis. The only finding on funduscopic exam is irregular 
retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_218580]. 
Anaphylactic-Like Reactions 
Anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported in patients previously exposed to PLATINOL. The reactions consist of facial edema, wheezing, tachycardia, and 
hypotension within a few minutes of drug administration. Reactions may be controlled by 
[CONTACT_218668][INVESTIGATOR_218581]/or antihistamines as indicated. Patients 
receiving PLATINOL should be observed carefully for possible anaphylactic-like 
reactions and supportive equipment and medication should be available to treat such a 
complication. 
Hepatotoxicity
Transient elevations of liver enzymes, especially SGOT, as well as bilirubin, have been reported to be associated with PLATINOL administration at the recommended doses. 
Other Events 
Cardiac abnormalities, hiccups, elevated serum amylase, rash, alopecia, malaise, asthenia, 
and dehydration have been reported. 
Local soft tissue toxicity has been reported following extravasation of PLATINOL. 
Severity of the local tissue toxicity appears to be related to the concentration of the

PLATINOL solution. Infusion of solutions with a PLATINOL concentration greater than 
0.5 mg/mL may result in tissue cellulitis, fibrosis, necrosis, pain, edema, and erythema. 
OVERDOSAGE 
Caution should be exercised to prevent inadvertent overdosage with PLATINOL. 
Acute overdosage with this drug may result in kidney failure, liver failure, deafness, 
ocular toxicity (including detachment of the retina), significant myelosuppression, 
intractable nausea and vomiting and/or neuritis. In addition, death can occur following 
overdosage.
No proven antidotes have been established for PLATINOL overdosage. Hemodialysis, 
even when initiated four hours after the overdosage, appears to have little effect on 
removing platinum from the body because of PLATINOL’s rapid and high degree of 
protein binding. Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures 
to sustain the patient through any period of toxicity that may occur. 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
PLATINOL is administered by [CONTACT_202745]. PLATINOL SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BY [CONTACT_218669]. 
Note: Needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in 
contact [CONTACT_218670]. 
Aluminum reacts with PLATINOL, causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_218582] a loss of 
potency.
Metastatic Testicular Tumors 
The usual PLATINOL dose for the treatment of testicular cancer in combination with 
other approved chemotherapeutic agents is 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days per cycle. 
Metastatic Ovarian Tumors 
The usual PLATINOL dose for the treatment of metastatic ovarian tumors in combination 
with cyclophosphamide is 75 to 100 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). 
The dose of cyclophosphamide when used in combination with PLATINOL is 600 mg/m
2 IV once every 4 weeks (DAY 1).

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 118
For directions for the administration of cyclophosphamide, refer to the cyclophosphamide 
package insert. 
In combination therapy, PLATINOL and cyclophosphamide are administered 
sequentially.
As a single agent, PLATINOL should be administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 IV per 
cycle once every 4 weeks. 
Advanced Bladder Cancer 
PLATINOL should be administered as a single agent at a dose of 50 to 70 mg/m2 IV per 
cycle once every 3 to 4 weeks depending on the extent of prior exposure to radiation 
therapy and/or prior chemotherapy. For heavily pretreated patients an initial dose of 
50 mg/m2 per cycle repeated every 4 weeks is recommended. 
All Patients 
Pretreatment hydration with 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused for 8 to 12 hours prior to a 
PLATINOL dose is recommended. The drug is then diluted in 2 liters of 5% Dextrose in 
1/2 or 1/[ADDRESS_262720] be maintained during the following 24 hours.
A repeat course of PLATINOL should not be given until the serum creatinine is below 
1.5 mg/100 mL, and/or the BUN is below 25 mg/100 mL. A repeat course should not be 
given until circulating blood elements are at an acceptable level (platelets t100,000/mm
3,
WBC t4000/mm3). Subsequent doses of PLATINOL should not be given until an 
audiometric analysis indicates that auditory acuity is within normal limits. 
PREPARATION OF INTRAVENOUS SOLUTIONS 
Preparation Precautions 
Caution should be exercised in handling the powder and preparing the solution of 
cisplatin. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be 
utilized. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.1-4 To minimize the risk

Baxter Healthcare Corporation
DESCRIPTION
Cyclophosphamide for Injection, USP is a sterile white powder containing cyclophosphamide monohydrate. Cyclophosphamide is a
synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. Cyclophosphamide is a white crystalline powder with the
molecular formula C 7H15CI2N2O2P•H 2O and a molecular weight of 279.1. The chemical name [CONTACT_218684] 2-[bis(2-
chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate. Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, orethanol and has the following structural formula:
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxi dase
system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321]. The mechanism of action is
thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA.Cyclophosphamide is well absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability greater than 75%. The unchanged drug has anelimination half-life of 3 to 12 hours. It is eliminated primarily in the form of metabolites, but from 5 to 25% of the dose is excreted inurine as unchanged drug. Several cytotoxic and noncytotoxic metabolites have been identified in urine and in plasma. Concentrat ions
of metabolites reach a maximum in plasma 2 to 3 hours after an intravenous dose. Plasma protein binding of unchanged drug is lowbut some metabolites are bound to an extent greater than 60%. It has not been demonstrated that any single metabolite is respon sible
for either the therapeutic or toxic effects of cyclophosphamide. Although elevated levels of metabolites of cyclophosphamide ha ve
been observed in patients with renal failure, increased clinical toxicity in such patients has not been demonstrated.
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE
Malignant Diseases
Cyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially wi th
other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to cyclophosphamide treatment:
1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin’s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular
or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma.
2. Multiple myeloma.
3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), a cute
myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (cyclophosphamide given during
remission is effective in prolonging its duration).
4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease).
5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease).6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary.7. Retinoblastoma.8. Carcinoma of the breast.
Nonmalignant Disease Biopsy Proven “Minimal Change” Nephrotic Syndrome in Children:
Cyclophosphamide is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should
not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid thera py or
in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, cyclophosphamide may induce  a
remission. Cyclophosphamide is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-[ADDRESS_262721] developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other
antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoprolifera tive
malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative orlymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically.In some cases, the second malignancy developed several years after cyclophosphamide treatment had been discontinued. In a singlebreast cancer trial utilizing two to four times the standard dose of cyclophosphamide in conjunction with doxorubicin a small n umber
of cases of secondary acute myeloid leukemia occurred within two years of treatment initiation. Urinary bladder malignanciesgenerally have occurred in patients who previously had hemorrhagic cystitis. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containingregimens for a variety of solid tumors, isolated case reports of secondary malignancies have been published. One case of carcin oma
of the renal pelvis was reported in a patient receiving long-term cyclophosphamide therapy for cerebral vasculitis. The possibility ofcyclophosphamide-induced malignancy should be considered in any benefit-to-risk assessment for use of the drug.Cyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and such abnormalities have been reportedfollowing cyclophosphamide therapy in pregnant women. Abnormalities were found in two infants and a six-month old fetus bornto women treated with cyclophosphamide. Ectrodactylia was found in two of the three cases. Normal infants have also been born towomen treated with cyclophosphamide during pregnancy, including the first trimester. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if thepatient becomes pregnant while taking (receiving) this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetu s. Women
of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development of sterilityappears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatm ent.
Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients.Amenorrhea associated with decreased estrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a significant proportion of womentreated with cyclophosphamide. Affected patients generally resume regular menses within a few months after cessation of therapy.Girls treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence generally develop secondary sexual characteristics normally and haveregular menses. Ovarian fibrosis with apparently complete loss of germ cells after prolonged cyclophosphamide treatment in lateprepubescence has been reported. Girls treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence subsequently have conceived.Men treated with cyclophosphamide may develop oligospermia or azoospermia associated with increased gonadotropin but normaltestosterone secretion. Sexual potency and libido are unimpaired in these patients. Boys treated with cyclophosphamide duringprepubescence develop secondary sexual characteristics normally, but may have oligospermia or azoospermia and increasedgonadotropin secretion. Some degree of testicular atrophy may occur. Cyclophosphamide-induced azoospermia is reversible in somepatients, though the reversibility may not occur for several years after cessation of therapy. Men temporarily rendered sterile by[CONTACT_218671].
Urinary System
Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal .
Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_218584]. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and th e
duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluidintake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder.This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it maypersist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis.
It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis.
Cardiac Toxicity
Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide,
no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m
2 to as high as 26
g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a
few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the  first
cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred
secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium .
No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by [CONTACT_218672][INVESTIGATOR_218585].Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-[ADDRESS_262722] been reported; death has also been reported in association with this event. Possible cross-sensitiv ity with
other alkylating agents has been reported.
PRECAUTIONS
General
Special attention to the possible development of toxicity should be exercised in patients being treated with cyclophosphamide i f any of
the following conditions are present.
1. Leukopenia
2. Thrombocytopenia3. Tumor cell infiltration of bone marrow4. Previous X-ray therapy5. Previous therapy with other cytotoxic agents6. Impaired hepatic function7. Impaired renal function
Laboratory Tests
During treatment, the patient’s hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and platelets) should be monitored regularly to d etermine
the degree of hematopoietic suppression. Urine should also be examined regularly for red cells which may precede hemorrhagic
cystitis.
Drug Interactions
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide reportedly are increased by [CONTACT_218673].
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving cyclophosphamide even thoughcyclophosphamide has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs.Cyclophosphamide treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of
succinylcholine chloride.If a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within [ADDRESS_262723] should be alerted.
Adrenalectomy
Since cyclophosphamide has been reported to be more toxic in adrenalectomized dogs, adjustment of the doses of both replacement
steroids and cyclophosphamide may be necessary for the adrenalectomized patient.
Wound Healing
Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility
See WARNINGS section for information on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy Category D—See WARNINGS section.
Nursing Mothers
Cyclophosphamide is excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions and the potential for
tumorigenicity shown for cyclophosphamide in humans, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinuethe drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 125
page 4 of 9Pediatric Use
The safety profile of cyclophosphamide in pediatric patients is similar to that of the adult population (see ADVERSE REACTIONS
section).
Geriatric Use
Insufficient data from clinical studies of cyclophosphamide for malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, mycosis
fungoides, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, and breast carcinoma are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determin e
whether they respond differently than younger patients. In two clinical trials in which cyclophosphamide was compared withpaclitaxel, each in combination with cisplatin, for the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma, 154 (28%) of 552 patients whoreceived cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin were 65 years or older. Subset analyses (<65 versus >65 years) from these trials, publishedreports of clinical trials of cyclophosphamide-containing regimens in breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and postmarketingexperience suggest that elderly patients may be more susceptible to cyclophosphamide toxicities. In general, dose selection for anelderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range and adjusting as necessary based on patientresponse (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Treatment of Malignant Diseases).
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Information on adverse reactions associated with the use of cyclophosphamide is arranged according to body system affected or type
of reaction. The adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing incidence. The most serious adverse reactions are describe d in the
WARNINGS section.
Reproductive System
See WARNINGS section for information on impairment of fertility.
Digestive System
Nausea and vomiting commonly occur with cyclophosphamide therapy. Anorexia and, less frequently, abdominal discomfort or pain
and diarrhea may occur. There are isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration and jaundice occurring durin g
therapy. These adverse drug effects generally remit when cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped.
Skin and Its Structures
Alopecia occurs commonly in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. The hair can be expected to grow back after treatment with the
drug or even during continued drug treatment, though it may be different in texture or color. Skin rash occurs occasionally in patients
receiving the drug. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_218586]. Very rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic
epi[INVESTIGATOR_218587]; due to the nature of spontaneous adverse event repor ting,
a definitive causal relationship to cyclophosphamide has not been established.
Hematopoietic System
Leukopenia occurs in patients treated with cyclophosphamide, is related to the dose of drug, and can be used as a dosage guide.
Leukopenia of less than 2000 cells/mm3 develops commonly in patients treated with an initial loading dose of the drug, and lessfrequently in patients maintained on smaller doses. The degree of neutropenia is particularly important because it correlates with areduction in resistance to infections. Fever without documented infection has been reported in neutropenic patients.Thrombocytopenia or anemia develop occasionally in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. These hematologic effects usually ca n
be reversed by [CONTACT_218674]. Recovery from leukopenia usually begins in [ADDRESS_262724] been reported; death has also been reported in association with this event. Possible cross-sensitiv ity
with other alkylating agents has been reported. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) has been reported with the use of
cyclophosphamide. Malaise and asthenia have been reported as part of the postmarketing experience.
OVERDOSAGE
No specific antidote for cyclophosphamide is known. Overdosage should be managed with supportive measures, including appropriate
treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or cardiac toxicity should it occur.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Treatment of Malignant Diseases Adults and Children
When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of cyclophosphamide for patients with no hematologic deficienc y
usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens
include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly.Oral cyclophosphamide dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing.Many other regimens of intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord withevidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. T ransient
decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm
3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/
mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia.
When cyclophosphamide is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of cyclophosphamide aswell as that of the other drugs.Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dia lysis
system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters ofcyclophosphamide metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for cyclophosphamide dosage modification inpatients with renal function impairment.
Treatment of Nonmalignant Diseases Biopsy Proven “Minimal Change’’ Nephrotic Syndrome in Children
An oral dose of 2.5 to 3 mg/kg daily for a period of 60 to 90 days is recommended. In males, the incidence of oligospermia and
azoospermia increases if the duration of cyclophosphamide treatment exceeds 60 days. Treatment beyond 90 days increases theprobability of sterility. Adrenocorticosteroid therapy may be tapered and discontinued during the course of cyclophosphamide th erapy.

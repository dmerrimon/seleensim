  Page [ADDRESS_979342] for non-inferiority will be carried out using a 2-tailed 95% confidence interval 
for the difference (δ = Unipolar electrocautery system - Saline-coupled bipolar sealer) 
in the estimated blood loss between the two groups. δ is the margin of inferiority and 
will be set at 200 cc.  If the upper confidence limit < δ (≥δ) then we will conclude that 
the Unipolar electrocautery system is non-inferior (inferior) to the Saline-coupled 
bipolar sealer.   
 
This test for non-inferiority will only be performed for the primary study endpoint of 
estimated blood loss; all other secondary variables will be tests of superiority of 
Unipolar electrocautery versus Saline-coupled bipolar sealer. 
 
 
1 Previous Study History 
Has this study ever been reviewed and rejected/disapproved by [CONTACT_84965]? 
 
 No   Yes   if yes, please explain:  
 
[ADDRESS_979343] when compared to the unipolar electrocautery .  A 
bipolar electrode costs an additional $450.[ADDRESS_979344] of the 
saline-coupled bipolar sealer was offset by [CONTACT_717982].  A single blood transfusion is estimated to be $750-$1200. [ADDRESS_979345] 
challenged the superiority of the saline-coupled bipolar sealer in hemostasis.  These randomized 
clinical trials (RCT) have not supported superiority of this method when compared to standard 
unipolar electrocautery and the continued use of the saline-coupled bipolar sealer has been 
questioned.   
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the saline-coupled bipolar sealer compared to 
the unipolar electrocautery provides superior hemostasis in patients undergoing primary 
unilateral total knee arthroplasty.  This will be a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, non-
inferiority study in patients scheduled for a primary unilateral TKA with [CONTACT_717998] or 
[CONTACT_717999].  The restriction of this study to two surgeons will limit variations in the 
outcomes being measured due to differences in surgical technique.

 3 Introduction 
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_979346] been reported 
to be as high as 39% in total knee arthroplasty.2 Transfused patients are exposed to risks such as 
adverse immunological reactions, disease transmission, intravascular hemolysis, transfusion-
induced coagulopathy, renal impairment or failure, and increased mortality.  Postoperative 
anemia has also been associated with prolonged length of stay and increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]3.  
Minimizing blood loss has led to multiple blood conservation strategies in orthopaedic 
procedures.   
 
One method of hemostasis in use at Syosset Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717955] 2013 is the use of intravenous 
antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid).  The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in orthopaedic surgery 
has resulted in a 50% reduction in the rate of transfusions4. TXA interferes with clot breakdown. 
Ninety percent of TXA is excreted by [CONTACT_717983] [ADDRESS_979347] been isolated case reports of thrombus formation with intravenous (IV) administration of 
TXA.  Due to this risk, IV TXA is not administered to patients with risk factors for 
thromboembolic events.   
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567252] (neuraxil blockade) has been shown to be effective in reducing 
intraoperative blood loss.  Rogers, et al in a meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_979348] is responsible for the 
reduction in bleeding during surgery.  
 
Maintenance of normothermia is also of paramount importance in controlling blood loss in 
orthopedic surgery.  Perioperative hypothermia is defined as a core temperature < [ADDRESS_979349] 
questioned the routine insertion of drains.  Esler, et al prospectively randomized 100 patients 
undergoing cemented total knee replacement to receive either a single deep closed-suction drain 
or no drain. The total blood loss was significantly greater in those with a drain (568 ml versus 
119 ml, p < 0.01; 95% CI 360 to 520) although those without a drain lost more blood into the 
dressings (55 ml versus 119 ml, p < 0.01; 95% CI –70 to10). There was no statistical difference 
in the postoperative swelling or pain scores, or in the incidence of pyrexia, ecchymosis, time at 
which flexion was regained or the need for manipulation, or in the incidence of infection at a 
minimum of five years after surgery in the two groups.  The authors concluded that there was no 
evidence to support the use of a closed-suction drain in cemented knee arthroplasty, finding it 
merely interfered with mobilization and complicated nursing care. [ADDRESS_979350], developed the electrocautrery.  
Harvey Cushing introduced it into clinical practice.  A diathermy machine converts electricity of 
the main supply (240V; 50 Hz) into high frequency current (>100,000 Hz) to minimize the risk 
of electrical shocks.  In unipolar mode, the current from the diathermy enters the patient through 
the active electrode and exits through the grounding pad.   The unipolar electrocautery results in 
a tissue surface above 4000 C to char tissue. 
 
In saline-coupled  bipolar mode the current passes between the two prongs of the electrode 
without any significant flow through the patient and there is no need for the grounding pad.  The 
use of saline-coupled bipolar sealing technology (Aquamantys System®, Medtronic) represents a 
newer approach to reducing blood loss in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.  Unlike 
standard electrocautery, which uses unipolar radiofrequency energy, this technology uses bipolar 
radiofrequency energy combined with a continuous-flow saline at the electrode tip to prevent 
tissue temperatures from exceeding 100°C.   The temperature is sufficient to shrink collagen 
fibers in blood vessel walls, which seals their lumen resulting in hemostasis without surrounding 
tissue damage2.  Saline-cooled bipolar radiofrequency technology provides a solution to osseous 
bleeding by [CONTACT_717984] a conduit into the interstices of cancellous bone.[ADDRESS_979351] been closed .2  However, 
the use of this technology has significantly increased the per-case expense of using this device.  
 
The use of the saline-coupled  bipolar sealer in orthopedics has become more prevalent based on 
initial publications showing a reduction in intraoperative blood loss and postoperative 
transfusion requirements.  Marulanda, et al conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 
2009 with 69 primary TKA patients.  Though the bipolar sealer group had a lower mean decline 
in hemoglobin level compared to the unipolar group, there was not a statistically significant 
difference in blood transfusions or postoperative hemoglobin nadir.2  Clinical outcomes were 
assessed by [CONTACT_250155], range of motion and Knee Society Scores.  There were no differences 
in clinical outcomes between the groups.

  Page 5 of 33 
 In 2009 Weeden, et al published a retrospective, matched controlled review of 100 patients who 
had undergone primary total knee arthroplasty by a single surgeon.  The prevalence of both 
autologous and allogeneic transfusion was significantly reduced by 64% in the bipolar sealing 
group.[ADDRESS_979352] also been found in the use of the saline-coupled  bipolar sealer in total hip 
arthroplasty (THA).  Morris in a retrospective study supported previous authors’ findings of 
significant reductions in blood loss and transfusions with the use of the saline coupled bipolar 
sealer in THA. [ADDRESS_979353] both authors do not recommend the use of the bipolar sealer for primary THA. 
   
These conflicting results are multifactorial and highlight both the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_717956].  The restriction of this study to two surgeons will 
limit variations in the outcomes being measured due to differences in surgical technique.  
 
Plymale’s study included patients having either general or epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686].  Baseline 
characteristics did not discuss if these groups were evenly distributed.   
 
These studies predate the use of IV TXA in orthopedic surgery and its dramatic effect on 
hemostasis.  Additionally, current trends in allogeneic blood transfusion protocols have also 
changed.  Patients are now transfused at lower hemoglobin levels.  Some of these studies did not 
have a clearly defined transfusion protocol and the transfusion requirements were left to surgeon 
discretion.  This limitation allowed for operator bias of a study clinical outcome.    
 
Another concern for using drain output as an outcome measure is that it has been documented 
that this drainage does not accurately represent postoperative blood loss as the drains do not 
remove all the blood lost.[ADDRESS_979354] patients are observed in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717957].  Long term follow-up on clinical outcomes such as range of motion and 
functional assessment scores were not reported in many of the trials.  
 
This study will compare the use of the saline-coupled bipolar sealer with the unipolar 
electrocautery to determine if one method results in increased homeostasis as measured by a 
hemoglobin nadir, reduced allogeneic blood transfusions, and estimated blood loss calculated 
using the Gross’ Formula.  This study will also be assessing the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 2012 
Knee Society Scores, and the safety profile.   
 
Null Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that the difference between the mean estimated blood loss in 
the Unipolar electrocautery and the saline-coupled bipolar sealer is greater than or equal to the 
margin of non-inferiority of 200 cc. Also, we propose that the safety and efficacy profile of the 
saline-coupled bipolar vs. the unipolar are clinically equivocal.  
 
3.2 Investigational Agent-Device 
 
The Aquamantys® System is a commercially available device used routinely used in the 
operating room for a wide variety of surgical cases.  The Aquamantys® System is a patented 
Transcollation® technology, a combination of radiofrequency (RF) energy and saline that 
provides haemostatic sealing of soft tissue and bone during surgery.  The patented integration of 
RF energy and saline delivers controlled thermal energy to tissue. This combination allows the 
device temperature to stay at approximately 100°C, nearly 200°C less than conventional devices, 
which produces a tissue effect without the charring associated with other methods. The 
temperature is sufficient to shrink collagen fibers in the walls of blood vessels, effectively 
sealing the blood vessels, resulting in the reduction in bleeding from both soft tissue and bone. 
The device can be used to spot coagulate vessels that are actively bleeding or to broadly paint 
tissue surfaces to prevent bleeding or treat active oozing.  Suction is used to remove the saline 
from the surgical field. 
 
The Aquamantys System consists of a generator and  disposable, single-use hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]. 
Medtronic Advanced Energy offers innovative Aquamantys hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_717958], such as the 6.0 Bipolar Sealer and MBS Bipolar Sealer with Light.   Salient 
Surgical Technologies, the original manufacturer of the device was acquired by [CONTACT_54452] 
2011.   
 
Aquamantys Disposable Bipolar Devices  are sterile, single-use devices which employ RF energy 
and saline irrigation for hemostatic sealing and coagulation. These devices are equipped with a 
dual electrode tip. Saline and electrical lines exit the opposite end of the hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_717959]. The hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_717960]/off button that simultaneously activates both 
RF power and saline flow. A saline fluid delivery line is provided with the device, and includes a 
section of pump tubing and drip chamber. The three-pin electrical connector is designed to be 
plugged into the Aquamantys Pump Generator (Appendix A).

Objective and functional outcomes will be obtained using the 2011 Knee Society Score (KSS).  
The KSS will be completed preoperatively and postoperatively as per the department standard of 
care for all total knee arthroplasty patients.(Appendix E).   
Preoperatively patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelets, with the exception of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [ADDRESS_979357] intraoperative 
and postoperative bleeding.  Patients with any bleeding dyscrasias will also be excluded from the 
study.  Patients are instructed to discontinue aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], medications containing aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-like 
products, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents seven days prior to surgery.  (Appendix F).   
Patients who are unable to stop these products for any reason will be excluded from the study.   
   
All preoperative patients are seen in pre-surgical testing (PST) within [ADDRESS_979358] be discontinued prior to surgery (Appendix G). 
 
On the operative day patients will be interviewed to confirm their agreement to continue in the 
study. Patients will be re-consented by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Krauss, [CONTACT_681039], or [CONTACT_718002], if the date of the 
original consent is greater than [ADDRESS_979359] and 
the preoperative medical history documents.  Patients will be randomized to either the treatment 
arm (saline-coupled bipolar sealer) or the control arm (unipolar electrocautery). The Biostatistics 
Unit will develop a randomization procedure using a permuted block design and the 
randomization process will occur in REDCap using the Randomization Module. The operating 
room (OR) staff will be immediately notified of the treatment arm so that the OR can be 
prepared.  
 
Intraoperative blood management strategies will be consistent for all subjects to avoid any 
confounding factors which could affect postoperative transfusion requirements. Any patients 
unable to be treated according to the department treatment guidelines will be excluded from the 
study. Intraoperatively blood loss is minimized by [CONTACT_717985], pharmacologic 
interventions, and surgical techniques.   
 
Anesthetic techniques include spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_717962] a TKA.  Any patient with preoperative contraindications to spi[INVESTIGATOR_717963].  Unfortunately, due to technical issues in the OR, 
some patients are unable to receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_717964].  
Though a rare occurrence these patients will remain on study and included in the study statistics 
as this is an Intent to Treat Study design.   Euthermia is managed by [CONTACT_717986].

Pharmacologic techniques included TXA 1000 mg/100cc Normal Saline infused over 15-[ADDRESS_979360] dose.  Any 
patients unable to be treated according to the department treatment guidelines for IV TXA will 
be excluded from the study (Appendix H).  A closed suction  drain is inserted based on the 
surgeon’s clinical decision. 
 
The patient and the postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717965]. The OR 
staff will be trained not to discuss this information with the patient. During the transition of care 
from the OR to the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) the electrocautery used is not routinely 
included in the verbal patient report.  The lack of this information is not required to effectively 
manage the patient in the postoperative period and will not affect patient care. Postoperatively 
medical care is managed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_8384], medical doctors specializing in the care of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].  The blood transfusion protocol is consistent for all patients.  Patients 
receive allogeneic blood transfusions when the hemoglobin is < 7 g/dL.  For Hgb >7 g/dL to <8 
g/dL patients are treated only if they are exhibiting clinical symptoms related to the anemia or if 
there is a rapid decline in Hgb.  For Hgb > 8 g/dL patients are treated if they are exhibiting 
clinical symptoms of anemia. 
 
The pneumatic tourniquet will be applied and inflated to maintain a bloodless field. The 
tourniquet pressure is determined by [CONTACT_11065].   At the end of the surgery the tourniquet is 
released.  Bleeding vessels are sealed with either the saline coupled bipolar sealer or the unipolar 
electrocautery based on the subject randomization. 
 
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in joint replacement consists of both chemical and 
mechanical measures.  All patients have a sequential compression device applied in the operating 
room to the non-operative extremity.  At the end of the surgical case, after the dressing has been 
applied, the sequential compression device is applied to the operative extremity.  Sequential 
compression devices are in use while patients are in bed. 
 
Patients are started on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis postoperative Day 1.  The 
treatment regimen is dependent on the patient’s calculated Caprini Risk Assessment Score. 
(Appendix I). 
Early ambulation for TKA patients begins on postoperative Day 0.  Patients are seen by a 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_717966].  
Only acute medical events are valid reasons for a patient not to be ambulated at this time point.  
While hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717967] a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. This study will be assessing

Estimated blood loss will be calculated using the Gross’ Formula.16 This method is being used to 
provide a more standardized method of calculating blood loss. Eipe and Ponniah showed that 
surgical blood loss was underestimated by 64% when clinical methods are used to assess blood-
soaked sponges and blood lost to suction bottles and the vacuum drain17.

10 Risks to Subjects 
 
This study does not put the patient at any additional risk. The bipolar sealer and unipolar 
electrocautery are commercially available devices routinely used during orthopaedic surgery.   
Risk factors identified with the use of electrosugery include fires, patient burns, surgical 
personnel injuries and biological hazards, such as plume.  The operating room adheres to the 
Association of Surgical Technologists (AST) Standards of Practice for Use of Electrosurgery 
(Appendix C) and the Northwell Health Electrosurgical Safety Policy (Appendix D). The AST 
developed these standards of practice to protect both the patient and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717].  These 
practices provide an optimum level of patient and operating room staff safety.

14 Statistical Plan 
14.1 Sample Size Determination 
Sample Size Considerations : 
The proposed sample size for this study is 164 subjects  (n=82 per group ). 
  
As a non-inferiority trial, Unipolar will be considered non-inferior to Bipolar if the difference in 
the mean estimated blood loss as calculated by [CONTACT_17403]’ Formula is less than 200 cc (δ=margin of 
inferiority=200 cc).  More formally, let µ Unipolar and µ Bipolar be the mean estimated blood loss for 
the Unipolar system and the Bipolar system, respectively.  The following are the null hypothesis 
and alternative hypothesis: 
H0: d = µ Unipolar – µBipolar ≥ δ vs.  
HA: d = µ Unipolar – µBipolar < δ 
 
Based on a previous study “ To Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of IA-TXA in Primary Total 
Joint Arthroplasty ” we will assume that the mean estimated blood loss is [ADDRESS_979372] deviations in the Bipolar system and Unipolar system 
which were 476 cc and 546 cc, respectively (Marulanda, 2009). Based on two surgeons that are 
experts in TKA, less than 200 cc was determined to be a clinically acceptable increase in 
estimated blood loss. Using a 2-sided α-level of 0.05, and a non-inferiority margin of 200 cc, a 
target of 82 subjects per group (n=164 in total) would yield 80% power to determine that the 
Unipolar system is non-inferior to the Bipolar system when the estimated blood loss in the 
Bipolar group is [ADDRESS_979373] deviation 
of 511 cc.

 Perioperative blood loss as measured by [CONTACT_717989]: 
o  preoperative hemoglobin and the nadir of the postoperative hemoglobin value 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
o the preoperative hematocrit and the nadir of the postoperative hematocrit value 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 Hemoglobin and hematocrit values over time (pre-op, post-op day 0, day 1, day 2, and 
until discharge) 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95156] 
 Functional outcomes as measured by:

o 2011 Knee Society Scores  
 
Primary Safety Endpoints : 
 Wound infections within 90 days of the date of surgery 
 Device related adverse events within 90 days of the date of surgery 
 
Randomization :  
Subjects will be randomly assigned by a 1:1 ratio to either: 
3. Unipolar electrocautery  system (Covidien ForceTriadTM  Electrosurgical System)  
4. Saline-coupled bipolar sealer  (Aquamantys SystemTM  Medtronics) 
The Biostatistics Unit will develop a randomization procedure using a permuted block design 
and the randomization process will occur in REDCap using the Randomization Module.  Details, 
including required record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] a well documented single-blind randomization procedure, 
will be further developed upon approval of this protocol.     
 
Intention to Treat (ITT) :   
The primary analyses will be based on the ITT population.  The ITT population will be defined 
as any subject who is randomized, regardless of which system is used. 
 
 
Interim Analysis and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:   
There will be no interim analysis.

  Page 22 of 33 
  
 
Statistical Methods:   
The test for non-inferiority will be carried out using a 2-tailed 95% confidence interval for the 
difference (δ = Unipolar electrocautery system - Saline-coupled bipolar sealer) in the estimated 
blood loss between the two groups. δ is the margin of inferiority and will be set at 200 cc.  If the 
upper confidence limit < δ (≥δ) then we will conclude that the Unipolar electrocautery system is 
non-inferior (inferior) to the Saline-coupled bipolar sealer.   
 
This test for non-inferiority will only be performed for the primary study endpoint of estimated 
blood loss; all other secondary variables will be tests of superiority of Unipolar electrocautery 
versus Saline-coupled bipolar sealer. 
 
A mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance will be performed separately 
for hemoglobin and hematocrit, to determine whether the two groups behave differently across 
time (pre-op, post-op day 0, post-op day 1, post-op day 2, and until discharge).  The models will 
contain one repeated (within subjects) factor of time, a between factor of group, and a group-by-
time interaction term.   Time will be treated as a fixed effect in the model and an unstructured 
covariance approach will be used.  Results will be reported as adjusted (least squares) means and 
standard errors.  For all analyses, the standard assumptions of Gaussian residuals and equality of 
variance will be tested.  If the standard assumptions are not met, a transformation will be 
performed, and the results will be brought back to the original units and reported as geometric 
means with their corresponding lower and upper confidence limits. 
 
LOS (or “Time to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]”) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_545853], i.e., computing  the Kaplan-Meier product limit curves, where group (Saline-
coupled bipolar sealer vs. Unipolar electrocautery system) will be the stratification variable.  In 
cases where the endpoint event, “discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]”, did not occur, the number of days 
until last follow-up will be used and considered ‘censored’.  These two groups will be compared 
using the log-rank test.  The median “time to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for each group will be obtained from the Kaplan-Meier/Product-Limit 
Estimates. 
 
A two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare the two groups for 
perioperative blood loss and Functional outcomes (i.e. distance walked, Knee Society Scores). 
Estimated blood loss will be calculated using the Gross’ Formula.  The chi-square test or Fisher’s 
exact test, as deemed appropriate, will be used to compare the two groups for wound infections 
and device related adverse events. 
 
A result will be considered statistically significant at the p<0.05 level of significance.  All 
analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

803.32 (c)) ambulatory surgery centers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], outpatient diagnostic centers and other user 
facilities are required to report all incidents in which a medical device or user error may have 
caused or contributed to the death, serious injury or serious illness of a patient (Appendix K). 
 
 
 
 
15.1 Serious Injury or illness definition 
 
“Serious injury or illness” means those injuries that are life threatening, result in permanent body 
function impairment or permanent damage to a body structure, or necessitate immediate medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent permanent body function impairment or permanent damage to 
a body structure (21 CFR 803.3) (r).   
 
A device may have "caused or contributed to" a patient’s death or serious injury, if the death or 
serious injury was or may have been attributed to the device or the device may have been a factor 
in the death or serious injury because of:   
 
o Device failure 
o Malfunction 
o Improper or inadequate device design 
o Manufacture 
o Labeling or 
o User error 
 
15.2 Mandatory Medical Device Reporting 
The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation (21 CFR 803) contains  mandatory 
requirements for manufacturers, importers, and device user facilities to report certain device-
related adverse events and product problems to the FDA. The regulation specified that reports be 
filed on FDA Medwatch Form 3500A or an electronic equivalent.  
 
 
Device User Facility Reporting Requirements of Serious Adverse Events:  
A “device user facility” is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, outpatient 
diagnostic facility, or outpatient treatment facility, which is not a physician’s office.

 15.3 Recording of Adverse Events 
Information on all device related serious and non-serious adverse events will be recorded in the 
source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form 
(CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
 
All devices related serious and non-serious adverse events occurring during the study period 
must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the 
cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be 
followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation 
should be recorded and reported immediately. 
 
15.3.1 EC/IRB Notification by [CONTACT_17250] (including follow-up information) must be 
submitted to the EC/IRB according to their policies.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_16460]/IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the Clinical 
Investigator’s binder. 
15.3.2 FDA Notification by [CONTACT_717995].   
 
15.4 Unblinding Procedures 
 
The patient can be unblinded to the treatment arm by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_717975]’s postoperative care. 
 
 
15.5 Data and Safety Monitoring  
15.5.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of all 
adverse events deemed related to the medical device.  Medical monitoring will include a regular 
assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_717976] 2 months. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a safety report for these regular reviews comprised 
of adverse events and the actions taken. The study protocol will be carried out in accordance

  Page 26 of 33 
 with OHRP/FDA/NIH guidelines and requirements. In the event of a serious adverse event 
during the study protocol, it will be reported immediately to the PI. Serious AND Unanticipated 
AND possibly, probably or definitely related AEs will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_979376] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at 
the end of their scheduled study period. 
16.2 Source Documents 
 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial.

 16.3 Case Report Forms 
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on 
the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.   
 
The REDCap software will be the electronic CRF used for this study.  Vanderbilt University, 
with collaboration from a consortium of institutional partners, has developed a software toolset 
and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical 
trial data. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) data collection projects rely on a 
thorough study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_717996]. The iterative development and testing process results in 
a well-planned data collection strategy for individual studies.  REDCap servers are housed in a 
local data center at the Feinstein and all web-based information transmission is encrypted. 
REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA-Security guidelines and is recommended to 
Northwell Health researchers by [CONTACT_717997], Research Compliance Office and 
Institutional Review Board. REDCap has been disseminated for use locally at other institutions 
and currently supports 1,244 active institutional partners and other institutions in 87 countries 
(www.project-redcap.org ).  
 
Records Retention 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_979377].  These documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an 
instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
17 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
17.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
This section is not applicable for this study.   
17.2 Auditing and Inspecting

5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
Evidence suggests that the regulation of the neurotransmitters serotonin  and dopamine  is altered in the brain of 
people with anorexia nervosa  (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). This study will use br ain imaging technologies 
to measure several neurotransmitters (serotonin and dopamine) that contribute to our abilities to respond to 
reward or inhibit our impulses, and which are known to be altered in the brain of people with anorexia nervosa 
(AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN).  Because palatable food stimulates dopamine secretion, we propose  to use a 
challenge with brain imaging that will stimulate dopamine release which we hypothesize will generate anxiety 
rather than pleasure in AN, and will help explain wh y AN restrict eating in order to reduce anxiety. This 
application will help to understand the unique and puzzling symptoms of eating disorders and contribute to 
finding better methods for identifying effective treatments for these often relapsing and somet imes chronic 
disorders.  
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
How are individuals with restricting -type AN able to starve themselves and become emaciated while most 
people have difficulty losing a few pounds? Furthermore, why do individuals with BN tend to periodically 
overe at? Considerable data support our overarching hypothesis: Serotonin ( 5-HT) and dopamine ( DA) 
functional activity, through actions on reward and inhibitory neural pathways, contribute to disturbed appetitive behaviors and extremes of self -control in AN and BN. In order to avoid the confounding effects of malnutrition 
and weight loss (and because our data suggest that recovered ( REC ) individuals have persistent trait- related 
alterations of DA and 5- HT function,
11, 12, 14, 60 we will study, over the  course of 5 years, 25 REC AN, 25 REC 
AN-BN, 25 REC BN, and 25 age and body mass index (BMI) matched healthy control women ( CW) who are 
18 to 45 years old. We will use PET imaging with specific radioligands for the DA D2/D3 receptors 
([11C]raclopride) and 5 -HTT ([11C]DASB).  
  It is well known that [ADDRESS_279031] diminished 5- HTT binding [ e.g., [11C]DASB binding potential (BP Nondisplaceable tissue uptake (ND) )] in midbrain 
and striatal regions) contributing to inhibition of appetite and other rewards in AN, and decreased self -
regulatory control in BN. We predict REC AN -BN will have [ADDRESS_279032] similar dysregulation of anterior ventral striatum (AVS) system function, making them vulnerable to 
dysfunctional modulation of the rewarding aspects of appetitive behaviors (a nd modulation of emotionality).  
In Aim 2A , we propose to use  PET and [11C]raclopride binding to confirm several hypotheses generated by [CONTACT_231430] D2/D3 receptors9, 60. First, that REC AN, and perhaps REC BN, have 
elevated anterior ventral striatum (AVS) [11C]raclopride (DA D2/D3  receptor) BP ND compared to CW. Second, 
that dorsal caudate (DC) [11C]raclopride BP ND in REC e ating disorders (ED s) is associated with baseline harm 
avoidance (HA), a measure of inhibition and anxiety.  
In AIM 2B , we will assess endogenous striatal DA release in order to better understand altered striatal 
[11C]raclopride binding, and (in AIM 2C ) to replicate and extend pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]10 that show that endogenous DA 
release in the dorsal caudate ( DC) provoke s inhibitory and anxiety symptoms in AN and BN. In brief, because 
[11C]rac lopride binding is influenced by [CONTACT_231431], elevated [11C]raclopride binding could indicate either 
an elevation of the density and/or affinity of the DA D2/D3 receptors or a reduction of intrasynaptic DA 
concentrations. It has been shown in non -human primate studies that the decrease in the BP ND of benzamide 
radiotracers such as [11C]raclopride following amphetamine (AMPH) -induced DA release is a reliable measure 
of endogenous DA transmission29, 108 in striatal subdivisions (limbic, associative and sensorimotor striatum).121, 
122 AMPH administration results in an increase in extracellular DA and a consequent reduction in 
[11C]raclopride binding. The change (Δ) in BP ND (the difference between the [11C]raclopride BP ND at baseline 
and post -AMPH treatment normalized to the baseline BP ND and expressed as a percentage) provides a non-
invasive measure of changes in DA concentration in the human brain. We will use the PET/double 
[11C]raclopride/AMPH paradigm described above to assess striatal endogenous DA release. Several recent, 
small scale studies using this technology10, 31 and a previous study96 of cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) homovanillic 
acid (HVA), a DA metabolite, support the likelihood that REC AN and BN have alterations of endogenous 
striatal DA releas e. In AIM 2B we will assess endogenous DA release to help interpret alterations in DA 
functional activity as well as D2/D3 receptors in limbic, associative, and sensorimotor striatal regions.  As 
summarized in Table [ADDRESS_279033] “motivated” responses whereas BN may have hypoactive dorsal associative 
inhibitory pathways. Several lines of evidence support our hypothes is that alterations of food -induced DA 
secretion, perhaps acting on DA D2 receptors, contribute to pathologic eating. In AIM 2C  we seek to replicate 
and extend findings that AN have a paradoxi cal response to palatable foods because endogenous DA release in 
the DC is anxiogenic in AN . This anxiogenic effect is  compensated  for by [CONTACT_231432]. 
We will also test the hypothesis that a measure of altered inhibition in AN is ass ociated with DC DA D2 
binding.  
 Behavioral disorders may be caused by [CONTACT_231433]. The relationship between altered 5 -HT and DA 
function (and effects on ventral limbic and dorsal cognitive circuits) may modulate pathological feeding behavior in AN and BN. In brief, 5- HT and DA systems are thought to interact (with 5 -
HT being aversive/inhibitory, and DA m odulating 
reward/motivation) to regulate appetitive processes.
42, 45 Our data9 
showed positive correlations between striatal [11C]McN5652 BP ND and [11C]raclopride BP ND in REC AN, R EC 
AN-BN, and REC BN. Interactions between [11C]McN5652 BP ND and [11C]raclopride BP ND significantly 
predicted harm avoidance (HA), a measure of inhibition and anxiety, in REC ED.  We hypothesize that binding of these ligands may reflect complex 5 -HT – DA n eurotransmission interaction processes. In AIM 3  we seek to 
replicate these findings and determine whether a similar relationship occurs in CW.

Page 3 In AIM 4  we will explore how [11C]DASB)BP ND and [11C]raclopride BP ND are associated with neural circuits 
that modulate appetitive behaviors. We will co- register, in the same REC ED and CW, the PET findings in 
AIMS 1 to 3 with an fMRI study (UCSD IRB project No. 080019; 2 R01 MH0042984- 17A1; W. Kaye PI) that 
examines neural substrates underlying appetitive, as wel l as reward and cognitive dysregulation. The anterior 
insula (AI) and striatum integrate the sensory/hedonic aspects of taste, interoceptive awareness, and 
reward/motivation. Importantly, fMRI studies show that REC AN have diminished181 and REC BN have 
exaggerated blood oxygen- level dependent (BOLD) response of this circuitry in response to tas tes of sucrose.[ADDRESS_279034] or 
motivation (due to excessive 5- HT inhibition), whereas the opposite may be true for BN. We predict that REC 
AN-BN may fall in -between REC AN and REC BN. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_231386] [11C]raclopride BP ND in REC AN. This 
supports the speculation that those with the most diminished AI response to sucrose may have the lowest 
striatal DA concentrations and, thus, reduced appetitive motivation to approach food. In s ummary, AIM 4 will 
explore links between striatal [11C]DASB)BP ND and [11C]raclopride BP ND, and neural processes related to 
appetitive function, reward, inhibition, and self -control. In AIM 5  (exploratory) we will genotype the 5- HTT, 
DA D2/D3 receptors, and other relevant genes to explore their relationship with brain imaging.  
In summary, this application seeks to understand how [11C]DASB)BP ND and [11C]raclopride BP ND  are related 
to traits that are shared by, or divide EDs into subtypes. Our overarching goal is to characterize neural 
processes in ED, and their relationship to behavior. Current treatments for AN and BN are of limited efficacy. In AIM  [ADDRESS_279035] comparison between experimentally manipulated stria tal DA  binding and average bli nk rates in human subjects.
  
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Background:  
AN and BN are disorders of unknown etiology that tend to have their onset during adolescence in women.1 
Although psychosocial factors are hypothesized to cause AN and BN, recent studies show that genetic 
heritability accounts for approximately 50 to 80% of the risk and creates neurobiological vulnerabilities.21, 32, 89, 
101, 155, [ADDRESS_279036] after recovery, and are elevated in unaffected family members.33 
Two types of consumatory behavior are seen in AN and BN . Restricting -type anorexics (“AN” in this 
application) lose weight purely by [CONTACT_231434]. Individuals with BN (“BN” in this application) do not become emaciated and are able to maintain an average body weight (ABW) above 85%. BN individuals alternate restricting with epi[INVESTIGATOR_231387]/or purging. The third category are individuals who have bot h AN and BN (“AN -BN” in this application). It has been argued that AN 
and BN share some common risk and liability factors because these disorders are often cross -
transmitted in 
families and share many behavioral traits.101, 113, 160, [ADDRESS_279037] poor impulse control, greater novelty seeking,
112, 159, 179 and 
high rates of drug and substance abuse.79  
Neural circuitry of ED:  Imaging technology has supported the emerging ability to characterize the neural 
circuitry of neuropsychiatric disorder s.[ADDRESS_279038] hypotheses regarding 
the neural processes that contribute to shared and independent behavioral traits in AN and BN. Work by 
[CONTACT_231435]137 describes how dysfunction of limbic and cognitive neural networks may occur in a range of 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 4 psychiatric disorders. Specifically, a ventral limbic neural circuit, which includes the amygdala, anterior insula 
(AI), AVS, and ventral regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is 
necessary for identifying rewarding an d emotionally significant stimuli and for generating affective responses 
to these stimuli. A dorsal executive function neural circuit, which includes the hippocampus, dorsal regions of 
the caudate, dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), parietal cortex, and other regio ns, is thought to modulate selective  
attention, planning, and effortful regulation of affective states. We hypothesize that AN and BN individuals 
have an imbalance within and/or between ventral limbic and dorsal cognitive circuits. Imaging studies from 
several groups169, 180, [ADDRESS_279039]. Thus, AN and BN may share an inability to precisely identify and/or modulate emotionality and reward in response to salient stimuli. Poor context separation 
may make them 
vulnerable to respond inappropriately  to the rewarding aspects of appetitive stimuli. In contrast, fMRI studies 
consistently show that ill and REC AN have increased activity in cognitive neural circuits,180, [ADDRESS_279040] diminished or impaired activity in these regions;120, 145, [ADDRESS_279041] less ability to sel f-regulate and 
control their impulses.   
Distinguishing Shared and Independent Traits in AN and BN:  One goal of this application is to determine how 
monoamine and neural circuitry contribute to aspects of behavior and may be associated with diagnostic 
categ ory (e.g., AN vs. BN), perhaps related to impulse control, or aspects that may cut across diagnostic 
boundaries, such as HA. We will study subjects recruited and assessed by  [CONTACT_231436]. 080019;  [ADDRESS_279042] a comp rehensive battery of behavioral and cognitive 
assessments. Still, we want to note that this application will focus on the role of HA, a multifaceted 
temperament trait39 that contains elements of anxiety, inhibition, and inflexibility; reflecting the concept of 
‘behavioral inhibition’. The reason is that our PET imaging studies show striking and consistent correlations 
between the BP of both 5- HT 1A and 5- HT 2A, DA D2/D3 receptors, and HA. HA is positively associated with 
increased 5 -HT 1A BP in REC AN,12 decreased 5 -HT 2A BP in REC AN -BN,11, normal 5- HT 2A BP in ILL 
AN/AN- BN13 and increased DA D2/D3 BP in REC AN/AN- BN.60 In addition to being a premorbid childhood 
predisposing factor,2, 112, 156 elevated HA is common in all ill ED subtypes (for revie w see Cassin36) and 
elevated HA persists  after recovery from AN and BN.[ADDRESS_279043] HA is a t rait that 
cuts across diagnostic boundaries (i.e., it is common to AN, AN -BN, and BN). However, it is possible that HA 
may be associated with extremes of impulse self -control.  
Distinguishing State and Trait in AN and BN: When malnourished and emaciated, i ndividuals with AN and BN 
have alterations of brain and peripheral organ function that are arguably more severe than in any other 
psychiatric disorder .50, 87 As a result,  neurobiological studies during acute illness are confounded by [CONTACT_231437]. Determining whether such symptoms are a consequence or a potential cause of pathological 
feeding behavior or malnutrition is a major methodological problem in the field. Considerable evidence 
suggests that childhood temperament and personality traits can create a vulnerability for developi[INVESTIGATOR_231388], however, premorbid neurobiological studies in children are not pra ctical. The strategy 
used in this application is to identify neurobiological vulnerabilities that are independent of the confounding effects of malnutrition by [CONTACT_231438].
179 Even if persistent physiological 
disturbances in REC EDs are “scars” they are still likely to help understand the processes contributing to these disorders.  
Altered 5-HT function in EDs : It is well known that [ADDRESS_279044] different patterns of 5- HT disturbances (see 
review by [CONTACT_231439].88). For example, different degrees of elevated CSF concentrations of 5- HIAA,94, [ADDRESS_279045] a poor response to 
SSRIs6, 34, 53 and other “antidepressant” medication, while these drugs have greater efficacy in BN.  
Altered DA function in EDs:  Genetic, pharmacologic, and physiological data20, 66, 88, 96, [ADDRESS_279046] been done.19, 82, 93 In terms of PET studies, our group found that REC AN and 
AN-BN had inc reased [11C]raclopride BPND in the AVS.9, 60 Moreover, [11C]raclopride BPND in the DC was 
associated with HA in REC AN/AN- BN. DA disturbances in EDs may contribute to an altered modulation of 
appetitive behaviors, symptoms of anhedonia, dysphoric mood, and increased motor activity.75, [ADDRESS_279047] a differential AVS response to positive and negative monetary feedback compared to CW. As 
noted above, AN and BN may share an inability to precisely identify and/or modulate emotionality and reward in response to salient stimuli.  
 
Exploration of group differences for endogenous DA release in striatal  regions of interest ( ROIs )  
Limbic striatal: Some, but not all, data show that mixed groups of REC AN and AN -BN have elevated 
baseline AVS [11C]raclopride BP ND compared to CW.9, 10, 60 While pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]10 in a mixed group of REC AN 
and AN -BN s howed a non- significant reduction of endogenous DA release in the AVS, an earlier study from 
our group showed that only the REC AN (pure restricting -type) had significant reduction of the DA metabolite 
HVA in CSF compared to CW. In Parkinson’s disease ther e is diminished CSF HVA and extracellular DA.38, 84 
We seek to determine whether pure R EC AN (never had BN) have reduced endogenous DA AVS release when 
compared to CW. Because endogenous DA displaces raclopride at the D2 receptor, elevated DA D2 receptor binding is consistent with diminished DA release. Altered AVS DA function in  
“pure” rest ricting -type AN 
group is likely given that this subtype has substantial anhedonia and reduced consummatory drive and other evidence of dysregulated AVS function.
62, 180, 181 
    With regards to predictions of AMPH induced DA release in REC BN and AN -BN, there are limited 
background data. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_231389] a non- significant baseline [11C]raclopride BP ND 
increase in the AVS in REC BN ,[ADDRESS_279048] deviation (SD). Moreover, REC BN and AN -BN 
have normal CSF HVA levels96, and ill BN have normal limbic DA release.[ADDRESS_279049] investigated 
mixed groups of AN and AN -BN, or BN a nd AN -BN. One advantage of the current study is that we are 
recruiting substantial numbers of “pure” subtypes. For example, the AN have never had BN symptoms. Second, data about DA release are critical for understanding DA’s relationship to anxiety and inhibition (AIM 2C) and to building a model (see below) regarding limbic and associative DA balance for the 3 subgroups.   
    Associative striatal DA predictions : In terms of the DC, the data reviewed above found no difference  
between REC AN/AN -BN and CW for baseline or  Δ BPND values. We expect to find normal  DC baseline 
[11C]raclopride  and Δ BP ND in “pure” REC AN.  There are limited data regarding DA function in BN. Broft [ADDRESS_279050] decreased mean baseline D2/D3 receptor BP ND in the posterior putamen and caudate in 
ill BN, and a significantly reduced/blunted DA release after the methylphenidate challenge in the anterior and

diagnostic groups (some of the ILL BN had a history of AN). Still, there are reasons to think (see below) that 
REC BN will have diminished baseline [11C]raclopride and DA release in the associative and sensorimotor  
striatum, whether it is a tra it or a “scar”.8, 73 
    Modeling DA process in AN and BN : AN and BN tend to have opposite extremes of self -control and 
inhibition. For example, recent meta -analyses35, 68 show increased rates of drug and alcohol abuse in BN and 
decreased rates in AN. In a recent review we propose91 that such inhibitory extremes make BN vulnerable to 
and AN “protected” from using drugs and alcohol and other consum atory (food) behaviors. There have been 
relatively consistent findings (reviewed in176, 177) of reduced PET [11C]raclopride BP ND in the striatum, 
including the ventral striatum, in those with substance abuse and alcohol use disorders. Reduced/blunted striatal DA release in individuals who abuse coc
aine and alcohol has been exhibited in a smaller number of PET 
studies in human and primate models.73, 122, 123, 174 Whether  BN and substance abuse share DA D2 receptor 
related vulnerabilities  and whether  opposite findings contribute to protective  factors in AN remains to be 
determined.   
    AIM 2B will contribute to building our model of striatal DA functional activity in AN and BN. Studies of food tastes and negative and positive feedback consistently show altered ventral limbic circuitry in AN and BN 
(see review by [CONTACT_231441]
91). In addition, fMRI studies tend to show that AN and BN have altered activity of dorsal 
executive/cognitiv e circuitry, which is consistent with the possibility that AN have enhanced higher -order 
inhibitory function and BN have reduced inhibition. Our overarching goal is to explore the balance between neural processes that modulate reward and inhibition. Do AN 
have “normal” DA “tone” in cognitive 
association networks in the dorsal neurocircuit (e.g. DLPFC -to dorsal striatum), which direct motivated actions, 
but impaired ability of the ventral striatal pathways that direct more ‘automatic’ or intuitive motivated 
responses? In BN, is there hypoactivity of dorsal cognitive association pathways that is insufficient in inhibiting 
“normal” hedonic/incentive motivation impulses in “reward” neural circuits? Alternatively, though not 
supported by [CONTACT_48040], is it possibl e that AN have adequate ventral limbic- striatal circuitry , but this ventral 
circuitry is  strongly inhibited by “hyperactive” inputs from cognitive domains such as the DLPFC and the 
parietal cortex ? Conversely, BN may have exaggerated hedonic/incentive moti vation impulses in “reward” 
neural circuits that overwhelm normal cognitive inhibition. Predictions about AN -BN are particularly 
handicapped by [CONTACT_231442]. It may be that they have impairments of both limbic and associated circuits 
leading to a particula rly dysregulated balance between reward and inhibition, or that they have exaggerated 
defects of associative circuits.   
 Relationship of endogenous DA release to anxiety and/or
 
inhibition in AN and BN:  
Background : Considerable literature (see 36) shows that HA, a 
multifaceted temperament trait39 that contains elements of anxiety, 
inhibition, and inflexibility, is elevated in individuals who are ill with AN and BN and persists after recovery.
179 As noted above, 
DC [11C]raclopride BP ND  is positively correlated with HA .9, 60 
Importantly, increased DA D2 -like receptor functional activity is 
associated with inhibition in healthy humans.72 Moreover, rats 
characterized as risk averse148 show greater D2 mRNA expression 
in the DC. In Aim 2C, we seek to explore how DA signaling in associative /executive cortical striatal circuitry may be related to inhibition and/or adverse consequences in AN and BN.  
    Anxiety : The major goal in Aim 2c is to replicate and extend 
our finding that self -reports of HA are associated with baseline D2 
binding in the DC in AN and BN, and self -reports of anxiety are

Page [ADDRESS_279051] people find eating to be a pleasant and rewarding experience. But for AN, 
eating stimulates dysphoric mood, while there is an anxiety -reducing character to dietary restraint and reduced 
caloric intake.61, 86, 153, 157, 173 Ingestion of palatable food is associated with striatal endogenous DA  release.8, 17 
We hypothesize that food- induced release of DA activates DC D2 receptors resulting in anxiety in AN (and not 
AVS related reward and motivat ion as in healthy controls). As a result, AN individuals pursue starvation 
because food refusal may be a way of diminishing DA release and concomitant anxiety. In fact, AN individuals 
have decreased CSF HVA, the major metabolite of DA,92, [ADDRESS_279052] to find that AMPH administration makes them more 
anxious, and that anxiety will be associated with increased endogenous DA in associative and sensorimotor striatal regions. There may als o be a group that becomes euphoric on AMPH. 
Broft31 reported evidence of an 
association between striatal DA response and ratings of “energetic” in ill BN but the se were said to be driven 
by a small number of data points. This group, which may be at higher risk for substance abuse, may have 
diminished endogenous DA in associative regions, or enhanced AVS DA release associated with pleasure.   
  Inhibition : Clinically, it is well known that AN have exaggerated self -control and are anhedonic so they are 
able to sustain self -denial of food as well as most comforts and pleasures in life.[ADDRESS_279053] (i.e., show less reduction in the value of  a monetary reward over time) 
compared to healthy volunteers.[ADDRESS_279054] may help to 
maintain persistent food res triction. We will build on a recent study72 in healthy controls that showed that 
striatal (particularly in dorsal regions) DA D2/D3 receptor availability was negatively correlated with speed of response inhibition [stop signal react ion time (SSRT)] and positively correlated with inhibition -related fMRI 
activation in frontostriatal neural circuitry. Thus 
people with faster stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_231390] D2 receptor 
binding in the caudate and putamen. The stop signal task (SST) requires peopl e to stop an already initiated 
response5 and calculates the speed of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SSRT). There are relatively little response inhibition data (with 
SST or any other task) in AN, but a recent study in AN found that they had longer SSRT.[ADDRESS_279055] after s ubjects complete the 
baseline [11C]raclopride PET study. We predict ( Figure 1 ) that both AN and CW will show a negative 
relationship between SSRT and DC D2 binding, but that such a relationship in AN will be shifted to the left due to reduced DA activation  of the D2 receptor. While slower inhibition in AN may seem counter -intuitive, this 
finding may be consistent with studies that show they have impaired abilities to change mental set.
[ADDRESS_279056] after administration of AMPH. Studies tend to show46, 111, 142 that AMPH improves 
inhibition in healthy people without changing “ going”  speed. That is consistent with the idea that AMPH 
induced release of endogenous DA increases activation of D2 receptors and thus underlies inhibition -related 
caudate activity.[ADDRESS_279057] to find that AMPH shifts healthy controls to the right ( Figure 1 ). An abnormal 
shift to the right in AN would suggest aberrant function of DA/D2 -related processes . It is possible that higher 
anxiety in AN179 contributes to the slower stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_231391]. While low threat puts people in a state of arousal 
where they can stop things more quickly, high threat association appears to make them slower .[ADDRESS_279058] is an adequate reflection of 
inhibitory control ability in AN (especially in a way  that relates to self -control).  I
ndividuals with BN and AN -
BN have a puz zling group of symptoms in that they alternate between being overly inhibited and overly 
disinhibited: eating behaviors tend to alternate between restriction and overeating with a loss of normal meal 
patterns.189 This study  will provide the opportunity to better understand relationships between [11C]raclopride

Significance:  The understanding of the pathophysiology of EDs has tended to lag behind ot her major 
psychiatric disorders. Improvement in the understanding and treatment of EDs are of immense clinical and 
public health importance133 as these are oft en chronic, relapsing illnesses77, 100, [ADDRESS_279059] puzzling symptoms that are unique to the 
disorder s: extremes of eating (restricting, bingeing/purging), relentless drive to lose weight, body image 
distortions, denial of illness, etc. We have little understanding of how such symptoms are encoded in the brain. 
These symptoms appear to be unique to humans. Since animal models have not been developed displaying 
these puzzling sym ptoms, studies in humans are essential. The  overarching goal of this, and related 
applications, is to use imaging to understand the neural circuitry of AN and BN and how symptoms are 
encoded in these circuits.  
 Importantly, for AN, there is no proven treat ment that reverses symptoms
133 or FDA approved medication.7, 34, 
83 While those with BN may respond better to treatment, many continue to be symptomatic or relapse.184 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_231392] 5 -HT and DA disturbances in ED, there is little evidence t hat selective 5 -HT reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs)6, 34, [ADDRESS_279060] DA  agonists in 
Cynomolgus monkeys103, and was further refined by [CONTACT_231443] a p otential key source of this link 
using the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP in monkeys ( cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_231393]). By [CONTACT_231444]’s Disease85, research in these patient 
populations ha ve indicated that these DA  abnormalities seem to be inducing the expected changes based on 
each disease’s dopamine profile consistent with the animal literature. This  work seeks to extend past patient and 
animal research by [CONTACT_231445].

Study -Day Session Procedures : Each study will be done during the early follicular phase (days 1 to 10) of the 
subject’s menstrual cycle. Subjects will arrive the day before the study and stay overnight at the Clinica l and 
Translational Research Institute (CTRI) at UCSD. On the day of the study, they will be awakened at 6:[ADDRESS_279063], they will be transported by [CONTACT_231447] 7:[ADDRESS_279064] confirmation will be made via the signed copy of the written 
informed consent and then an intravenous catheter will be placed in either the left or right antecubital vein. 
After in sertion of an intravenous catheter in a forearm vein, and a 20 minute transmission scan, a PET scan will 
be acquired following a slow bolus administration (over 20 sec) of 15 mCi of high -specific activity [11C]DASB. 
Emission data will be collected in 3D mo de for [ADDRESS_279065]’s discharge from the 
PET suite.  
    On the following day, the second day of the study, they will be awakened at 7:[ADDRESS_279066] PE
T scan will be acquired 
following a slow IV bolus administration (over 20 sec) of 10 mCi of high- specific activity [11C]raclopride. 
Emission data will be collected in 3D mode for [ADDRESS_279067] scan with [11C]raclopride, the participant will receive 0.[ADDRESS_279068] 15 minutes, every five minutes for the next 30 
minutes, and then every 15 minutes (up to at least 180 min) . The post -AMPH [11C]raclopride scan will be 
performed 3 hours after the administration of AMPH. Assessment of behavioral responses will be conducted 
before and after PET scans. The participants will complete a symptom -rating visual analog scale (VAS) pre -
baseline PET, pre -AMPH, and then at 30 minute intervals a questionnaire assessing several states: “happy,” 
“anxious,” “energetic,” “restless.”163 To assess study participants’ mood states and fluctuations, we will utilize , 
at the same intervals , the short version of Profile of Mood States (POMS -B).125 The POMS is a useful measure 
of mood states and their fluctuations  and is  appropriate for both research and therapy. It is a factor -analytically 
derived self -report inventory that measures six identifiable mood or affective states: tension -anxiety;  
depression- dejection; anger -hostility; vigor -activity; fatigue -inertia; and confusion- bewilderment. For  more 
than 30 years, the POMS assessment has provided a valid and reliable measure of affective mood states. The 
short version, POMS Brief, developed in  1989, has a total of 30- items with five on each of the six POMS 
factors. Like the longer version, the POMS -B has excellent internal consistency. Items are rated on a 5 -point 
scale (not at all, a little, moderately, quite a bit, extremely) and they only ta ke five minutes to compete. The 
items are easy for patients to understand, allowing them to quickly and accurately complete the assessment. The basic stop signal task

[11C]raclopride (post -AMPH) scan. The study will be completed by [CONTACT_231448]. At the 
completion of the second scan, the IV lines will be removed. An EKG, v ital signs, mental status and physical 
exam will be performed and evaluated by [CONTACT_231449]’s discharge from the PET 
suite. The subject will be served a cafeteria- style assortment  of lunch foods  following the [11C]DASB scan on 
Day [ADDRESS_279070] -AMPH [11C]raclopride scan on Day 2. The uneaten food will be weighed after completion 
of the meal and the total calories consumed will be recorded.   
 
MRI Protocol:  All participants will undergo an MRI procedure for anatomical localization  of ROIs. Only one 
MRI will be done per participant. A single MRI study will be performed at the UCSD Keck Center for 
Functional MRI using a GE Excite HDx 3.0 Tesla scanner as described in our parent grant. The registered MRI will be used as an individuali zed anatomic map for the selection of ROIs used in the analysis of the PET data 
(see section Neuroimage Analysis ). 
 
Radiochemistry of [11C]raclopride and [11C]DASB:  
[11C]raclopride will be prepared at the UCSD Center For Molecular Imaging, PET Radiochemist ry 
Laboratory. Radioactive [11C]CO2 will be produced by [CONTACT_941] 14N(p, α)11C nuclear reaction at the CTI RDS 111 
cyclotron operated by [CONTACT_231450]. The [11C]CO2 will be converted into [11C]CH3I in GE Tracerlab FX MeI box 
sequentially swept into a silver triflate oven to produce [11C]methyl triflate. O -desmethylraclop ride

of the loop will be quantitatively injected into a semi preparative liquid chromatography column. The 
[11C]raclopride fraction will be isolated, passed through a 0.22 µm sterile Millex -GV membrane filter, and 
collected in a 30 mL sterile vial already containing 15 mL of 0.9% sterile saline. Quality Assurance will be

Dextroamphetamine sulfate (oral)  is the dextro isomer of the compound d,l -AMPH sulphate. It is an FDA 
approved drug available for the treatment of narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (maximum 
approved total daily dose of 5- 60 mg). It is manufactured and marketed under the commercial name [CONTACT_231492] [CONTACT_231451]. As d exedrine is available as an orange, triangular, scored tablet in 5 mg, 
10 mg and 15 mg strengths, it will be dispensed by [CONTACT_231452] 0.5 
mg/kg (in 2.5 mg increments). For example a subject who weighs [ADDRESS_279072] successfully used oral AMPH in the dose range of 0.43- 0.5 mg/kg in PET imaging 
studies.10, 143, 191, 193, 194  
 
PET scan protocol:  The PET imaging will be done at the UCSD NeuroPET Center using a HR+ PET s canner 
under the supervision of Drs. Hoh and Buchsbaum. An intravenous catheter will be placed in a forearm vein for 
radiopharmaceutical infusion (this protocol will not involve arterial catheterization) and collection of blood 
samples. The subject’s head will be positioned and immobilized using a vacuum bead padding to decrease head movement during  the scan. A 20 minute transmission scan, using rotating rods of Ge -68/Ga -
68, will be 
obtained for attenuation correction of the emission scan(s). On the first day of the study, after the transmission scan, a PET scan will be acquired following a slow bolus administration (over 20 sec) of 15 mCi of high-specific activity [

the waiting period (post AMPH), the participant will be asked to perform a few structured tasks and rating 
scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Profile of Mood Scale (POMS)[ADDRESS_279076] with baseline. 
Approximately 5 mL of venous blood will be drawn at 0 and 30 min relative to the second [11C]raclopride scan 
to measure plasma AMPH levels. Following each PET scan, an EKG, vital signs, mental status and physical 
exam will be performed and evaluated by [CONTACT_231453]’s discharge from the 
UCSD PET center and the IV line will be removed.

Stop Signal Task:  The basic stop signal task115 will be done after the 1st [11C]raclopride (at b aseline) and then 
shortly after the 2nd [11C]raclopride (post -AMPH) scan. The test -retest reliability of the task is high.[ADDRESS_279077] (ROI) Definition for analysis of PET Data . PET and MRI image sets are 
aligned using PET/MRI fusion software (IDL, ITT Visual Information Solutions). ROIs are defined on MRI 
images across all MRI slices passing through those structures using an ROI drawing tool (imagetool) by [CONTACT_231454] (blind to the diagnosis) with established reliability.  For the [
11C]raclopride and [11C]DASB studies ROIs 
will include the three functional sub -division s (limbic, associative and motor) of the striatum as outlined by 
[CONTACT_231455].121. The l imbic striatum comprises the AVS; the associative striatum comprises the pre -
commisural DC, precommisural dorsal putamen and postcommisural DC; the motor striatum comprises the post 
commisural dorsal putamen. For the [11C]DASB studies, as outlined by [CONTACT_231456].,65 The subcortical regions 
include thalamus, insula, midbrain, medial temporal lobe  (a spatially weighted average of 5 limbic structures, 
the uncus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus). T he neocortical ROIs are 
as follows: DLPFC, medial PFC, OFC, ACC, temporal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067]. The cerebellum will be used as 
reference region for both studies. A different set of ROIs are routinely utilized for fMRI studies. As a result, we 
will define a second ROI set that will be applied to the PET BP ND maps and enable us to perform the integrative 
analyses to relate t he PET and fMRI data in exploratory AIM 4.  
    Anatomically constrained functional regions of interest for fMRI analyses. One of our co- investigators, [CONTACT_231494], in collaboration with his colleagues, has developed methods for reconstructing the corti cal sheet 
based upon routine 3D T1- weighted MRI volumes.43, 44, 54, 55 FreeSurfer not only allows for the accurate 
measurement of cortical thickness, it also provides a method for parcellation of the cortical surface, where each location on the surface is ass igned a neuroanatomical label based upon probabilistic information estimated from 
a manually labeled training set.
56 The ROIs that will also be used for fMRI analysis include: bilateral caudate, 
ventral striatum, medial PFC, ACC, DLPFC, medial OFC, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, and 
AI.  
    Analysis of PET Data:  The “PET” ROIs will be applied to the dynamic [11C]raclopride and [11C]DASB 
images to obtain decay -corrected, time -radioa ctivity curves using a calibrated phantom standard to convert 
tomographic counts to µCi/ml for each time point. Analysis of the PET data for both [11C]raclopride and 
[11C]DASB  will be performed using both the simplified reference tissue106 and graphical reference tissue116 
methods with the cerebellum as reference region for non -displaceable uptake. Both of these reference tissue 
methods have been shown to be appropriate models for quantifying [11C]raclopride49, 60 and [11C]DASB  
binding in humans65, 164 without an arterial input function. The outcome measure derived from these analyses is 
BPND. BP ND (unitless) is equal of f NDBavail/KD where B avail is the concentration of receptors available for 
radioligand binding in vivo  (not bound to endogenous li gand), K D is inversely related to the in vivo  affinity of 
radioligand for receptor binding and f ND is the fraction of radiotracer freely dissolved in tissue water (i.e. free 
fraction) in the non- displaceable compartment.80 We will also generate parametric BP ND maps that will be 
spatially normalized to the MR data set and the “fMRI” ROIs will then be applied to sample the normalized 
PET BP ND maps.  
    FC analysis across regions. We will explore functional inter -relationships in AI, OFC, striatum, and ventral  
and dorsal putamen by [CONTACT_231457]. Initial analyses will assess for 
outliers and distributions of fMRI and PET data times series to ensure modeling assumptions are met. Outliers 
will be Winsorized; non- normality will be handled via appropriate transformations. Missing data will be 
multiply imputed.[ADDRESS_279078]; subject -level PET 5 -HT/DA function in these same 
regions will be entered along with group membership (REC AN, REC AN -BN, REC BN, and CW). This 
random effects model will be used to test for whether any  group differences in FC in this network are (partially) 
explained by [CONTACT_231458] 5 -HT and/or DA function. The methods implemented in the FC toolbox in 
MATLAB (Version 7.6)[ADDRESS_279079], task -specific BOLD fMRI activation will be related to a specific PET BP ND value following the 
methods of Fisher et al. (2009).[ADDRESS_279080] squares (PLS) multivariate analysis will be applied to relate 
regional results and/or voxel level contrast maps.37, 141, [ADDRESS_279081] variables (X and Y) that can be statistical contrasts, covariates or 
neuroimaging data. The inter -block covariance matrix R YX between X and Y is determined and primary 
outcomes are scores  that represent the elements of block -X and block- Y that are most correlated. PLS can be 
applied to relate fMRI single -subject ROI results to PET BP ND maps or relate a difference map for a fMRI 
BOLD contrast to a difference map for a PET BP ND contrast between groups.  
 
Genetic Analyses:  
A one -time 20cc sample will be collected on the first scanning day only from consenting participants for the 
purpose of extracting DNA to determine whether polymorphisms of physiological systems that are known to 
influence 5 -HT and DA function contribute to binding on the PET/radioligand s tudies with women who have 
an eating disorder history. All samples collected will be identified without personal identifiers, but coded, and 
known only by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kaye's research team. Genetic samples will be used for eating disorder research, obesity or relat
ed disorders. Should a participant withdraw her consent from this genetic testing, the samples will be 
immediately destroyed. Otherwise, frozen samples will be kept under locked conditions at UCSD in the Eating Disorders Center for Treatment and Research  f
or an indefinite time where they will be submitted for analysis 
with DNA and lymphocyte extraction. A specific consent for this blood draw will be signed at the time of study consenting if the participant is interested in participating. Blood samples for g
enetic analysis will be stored in 
freezers at the Eating Disorders Center for Treatment and Research  under supervision of [CONTACT_231495]. [CONTACT_231495] 
will be responsible for determining how DNA will be used. The specimens collected and the DNA that they 
contain may  also be used in additional research to be conducted by [CONTACT_231459]. In addition to [CONTACT_231495], subjects DNA may also be studied by [CONTACT_231460], obesity and other related 
disorders. No more than a total of 105 cc of blood will be drawn for both studies together; this amount is 
approximately 20- 25% of a regular blood donation. 
 
Power and Statistical Analysis Plan: 
Aim 1 : In AIM 1 we will use PET and [11C]DASB BPND to determine whether there is a continuum of 5- HTT 
binding associated with diagnosis. We hypothesize that REC AN will show increased and REC BN decreased [
11C]DASB BPND in midbrain and striatal regions. REC AN -BN will have [11C]DASB BPNDs between those 
of REC AN and REC BN and will probably not differ from CW. These hypotheses will be tested by [CONTACT_231461] t -test with diagnosis as factor and [11C]DASB BPND as dependent variable. We will use Troendle's 
(1995) method to adjust for multiple comparisons .167 Our preliminary study14 found [11C]McN5652 BPNDs of 
1.169 (CW), 1.316 (AN), 1.027 (BN), and 1.168 (AN -BN) in the dorsal raphe, with a SD of 0.348 or less in 
each group. [11C]McN5652 is an older radioligand and, based on additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we expect to see 
[11C]DASB BPNDs that are roughly 2.17 -times higher than [11C]McN5652 BPNDs in the midbrain,  with only a 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 14 slight increase in within -group SDs (less than 0.382 for [11C]DASB BPND). With 25 subjects per group, a 
(Welch -Satterthwaite) t- test will have power in excess of 80% to see a difference between the REC AN and 
CW (based on a mean difference of 0.319 and a within- group SD of 0.382) and REC BN and CW (based on a 
mean difference of 0.308 and a within- group SD of 0.382) at the 0.05 level (two- sided). We expect the 
[11C]DASB BPND for REC AN- BN to be between that of REC AN and REC BN and (essentially)  the same as 
CW. 
 
Aim [ADDRESS_279082] increased AVS [11C]raclopride BPND compared to CW, and to further explore [11C]raclopride 
BPND in REC AN- BN. We will assess [11C]rac lopride BPND in ventral and dorsal putamen, ventral and DC 
and consider the influences of age, weight, and other relevant variables. These hypotheses will be tested by [CONTACT_231461] t -test, with diagnosis as factor and [11C]raclopride BPND as dependent varia ble. We will use 
Troendle's (1995) method to adjust for multiple comparisons.[ADDRESS_279083] to see 
[11C]raclopride BPND of roughly 2.120 (CW), 2.404 (REC AN), 2.299 (REC BN), and 2.147 (REC AN -BN) in 
the AVS , with SDs of roughly 0.359 in each group. With 25 subjects per group, a (Welch -Satterthwaite) t- test 
will have power in excess of 90% to detect differences in [11C]raclopride BPND between each of the ED 
groups and CW at the 0.05 level (two- sided). We will  also regress log [11C]raclopride BPND on group (REC 
AN, REC AN- BN, and REC BN, with CW as the reference group), controlling for age, height, and weight. To 
the extent that these additional covariates are associated with log [11C]raclopride BPND, this will  reduce the 
standard error associated with each of the group effects leading to improved power.  
 
In Aim 2B  ee hypothesize DA release (as reflected by [CONTACT_231462] Δ  BPND) will be diminished in REC AN patients 
when compared to CW. This hypothesis will be tes ted usin g linear regression, with diagnostic group as factor 
and log AVS BP ND as dependent variable, controlling for age, height, and weight. For Aim 2B, we propose a 
regression model of the form: [log(post -AMPH BP ND) = a + b * log(baseline BP ND) + c * group + err or and 
hypothesize that the group differences (c) will be statistically significantly different from 0. Indeed, based on 
our preliminary data, we expect a pre -post difference in log -binding -potential [log(BP ND)] in the AVS of 0.132 
in the REC AN group and 0.101 in the CW with SDs of 0.048, corresponding to a group difference of c = 
0.031, with a pre -post correlation of 0.90. Assuming this, with [ADDRESS_279084] 51% power 
at the 0.05 level (two- sided). This is improved by [CONTACT_231463] a ge, height, and weight. Indeed, controlling 
for these produces a smaller error SD of 0.034, with the same coefficient estimates as above. In this case, we 
will have power in excess of 0.80 for group differences at the 0.05 level (two- sided). Preliminary da ta from 
Broft et al .[ADDRESS_279085] the differences between ILL BN and CW in Δlog(BP ND) are even larger post -pre 
methy lphenidate administration. Indeed, they saw chan ges on the order of 2.[ADDRESS_279086] power  greater 
than 0.80 to see group differences at the 0.05 level (two- sided) in this case as well.   
 
Aim 2C  Relationships between [11C]raclopride Δ BPND and behavioral characteristics (from assessments and 
VAS scales) and plasma AMPH levels of subjects will be analyzed with Pearson Product -Moment correlation 
coefficient. For example, we will compare the Fisher’s z -transformed correlations between be havioral measures 
of euphoria and anxiety with [11C]raclopride Δ BPND in REC AN, REC AN -BN and REC BN vs. CW using a t -
test. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_231394], we expect correlations between euphoria and [11C]raclopride Δ BPND 
in the AVS to be larger (in m agnitude) than - 0.69 in CW and 0.21 in REC AN subjects. Assuming a difference 
in Fisher's z -transformed correlations of 1.06 (or larger), we will have power 0.91 to see a group difference at 
the 0.05 level (two- sided), with 20 subjects per group. (Note tha t the z -transformed value of 0.69 is - 0.85, and 
the z -transformed value of 0.21 is 0.21, giving a difference of 0.21 - (-0.85)  = 1.06). Similarly, we will correlate 
DA release with self -ratings of anxiety, euphoria, self -control, and labile mood in striata l regions in order to 
assess behavioral response, as well as SSRT and post -study food consumption. We will use continuous 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_279087] power in excess of 0.80 to see group 
differences at the 0.05 level (two- sided). We will explore the effects of age, height, and weight on DA release 
using partial correlations, after controlling for these variables.  
 
Spontaneous Eye Blink Rate:  Collec ting of eye blink rate data will be done two times during the study, shortly 
before the 1st [11C]raclopride scan (baseline), and shortly before the 2nd [11C]raclopride (post -AMPH) scan. 
Spontaneous eye blink rate will be measured by [CONTACT_231464] a computer screen that is 
equipped with a video recording device. Participants will be told to look at the fixation cross in the center of the 
screen for a duration of five minutes with the explanation that we are interested in recording aspec ts of facial 
movements. Participants will not be told that blink rates are the object of the fixation to ensure that blink rates 
truly are spontaneous and are not being intentionally manipulated by [CONTACT_2299]. Data will subsequently be 
scored by [CONTACT_231465] a blink per minute rate, similar to prior work using 
this methodology .[ADDRESS_279088] Population : We seek to recruit 30 REC AN, 30 REC AN -BN, 30 REC BN, and 30  CW, between ages 
18 to 45 for the PE T imaging studies. It is our experience from previous studies that it will be necessary to 
enroll an additional 20% of subjects due to drug failure, non- completion of PET studies, etc. Thus, we e xpect to 
comp lete PET studies in a total of 100  subjects (25 REC AN, 25 REC AN -BN, 25 REC BN, and 25 CW).   
    Only right -handed subjects will be included as screened by [CONTACT_231466].135 The 
rationale for  including only female subjects is that AN, AN -BN and BN among males is relatively rare (less 
than 10% in our experience). Furthermore, because some males with AN, AN -BN or BN have many atypi[INVESTIGATOR_231395], they should be subjects of a different study. All s ubjects will be matched by [CONTACT_654], IQ, income, 
race/ethnicity, and will be non -smokers. REC AN, REC AN -BN, REC BN, and CW will be matched by [CONTACT_44207]. 
Subjects will be recruited locally and nationally to reflect the racial/ethnic composition of the [LOCATION_002], 
which encompasses a wide range of ethnically diverse individuals (i.e., 65.6% White persons, not Hispanic, 
15.4% Hispanic or Latino origin, 0.2% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 4.5% Asian persons, 1.0% 
American Indian and Alaska Native persons,  12.8% Black persons, 79.8% White persons 
(http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/[ZIP_CODE].html ). While every effort will be made to recruit participants in 
respective proportion to these de mographics, it has been our experience that patients with AN, AN -BN and BN 
tend to be predominantly white. Subjects fulfilling all the inclusion, but none of the exclusion criteria, will be 
admitted to the study. No exclusion criteria shall be based on rac e or ethnicity.  
 
Inclusion Criteria for REC AN, REC AN -BN and REC BN Women : REC AN, AN- BN and BN subjects must 
have, at some point in their life, met a DSM -IV diagnosis of AN and/or BN. The onset of their illness must 
have been at least 4 years prior to pa rticipating in this study. Due to the high rate of conversion from AN to BN 
within 3 years of onset, this time requirement will ensure that they did not convert from one diagnostic subtype 
to another. Thus, diagnostically “pure” groups may be obtained. REC  AN women must have met DSM –IV 
criteria for AN, restricting type, with an ABW below 85% for height.[ADDRESS_279089] engaged in 
binge eating (as defined in DSM –IV) or purging behaviors (e.g., vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, enemas, 
etc.). REC AN -BN subjects must, at some point in their life, have been below 85% ABW and have had 
binging/purging behaviors during a period of low weight. REC BN must have met a lifetime DSM –IV 
diagnosis of BN with no history of AN. They must have engaged in b inge eating (as defined in DSM –IV)

months; b) Maintained a stable weight (± 3.0 kg) between 90% and 120% ABW128 for at least 12 months; c) 
Regular me nstrual cycles for the preceding 12 months; d) Have values within the normal range for beta –
hydroxy –buteric –acid (BHBA), glucose, and insulin during the evaluation phase. Subjects will be studied 
during the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle (early folli cular phase).  
 
Exclusion Criteria for REC AN, REC AN -BN and REC BN Women : a) Met diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse 
or dependence in the 3 months prior to the study. Alcohol or substance use within 30 days prior to PET studies 
as determined by [CONTACT_6270] -report,  clinical or psychiatric interviews, or urine toxicology screen; b) Current diagnosis 
of an Axis I major affective or anxiety disorder or suicidal thoughts, or presence of other psychopathology that 
might interfere with ability to participate in the study,  (e.g., requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231396]); 
c) Organic brain syndromes, dementia, psychotic disorders, or mental retardation; d) Neurological or medical 
disorders such as seizure disorder, renal disease including pyelonephritis and chronic cystitis, impaired renal 
function including hyponatremia (less than 135 meq/l), hypokalemia, raised BUN (more than 15 mg/dl), raised 
creatinine (more than 1.5 mg/dl), diabetes, thyroid disease including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, 
EKG indicative of  electrolyte imbalance; e) BN subjects whose primary or only purging methods were the use 
of laxatives, diuretics or means other than vomiting; f) Use of psychoactive medication in the 3 months prior to 
the study; g) Pregnancy, lactation  or lack of effecti ve birth control during the [ADDRESS_279091] will be conducted within 24 hours of the study; h) Tobacco use in the 3 months prior to the PET 
studies. 
 
Criteria for CW : Healthy CW must not have any stigmata suggestive of an ED. The y must have maintained an 
ABW between 90% and 120% since menarche. Their lab tests, medical and psychiatric histories, and physical 
and neurological examinations should indicate no current or past psychiatric (definitive Axis I disorder), 
medical or neurol ogical illness. We recognize that these criteria will create a selection of healthier than average 
control subjects. However, it was deemed more important to avoid the potentially confounding effects of 
psychiatric symptomatology in the control group with regard to the biological measures for the current study. 
All pregnant and la ctating women will be excluded.  
 
11. RECRUITMENT  
This is a five -year study in which we will recruit equal numbers of subjects each year. It is our experience from 
previous studie s that it will be necessary to enroll an additional 20% of subjects due to drug failure, non-
completion of PET studies, etc. Thus, we expect to enter [ADDRESS_279092] s to complete cells of 25 radioligand/PET 
studies per subject group. Overall, we will enter [ADDRESS_279093] 50 to 70% of individuals who have anorexia or bulimia eventually recover, we are confident 
that our recruitment goal can  be achieved over the proposed 5- year period. All CW will be recruited from the 
greater San Diego region to minimize travel cost. However, based on our experience, approximately 75% of our 
REC subjects will come from outside southern [LOCATION_004].  
    We will continue to employ recruitment strategies that were ef fective in our previous studies. These include:  
a) mailings to former patients of UCSD and the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_231397]; b)  mailings of IRB approved flyers t o 
clinicians and treatment centers specialized in EDs, and to university health and counseling centers; c) placing 
advertisements and study announcements in ED related publications, press releases and conferences (e.g., 
NEDA, AED and EDRS); d) placing stud y advertisements on websites such as EDReferral and NEDA. We will 
also utilize the UCSD research websites which make available to professionals and the lay public alike our 
research publications and current findings ; e) We may also contact [CONTACT_231468], provided they have given 
written permission to recontact [CONTACT_476]. There will be no cold -calling to any potential participant.  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_279094] our staff by [CONTACT_231469]: age, weight, height, use of medications, handedness and 
presence of metal in the body. Our procedure is to esta blish if prospective study participants meet minimal 
criteria as described before proceeding to explain the protocol and obtain address to send out consent form and 
self-report questionnaires. If subjects are disqualified at this time their information wil l be destroyed. If 
preliminary requirements are met, this information is destroyed (page 1 of brief screening tool) and we would 
then proceed to obtain mailing information. This information is the same as would be asked if the subject was 
being set up for a clinical appointment. The only information retained will be name [CONTACT_3816], and phone 
number. The protocol will then be explained to the subject and we will then mail a consent form and self -
assessment questionnaires to the subject. If a subject declin es to participate or does not meet the minimal 
required inclusion criteria as per brief screening tool, the information obtained will be destroyed. This 
information will also be destroyed after receiving a signed consent form back from a subject or in the case of no 
response after sending the consent information to a subject.  
Recruitment will be accomplished by [CONTACT_231470], website ads, craigslist, The San Diego 
Reader and ads in local and regional publications. Potential subjects can respo nd to these advertisements by 
[CONTACT_231471]. Many potential participants will live outside the immediate San Diego area; these potential 
research subjects would probably be unwilling to participate if they were required to come to UCSD to sign a 
written consent and undergo the initial screening. Also, because many subjects are excluded before completing 
the entire initial screening, requiring a trip to UCSD for a preliminary screening would be very time and cost 
intensive and therefore delay the compl etion of the study. Therefore, these subjects approaching us about 
participating in research will undergo a brief interview or telephone screening conducted by [CONTACT_79553] . 
This screening is designed to give a preliminary indication of whether or not the subject will be appropriate for 
this research study based upon current age, height, weight, and if the subject is currently on any medications. 
The preliminary screening tool is enclosed. It contains no name [CONTACT_231493], (page 1). The only informat ion 
retained will be name [CONTACT_3816], (page 2). Written consents will then be obtained from the participant before any information is obtained for the in-
depth screening process. If potential subjects appear to meet inclusion 
criteria (age, weight, height , and absence of medications) the research program will be explained to the 
subjects. All information is confidential and would not affect an individual’s employability or reputation. 
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Once a potential study participant expresses int erest in our study and meets preliminary eligibility requirements, 
as determined by [CONTACT_231472], a written consent form will be sent to the subject either electronically or via mail. Consenting procedures will be HIPAA compliant. Upon receipt of  
written consent, recruitment 
contact [CONTACT_231473]. The subject recruiter will present to study 
participants the objectives, procedures and a clear statement explaining risks and benefits involved in the study. Questions will be asked and elicited in order to ascertain that participants comprehend the study procedures as 
well as potential risks involved, prior to consenting to the study. All study related questions from study 
participants that a research staff is unable to address will be referred to one of the principal investigator, Drs. Kaye and Bailer , or other co -
investigators. Once a participant signed the consent form, the participant is 
considered enrolled in the study.  
 Participants will sign a separate co nsent form if they are interested in the future genetic study. The same 
consenting procedure described above will be followed.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
This is not a therapeutic study, and there are no alternatives.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_279095]. It should be noted that REC ED subjects are often motivated by [CONTACT_231474] a better understanding of EDs. We do not fe el 
that these studies pose any significant psychological risk for the patients.  
 
Risks of Venipuncture and Blood Sampling . There is minor discomfort and potentially significant 
psychological distress associated with venipuncture, if the procedure is not we ll-handled. There is a rare risk 
associated with the chance of infection or light -headedness or fainting due to blood withdrawal (less than 1 out 
of 100 people) and a more common risk (10 to 25 out of 100 people) of slight pain, bruising, bleeding or 
soren ess associated with taking blood from a vein.  
 
Risks of Catheterization.  Insertion of a catheter for intravenous injection of the PET radiopharmaceutical is 
rarely associated with the chance of infection (less than 1 out of 100 people), but more commonly a ssociated 
with slight pain or bruising at the puncture site (10 -25 out of 100 people).  
 
Risks of MRI.  According to the FDA, there is currently no evidence that MRI with approved scanners of up to 
[ADDRESS_279096], if unprotected, hearing loss can 
occur with prolonged exposure to the noise generated during MRI imaging. In addition, subjects may 
temporarily experience dizzine ss and/or nausea if the individual moves rapi[INVESTIGATOR_231398]. 
There is also the potential for RF -induced local heating and for mild electric stimulation due to induced currents 
from rapi[INVESTIGATOR_231399].  
 
Risks of administering tracer dose of [11C]DASB and [11C]raclopride. Mass doses of radiotracers used in 
these studies are negligible. For these compounds, with affinities in the pi[CONTACT_3252]-  to nano- molar range, the receptor 
occupancy is negligible, and we have not observed any pharmacologic al effects. However, as with any drug, the 
possibility of idiosyncratic reaction exists as discussed in the consent forms. 
 
Risk of administering oral AMPH.  The major somatic side effects of AMPH administration are 
cardiovascular (hypertension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tachycardia, bradycardia, orthostasis , syncope ). General effects such 
as sweating, feeling warm or cold, chest tightness, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
blurred vision, and headaches, have been reported. There is a rare risk of permanent neurologic damage and 
death as a result of cardiac arrest or stroke. One of the largest cohort (n=81 schizophrenic and n=7 control 
subjects) of published safety data for 0.5 mg/kg oral AMPH is a report by [CONTACT_231475].[ADDRESS_279097] hour, and absolute readings peaked at the second 
hour, at which point mean BP indices in subjects who received AMPH were 31 mm Hg greater for SBP 
(systolic blood pressure), 11 mm Hg for DBP (diastolic blood pressure), and 18 mm Hg for MAP (mean arterial pressure). They also observed a m ild but significant increase in heart rate (+ 10 beats per minute from baseline) 
after [ADDRESS_279098] 
successfully used oral AMPH in the dose range of 0.43- 0.5 mg/Kg in PET imaging studies, but they have not 
reported any adverse effects that required medical intervention.49, 143, 193, [ADDRESS_279099] not 
experienced any adverse effects in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].10 
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 19 Risks of Radiation Exposure:   Participation in the PET imaging procedures involves exposure to small 
amounts of radiation. The EDE per single injection is 0.39 rems for [11C]DASB and 0.25 rems for 
[11C]raclopride.  If the participants undergoes the maximum of 3 PET transmission scans, two [11C]raclopride 
scans (10 mCi) and one [11C]DASB scan (15 mCi) , the combined Effective Dose Equivalent (EDE)  radiation 
exposure will be equivalent to a whole body dose of 1.23 rem  (12.3mSv)  (24.64% of the annual whole body 
radiation exposure (5 rems) permitted to radiation workers by [CONTACT_231476]). This amount is approximately 
7 times more than they would receive from the average person’s annual background radiation exposure, which 
is approximately 160 mrem (1.6 mSv). This radiation dose is not expected to produce any harmful effects, 
although there is no known minimum level of radiation exposure considered to be totally free of the risk of causing genetic defects or cancer. Th
e risk associated with the amount of radiation exposure participants 
received in this study is considered low and comparable to everyday risks and similar to that from many 
commonly performed diagnostic Nuclear Medicine Procedures. If participants are espe cially concerned with 
radiation exposure or have had a lot of x -rays already, we advise that they should discuss their concern with 
their doctor.  
 
No PET studies will be performed on nursing, pregnant, or potentially pregnant women, as confirmed by [CONTACT_11084] p
regnancy testing and a urine test. Adverse effects of the radiopharmaceuticals in the study have not been 
reported. However, the possibility exists for a rare reaction to any of the substances or procedures to which the subject is exposed. Insertion of cat
heters for intravenous injection of the PET radiopharmaceutical may be 
associated with slight pain or bruising at the puncture site.  
 
Risk of Breach of Confidentiality. Breaches in confidentiality could impact future insurability, employability, 
or reprodu ction plans, or have a negative impact on family relationships, and/or result in pat ernity suits or 
stigmatization.  
 
Risk of Alcohol Exposure : The production of the [11C]raclopride compound contains up to 10% alcohol. This 
would amount to a total injected alcohol amount of 2mL of ethanol. Two mL distributed over 5000 mL whole 
blood or 2500 mL plasma would represent 2/5000 = 0.4 x 10- 3 (Blood alcohol Concentration BAC 0.0004) or 
2/2500 = 0.8 x 10- 3 (BAC 0.0008) as maximum amount.  
 
Risks of psychological ass essments : The main risks are that clinical interviews, cognitive testing and self -
report questionnaires are time consuming. Material elicited during interviews may be upsetting to some study 
participants. Others may find cognitive tasks to be challenging o r frustrating. These assessments, however, 
rarely pose psychological risks for study participants. 
 
MRI:  The subject may experience discomfort being in the confined environment of the scanner.  
 
Exposure to a high magnetic field. The only known hazard assoc iated with exposure to a static high magnetic 
field is that the magnet exerts a strong force on ferromagnetic objects. For this reason, ferromagnetic objects are 
excluded from the vicinity of the magnet so that they will not become projectiles. In addition , each subject 
undergoes a standard screening procedure to determine whether they have any implanted materials that may 
pose a risk. If there is any doubt about the nature of any implanted material, the subject will not be scanned. 
Conventional MRI uses 1.5 Tesla (T) magnets. At the Keck Center for Functional MRI, the research systems 
for human use have field strengths of 3T. Imaging at these field strengths is not considered a significant risk 
according to FDA guidelines. 
 
Heating from radiofrequency (RF) pulses.  The RF pulses that are used for creating the MR signal deposit 
some energy in the body in the form of heat, but no ionizing radiation is used with MRI. For the same pulse 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 20 sequence, the RF power deposited is higher at higher magnetic field strengths . However, the pulse sequences 
we will use at 3T has relatively low power depositions. In the future pulse sequences with higher RF power 
depositions may be developed, but we will insure that the power deposited is always below the FDA guidelines.  
 
Periphe ral nerve stimulation from rapi[INVESTIGATOR_231400] (dB/dt).  Magnetic field gradients are 
switched on and off during imaging to encode the spatial distribution of the MR signal. Gradient switching rate 
depends on the gradient coil used, but does not depend on field strength. For this reason, the gradient switching 
rates will be similar to those for the 1.[ADDRESS_279100], and these rates will not exceed 
FDA recommendations. The FDA guideline states that a significant risk is inv olved only when “dB/dt sufficient 
to produce severe discomfort or painful stimulation” is used. All of the MRI studies performed in the past at 3T 
systems at UCSD are well below this threshold.  
 
Acoustic noise.  Acoustic noise is always an unwanted side ef fect of MR imaging. As currents are pulsed 
through the gradient coils within the magnetic field, the system acts like a loudspeaker, making a repetitive 
tappi[INVESTIGATOR_231401]. At the higher field strengths (3T) the acoustic noise is increased. In all our studies s ubjects will 
wear ear plugs to reduce the noise to a comfortable, safe level. The FDA guideline for a significant risk due to 
acoustic noise is “peak acoustic noise over 140 dB”, and we will insure that the acoustic levels remain well 
below this value. 
 
Acquisition of Eye Blink Rate.  The main risks associated with acquisition of eye blink data are associated 
with time consumption. Participants may become bored or irritated having to sit still and hold a fixation on a 
computer screen for [ADDRESS_279101] be so anxious about venipuncture that these studies are not 
feasible.  The taking of a blood sample may cause some discomfort. The CTRI nurse and the study staff will 
monitor the subjects’ condition closely to minimize any discomfort.  
 
MRI Related Risks . Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], [ADDRESS_279102] been measured to produce noise b etween 122- 131 db.59 
The potential risk of hearing loss associated with the noise generated during MRI is eli minated by [CONTACT_231477] (rated to reduce noise by 32 dB) and through the use of headphones (rated to reduce noise 30 dB). 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_279103]’s weight is accurately recorded and used in 
determining the appropriate changes in gradients. Subject s are warned of the possibility of mild electric 
stimulation and are monitored throughout the session. Exclusions will be made for the following: cardiac 
pacemaker, metal fragments in eyes/skin/body (shrapnel), history of being a metal worker/welder, histo ry of 
eye surgery/eyes washed out because of metal, aortic aneurysm clips, prosthesis, by -pass surgery/coronary 
artery clips, hearing aid, heart valve replacement, subjects with an IUD (birth control device), a shunt 
(ventricular or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]), electrodes, me tal plates/pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]/screws/wires, or neuro/bio -stimulators (TENS unit), vision 
problems uncorrectable with lenses, claustrophobia, inability to lie still on one’s back for approximately [ADDRESS_279104] will be performed within 24 hours of the study. No studies will be 
performed on pregnant or potentially pregnant women. If there is a possi bility of metal being present in the 
participant’s body, the participant will be asked to undergo an x -ray study to rule out the presence of metal. The 
participant will be required to sign an additional consent form to undergo the x -ray study.  
 
In order to  minimize the risk of fear of closed spaces while in the MR scanner, patients will be extensively 
interviewed and informed about the nature of the task. If, at any point in during the scanning, the subject 
expresses increasing discomfort, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_231402]:  All subjects will be screened twice before they will be allowed to enter the 
MRI facilities. Any non -removable magnetic material will automatically exclude subjects. A ll staff is regularly 
trained in MRI safety procedures by [CONTACT_978].  
 
Heating from radiofrequency (RF) pulses : The MRI pulse sequences that will be used are discussed prior to 
usage by [CONTACT_231478] (CMR) with respect 
to potential heating effects. The physicists at the CMR regularly test pulse sequences on phantom objects for 
heating effects.  
 
Acoustic noise: Subjects will be instructed to wear earplugs or headsets that reduce the noise by [CONTACT_2902]  20-40 
dB. Subjects will be instructed to indicate if the noise is a source of physical or psychological discomfort. If 
this were to occur the experiment will be terminated immediately.  
 
PET and  Radiation related issues  The use of [11C] radioligands in thi s research proposal is considered to be 
generally safe and effective as approved by [CONTACT_59923], San Diego Radioactive Drug Research 
Committee in accordance with Food and Drug Association regulation 21 CFR 361.1. No PET studies will be 
performed on pregnant or potentially pregnant women, as confirmed by [CONTACT_231479] 24 
hours prior to each PET scanning session. The total Occupational Dose Limit / EDE for adults, as regulated by 
[CONTACT_231480] 5.0 rem per year. Thus, for the three  studies the EDE is about 
24.64 % of the radiation dose (5 rem) permitted on an annual basis to radiation workers by [CONTACT_17926] 
(21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 361.1. If an X -ray study is required to rule out the presence of metallic 
fragments, the maximum radiation dose to the involved body area will be 0.3 rems (a unit of radiation dosage), 
with minimum exposure of the other areas of the body. In order to restrict the yearly cumulative exposure to 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_279105] are excluded, as well 
as subjects exposed to nuclear medicine procedures during the previous year, including research protocols. In 
case of idiosyncratic reactions to the rad iotracers, a physician is present at each experiment and will be 
available at all times during the study and an emergency cart will be in close proximity.  
 
Risk of Alcohol Exposure : The radiotracer that is injected will contain a very small amount of alcoh ol that is 
1/[ADDRESS_279106] states. This amount is minimal (Blood alcohol 
Concentration BAC 0.0004). The common legal limit for driving is a BAC of 0.8. In most cases the injected 
dose will be below. We do not expect that  the subject will even recognize any effects from this amount of 
alcohol; however, we discourage subjects with a history of alcohol dependence from participating in order to 
avoid the risk of relapse.  
 
Participant Monitoring on AMPH : Subjects with a histor y of hypertension or any heart disease will be 
excluded. Only subjects who are normotensive ( 100/70> BP<120/80) and have a HR above [ADDRESS_279107] [11C]raclopride scan, as well as when measured [ADDRESS_279108] [11C]raclopride scan when subject will lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_279109] by a physician familiar with the protocol 
(study physician, [CONTACT_231496]). A study physician will be available to monitor the  subject until discharge. 
In order to monitor possible side effects of amphetamine including cardiovascular (hypertension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
tachycardia, bradycardia, orthostasis , syncope ) as well as general effects such as sweating, feeling warm or 
cold, ches t tightness, nausea, diarrhea,  vomiting  muscle and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], blurred vision and headaches, 
blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded every two minutes for the first 15 minutes after amphetamine 
administration, then every five minutes for 30 minutes, then every 15 minutes thereafter (up to at least 180 min) and then hourly until discharge. In addition, a participant will be asked to fill out an adverse event questionnaire after amphetamine ingestion in the following intervals: 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min and 180 min. If the patient has a SBP>190 or DBP>130 for greater than 5 minutes after ingestion of AMPH, then treatment with oral labetalol (200 -400 mg) will be initiated. Sublingual nitroglycerin (150- 600 
mcg) will be administered if the patient complains of chest pain. All changes from a laying to a sitting, laying 
to a standing, or sitting to a standing position of the participants will be assisted by [CONTACT_231481]. Participants 
will be requested to dr ink at least 1.[ADDRESS_279110] and end of the 2nd scan. If 
the patient has psychomotor activation or behavioral symptoms suggestive of a hypomanic state, they will be treated with oral lorazepam 2 mg. If symptoms of nausea, 
diarrhea, muscle and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or 
headaches occur and are persisting and becoming intolerable for the participant, we will provide respective 
medication (including antiemetic medication, spasmolytics and pain medication) based on the individual 
clinical severity and assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_83619], [CONTACT_231496]. All these medications will be 
stored at the UCSD NeuroPET center for emergency management. Following emergency treatment with these 
medications, the appropriate routine medical  care will be initiated and provided. If any of the above side effects 
persist for more than [ADDRESS_279111] will receive: a) 
physical exam; b) vital signs measurement; c) mental status exam and d) EKG  
  Transfer Criteria : The subject will be transferred from the UCSD PET center to the UCSD Eating Disorder 
Treatment and Research Center once they meet the following criteria upon evaluation by a study physician: a blood pressure of less than 150/90 mm Hg; a heart rate of less than 110 BPM; no behavioral abnormalities.  
   Discharge Criteria:  After a minimum of [ADDRESS_279112] will be 
medically discharged from the UCSD Eating Disorder Treatment and Research Center  only if they meet the 
following crite ria upon evaluation by a study physician: a) a blood pressure (BP) of less than 20 mm Hg above 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 23 their baseline reading for systolic and diastolic BP or less than 150/90 (whichever reading is lower); b) a heart 
rate of less than 20 BPM above their baseline or 100 (whichever reading is lower); c) no reported subjective 
effects from the AMPH; d) no adverse events to the AMPH; e) a normal physical exam; f) a normal mental 
status exam. Most of the REC AN and BN will travel to San Diego for this study. We will establish a policy that 
they are required to stay the night after the study and will be discharged to travel home the next day. For the 
subjects that live in San Diego, we will ask a relative to drive them home after being discharged from the study.  
 
Confidentiality. To minimize possible risk of breach of confidentiality, each study participant will be assigned, 
upon entry into the study, a numeric code which will be used as the identifier for subsequent research related 
activities. All information collected, including self -report questionnaires, psychological assessments, and 
imaging data are identified solely by [CONTACT_231482]. Only strictly anonymous 
data will be entered into the database and used for statistical analysis. Acc ess to the numbering system will be 
limited to the principal investigators, Drs. Bailer and Kaye, and their research staff involved in the study. 
Research files will be kept in locked quarters and made available only to qualified personnel for research 
purposes. No verbal or written information concerning a subject will be released to anyone without expressed 
written consent by [CONTACT_423].  
If blood samples are obtained for genetic sampling, all samples will be labeled by [CONTACT_231483], as knowledge of genetic research data could potentially impact 
future insurability, employability, or reproduction plans; or have a negative impact on family relationships; and/or result in shame or embarrassment. 
 
Others.  Unanticipated findings of potential medical significance uncovered during the course of the study, 
including a positive pregnancy test or an abnormal MRI, will be reported to the PIs. The study participant will 
be informed of the test result and then refe rred to her physician. If the participant does not have a regular 
physician, an appropriate referral will be made.  If the participant does not have a regular physician, an 
appropriate referral will be made. In the unlikely event that a subject is injured d uring the study, she will 
receive care from the University of [LOCATION_004] as needed to treat the injury.  
 
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
To minimize possible risk of breach of confidentiality, each stu dy participant will be assigned, upon entry into the 
study, a numeric code which will be used as the identifier for subsequent research related activities. All 
information collected, including self -report questionnaires, psychological assessments and imagi ng data are 
identified solely by [CONTACT_231482]. Only strictly anonymous data will be entered into the database and used for statistical analysis. Access to the numbering system will be limited to the principal investigator, Drs. Kaye and Bailer, and the research staff involved in the study. Research files will be kept in 
locked quarters and made available only to qualified personnel for research purposes. No verbal or written information concerning a subject will be released  to anyone without expressed written consent by [CONTACT_423].  
A data and safety monitoring plan will be implemented with close supervision by [CONTACT_231484] -related activities. Drs. Bailer and Kaye will meet weekly with their research staff to review 
recruitment issues, data collection and entry and assess the adequacy of procedures to ensure subject privacy and confidentiality. More specifically, the data safety and monitoring plan will involve 1) evaluation of the progress of  the research study, e.g., assessing data quality and timeliness of participant recruitment, accrual and 
retention; 2) review of the outcome and adverse event data to determine whether there is any change to the anticipated benefit -to-risk ratio of study p articipation and determination of whether the study should continue 
as originally designed, be changed or terminated; 3) assessment of external factors or relevant information that may have an impact on the ethics of the research or safety of study partici pants; and 4) review of study 
procedures designed to protect the privacy of the research subjects and the confidentiality of their research data. 
In addition, we will use a Data Safety Monitoring Board consisting entirely of personnel not associated with t he

communicate with Drs. Bailer and Kaye, as well as the IRB, in compliance with IRB policy for reporting 
adverse events. All fatal or immediately lif e-threatening events as well as unanticipated problems (UPRs) will 
be reported in writing to the IRB as soon as possible and no later than [ADDRESS_279113] Operating 
Policies and Procedures (Section 3.13). The IRB will determine appropriate actions for mitigating unexpected problems. UPRs involving risks to human subjects or others will be promptly reported to OHRP, FDA, and the appropriate Unive rsity officials. In addition, adverse events will be reported annually as a part of the 
Continuing Review in compliance with UCSD Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review Board Standard Operating Policies and Procedures (Section 3.11). If, during the course of the study, changes or modifications to the study protocol become necessary to ensure continued confidentiality measures, or to ensure the level of risk associated with this study, the IRB will be notified immediately.  
 
17. POTENTIAL BEN EFITS  
Subjects participating in this study will benefit from the screening procedures that include a careful 
examination of the patient's psychiatric condition. Subjects will be paid for their participation since subjects will not accrue any other direct benefit for their participation in this study. Both experimental and control subjects will receive remuneration for their participation in these studies. Many subjects work or attend school, so that participation in this study will mean that they will have  to take time off from these responsibilities. This 
payment is to serve as an incentive for subject participation and to reimburse travel, lost wages, and expenses (e.g., parking). Although the individual subjects may not receive any benefit beyond financi al remuneration, the 
data generated by [CONTACT_231486], and pave the way for new clinical treatments for these disorders. Study participants may also gain satisfaction from the knowledge  that they are contributing to a better understanding of brain function and potentially to the 
etiology of a psychiatric illness. There is little in the way of proven treatments for ED, particularly AN. Consequently, this is a costly and often chronic disorder for many. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of AN and BN is likely to lead to better therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The information gathered in this study will contribute to understanding [ADDRESS_279114] for any of the medical procedures or for the PET or MRI or 
evaluations required for the study, questionnaires or assessments.  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
Subjects will be compensated $375.00 for participation in each of the [11C]DASB PET scan and the 1st 
[11C]raclopride scan, for a total of $1250.00 if they completed also the 2nd [11C]raclopride scan after ingestion 
of amphetamine . Consented participants who do not meet all criteria will be paid $[ADDRESS_279115] the 
written assessments, and $25.00 for completing the preliminary subjective assessments and physician 
interview. If a participant is ruled ineligible after completing the entire screening process with interviews, 
assessments, physical, labs and EKG, they will be compensated $50. 00 for their time.

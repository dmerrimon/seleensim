Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  I. Introduction to Protocol:  
 
In this protocol, we have included  elements of the funded study that pertain to the Strong Minds -
Strong Communities  clinical trial, described in the submitted publication. We have not included 
details of other study activities that go beyond the scope of the clinical trial , and we have 
synthesized language to be clear  for publication . Terminology and roles reflect the primary IRB 
site, with some adjustments in practice at the cede review site.  
 
II. Background and Significance  
 
For racial/ethnic and linguistic minorities, disparities emerge along the continuum of mental 
health care. Members of these groups are heavily represented in Medicaid. Nonetheless, they 
face many barriers to care, including a shortage of trained providers who can provide culturally 
congruent service in their preferred language and an absence of easy identification of mental 
health need s. Members of racial/ethnic and linguistic minority groups are less likely to initiate 
and remain engaged in mental health t reatment. When  accessing  care, they frequently receive 
less appropriate or poorer quality services . As a result, Latino, Asian, and Black individuals 
experience greater unmet need compared to non -Latino Whites (~80% vs. 63%).  
 
Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid expansions do 
not appear to have decreased the gap in mental health treatment between Whites and 
racial/ethnic minorities. State Medicaid -based accountable care organizations (A COs) are 
increasing in number, with the goal of providing care coordination via team -based approaches, 
reducing disparities, and linking with community -based services employing a population health 
approach within capi[INVESTIGATOR_276205]. However, many ACOs hav e not yet incorporated mental 
health services into their provider networks, representing a missed opportunity to close a 
4 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  treatment gap. To reduce mental health disparities for racial/ethnic and linguistic minorities, this 
study examines how to successfully build staff capacity and training opportunities to help ACOs 
implement evidence -based mental health interventions.  
 
The purpose of this research project is to reduce mental health disparities for racial/ethnic and 
linguistic minorities by [CONTACT_276211] -ACO -academic partnerships to collaborate in 
building capacity for mental health care; training Community Healt h Workers (CHWs) to provide 
an integrated, evidence -based intervention in community settings linked to ACOs; and 
addressing participants’ activation and social needs through a care manager that connects 
participants to needed services. We propose a model t hat includes CHWs as mental health 
providers, who offer an evidence -based mental health intervention called Strong Minds -Strong 
Communities  to address the shortage of trained providers who can offer culturally congruent 
mental health service in non -English languages in Medicaid -based ACOs, thereby [CONTACT_276212] l/ethnic 
and linguistic minorities in North Carolina (NC) and [LOCATION_005] (MA).  
 
The following protocol focuses on Aim 2, the clinical trial portion of the study.  
 
III. Study Design Summary  
 
A. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  Latino, Asian, Black (African American or Afro -Caribbean), or non -Latino 
White adults 18+ years of age with moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
This includes participants who score 50+ on the CAT -MH depression administered in 
English/42+ for the CAT -MH depression administered in Spanish or Chinese and/or 51+ for the 
5 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  CAT-MH anxiety administered in English /41+ for the CAT -MH administered in Spanish or 
Chinese; and/or a positive score on the CAT -MH Major Depressive Disorder,  and without any 
mental health care (therapy sessions with psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker) in the past 
[ADDRESS_337134] speak English, Spanish, Mandarin, 
or Cantonese.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  Participants will be excluded if there is evidence of: (1) history of psychosis, 
mania, or psychotic symptoms; (2) specialty mental health treatment within past 3 months; (3) 
upcoming behavioral health appointment (pharmacological not excluded); (4) evide nce that the 
participant lacks capacity to consent (measured by a validated screener); (5) evidence of 
current suicidal risk or harm to others (affirmative responses on Paykel suicide questionnaire); 
and (6) severe alcohol or substance d ependence (CAT score 70+, showing a high level of risk 
in substance  use). 
 
Recruitment goals:  We estimate needing to screen 3,525 participants per site (MA and NC, 
total of 7,050) to end up at roughly 600 eligible and willing to participate in the intervention trial 
in each site with attrition (1200 across MA and NC).  
 
IV. Source of Subjects and Recruitment Methods  
 
Recruitment in [LOCATION_005] and North Carolina will occur in ACOs with large populations of 
ethnic minorities, as well as Community Clinics and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) 
that serve large numbers of racial/ethnic and linguistic minority clients in the ACO catchment 
areas. We will accept referrals of potential participants to screen from clinicians or staff at the 
organizations. We will also consider individuals who are not necessarily patients or clients of the 
participating clinics or community -based organizations . We will also recruit potential participants 
[ADDRESS_337135] sending a letter and 
then following up by [CONTACT_276213].  
 
Within collaborating ACOs/CBOs, Community Health Workers (either hired by [CONTACT_276214]/CBO sites) or Clinical Research Coordinators  will recruit and screen participants.  
They will take part in regular supervision and will have access to study staff they can contact 
[CONTACT_276215], related to recruitment, consent, 
screening, and initiation of emergency protocols if needed . Research staff  will recruit and screen 
participants, while potential  participants are at the ACOs/CBOs for regular programming. CHWs  
or CRCs  will work closely with the providers to identify potential participants who may be 
approached for screening.  Depending on clinic preferences, CHWs /CRCs  may also approach 
any individual waiting in the clinic. After introducing themselves and explaining that they would 
like to discuss a new study being implemented at the ACO/CBO, the CHW or CRC and potential 
participant s will move to a  private room for consent.  
 
Since the onset of the coronavirus, we will provide the option of continuing our recruitment by 
[CONTACT_648]. We adjusted our protocol to allow audiotaped, phone -based informed consent. This will 
be particularly useful for participating  sites, given that we will contact [CONTACT_276216] . We would contact [CONTACT_276217], via a letter from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_276206] (previously approved by [CONTACT_1201]) 
and then by [CONTACT_276218]. Staff at community sites can also indicate 
to their clients on outreach calls that someone from our study will contact [CONTACT_476], and then our 
staff will reach out by [CONTACT_648]. Community sites will share the names of clients that we can 
contact.  
 
[ADDRESS_337136] Enrollment  
 
A. Methods of enrollment, including procedures for obtaining consent  
 
Community Health Workers  or Clinical Research Coordinators  will administer the informed 
consent at each ACO/CBO  site. The CHW or CRC will go through the Informed Consent Form 
and ask the potential participant if he/she is interested and willing to be screened. We will ask 
the potential participant to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to administering the screening. 
If the potential participant is eligible and willing to take part in the program, the CHW or CRC will 
administer a capacity to consent form (based on Zayas et al, 2015). Subjects are not limited in 
the time taken to decide whether or not to participate in the study. However, if they inform us [ADDRESS_337137] the participant’s screener ID and ask them 
to confirm verbally that they reviewed the informed consent form and text messaging consent 
form with the research staff by [CONTACT_276219]. We will ask them to verbally respond as well on audiotape to the 
8 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  subsequent questions such as sharing info with the PCP and related to referrals. CHWs will 
proceed to administer the screener to participants who provide verbal consent to participate in 
the study. CHWs will administer the Capacity to Consent to eligible p articipants. We will mail the 
$15 gift cards to participants who complete the screener.  
 
Participants who are eligible as determined from the screener, pass the Capacity to Consent, 
and are interested and available to take part in the study will then be passed to baseline.  A 
Clinical Research Coordin ator (CRC) will administer the baseline interview.  Once the baseline 
interview is complete, the CRC  will contact [CONTACT_32808] , who will then randomize the 
participant. The project director will assign participants randomized to the intervention group to a 
CHW at the participant’s ACO/CBO, an d the CHW will call the participant to schedule an initial 
session. The project director will contact [CONTACT_276220], and that they will be contact[CONTACT_276221].  
 
Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_337138] for participation in the screening. Those who are enrolled 
will receive $ 40 gift cards for completing the baseline, and 3 - month assessment, a $[ADDRESS_337139] 
for completing the 6 -month and a $[ADDRESS_337140] for completing the 12 - month follow -up 
assessment . For a small proportion of participants who  are not screen -eligible , we will 
administer the baseline interview and provide them with the $25 incentive. This is to ensure that 
our screener is accurately identifying positive cases.  
 
VI. Research Procedures  - Intervention  
 
The proposed study is an evidence -based intervention (see CERED intervention) which 
demonstrated effectiveness. Strong Minds -Strong Communities  is culturally adapted from 
9 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  cognitive behavioral therapy and includes mindfulness exercises, promotion of behavioral 
activation through pleasant activities and developi[INVESTIGATOR_276207]. The intervention 
is led by [CONTACT_276222] 10 sessions, tailored to the partici pant using a collaborative 
approach, to improve mood symptoms, augment self -reported functioning, and increase self -
reported quality of care among participants with moderate to severe symptoms of depression 
and/or anxiety. The Strong Minds -Strong Communiti es intervention seeks to increase 
engagement, decrease depression and anxiety symptoms, improve functioning, and increase 
perceived quality of care among low -income racial/ethnic and linguistic minorities. The 10 -
session intervention is culturally adapted fo r use among a wide group of minority populations 
(Latino, Asian, African -American and Afro Caribbean), has few exclusionary criteria to improve 
generalizability, and is administered by [CONTACT_276223] -level clinicians. The CHW will conduct a welcome visit with eligible participants, 
introduce them to the program, and provide the workbook and educational materials. The CHW 
will give feedback on symptoms to the treating primary care provider (PCP) if participants allow 
it and will use motivational interviewing techniques to increase engagement.  The first 5 sessions 
will occur weekly. Every other week , the CHW will evaluate the participant with  either the 
PROMIS for depression or for anxiety (short form), the 9th question from the PHQ -9 regarding 
suicidality , and  if necessary, the 5 -item suicide questionnaire, both for participant safety and to 
ensure the participant’s mental health is not deteriorating to the point where immediate 
intervention or referral is necessary. This symptom assessment will be done for bot h 
intervention and enhanced usual care groups). Sessions will continue until at least [ADDRESS_337141] passed . 
 
The Strong Minds -Strong Communities  intervention is complemented by a care manager that 
links participant s to services for needs related to social determinants of health (i.e. education, 
10 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  housing). The Strong Minds -Strong Communities  intervention will be compared with an 
enhanced usual care group.  
 
Participants can complete the intervention by [CONTACT_18623]/or during  off hours (evenings, 
weekends) to facilitate participation. If we find participants are too severely impaired to benefit 
(see exclusion criteria), we will link them to mental health or substance abuse services and 
resources via the care manager.  
 
We will offer a ‘flexible approach’ option. If someone is eligible after the screener but reports not 
being interested in participating in the study , we will ask permission to contact [CONTACT_476] 3 more 
times within a 6 month  period ([ADDRESS_337142] screening interview, 4 months and 6 
months after). If they agree, we would contact [CONTACT_276224] [ADDRESS_337143] screening interview (after 3 calls), i f the person 
still reports not being interested in participating, we will assume the case to be a decline to 
enroll, and not contact [CONTACT_12552]/her again. If, after the first screening interview the person who is not 
interested in being enrolled asks the RA not t o continue to contact [CONTACT_476], we will also mark the 
case as declining to enroll.  
 
Participants in the enhanced usual care group will receive an NIH booklet about anxiety and 
depression in Spanish, English, or Mandarin/Cantonese. The Care Manager will call the 
participant 4 times over the course of 6 months to administer the PROMIS, the 5-item suicide 
questionnaire, and a question about medication side effects to mimic the administration 
schedule in the intervention group, with data entered in Dimagi CommCare.  With the 
participant’s permission, the care manager will inform the PCP about screening and other 
assessments and determine if participants should be referred to mental health or substance 
services and removed from control group given severity (PHQ -9 >=20, GAD -7>=15 and Paykel 
11 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  =4 or 5 or active substance use). This will be considered a positive outcome for participant 
safety.  
 
All enrolled participants (intervention and usual care) will be contact[CONTACT_276225] 12 months: baseline, and 3 -month, 6 -month, and 12 -month follow -ups. 
 
Clinical Research Coordinators (also referred to as Research Assistants in some departments) 
will hold the initial responsibility for conducting baseline and follow -up interviews. Procedures for 
contact[CONTACT_276226]: 1) Study staff wi ll notify the CRC of the target interview 
date, including acceptable window for interview administration; 2) the CRC will attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_276227]/CBO; 3) If after [ADDRESS_337144] the participant by [CONTACT_648]; 4) If 
after [ADDRESS_337145] them in order to administer an interview, 
and if we do not hear back, we may visit them at home; 5) If the participant does not respond to 
the letter, MGH staff will visit the person at home and attempt to administer the interview at that 
time.  
 
A protocol has been established for the home visit to ensure staff safety, including regular 
contact [CONTACT_276228] -office staff by [CONTACT_152722].  Home visit protocol stipulates that staff will 
be paid their regular hourly rate for travel to and from parti cipants’ homes. Staff have been 
notified in advance that they may need to visit participants’ homes. Safety is monitored by [CONTACT_201214]: 1) Staff will provide the supervisor with the name [CONTACT_276247]’s home; 2) Staff will text/call 
their supervisor when they have arrived at the participant’s home, and will apprise their 
supervisor of the status of the home visit (e.g., participant not home, interview will proceed as 
12 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  scheduled, etc.); 3) Staff will text/call their supervisor mid -way through the interview to apprise 
of status; 4) Staff will text/call their supervisor when they are leaving the participant’s home, and 
when they arrive at their destination (e.g., home or o ffice). In addition, staff are provided a safety 
code to text or call if a dangerous situation arises during the interview and are required to leave 
the participant’s home immediately if they ever feel unsafe in a participant’s home, or if guns or 
illegal substances are present.  
 
A. Data Collection   
 
Data will be collected at several points. All potential participants will complete a [ADDRESS_337146] -baseline. In addition, all 
participants will complete a biweekly symptom assessment, using the PHQ -9 and GAD -7, and 
the Paykel Suicide Screener, if necessary.  
 
VII. Biostatistical Analysis  
 
A. Specific data variables being collected for the study (e.g. data collection 
sheets).  
 
Screener, Baseline Assessment, Follow -up Assessment, Symptom Assessment (PHQ -9 and 
GAD -7) 
 
The proposed study has four goals : 
1) To test the effectiveness of an evidence -based, CHW -led mental health intervention, 
The Strong Minds -Strong Communities  Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT), focused on (1) 
13 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  decreasing depression and anxiety symptoms, ( 2) improving functioning, and ( 3) 
increasing perceived quality of care among low -income racial, ethnic, and linguistic 
minorities.  
2) To test whether there is a differential effect of Strong Minds -Strong Communities  based 
on participants’ race and ethnicity, thereby [CONTACT_276229].  
3) To test whether there is a differential effect of Strong Minds -Strong Communities  based 
on participants’ language , thereby [CONTACT_276230].  
4) To test whether there is a differential effect of Strong Minds -Strong Communities in 
North Carolina compared to [LOCATION_005], thereby [CONTACT_276231] a specific geographic location.  
 
Dependent variables.  Across all goals , the following post -baseline outcome measures will be 
used as the main dependent variables. (1) Depression and anxiety symptoms will be evaluated 
with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist -25 (HSCL -25), a 25 -item self -report of anxiety (first 10 
items) and depres sion symptoms (last 15 items) in the past two weeks rated on a 4 -point scale 
from 1 ‘not at all’ to 4 ‘extremely’. Total scores are calculated as the average of all items (range: 
1-4) and higher scores represent worse d epression and anxiety symptoms. (2) Level of 
functioning will be measured using the 12 -item World Health Organization Disability 
Assessment Schedule 2 ·0 (WHODAS 2 ·0), a self -report assessing six domains of functioning: 
cognition, mobility, self -care, getting along, life  activities, and participation. Participants are 
asked to rate difficulties performing activities in each domain in the past 30 days using a 5 -point 
scale from 1 ‘none’ to 5 ‘extremely or cannot do’. Total scores are calculated as the sum of all 
items (range: 12−60), and higher scores indicate lower levels of functioning. (3) Perceived 
quality of care was evaluated using the Global Evaluation of Care domain of the Perceptions of 
14 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  Care Outpatient Survey (PoC -OP), a clinical -care oriented, self -report satisfaction rating scale 
assessing patients’ perception of the quality of interpersonal care. The Global Evaluation of 
Care domain includes three items rated on a 4 -point scale from 1 ‘never’ to 4 ‘always’, which are 
transformed into a score from 0 ‘lowest quality’ to  100 ‘highest quality. ’ 
 
Independent variable.  The main independent variable will be an effect -coded variable for the 
intervention condition (control = -0·5, intervention = 0 ·5). In this coding system, the mean of the 
dependent variable for participants in the control condition is compared to the mean of the 
dependent variable for participants in the intervention condition.  
 
Covariates.  Baseline outcome measures will be used as a covariate.  
 
Moderators.  In Goal 2, r ace and ethnicity will be used as a moderator of the main independent 
variable (intervention condition). Using self -reported information, participants will be classified 
into four mutually exclusive categories: Latinx, non -Latinx Black, Asian, and non -Latinx White. In 
Goal 3, language  will be used as a moderator of the main independent variable (intervention 
condition). Using self -reported information, participants will be classified into four mutually 
exclusive categories: English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Cantonese . In Goal [ADDRESS_337147] of residence: North Carolina  or 
[LOCATION_005].  
 
Endpoints.  The primary endpoints w ill be change from baseline in depression and anxiety 
symptoms, level of functioning, and perceived quality of care at month 6 (end of intervention) 
and at month 12 ([ADDRESS_337148] -intervention). The key secondary effectiveness endpoints w ill 
15 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  be the change from baseline in the score on the CAT -MH depression (range 0 to 100 with 
higher scores indicating worse depression symptoms)  and the CAT -MH anxiety (range 0 to 100 
with higher scores indicating worse anxiety symptoms)  at month 6 and 12. The primary and key 
secondary effectiveness endpoints w ill be also evaluated in prespecified subgroup analyses 
based on participant’s race and ethnicity, language, and site. Other exploratory endpoints will 
include changes from baseline in HSCL -25, WHODAS 2 · 
0, PoC -OP, CAT -MH depression, and CAT -MH anxiety scores at month 3, about midway 
through the intervention.  Finally, the primary and key secondary effectiveness endpoints w ill be 
evaluated in exploratory subgroup analyses based on the participant’s baseline severity of 
depression and anxiety . 
 
Statistical Analyses.  A two -sided P value of 0 ·[ADDRESS_337149] for the multiple comparisons across 5 outcome scores 
(HSCL -25, WHODAS 2 ·0, PoC -OP, CAT -MH depression, and CAT -MH anxiety) at 2 follow -up 
points (months 6 and 12). If the lowest of the ten P values was less than 0 ·005 (0 ·05 ÷ 10), it 
will be considered to be significant; the second lowest P value w ill be considered to be 
significant if less than 0 ·0056 (0 ·05 ÷ 9); the third lowest P value w ill be significant if less than 
0·006 (0 ·05 ÷ 8); and so on. Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints w ill be separately 
analyzed using a general linear model to estimate the treatment effect. Except for PoC -OP, 
baseline outcome scores w ill be included as covariates in all analyses. Site ([LOCATION_005] 
versus North Carolina) will also be included as covariate in all analyses. This general linear  
model ha s the following form:  
 
𝑦𝑖,𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒=𝛼0+𝛼1𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜 𝑛𝑖+𝛼2𝑦𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒+𝛼3𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑖+𝜀𝑖  
 
16 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  where 𝑦𝑖,𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒  represents an outcome measure for participant 𝑖 at either [ADDRESS_337150] -coded variable equal to -0·5 if participant 𝑖 was 
randomized to the control group and equal to 0 ·5 if participant 𝑖 was randomized to the 
intervention group. 𝑦𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒  is the baseline measure of the outcome (except for PoC -OP), 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑖 
is a binary indicator equal to one if participant 𝑖 was recruited in [LOCATION_005] and equal to 0 if 
recruited in North Carolina, and 𝜀𝑖 is an  error term. Because participants will be recruited in 
multiple CBOs/clinics  across the two sites, in sensitivity analyses we will use generalized linear 
mixed models with a random intercept accounting for clustering within CBOs/clinics for each 
primary and key secondary effectiveness endpoint.  
 
Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints w ill be performed 
for participant’s self -identified race and ethnicity (non -Hispanic White, non -Hispanic Black, 
Asian, and Hispanic or Latino), language (English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Cantonese), and site 
([LOCATION_005] and North Carolina). Subgroup differences  will be tested in three omnibus 
interaction tests. These three interactions w ill be examined for 5 outcome scores (HSCL -25, 
WHODAS 2 ·0, PoC -OP, CAT -MH anxiety, and CAT -MH dep ression) at month 6 and month 12, 
which will result in 30 statistical tests (3 × 5 × 2 ). No adjustment for the multiple comparisons w ill 
be made, and about two statistically significant interaction tests (P < 0 ·05) are expected on the 
basis of chance alone.  
 
Change from baseline in HSCL -25, WHODAS 2 ·0, PoC -OP, CAT -MH depression, and CAT -MH 
anxiety scores at the exploratory endpoint at month 3, and exploratory subgroup analyses 
based on participant’s baseline severity of depression and anxiety  will similarly be analyzed 
using a general linear model which included baseline scores (except for PoC -OP) and site as 
covariates . 
[ADDRESS_337151]  analysis of missing data at either endpoint (primary or exploratory) to test 
whether  that, conditional on the observed baseline variables (including baseline outcome 
scores), the missing at random assumption is plausible. Missing data for all statistical models 
(primary and key secondary endpoints, exploratory endpoint, prespecified subgroup analyses 
and exploratory subgroups analyses) w ill be handled using model -based imputation. For 
example, missing values to analyze change from baseline in HSCL -[ADDRESS_337152] coded variable for intervention condition, HSCL -25 scores at 
baseline, and a binary indicator for site ([LOCATION_005] versus North Carolina) w ill be included 
as predictors. The model further will also includ e the auxiliary baseline variables associated with 
missingness  (e.g., participant’s ag e or gender ). The same model -based imputation w ill be 
employed for all pri mary and key secondary endpoints, and the exploratory endpoint. Imputation 
models for subgroup analyses (prespecified and exploratory) will add the moderator and its 
interaction with intervention condition as predictors. For each model, 20 imputed datasets w ill be 
generated. Analyses of imputed data will use Rubin’s rules to obtain pooled estimates and their 
standard errors.  
 
C. Power Analysis (e.g., sample size, evaluable subjects, etc.)  
 
The proposed study aimed to recruit 1,200 participants equally distributed across sites (North 
Carolina and [LOCATION_005]) and intervention conditions (Intervention and Control). That is N = 
600 intervention participants (300 in North Carolina and 300 in [LOCATION_005]) and N = 600 
enhanced usual care participants (300  in North Carolina and 300 in [LOCATION_005]).  
[ADDRESS_337153] 
size for the outcomes ranged from 0 ·24 to 0 ·68. The nonparticipation rate of enrolled 
participants was assumed to be 13%. Our sample size of 1,200 (600 treatment and 600 control) 
from North Carolina and [LOCATION_005] is thus effectively 1044. This sample yielded 87% 
power to detect an intervention e ffect size of 0 ·20, with  a two -sided significance level of 0 ·05. 
Testing whether there is a differential effect of Strong Minds -Strong Communities based on 
participants’ race and ethnicity means trying to determine whether race and ethnicity moderated 
the impact of the intervention. The racial and ethnic composition  of our sample was roughly 63% 
Latinx, 14% non -Latinx Black, 13% Asian, 9% White, and 1% other races or ethnicities. 
Assuming a large effect size of the intervention for White participants (> 0 ·5), a small effect size 
for Black participants (< 0 ·3), and a medium effect size for Asian and Latinx participants (> 0 ·3 
and < 0 ·5), we will have 80% power to detect a significant intervention effect in each racial and 
ethnic group with a sample size of 1044. Similarly, testing whether there is a differential effect of 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities in North Carolina compared to Ma ssachusetts means testing 
whether site moderated the impact of the intervention.  
 
VIII. Risks and Discomforts  
 
A. Psychosocial (non -medical) risks:  
 
The safety of intervention participants will be closely monitored during the Strong Minds -Strong 
Communities  intervention . Participants will be administered the PHQ -[ADDRESS_337154]. This agreement outlines the 
criteria for data access, conditions for research use, incorporates privacy and confidentiality 
standards to ensure data security, and prohibits manipulation of data.  
 
Participants in the Strong Minds -Strong Communities  intervention may feel some discomfort 
sharing personal information. Participants are reminded during the consent process that they 
are not required to share information that they do not wish to share, and that any information 
they share with the CHW or CR C will be confidential, with the exception of mandatory reportable 
content. They are also reminded that they may terminate an interview or session at any time. 
20 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  Furthermore, research team members will refer to participants by [CONTACT_276232], rather than their names, unless necessary for referrals or emergency intervention.  
 
CHWs will receive weekly supervision from MD or PhD level clinicians throughout the 
intervention. Supervisors will inquire about potential safety issues and will closely monitor 
participants at risk. Supervisors will report any risk issues to the research team and discuss 
these issues with the research team and site leaders in biweekly conference calls.  
 
In the event that a participant endorses Items 4 and 5 of the  Paykel  Suicidality  Screener (see 
above), the CHW or CRC administering the assessment will follow the Emergency Protocol. The 
protocol calls for an assessment by [CONTACT_276233]. The research team member 
will follow up with the participant within 24 hours. If the  person is admitted to emergency 
psychiatric services, the research team member will follow up with the participant after 30 days. 
If the participant no longer reports  suicida lity, he/she will be allowed to continue to the study. In 
no case will a participant with elevated symptoms be removed from the study without ensuring 
an appropriate referral. If a participant scores in the severe range on the PHQ -9 or the GAD -7 
(correspon ding to scores of  greater or equal to 20 on the PHQ -9 or greater or equal to 15 on the 
GAD -7) for two or more assessments, that participant will be monitored closely and the CHW’s 
supervisor will determine whether that individual should be referred to spec ialty treatment. 
Depending on the nature of the treatment, the participant may be allowed to continue with the 
study. The following criteria will be used to remove a subject from the study. The participant’s 
primary care provider will be notified if his/he r symptom assessment scores remain in the 
severe range.  
 
IX. Potential Benefits  
 
21 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  A. Potential benefits to participating individuals  
 
In terms of efficacy, it is hoped that this intervention will contribute to reduced depression and/or 
anxiety among a significant proportion of study participants. Depressive and anxiety symptoms 
from baseline will be measured by [CONTACT_276234] -25, the PHQ -9, and the 
GAD -7, and disability days as measured by [CONTACT_14300] -DAS 2.  
 
B. Potential benefits to society (e.g. increased understanding of disease process, 
etc.) 
 
We anticipate that the information to be gained from the intervention will illustrate an important 
model for building community capacity in mental health service delivery and provide a way to 
engage and treat low -income, non -English speaking and racial/ethnic minority adults with 
moderate to severe rates of depressive or anxiety symptoms in ACOs. There is a tremendous 
need for sustainable and affordable solutions that use task shifting for mental health problems. 
We envision that the proposed model of building community capacity could be de livered and 
sustained at relatively low c osts by [CONTACT_276235], making it a unique and much 
needed intervention model with a high potential for feasibility and sustainability after the project 
ends. From a public health perspective, this type of model for problem solving and res ource 
building in the community is beneficial.  
 
X. Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
A. Independent monitoring of data source  
 
[ADDRESS_337155] been established to monitor data and 
safety. The principal investigators , co-investigator , and the research team hold biweekly 
conference calls to monitor study progress and any risk issues or adverse events. This group 
also meets biweekly with the site leaders at each ACO/CBO to monitor events within the 
ACOs/CBOs and to update ACOs/CBOs about study changes. In addition to weekly supervision  
CHWs hold with licensed clinicians, CHWs hold biweekly support calls  with the MGH project 
coordinator, and RAs have biweekly support calls with the MGH research assistant. These calls 
update ACO/CBO staff on any changes or important reminders, monitor staff activities, and 
provide support.  
 
Collection protocols have been established to ensure accuracy and quality of the data obtained 
from all participant interviews with Clinical Research Coordinators and treatment sessions with 
CHWs. Interviewers will have biweekly conference calls with Site Leaders at the ACOs/CBOs , 
and in collaboration with the team where data quality and data analyses will be discussed. 
These calls will provide a forum for interviewers to discuss issues and concerns pertaining to 
data collection protocol as well as a time to provide feedback on com pleted assessments.  
 
For the intervention, quality of the CHWs’ work will be monitored by [CONTACT_276236]. We will conduct random (15%) adherence checks using a fidelity 
checklist that mirrors the intervention manual. This checklist documents activi ties covered in the 
training session, difficulties encountered, and clinicians’ observations regarding the participants’ 
level of understanding and participation in the intervention. In addition, supervisors will lead 
weekly meetings/conference calls to re view the CHWs’ caseloads as well as assist them in 
following the manualized protocol. The investigators from all sites will participate in weekly 
group supervision and review treatment fidelity checklists required of all CHWs to ensure 
standard delivery of  treatment within and across sites.  
[ADDRESS_337156] (CAB) of this study and all the Site PIs will work with the MGH research team to ensure 
that the study is monitored from a scienti fic and ethical standpoint,  and we will hold yearly 
meetings to assess data collection and management.  
 
The study staff will work closely with the Site Leaders, CHWs and RAs at the participating 
ACOs/CBOs in the set up and ongoing implementation of the study. We will provide required 
research materials, documents and technology, such as audio recorders, to f acilitate this work. 
The CHWs and RAs will be granted remote access to the server as well to encrypted online 
data storage provided through Dropbox.com using their Partners secure login, to be able to 
upload recordings, tracking materials and other informa tion. This information will be monitored 
through quality control checks by [CONTACT_276237]. Study staff will provide regular supervision and 
oversight to CHWs and RAs.  
 
All consent forms will be clearly labeled (with version control information), and the Project 
Director will work closely with the CHWs at each site in order to ensure that proper consent 
forms are used at all times to consent the providers and patients par ticipating in the study.  
 
All documents that include identifying information (i.e. names, addresses and telephone 
numbers) will immediately be separated from the patient assessments, training materials, and 
24 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  recordings. These items will be stored by [CONTACT_276238] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked file and 
an identifying case number will be generated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_276208]/or a ny information or files that link the 
case number with any patient identifying information. No reports will be made public using any 
names or identifying information. Raw data and accompanying research protocols will be kept 
for at least [ADDRESS_337157] Managers, and community site 
partners will work closely to ensure data is protected across sites.  
 
25 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  Given that the CAT -MH screening tool and our Strong Minds -Strong Communities  Intervention 
(delivered by [CONTACT_29441]) are relatively new, we will make extensive efforts to ensure the safety of 
study participants, and to systematically track risks, issues, and outcomes across the MA and 
NC sites. We will create a monitoring registry where we can tabulate and track any human 
subjects and systematic issues that arise with implementation across sites, and between 
intervention and control conditions. We will identify a core set of p articipant  issues that will be 
flagged if they occur: 1) cases with no improvement or an increase in symptom scores on key 
outcome variables; 2) no -show for scheduled appointments; 3) staff concerns about participant’s 
well-being; or 4) site operational issues (such  as space limitations for sessions, transportation 
challenges, resistance by [CONTACT_276239], such as the procedures for the 
emergency protocol etc.). These four areas will be programmed into the registry, with an area 
for notes and additional details. The registry will be maintained by [CONTACT_276240], who will set up the registry to track pa rticipants  
by [CONTACT_276241], clinical site, and date of occurrence. We will create logons for CHWs and Research 
Assistant interviewers at each site, who can enter information pertaining to their cases. We will 
set up specialized permissions at the user level to ensure tha t Research Assistants remain 
blinded to any information ab out participant condition. The Project Manager and Care Manager 
will review the data in preparation for weekly team and supervisor meetings and  will download 
the registry data to review with study staff and supervisors. At the onset of the project, we will 
work with the study data analysts to program an algorithm to easily query the system to display 
cases with elevated issues in each of the [ADDRESS_337158] including: a secure, multi -tenant system  hosted in Dimagi’s 
Secure Private Cloud, based in Chicago, IL; Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS): Web 
Application Firewall (WAF); Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS); Server Event and 
Information Management (SEIM); encrypted hard drives; data d estruction policy; and being 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant.  
 
All audio -recorded interviews will also be uploaded immediately to the same secure, password 
protected server maintained at MGH.  No reports will be made public using any names or 
identifying information. Our coded dataset will be stored on a secure centra l server. Only 
authorized research staff approved by [CONTACT_276242]. PHI will be destroyed according to standard protocols, 7 years after the completion of 
the study.

XI. Adverse event reporting guidelines:  
 
A. Sample Self-Harm/Risk Emergency Protocol  
 
The following protocol is an example of the mental health self -harm/risk reported to study staff 
for patient participants in the intervention. We would adapt this protocol to study sites per local 
requirements and for physical health issues that might be e xperienced.  
 
The emergency procedure is prompted if a patient endorses a [ADDRESS_337159] 30 days.  The questions include: “Has there been a time in 
the last 30 days/since the last assessment when you reached the point where you seriously 
considered taking your own life, or perhaps made plans how you should go about doing it?” = 
yes or “Has there been a  time in the past 30 days/since the last interview when you made an 
attempt on your own life?” = yes.  
 
1) At the end of the session or interview, study staff should inform the participant : “I am not 
a clinician; however, when anyone tells us they’ve been feeling this way recently, we 
connect them with a clinician who can ask some questions about how you’ve been 
feeling.  We will also contact [CONTACT_276243].  We want to ensure your safety, so let me 
connect you right now.  Could you please tell me where you are located right now? ” 
28 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol   
2) Study staff should immediately connect the patient to the correct Emergency 
Services provider  for assessment.  
 
• Place the patient on hold (or have them wait a moment when in person).  
• When speaking to emergency services team, refer to the study: I have a patient on 
the line as part of the research study who scored high on a suicide screening tool. I 
am not a clinician, and am hopi[INVESTIGATOR_276209] -- 
he/sh e has given consent to this as part of the study.  
• Take the name [CONTACT_276248].  
• The emergency services provider will need the following information from you:  
o patient’s name  
o phone number  
o present location  
o what was said by [CONTACT_276244]: suicidality  
• If a Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese speaking clinician is not readily available, 
study staff are allowed to translate only in the capacity of informing the patient of 
what the emergency services provider says are the ‘next steps’ (i.e., someone is 
going t o call you back in 5 minutes, etc.)  
 
If for some reason, the participant is not able to be or refuses to be connected right away 
you should:  
1) Provide the patient with the emergency services contact [CONTACT_6227], depending on 
where they are located.  
29 
Strong Minds -Strong Communities Protocol  2) Contact [CONTACT_276245].  Immediately inform the study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_276210].

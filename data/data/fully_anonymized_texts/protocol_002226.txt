Hispanic whites,6-11 even up to  5 years after diagnosis.9 Further, Hispanic cancer survivors are less 
likely to receive psychosocial services than non -Hispanic whites.12 Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) 
has a large evidence base demonstrating its efficacy in reducing distress , 13 anxiety , 14,15 and 
depressive symptoms14-21 among Hispanics.

2.0 Objectives  
 
Building on this study team’s current NCI -funded study of a telephone -based intervention targeting 
English -speaking rural cancer survivors (5R21CA198237, MPIs Danhauer/Brenes), this study proposes 
to culturally and linguistically adapt a telephone- based cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention 
designed to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms for use with Hispanic cancer survivors (Spanish- 
or English -speaking). Twelve  participants will be recruited to participate in the tailored CBT intervention. 
They will provide content/process feedback on the intervention and undergo assessment of relevant 
future outcomes (to be used as pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]). Participants with either moderate or severe distress (an xiety 
and/or depressive symptoms) will complete the telephone- based intervention that will consist of a CBT 
workbook with accompanying psychotherapy by a bilingual mental health provider . Each participant will 
choose whether (s)he prefers to complete the intervention in Spanish or English (at least half of the participants will complete the study in Spanish).  
2.1 Primary Objective s 
 
2.1.1  To assess the feasibility  (participation, accrual, retention, adherence) of administering 
the intervention in Hispanic cancer survivors.  
 
2.1.2  To culturally adapt an existing behavioral intervention for cancer survivors based on 
stakeholder feedback.  
 
2.2 Exploratory Objectives 
 2.2.1 To summarize emotional distress (anxiety , depressive symptoms)  and fear of recurrence 
in these post -treatment Hispanic cancer survivors.

5.1 Primary Outcomes  
5.1.1  Feasibility  (participation, accrual, retention, adherence rates )  
To determine study feasibility, recruitment, accrual, retention, and adherence rates , 
which  will be calculated as follows:  
Participation. To  determine participation rate, we will track the total number of 
individuals approached, the number of individuals who met all eligibility criteria, and 
percent who agree to participate.  
Accrual . Accrual rates will be calculated by [CONTACT_380221].  
Retention . Study retention will be estimated by [CONTACT_380222] 13 visit. Drop- out is defined as 100% minus the dropout %.  
Adherence. Intervention adherence will be estimated as the mean percentage of 
therapy or check -in sessions each participant completes. Participants must complete at 
least 9 of the 12 sessions (75%) to be considered adherent.  
5.2 Secondary Outcomes 
5.2.1  Anxiety – GAD-7 
The GAD -753 is a self -report measure of DSM -IV symptoms of GAD. Participants rate 7 
questions on  a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day); one additional question 
assesses the interference of these symptoms with functioning. The first 7 questions are 
summed to create a total score. It has been validated for use in the general population 70 
and in primary care.53 The GAD -7 has demonstrated good sensitivity (89%) and 
specificity (82%) in identifying GAD diagnoses when using a cut point of 10.53 It also has 
good internal consistency (alphas = 0.89 -0.92) and test -retest reliability (intraclass 
correlation = .83).53,70 
5.2.2  Depressive Symptoms – PHQ-[ADDRESS_476218] 2 weeks on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Responses are summed, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomatology. It has 
demonstrated good reliability and validity. The traditional cutoff for the PHQ -9 is a score 
≥10. However, ASCO guidelines recommend using a score ≥8, based on a study of cancer outpatients
76 and a meta- analysis of use of the PHQ-9 for identifying depression 
in cancer patients.77 
5.2.3  Fear of Recurrence – Fear of Recurrence Inventory Severity Subscale  
The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory55 (FCRI; severity subscale) will be used to 
measure self -reported fear of recurrence. This 9 -item subscale measures the presence 
and severity of the intrusive thoughts or images associated with the fear of recurrence, and it can be used separately as a short form of the 42- item FCRI for the brief 
screening of fear of cancer recurrence. The measure is widely used and has strong 
reliability and validity (Cronbach’s α=0.75).

Intervention. Participants with moderate or severe anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will participate in the 
telephone- based intervention that consists of the CBT workbook (15 minutes daily to complete exercises), 
plus psychotherapy delivered by [CONTACT_97266] a licensed bilingual mental health provider  (45-50 minute 
sessions weekly). Two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s who meet the following requirements have been hired to conduct the 
intervention. They meet the following qualifications: Master’s or doctoral degree in counseling, marriage and 
family therapy, psychology, or social work; licensed as an independent mental health provider in North 
Carolina; and experience with CBT. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_380201] -specific training with [CONTACT_380251] that 
will cover study design, anxiety/depression in cancer survivors, principles of CBT, intervention delivery, and use of the workbook. The professionally -prepared CBT workbook focuses on cognitive- behavioral techniques 
for managing anxiety, depression, and distress. Chapters focus on the cognitive- behavioral model of 
depression and anxiety, relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, worry control, exposure, behavioral activation, and relapse prevention.  Workbook chapters target issues specific to cancer 
survivors, such as (a) fear of recurrence;
2,3,29- 41  (b) lasting effects of treatment on health, ongoing symptoms 
of fatigue and physiologic effects of cancer treatment;2,3,29,32,37,41,42  (c) late effects of cancer treatment (the 
possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_380202]);29,38,43  (d) concerns about reproductive ability42,44  and (e) distress 
related to changes in body image and sexuality.31,38,43 The sessions will supplement the participant's 
understanding of distress management techniques and include a review of the daily workbook exercises to 
assure understanding and maximize application in daily life.

Screening and Consent Procedures  
Patients will be referred from oncology providers and the Hispanic patient navigator  or from the community . 
 
       Pre-Visit  
We will obtain a limited HIPAA waiver to assess the potential participant’s name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and 
demographics . This information will be collected on a Pre -Visit Form that will be reviewed with potential 
participants during the screening phone contact  [CONTACT_380223].  
 
Informed Consent  
After making sure the patient clearly understands the study procedures and agrees to follow them, the 
patient will be asked to sign the informed consent form electronically  (e.g., REDCap) or in person. If 
signed electronically , REDCap will allow the study team to access signed electronic consent forms 
immediately after signature. Patients will have the option to download a copy of the signed informed consent from REDCap, or a hard copy will be provided to the patient  if needed.  
 
Screening  
The screening process will occur by [CONTACT_756]. Once a participant has signed the informed  consent , 
emergency contact [CONTACT_380224]. T he PHQ -[ADDRESS_476220] information,  demographics , and 
chart information (eligibility criteria – type of cancer, month/year of diagnosis, cancer stage at time of 
diagnosis, time of last treatment, date of birth).  Additional questions will also be administered to assess  
additional eligibilit y criteria including an item to determine adequate hearing ability (please refer to the next 
paragraph for additional hearing ability information), telephone access , and language preference.    
 
To determine adequate hearing ability, the participant is asked to repeat the phrase, “I have a cat so all I 
need is a dog.”  If the participant is able to repeat  this phrase correctly, staff will continue with screening.  
If the participant is unable to repeat the phrase correctly after a second attempt or if staff thinks hearing is a problem, the participant will be considered ineligible and will not be screened further.  Participants with a 
circumstance that could affect the ability to hear at the time of the call (illness, hearing aid problem, in process of obtaining hearing aid, etc.) can reschedule.    We will also collect information from the participant’s medical chart, including type of cancer, month/year 
of diagnosis, cancer stage at time of diagnosis, time of last treatment . 
 If a participant is not eligible or declines study participation at screening, screening informa tion will be 
entered  into RedCap up to the point the participant was no longer eligible or declined, and no further  
information will be collected.

there has been a significant change, the Project Manager will initiate the Crisis Protocol and 
complete a Crisis Protocol Event Form. During the course of a regularly scheduled participant contact, it may become evident that there is a need for immediate evaluation (e.g., active 
suicidal ideation, active psychotic symptoms, disorientation) . Staff will be instructed to follow 
the Crisis Protocol and complete the Crisis Protocol Event Form.  In both cases, the participant 
may be referred for mental health care by [CONTACT_380226].  
 
Study  staff will follow the steps outlined in the Crisis Protocol and participants will receive 
information about safety precautions and procedures to follow in the event of a crisis (i.e., the participant becomes imminently suicidal). Because active suicidal ideation is an exclusion 
criterion for the study, we anticipate that the risk of participants becoming suicidal during the study will be minimal. Further, in our prior studies, no participants randomized into the study 
became imminently suicidal. All study staff (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], research staff) will receive training on

intervention but continue in the study for follow -up purposes. For subjects who are enrolled, site 
staff must contact [CONTACT_380229] [ADDRESS_476232] and Reporting Requirements  
REPORTING ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Reportable Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
subject, including any clinically significant abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. The burden of collecting and reporting data on every possible AE is excessive and therefore, study staff will report all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and selected described below .  
 
SAEs and AEs will be ascertained by [CONTACT_380230] [ADDRESS_476233] a 
corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in 
the CTCAE v5.0.. A copy of the CTCAE can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
 
Definition: Regulations at 21 CFR §312.32 (revised April 1, 2014) define an SAE as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose or intervention level has one or more of the following outcomes:  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAEs) is defined if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380208] ≥ 24hours  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect

Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 16 of 31 • Important Medical Event (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 Reporting Requirements for above Study Descriptions:  
• All unexpected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380209]  
• All Grade 5 toxicities (deaths -expected and unexpected)  
• All unexpected Grade 4 toxicities  
• All additional reporting requirements as outlined in the protocol  
  
Selected Adverse Events  
A select list of adverse events include suicide attempts, psychosis, worsening anxiety, worsening depression, and suicidal ideation, should be reported as an adverse event, regardless of whether they 
resulted in an ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Definition of Worsening Anxiety or Depression  
An adverse event form should be completed for any participant who indicates a significant worsening in 
anxiety or depression scores ([ADDRESS_476234] deviation increase (rounded to the nearest integer) on the 
GAD -7 (Change≥4)  
75 or PHQ -9 (Change≥6)73,74,51 from baseline). If there is a need for immediate 
treatment (e.g., active suicidal ideation, active psychotic symptoms, disorientation, and active 
substance abuse) at any point in time, staff persons will notify the co- PIs. In both cases, the participant 
may be referred for psychiatric care.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring:   As adverse event reports are collected, all adverse events will be 
identified and reported to the co- principal investigators. The co- principal investigators are responsible 
for the review of all adverse event reports and determining whether any changes in the study protocol or informed consent are required to insure subject safety and welfare.  
 
Clinical Monitoring: The co -PIs will meet with the study staff weekly to provide supervision and review 
the clinical status of all participants. Study staff will also notify at least one supervisor immediately if a patient shows the need for urgent treatment (e.g., suicidal intent, active psychosis). This type of information will be communicated immediately, with consultation about an appropriate course of action.  
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC Institutional 
studies as outlined in Appendix D. All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention and are coded as 
either 1) unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 24 hours (regardless of grade), or grade 5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC using the using the SAE console in WISER.  
 All WFBCCC Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) staff members assisting a Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_380210], documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for DSMC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the DSMC as well as the entire committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.

9.1 Analysis of Primary Objective 
Objective 2. 1.1will provide data on feasibility, including participation, accrual, adherence, 
and retention rates. We will calculate  95% confidence intervals for each feasibility measure 
to determine the range of estimates consistent with our data. We will track the number 
approached for screening, number screened, number eligible, and the percent who agree to 
participate. For those not meeting eligibility criteria, reasons will be summarized. The 
proportion of participants and corresponding 95% CI for participants who participated in the 
intervention sessions and those who completed all assessments will be computed; we will 
also calculate the percent who complete the Week 13 visit to assess retention. We will use one-sample tests of binomial proportions to compare participation, adherence, and retention 
rates to th e hypothesized values of 50%, 75%, and 75 %, respectively.  
 
Qualitative Analyses . Interview transcripts  and field notes will be reviewed independently by 
[CONTACT_380231] Q -PRO Shared Resource who will provide an integrative 
summary/synthesis of th e interviews (identification of key points, potential themes, areas 
needing further exploration). The qualitative and quantitative analyses will be evaluated in a 
mixed -methods framework for consistency and discrepancies to refine the intervention for 
future studies.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_476236]  (anxiety , depressive 
symptoms) fear of recurrence, satisfaction, and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -participant relationship)  by [CONTACT_380232].  Because this is a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], this information will be used to 
estimate variability for future study planning purposes, but not to estimate effect size or to test hypotheses , and the analyses will be considered exploratory . 
 
9.3 Sample Size Justification 
An N=[ADDRESS_476237] for qualitative analyses to achieve thematic saturation.   
With 12 people, we will be able to calculate two- sided 95% confidence intervals around 
proportions of interest within 28%.  Power is not applicable for this study in the absence of 
hypothesis testing.

There are two distinct types of WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials based  on where 
patient enrollment occurs.  These  include:  
 
1) Local WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials where  all patients are 
enrolled from one of the WFBCCC sites. These include the main outpatient  Cancer Center 
clinics (located in Winston -Salem) as well as WFBCCC affiliate  sites located in Bermuda Run 
(Davie Medical Center), Clemmons, Lexington, High Point,  or Wilk esboro.  
2) Multi -Center WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials  where  
patients are enrolled from other sites in addition to WFBCCC sites.   
There are  three  types of trials that are included in this  category:  
a. Trials sponsored by [CONTACT_380237]  (NCORP) that are 
conducted at multiple sites where the PI [CONTACT_832] a member of a department at the Wake 
Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
b. Trials sponsored by [CONTACT_380238] [CONTACT_832]  a 
member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
c. Trials sponsored by [CONTACT_380239] [CONTACT_832]  a 
member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
 
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur on any patients  enrolled on WFBCCC 
Investigator Initiated Interventional trials must be entered into the WISER  system. The only exception to 
this requirement is for patients enrolled on NCORP trials at  non- WFBCCC sites. AEs and SAEs for NCORP 
patients enrolled at WFBCCC sites must be entered into the WISER system. Once these AEs and SAEs are 
entered in WISER, certain actions must  be taken regarding the reporting of specific Adverse Events to the  
DSMC .

 All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention (defined below) and are coded as either 1) 
unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hours (regardless of grade) , or grade 
5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC  using the using the SAE console in WISER.  
 
A research nurse or clinical research coordinator when made aware that an adverse  event  meets one 
of the above criteria has occurred on a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated  interventional trial, is responsible 
for informing a clinical member of the DSMC  by [CONTACT_648] (or in- person)  about  the adverse event. The 
nurse/coordinator should contact [CONTACT_380240], as well as all associated toxicities to be recorded along with the SAE. In 
addition, this nurse or coordinator is responsible for entering the  adverse  event information into the 
SAE console in WISER.  Once the adverse event has been  entered into the SAE console an email 
informing the entire DSMC  will be  generated.  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any staff member on the study team for  a WFBCCC Institutional 
Interventional trial. Ultimately, the protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_380215],  
documentation,  grading  and assignment  of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. However, 
when an AE event as described above  is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event 
to be sure that it  is reported to the  DSMC . 
 
What is considered during protocol  intervention ? 
During protocol intervention is considered to be the time period while a patient is on  study  treatment or 
during the time period within [ADDRESS_476248] study treatment (even if patient  begins a new (non- study) 
treatment during the 30 days). This window of [ADDRESS_476249] that a shorter window can be used 
to identify  events.  If it is a trial sponsored by [CONTACT_380241] a longer window for 
monitoring of SAEs, then the longer window of time specified by [CONTACT_380242].  
 
What is considered as an Unexpected Grade 4  event?  
Any grade 4 even t that was not specifically listed as an expected adverse event in the  protocol should be 
considered as unexpected. A grade 4 adverse event can be considered to  be unexpected if it is an event 
that would not be expected based on the treatment being  received  or if it is unexpected based on the 
health of the patient. In either case, if there is  any uncertainty about whether a grade 4 adverse event is 
expected or unexpected it should be reported to  DSMC . 
 
DSMC  notification responsibilities of the person (e.g., nurse) handling  the reporting/documenting of the SAE in 
WISER:  
1. Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the  DSMC  
according to the schedule as listed below (page if  nece ssary) . 
2. Enter  a new SAE  into the SAE  module that is located  in the Subject>> CRA  Console  in WISER 
WITHIN [ADDRESS_476250] knowledge of the event. Information can be  entered and  saved, but 
the DSMC  members will not be notified  until a  date  is entered  into the   DSMC  Notification Date 
Field. This will ensure that all persons that need to be made  aware  of the event (i.e., PI, study 
team members and  DSMC  members) will be  notified; remember to file a copy of the  
confirmation.  
3. Document that the appropriate person(s) on the DSMC  has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Indicate  the name [CONTACT_380249] a Telephone -Based Intervention to Treat Depression and 
Anxiety in Hispanic Cancer Survivors

WFBCCC # [ADDRESS_476251].  
4. Document whether or not the protocol should be suspended based on the  discussion  with the 
DSMC  clinician. This is the major function of the email notification. Enter  whether the protocol 
should be suspended in the Event Narrative  Field.  
5. Follow up/update the clinical member(s) of DSMC  regarding any new developments or 
information  obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting  process.

As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_380246] [ADDRESS_476254] with the next  DSMC  clinician  listed in the table above on the 
particular day the SAE is being reported . Allow up to  30 minutes for the new DSMC  clinician to respond to 
a phone call or page before  contac ting the next  member  in the table . These times (30 minutes) are a 
general guideline. Best judgment as a clinical research professional should be used giving considerations 
of the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact 
[CONTACT_380247]. If  the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as 
appropriate  and proceed with submitting the DSMC  notification form. It is important to take reasonable  
steps and to document that some type of contact [CONTACT_380248] . 
 
DSMC  CLINICAN  RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the  DSMC  clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events  as they are 
reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and  the members of DSMC . 
The review will include but not be limited to the information reported;  there  may be times when 
additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be  made  and further communi cation 
directly with the investigator may be warranted. DSMC  reserves  the right to disagree with the 
Investigator's assessment. If DSMC  does not agree with the Investigator,  DSMC reserves  the right  to 
suspend  the trial pending  further  investigation.  If there  is any immediate danger or harm that could be 
present for a future patient based on the  information  provided  in the DSMC  report  then an immediate

 suspension  of enrollment should  be considered.  
 
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS  REPORTS  
If all pertinent information is unavailable with the initial submission, once the additional  information is 
available do not submit a new report. Rather, go to the original email that  was sent to the DSMC  and 
using that email “reply to all”. Entitle this new email “ Amendment for (list date of event and patient ID)” 
this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the  additional information being reported. This 
information needs to be entered into WISER as  well. To do this, go to the Subject console and click SAEs 
on the  left column. Click on  the appropriate  SAE number  that needs  updating.  Then  click  Update.  This 
will allow  additional     information to be  added.

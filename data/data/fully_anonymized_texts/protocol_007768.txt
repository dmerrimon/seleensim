Specific Aim 1: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of ECT and ketamine on measures of depression. Specific Aim 2: To investigate the relative impact of ECT and ketamine on measures of memory and cognitive function. Specific Aim 3: To investigate the relative impact of ECT and ketamine on patient reported quality of life measures after acute treatment and at follow-up over six months. Study Design This is an unblinded prospective randomized open-label clinical trial. Patients will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_922680] three times per week or ketamine two times per week over three weeks (additional two week window allowed for flexibility).  Responders (patients who achieve a ≥ 50% decrease on their QIDS-SR-16 score from Baseline/Visit 1 to the End of Treatment visit) may return for three follow-up visits over a six month period following the end of treatment visit, depending on the date of enrollment relative to the end of study. Non-responders will receive a phone call one month after the End of Treatment visit. Number of Patients Approximately [ADDRESS_922681] arm and 200 in the ketamine arm. It is estimated that 60% or 240 patients (approximately 120 in each arm) will be classified as responders. Due to the expected high level of attrition, 192 patients classified as responders (approximately 96 in each arm) are expected to complete the follow-up visits, depending on when the study  ends.

Patients will receive up to nine treatments over three weeks (additional two week window allowed for flexibility). Ketamine: The standard dose of ketamine (0.5mg/kg infusion over 40 minute period) will be administered two times per week over three weeks (additional two week window allowed for flexibility). The investigator will be able to adjust the dose if clinically warranted. For both treatments, flexibility will be allowed for the clinician to adjust the treatment as clinically necessary. Concomitant Medications All patients will continue their existing antidepressant treatment while on the study protocol. Patients will also continue existing non-psychotropic medications initiated prior to the Baseline/Visit 1, unless the investigator determines that they are contraindicated for ECT or ketamine treatment. Each site will follow their standard clinical protocol for this.  Investigators will follow their site’s standard safety evaluation process for anesthesia administration and ECT. Prohibited Medications Any medication that is judged by [CONTACT_681365]. Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure is response rate, defined as ≥50% reduction in QIDS-SR16 scores from Baseline/Visit 1 to the End of Treatment Visit. Secondary Outcome Measures Secondary outcome measures will include clinician and patient rated scales for depression, suicidality, cognition, and associated psychiatric symptoms.

Introduction	 Major depressive disorder (MDD) accounts for 65.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and ranks third among illnesses of global disease burden (1). Identifying treatments that are more effective for MDD is required to meet this large and growing public health challenge. However, recent data suggest that antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681357] (2, 3). The real-world effectiveness of antidepressants is sub-optimal in approximately two of three patients (4, 5). Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) has been defined as depression resistant to one or more adequate trials of antidepressants for which the patient reports minimal or no significant improvement in mood (6, 7). TRD has been noted to be present in 20-50% of depression patients. TRD patients have significantly higher outpatient costs and a higher cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (8). Chronic, inadequately treated depression is associated with loss of social and workplace functioning, increased medical illnesses and healthcare use, and an increased risk for suicide(6). In the [LOCATION_002], the total economic cost of depression in 2012 was estimated at $188 billion (6). Hence, there is an urgent need to identify treatments that can be effective for TRD.   2.			Background	and	Rationale	 ECT Use in TRD Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been in use for nearly [ADDRESS_922688] effective treatments (9). However it is associated with a number of side effects and social stigma.  Cognitive impairment and significant memory loss has been observed in unilateral and bilateral as well as higher dose ECT immediately after treatment (10). Additional adverse events associated with ECT include anterograde amnesia (i.e. memory disturbance of events after ECT treatment) in the short-term and retrograde amnesia (memory disturbance of events before ECT treatment) in the long-term. Retrograde amnesia can persist for years after ECT treatment particularly for events near the time of treatment (11).  Other side effects of ECT include risks of receiving general anesthesia and muscle relaxants, delirium in the post- ECT period, headaches and muscle aches, nausea and fatigue and rarely, prolonged seizures.   Ketamine as an Alternative Treatment for TRD Ketamine shows promise as a treatment for TRD, but there is an evidence gap in its use as an alternative to ECT. Ketamine is a sedative/analgesic and general anesthetic approved by [CONTACT_681367]. It is an antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain and decreases the neurotransmission of glutamate (the main excitatory neurotransmitter) via the NMDA 
ELEKT-D Clinical Protocol Amendment V7.[ADDRESS_922689] (40). Ketamine can lead to symptoms of dissociation, perceptual disturbances, or even psychotic like symptoms (33) although these are seen infrequently at sub-anesthetic doses used in the treatment of TRD and are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_681358].  Currently, there are no formal randomized trials with detailed clinical and demographic data to provide direct comparative efficacy evidence between ECT and ketamine treatment. This study will provide such data and help to fill the evidence gap for efficacy of ECT and ketamine treatment for TRD. 3.			Study	Design	This is a prospective randomized open-label 2-arm (1:1) clinical trial of TRD with either ECT or ketamine treatment. Given the nature of ketamine and ECT treatments randomization and treatment arms cannot be blinded at the clinician or patient level.  After screening and evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients will be randomized to either ECT three times per week or ketamine two times per week. This acute treatment phase will last between three to five weeks. This timeframe allows for changes in the treatment schedule due to clinician discretion or the patient’s schedule. Patients may respond or remit to ECT or ketamine before they have completed all treatment visits and therefore may not undergo the full nine visits (for ECT) or six visits (for ketamine). Investigators will closely monitor patients and may adjust treatments during the acute treatment phase at any time. All patients, regardless of how many treatment visits have been completed, should complete an End of Treatment Visit (EOT).  All patients will complete self-reported cognitive assessments, depression questionnaires, and quality of life scales at the Baseline Visit/Visit 1 and throughout the acute treatment phase of the study (see Schedule of Events). Diagnostic interviews and clinician rated scales will also be performed at regular intervals throughout the acute treatment phase.  After the acute treatment phase, all patients will complete an EOT visit within [ADDRESS_922690] or ketamine treatments administered after the EOT visit. This will conclude their participation in the study and they will be

Responder: a patient who achieves a ≥ 50% decrease in their QIDS-SR-16 score from Baseline/Visit 1 to the End of Treatment visits. Responders may continue in the study for three follow-up visits at one month, three months, and six months after the EOT Visit, depending on the date of enrollment relative to the end of study.  They will continue naturalistic treatment with a clinician of their choice.  Non-Responder: a patient who achieves <50% decrease in their QIDS-SR-16 score from Baseline/Visit [ADDRESS_922691] worsening depression or suicidality during the acute treatment phase. These patients should be scheduled for an End of Treatment Visit and be evaluated for response. (These patients are unlikely to be classified as responders.  If an outpatient has worsening depression that requires psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the patient may continue in the study at investigator discretion. These patients can receive study ECT or ketamine treatments as an inpatient.  4.			Outcome	Measures To avoid potential bias, the patient assessments and the clinician assessments should be completed independently and without reference to one another. The research coordinator or clinician administering the questionnaires should not view the patient’s responses on patient rated scales. (They should, however, remind the patient to answer all questions and not leave any questions blank.)  4.1 Primary Outcome  The primary outcome measure is the percent of responders.

Given the nature of these treatments, treatment arms cannot be blinded at the patient or clinician level. Randomization will be conducted centrally through a secure electronic data management system. Detailed instructions can be found in the Manual of Operations (MOP). Collect patient status as inpatient or outpatient at randomization.   6.	Study	Treatments		6.1 Acute Treatment Phase (To occur over 3 to 5 weeks)  6.1.[ADDRESS_922698] Arm Patients will undergo anesthesia evaluation according to each site’s standard clinical procedure. Anesthesia will be administered according to standard of care at each site, but ketamine will not be allowed.  The initial ECT treatment will be Right Unilateral (RUL) ultra-brief pulse at 6X seizure threshold determined during titration at first visit. If there is not satisfactory improvement with RUL the investigator may change to Bilateral (BL) utilizing brief pulse using 0.5 modified half-age method to determine stimulus intensity. The seizure threshold may increase during the course of treatment and the dose of the electric stimulus may need to be increased incrementally (16). It is suggested to change to bilateral after three to five RUL treatments (17).  Treatments will be given three times a week and after nine treatments the acute arm of the study would be complete. Flexibility will be allowed for the ECT clinician to adjust the treatments as clinically necessary.  Patients will receive up to nine treatments over three to five weeks. Ideally patients will receive treatments at regular intervals of three times per week for three weeks. The window allows for modifications based on clinician discretion and the patient’s schedule.  Patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_681370]. Patients will be assessed for any adverse events and treated per investigator discretion.  Patients will receive both patient rated and clinician rated behavioral scales at Baseline/Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 4, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 9, and EOT Visit.  6.1.[ADDRESS_922699] dose of 0.5mg/kg infusion over a 40 min period. The investigator will be able to modify the dose if clinically warranted. Treatments will be given two times a week for a maximum of six treatments after which the acute arm of the study will be complete.  Patients will be clinically assessed prior to each treatment to evaluate response and appropriateness for continued treatment. Patients will be assessed for any adverse events and treated per investigator discretion.  Patients will receive both patient rated and clinician rated behavioral scales at all treatment visits (Baseline/Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, and EOT Visit).  6.[ADDRESS_922700] a decrease of ≥ 50% on the QIDS-SR-16 from Baseline/Visit [ADDRESS_922701] less than a 50% decrease in QIDS-SR-16 score from the Baseline/Visit 1 to the EOT Visit will be classified as non-responders. These patients will not be seen for follow-up visits. However, these patients will receive a follow-up phone call one month after the End of Treatment Visit to ask about AEs/SAEs, treatment with ECT, ketamine, psychotropic medications, and complete the PGI-S and PGI-I, QIDS and MADRS assessments. Patients will be referred to their clinical provider for ongoing treatment of depression. Continuity of care between study staff and clinical providers will be carefully managed in order to provide optimal ongoing psychiatric care for the patient.  6.[ADDRESS_922702] be recorded on the Psychiatric Medication Log.  Subjects should continue medications for other conditions and be reminded to tell study staff of any changes to medical history or concomitant medications. This will be assessed at each visit prior to treatment. All subjects should receive optimal care for any side effects occurring during the study (nausea, headache, etc.) according to local

Safety	Monitoring	and	Reporting	 Patients will be closely monitored for adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs), including worsening of depression symptoms. Study investigators will be able to modify treatment or remove patients from the trial based on their clinical discretion and specific patient outcomes.  An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache, fatigue, blurry vision) or signs (e.g., rapid or irregular heart rate, hypertension). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time after the informed consent is signed even if no study treatment has been administered.  Assessment of adverse events, including grading of severity and attribution to research will start at the time of consent. AEs will be evaluated at each visit.  For adverse events (AEs), the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.   • Mild – Events or symptoms that are easily tolerated and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events or symptoms that result in a low to moderate level of inconvenience or concern with normal daily activities.  Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events or symptoms that interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”  Note:  As of 1/1/2018, AEs that are classified as mild, do not need to be reported in the patients chart or the eCRF, per Investigator discretion. AEs classified as moderate or severe, as assessed by [CONTACT_39595], need to be reported in the patients chart and the eCRF.   8.1 Unexpected Adverse Events The following adverse events will be collected from the time of randomization for the study: Adverse events that are not listed in the current labeling for ketamine (Ketalar Product Information) or ECT. This includes events that are similar to those on the labeling but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity.

These events will be recorded on either an AE or an SAE form.  8.3 Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that meet the following definition will be collected from the time of consent until completion of either the One Month Follow-Up Call (for non-responders) or throughout the applicable follow-up visit (for responders). • Results in death • Is immediately life-threatening • Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect • Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  8.4 Documentation and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events SAEs will be reported to C5Research within 24 hours of learning of the event. The causality of the SAE (the relationship to the study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. The SAE will also be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Since the use of Ketamine in the ELEKT-D study is exempted from IND reporting, the Investigator does not have the responsibility to report any AEs/SAEs to the FDA.   8.5 Pregnancy All pregnancies should be reported to C5Research within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy. • Maternal exposure – If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, study treatment will be continued or discontinued per investigator discretion. If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, the investigator 
ELEKT-D Clinical Protocol Amendment V7.[ADDRESS_922716] inform C5Research within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. • Paternal exposure – There are no known risks regarding fathering a child while receiving either ECT or ketamine treatment. But, since there is limited data on ketamine in pregnancy it is advised that patients practice adequate birth control while in the study.  9.			Statistical	Plan	 The key exposures of this study are alternate day ECT treatment and twice a week ketamine infusion. We will conduct an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population defined as a randomized patient having at least one treatment and one valid QIDS- SR16 measurement during the acute treatment phase. Percent of responders is the primary outcome in this study. A responder is defined as a subject with a ≥50% decrease from baseline in the primary endpoint (QIDS-SR-16).  Multiple imputations may be implemented to achieve completeness of the data. In an unlikely case that missing data are non-ignorable, pattern-mixture modeling will be applied.  As a general principle, the statistical analysis will follow the pre-specified statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized prior to the end of the study. The SAP will address how missing data will be handled.  The primary outcome measure of response rate will be compared between ketamine and ECT using a chi-square test. A multivariable logistic regression model will be constructed, to account for potential heterogeneity of treatment effect caused by [CONTACT_681366]. A similar analytic strategy will be applied to evaluate cognitive function and quality of life.  Sample size The sample size justification will be for the primary outcome measure of response rate. Historical data reveal that the overall response rate as well as the respective response rate of ketamine and of ECT is around 50% – 60% on various scale measurements in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Assuming an observed difference of 10% and an acceptable difference margin of 5% with a 1-sided alpha=0.025, a sample of 400 patients (200 per group) provides 81.8% power to detect a treatment response, based on the Farrington-Manning score test of risk difference. The total sample also considers a 10% attrition rate.  10.

Each clinical site, according to local IRB requirements, is allowed to modify this informed consent document and make any necessary editorial changes, as long as neither the meaning nor intent of any section is changed.  The investigator or his/her designee (i.e., research coordinator or study nurse) will inform the patient of all aspects of the study pertaining to the patient’s participation in it. The process for obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. The informed consent form (ICF) must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_681373]/her designee BEFORE the patient can participate in the study. The participant will receive a copy of all signed and dated documents, and the originals will be retained in the patient’s study file or medical record.  Subject Information and Consent Each clinical site is responsible for the confidentiality of the data associated with participants enrolled in this study, in the same manner that it is responsible for the confidentiality of any patient information within its sphere of responsibility. All forms used for the study data will be identified by [CONTACT_681374], which will be generated at the clinical center, to maintain subject confidentiality. All records will be kept in locked file cabinets at the clinical centers with access limited to study staff, and all study staff will identify participants via their unique identifier. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_681375]. The participant grants permission to share research data with these entities in the consent document. Federal regulations govern the protection of patient’s rights relative to data confidentiality and use of research data.  Consent procedures and forms, and the communication, transmission and stoppage of patient data will comply with individual-site IRB requirements for compliance with The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Privacy Rule of HIPAA governs the protection of an individual’s identifiable health information. C5Research will ensure that clinical centers associated with the project comply with HIPAA regulations by [CONTACT_681376]. C5Research will maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_681363]. If IRB approvals are not current, data will not be accepted by C5Research. A secure, electronic data management system will be used to ensure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. All questionnaires and study related materials will be labeled with each participant’s coded identification number; there will be no protected health information indicated on the forms. 14.	Publication	and	Disclosure The study findings will be disseminated to the public through manuscripts, scientific and patient organization led conferences, press releases and through a dedicated website. The PIs may also publicize the study findings through talks and public symposia with their local mental health advocacy organizations (NAMI, DBSA, etc.).  This study will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.

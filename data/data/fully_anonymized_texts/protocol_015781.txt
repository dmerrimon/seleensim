17 5.4 Data Monitoring Committee  
A DMC will be established and will be comprised of 2 physicians (with ALS experience and no 
other involvement in the trial) and a statistician.   
The committee will meet following the administration of 6 doses to a minimum of 33% of 
participants, in each cohort. The meetings for dosing cohorts [ADDRESS_896675], or stop further dosing in the study. Specific responsibilities of the DMC are detailed in the DMC Charter including meeting schedules, documentation requirements, and data review. The DMC may meet on an ad hoc basis should an emergent safety issue be identified (see Section 10.3 ). 
5.5 Concomitant Therapy 
Generally, concomitant medications can be added, changed or discontinued as medically 
necessary. Appropriate documentation for all forms of pre-medications, supportive care, and concomitant medications will be captured in the source documents.  This includes any 
immunizations or vaccinations received for the duration of the study. 
5.6 Excluded Medications

5.6.1 Concomitant Use of Radicava® (edaravone) and Rilutek® (riluzole) or 
Tiglutik (riluzole suspension) 
x Edaravone and riluzole are allowed if the participant has been receiving a stable dose of edaravone for at least 3 months and/or riluzole for at least [ADDRESS_896676] to its ability to enroll the necessary study participants. Strategies for recruitment and retention are discussed 
during routine monitoring visits. Men and women meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria will be allowed to participate.   
6.1 Number of Participants 
The number of participants to be enrolled into the study is approximately 54 adults with ALS.   
6.2 Participant Screening
 
The purpose of Screening Visit 1 is to thoroughly inform, both verbally and in writing, the 
potential participant about the study and allow him/her the opportunity to ask questions. The potential participant will then sign and date the informed consent form and screening procedures 
can be performed. Once the consent form is signed the participant is considered enrolled into the 
study and any serious adverse events that occur will be captured from the date of consent until the end of study participation. 
Protocol AT-1501-A201  
[ADDRESS_896677] be used together are: 
a. Oral contraceptive and condom (combination oral contraceptives containing the 
second-generation progestin (levonorgestrel) and <30 g of estrogen should be 
utilized), 
b. IUD and condom, 
c. Diaphragm with spermicide and condom. 
d. True abstinence is also an acceptable form of birth control 
6. No active suicidal ideation with a plan, or behaviors which may be indicative of a 
participant’s intent to complete suicide as de termined by [CONTACT_663954] C-SSRS.  
7. Able and willing to give informed consent, follow trial procedures, and make multiple 
clinical site visits. 
6.4 Exclusion Criteria

x Clinical conditions affecting the immune system (e.g. HIV infection, 
agammaglobulinemia), 
x Systemic administration of corticosteroids (PO/IV/IM) at a dose equivalent to 20 mg/day of prednisone for more than 14 consecutive days within 90 days prior to screening, 
Protocol AT-1501-A201  
08 March 2021, Version 04 CONFIDENTIAL 
20 x Administration of anti-neoplastic and/or immunomodulating agents (e.g. TNF 
Į antagonists or anti-B cell antibodies) or radiotherapy within [ADDRESS_896679] for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, or HIV. 
11. History of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. 
12. Exposure to any other experimental or investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives; whichever is longer.   
13. History of active substance abuse within the past 2 years; 
14. History of stroke, poorly controlled or significant cardiovascular disease, diabetes or any other acute or chronic medical condition that would unreasonably increase the risks of the study procedures, as determined from an interview with the participant and/or review of medical records. 
15. Any other medical condition such as COVID-19, medication, or pre-planned medical/surgical procedure that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], would compromise the safety of patients or the integrity of study results. 
6.5 Handling of Withdrawals 
Participants are free to withdraw their consent to the trial at any time without providing reason(s) 
for withdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment.  
It is important to collect safety data on any participant who withdraws consent from the study 
before their last scheduled visit (End of Study Visit – Week 15). If early withdrawal occurs the 
clinical site staff is expected to contact [CONTACT_663955]-up by [CONTACT_663956]. 
A minimum of three attempts at contact [CONTACT_28801], the last with a certified letter, if necessary. 
If early withdrawal of consent occurs, the participant should be asked to return for their next 
scheduled visit (e.g., next study visit or phone assessment) to complete an end-of-study 
evaluation (Section 7.5). At a minimum the participant should be questioned over the telephone 
about any changes in clinical condition since their last visit, the status of any ongoing adverse 
events. The aim is to record data in the same way as for participants who complete the trial.  
Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn prior to receiving at least 4 doses of AT-1501 will be 
replaced within the same dosing cohort that was not completed (i.e. a patient withdrawn from the 1 mg/kg dosing cohort may be replaced with another individual who will receive 1 mg/kg).  
6.6 Study Drug Discontinuation 
Participants may be discontinued from receiving study drug for any of the following reasons: 
x Lack of cooperation with study requirements; 
Protocol AT-1501-A201  
08 March 2021, Version 04 CONFIDENTIAL 
21 x Intercurrent illness, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], would unreasonably increase the 
risks of the study procedures, or otherwise compromise the safety of the participant or the integrity of study results; 
x Participant refuses further treatment with AT-1501; 
x Actions taken to control the -spread of COVID-19 (e.g. no access to study drug)

8 PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS 
8.1 Assessments of Safety 
8.1.1 Medical History and Physical Examination 
A medical history is obtained through review of the participant’s medical records and personal 
interview in order to assess eligibility.  Assessment of eligibility should include a full review of all concomitant medications and relevant vaccinations or immunizations.   

Protocol AT-1501-A201  
08 March 2021, Version 04 CONFIDENTIAL 
28 AT-1501 for IV Use Only Anelixis Therapeutics 
Single Use Vial   
Prior to Reconstitution: Store at 2 to 8°C  
See Pharmacy Manual for reconstitution, use and storage instructions 
 
Caution: New Drug Limited by [CONTACT_311558]  
9.2 Drug Ordering and Storage 
AT-1501 is manufactured  
. The filled glass vials will be stored for distribution at Fisher Clinical Services. 
Initial orders will be addressed to the pharmacy, where the vials for use will be stored.  
Instructions on reconstitution, use and storage conditions will be provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual. 
9.3 Dosage and Administration 
Participants in this study will be enrolled into one of four dose groups: AT-1501 1.0 mg/kg, AT-
1501 2.0 mg/kg, AT-1501 4.0 mg/kg, or AT-1501 8.0 mg/kg.   
AT-[ADDRESS_896686] (which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment) reported during or after having received the investigational product/procedure. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_896687] or other means. Serious adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent; all adverse events will be collected from the first administration of  investigational product until completion of the final visit and will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_737]/designee for duration, severity, seriousness, and relationship to investigational product, as outlined below. In addition, the actions taken for the AE will also be documented on the eCRF. Full laboratory data are to be collected in this study, and toxicity trends will be analyzed utilizing objective toxicity criteria.  
A baseline recording of any symptoms of illness will be performed before administration of the 
investigational product. Only symptoms that increase in severity or frequency after 
investigational product administration or new symptoms of illness will be recorded as AEs. If the event reflects worsening symptoms, then this should be captured in the event term. Untoward medical events which occur after signature [CONTACT_663965]. 
For AEs occurring at the site of infusion the phrase “injection -site” or similar should be included 
in the event term (e.g. treatment-site erythema). AEs will be evaluated using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.03). All AEs will receive a CTCAE categorization from the Investigator. AEs will also be categorized according to relatedness to the investigational product (see Section 0). 
The investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this 
study and for reporting to the Sponsor if serious adverse events (SAE) occur. The Investigator is further responsible for appropriate medical care of patients during the study. The Investigator remains responsible to follow, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the study. In case of an AE, the patient must be followed until the event resolves or until the Investigator determines the AE has reached a stable outcome or is no longer clinically significant. Frequency of follow-up is left to the discretion of the Investigator. Participant notes throughout the study will be maintained by [CONTACT_737]. 
Protocol AT-1501-A201  
08 March 2021, Version 04 CONFIDENTIAL 
30 10.1.2 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Event 
All AEs will be assessed using the CTCAE scale as follows: 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL.  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5 Death related to AE 
10.1.3 Onset of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will classify the onset of each AE relative to the following stages of 
treatment: 
x During AT-[ADDRESS_896688] 
The Investigator’s assessment of the relationship  of the AE(s) to the investigational drug will be 
assessed as Not Related, Unlikely, Possible or Probable. For these purposes, the following 
definitions will be used: 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Unlikely: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship unlikely, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations. 
Possible:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153]. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Probable:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal. 
Protocol AT-1501-A201  
08 March 2021, Version 04 CONFIDENTIAL 
31 Related:  An AE that is almost certainly related to the use of the study drug. The AE 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s). 
For purposes of assigning relatedness – Not Related and Unlikely will be considered NOT 
RELATED. Possible, Probable and Related will be considered RELATED. 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events 
10.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
A SAE is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death 
Life-threatening Persistent or significant disability/incapacity Prompts a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663950]/birth defect Important medical events 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. AEs that do not result in any of these outcomes are 
considered non-serious. 
Participants should be closely followed for AEs during the study. Whether or not the adverse 
events are considered related to the investigational product, they must be reported. 
SAEs occurring more than 4 week s after a patient’s last dose of AT -[ADDRESS_896689] treatment, and coming to the 
attention of the Investigator, should be followed to document any congenital anomalies or birth defects, should they occur.  For purposes of consistency, pregnancies will be recorded in the 
SAE System; however, the event will then be downgraded if the outcome does not meet the SAE 
criteria.   
10.2.[ADDRESS_896690] be reported by [CONTACT_25309] (by [CONTACT_756], fax or email)  within 
24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. The Investigator or responsible clinical site staff will complete and submit the Serious Adverse Event report form and then enter all adverse events into the eCRF.

08 March 2021, Version 04 CONFIDENTIAL 
33 10.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_663945] (DLT) 
The DLT observation period to determine the safety of a dose is defined as starting with 
administration of the first dose of AT-[ADDRESS_896691] possibly related  to AT-1501 will qualify as a DLT. 
A DLT is further defined as: 
1. An event which meets the laboratory criteria for potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) or “Hy’s Law” defined as:  
x An elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) lab value that is greater than or equal to three time (3x) the upper limit of normal (ULN) WITH  
x An elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to two times 
(2x) ULN without findings of cholestasis, AND  
x At the same time, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lab value that is less than 2x ULN  
2. Any study drug related Grade [ADDRESS_896692] one dose of study medication will be included in 
the Safety Analysis Set (SAS). 
11.2.[ADDRESS_896693]-
baseline measurement will be included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
11.2.3 Evaluable Analysis Set 
The Evaluable Analysis Set (EAS) will include all treated participants who have no important 
protocol deviations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study. 
11.3 Statistical Analysis 
A detailed description of the planned statistical methods will be documented in a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® software ver. 9.4 or 
higher.

37 baseline examinations required for inclusion into the trial, but who were not included in the 
study. 
In the process of ensuring data completeness and accuracy, a 100% SDV will be performed. The 
Investigator will complete and maintain source documents for each participant participating in the study. Source data is the first place the data is recorded, regardless of where this is. AEs and SAEs together with visit dates and information about the disposition for each participant should be recorded in the participant medical chart/notes.   
For all participants, Anelixis Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee will validate the completed 
eCRFs. The Investigator will retain a copy of the printed eCRF, or equivalent. If data management detects eCRFs with missing or inconsistent data, queries will be sent into the system for correction by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator will also receive data queries, which 
might be generated during the computerized data validation process. 
Source data, source documents, CRFs, protocol and amendments, drug accountability forms, 
correspondence, participant identification list, informed consent forms, and other essential documents must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_896695]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained consistent with regulations under ICH GCP. 
Anelixis Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee will be responsible for data processing and data 
control. Participant data will be entered into the clinical database continuously by [CONTACT_31871].  All original documents and CRFs will be retained in the archives of Anelixis Therapeutics, Inc. as long as the product under investigation remains available for human use. 
13 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

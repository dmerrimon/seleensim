Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 1.0 Purpose and Objectives  3 
1.1 Purpose  4 
This prospective randomized controlled  trial evaluates  the feasibility of using percutaneous  peripheral nerve 5 
stimulat ion (PNS) to reduce acute post-surgical pain in nontraumatic lower extremity amputation  and 6 
decrease the incidence and/or severity of chronic phantom limb pain (PLP) or residual limb pain (RLP).  7 
The use of a novel, intentionally reversible, single -lead, PNS system has demonstrated promising results in 8 
the management of chronic pain syndromes including PLP and RLP  (7).  This study will apply the same 9 
PNS system to nontraumatic trans femoral or transtibial amputees  (TFA or TTA, respectively) in the post- [ADDRESS_308755] -operative period to develop a larger, multicent er, blinded, 17 
placebo -controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate  efficacy in reducing acute and chronic PLP and 18 
RLP.   Upon completion, we will assess the reliability and validity of the proposed study design.   In 19 
conducting this investigation, we hop e to a nswer the following questions:  [ADDRESS_308756]-operative period?    22 
- Does PNS produce clinically significant reductions in acute PLP or RLP?  [ADDRESS_308757] -operative period  reduce the incidence and severity 24 
of chronic PLP and RLP ?  25

pain in nontraumatic lower extremity amputation and decreases the incidence and/or severity of  chronic [ADDRESS_308760] -amputation pain.  Amputation leads to persistent 36 
pain in up to 70 -90% of patients, resulting in decreased quality of life, increas ed risk of depression, and 37 
negative impacts on interpersonal relationships and ability to work (10).  The prevalence of persistent PLP 38 
or RLP  in amputees is estimated to range from 45 to 74% for RLP and 51 to 85% for PLP (11,  12).  Pain [ADDRESS_308761] on ability to perform activities 40

Perioperative pain management in lower extremity amputations  commonly involves a multimodal approach 49 
utilizing pharmacologic and interventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (8).  Both acute and persistent post -amputation pain is [ADDRESS_308764] the potential for addiction and misuse (14).  Several interventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ADDRESS_308765] -amputation RLP or PLP (8).  Karanikolas et al demonstrated 55 
that optimized epi[INVESTIGATOR_253804]/or intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (PC A) in the perioperative 56 
setting decreases PLP intensity, prevalence, and frequency at 6 months  after amputation (23).  This study [ADDRESS_308766] 59 
Medical Therapy  (SMT ) at the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center (VA)  in lower extremity 60 
amputations  to prevent onset of chronic pain, decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and decrease health care utilization (both 61 
inpatient and outpatient).  The efficacy of peripheral nerve catheter -based regional anal gesia for pain relief 62 
in the immediate postoperative period is well documented.  However, associated motor, sensory, and 63 
proprioceptive deficits can increase the risk of falling (15) and duration of use is limited due to risk of 64 
infection (16).  This inter vention is limited by [CONTACT_253823] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_253805] 65 
and sciatic nerve catheters) must be removed by [CONTACT_144632] 5 to reduce the risk of  infection.  66 
Furthermore, Apfelbaum demonstrated in a large study that many patient’s worst incidence of postoperative 67 
pain occurs after discharge (5).  Given this safety limitation and the need for continued pain control in the [ADDRESS_308767] well beyond the time in which it is implanted.  To 72 
date, the system studied is  the only intentionally reversible , percutaneously placed  PNS system.  More 73 
comprehensive and earlier treatment of acute pain is believed by [CONTACT_253824] 74 
(6,7) . 75 
2.2 Literature Review   76 
PNS has been studied for the treatment of some chronic pain syndromes  (7, 17-19), including persistent [ADDRESS_308768]-amputation pain.  The mechanism of action of peripheral nerve stimulation in pain  relief  is commonly 78 
explained using the “gate control theory” of Melzack and Wall (20).  This theory explains that electrical [ADDRESS_308769] (15).  Rauck et al (7) showed that [ADDRESS_308770] pain is 86 
confined to one or two nerve distributions (7,  21-22).  Results showed that 14 of 16 subjects reported ≥75% 87 
paresthesia coverage  from PNS , obtained clinically significant pain relief, and proceeded to a 2 -week home 88 
trial with this system.  9 subjects completed the 2 -week trial and 5 subjects did not complet e the trial because 89

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, [ADDRESS_308779] of PNS on acute pain after lower extremity amputation  134 
The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI)  is a 9 -item questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a 135 
patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning.  The patient is asked to rate their [ADDRESS_308780], average pain, and rate the degree that pain interferes with gener al activity, mood, walking 137 
ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10 -point scale.  Levels 138 
of PLP and  RLP are re -assessed at follow -up Visits according to the Schedule of Study Procedures .  139 
Questions used to as sess pain or sensati on are listed below.  For BPI  #3, #4, and #5, responses are recorded 140 
on an 11 -point scale from “0” to “10” with “0” defined as “No Pain” and “10” defined as “Pain as Bad as 141 
You Can Imagine.”   142 
• Check yes or no if you experienced any (pha ntom limb or residual limb) sensation in the last 143 
24 hours.  144 
• BPI #3: “Please rate your (phantom limb or residual limb) pain by [CONTACT_253826] [ADDRESS_308781] 24 hours.”  146 
• BPI #4: “Please rate your (phantom limb or residual limb) pain by [CONTACT_253826] [ADDRESS_308782] 24 hours.”  148 
• BPI #5: “Please rate your (phantom limb or residual limb) pain by [CONTACT_253827] e [ADDRESS_308783] week .” [ADDRESS_308784] of PNS on the incidence and severity of chronic pain after lower 151 
extremity amputation  152 
Chronic pain (i.e. pain persisting for more than 2 to 3 months after TFA or TTA su rgery will be evaluated 153 
using BPI [INVESTIGATOR_101331] #3, #4, and #5 as above at follow -up Visits according to the Schedule of Study 154 
Procedures.   Data will be compared between groups to assess for differences in the incidence and severity 155 
of chronic pain.   156 
4.2 Secondary Outcomes  157 
4.2.1  Interference due to  Pain  158 
BPI #9 will be assessed at intervals defined in the Schedule of Study Procedures .  This question asks 159 
subjects to rate how pain has interfered with various aspects of life: “Mark the box beside the number that [ADDRESS_308785] 24 hours, pain has interfered with your: (a) General activity (b) Mood (c) 161 
Walking ability (d) Sleep (e) Enjoyment of life.”  Responses ar e recorded on an 11 -point scale from “0” to 162 
“10” with “0” defined as “Does Not Interfere” and “10” defined as “Completely Interferes.”    163 
4.2.2 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale  164 
Participant ratings of global improvement are one of the core ou tcome domains in chronic pain studies 165 
(Dworkin et al. 2005).  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale is assessed at intervals defined 166 
in the Schedule of Study Procedures, which rates perception of change in activity limitations, symptoms, 167 
emotion s, and overall quality of life in relation to pain since beginning treatment.  The scale ranges from 0 168 
defined as “No change” to 7 defined as “A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made 169 
all the difference.”  Responses are collected b y telephone or outpatient office evaluations in the 170 
Interventional Pain Clinic.    171

Louis University Medical Center.   PDI) is assessed at intervals defi ned in the Schedule of Study Procedures, 176 
which measures subjects’ disruption in various aspects of life secondary to chronic pain , including 177 
family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self -care, and life- 178 
support activities.  Each category is rated on an 11 -point scale from “0” to “10” with “0” defined as “No 179 
Disability” and “10” defined as “Worst Disability.”  Responses are collected by [CONTACT_253828] 180 
office evaluations in th e Interventional Pain Clinic.  181 
4.2.4  Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)  182 
The PCS is a widely -used, validated and reliable 13 -question instrument to assess rumination (4 183 
questions), magnification (3 questions), and helplessness (6 questions) (Sullivan, 2009.; Osman et al. 184 
1997 ). The survey asks participants to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how 185 
often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each question is scored on a 0 -4 scale with 0 = “not at all” 186 
and 4 = “all the time”. Higher scores indicate a greater tendency towards catastrophizing pain, which has 187 
been correlated with worse postoperative pain and response to pain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Riddle et al 2010; Pavlin et 188 
al 2005; Forsythe et al 2008).  189

be asked if they are taking any medications for pain.  Subjects will be asked to count their remaining number 193 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_253809] -up encounter.  194 
4.2.6  Functional Independence Measure (FIM)  195 
The FIM p rovides a uniform system of measurement for disability based on the International 196 
Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps .  The FIM instrument  measures the level of a 197 
patient's disability and indicates how much assistance is required for the individual to carry out activities 198 
of daily living.   A baseline m obility FIM will be recorded with the assistance of the Department of 199 
Physical Therapy shortly after amputation but before stimulator placement (Group A) and follow -up FIM [ADDRESS_308787] and compared between groups.  206

primary and secondary outcomes between Treatment and Control Groups.  The study outcomes will be 464 
reported in nontraumatic T FA or TTA, many of which are secondary to dysvascular disease.  Although this 465 
is a specific subset of all amputations that are performed, dysvascular disease accounts for a sizeable 466 
proportion of limb loss in the US with an estimated prevalence of 38 -82% ( 24, 25 ).  The results of this 467 
investigation will be used to refine the study design, recruitment, randomization, retention, and assessment 468 
procedures, and ultimately develop a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to further evaluate 469

dislodgement, nerve injury, bleeding, skin irritation, increased pain, and discomfort on insertion, during use 523 
or with withdrawal.   However, t here may be other risks that are currently  unknown.  The incidences 524 
provided are all estimated except for lead fracture. The risks listed below are described as either common 525 
(occurring more than 10% of the time), uncommon (occurring about 2 -10% of the time), or rare (occurring 526 
less than 1% of the  time).   527 
7.2.1  Infection  528 
Based on pre vious studies using this PNS system , the risk of infection is rare.  When compared to 529

to remove the lead .  When this occurs, one or more lead fragments  may remain in the body.  Granuloma 543 
(mild tissue inflammation) is directly related to the risk of retained electrode fragments.  The investigators [ADDRESS_308831] cases, retained fragments do not need to be 549 
removed .  550 
7.2.3  Lead migration and /or dislodgement  551 
It is possible for a lead to migrate fro m its original position or be come dislodged (i.e.  entirely  removed  from 552 
the insertion site ) during the [ADDRESS_308832] may experience discomfort during stimulation.   Stimulation near the skin surface may be perceived 554

caregiver, as appropriate, to ensure careful handling of the lead and lead connector during bandage changes.   560 
Discomfort or pain due to stimulation may occur if the lead migrates from its original location.  Stimulation 561 
near the skin surface may be perceived as a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” sensation and may be uncomfortable.  [ADDRESS_308834] positioning and slow advancement of the 570

7.2.6  Skin irritation  576 
It is a common risk for skin to become irritated at the lead exit site, under the stimulator pad (a modified 577 
surface electrode that is positioned between the skin and the stimulator device), in the area surrounding the [ADDRESS_308836] materials (stickers, 580 
bandages, tape etc.).  Subjects and their caregivers will be advised to examine the electrode exit site at 581 
regular intervals to look for any signs of irritation.  To avoid irritation under the pad and lead connector 582 
tape, subjects will be advised that the stimulator and pad may be moved to various locations near the lead 583 
insertion site throughout the study.  To  avoid irritation under the belt, subjects will be instructed to move 584 
the belt as needed.  In addition, subjects will be instructed to avoid placing the pad, belt, lead connector 585 
tapes, or bandages on unhealthy skin .   586 
7.2.7  Discomfort  or increased pain  on insertion, during use or with withdrawal  587 
Like procedures involving percutaneously inserted needles (e.g., injections, needle electromyography , 588 
acupuncture ), discomfort associated with test stimulation/placement of the stimulator lead is possible.  [ADDRESS_308837] ed on the PNS stimulator .  Pain is 595

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, [ADDRESS_308838] benefit from electrical stimulation.  This investigation  has inherent 615 
risks to Treatment  Group subjects which are justifiable based on the following rationale : [ADDRESS_308839] the procedure.  Lead placement for the peripheral nerve 622 
stimulator requires a  needle  distance that is further from the ta rget nerve than does placement of a peripheral 623 
nerve block catheter  (5 – 30 mm and 2  mm, respectively).  The increased distance between target nerve and 624 
needle should lower the risk of injury to unintended structures.  Further, evoked responses to electric al 625 
stimulation are used to guide lead placement (i.e. the needle is advanced slightly; once stopped, stimulation [ADDRESS_308840] is evaluated for responses; process is repeated as needed).  If damage to a nerve [ADDRESS_308841] needles, and lead introducer needles .  Needles are not reused.  Subjects with 632 
systemic infection and/or immunosuppressive disorders will be excluded.  Subjects are instructe d to contact [ADDRESS_308842] comfort.  640

a data and safety monitoring review once eve ry 8 weeks in which Case Report Forms and any AE forms 659 
are evaluated.  Safety information is also assessed at outpatient study visits and by [CONTACT_21646].  If study 660 
investigators determine that the PNS tr eatment is unsafe to continue (i .e. systemic infe ction, increased pain [ADDRESS_308845], need for implantable electronic device that requires discontinuation of the 662 
PNS), then PNS will be discontinued as appropriate.  663 
8.1 Serious Adverse Events  664 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be record ed on Form AE and the IRB will be notified within 5 days of 665 
occurrence.  Monitoring for SAEs will occur at each follow -up encounter.  Subjects will be asked if they 666 
are experiencing any increased discomfort, pain, skin irritation, or bleeding.  At the outp atient follow -up 667 
visits, the PNS lead exit site will be examined and the stimulator device will be interrogated to ensure proper 668 
functioning.  Any adverse event  will be investigated and managed as appropriate.   Subjects are instructed 669 
to notify study pers onnel by [CONTACT_756] (804 -675-5188) in case of any changes in medical status as soon as [ADDRESS_308846] as soon as  possible.   672 
Details regarding any observed adverse event  and its relation to the PNS system will be coll ected on Form 673 
AE.  The severity of the AE will be classified as mild (event that causes mild discomfort or inconvenience 674 
and resolves without treatment), moderate (event that requires medical intervention or medication to treat), 675 
or severe (event that requires interventio n to prevent permanent impairment or damage, an event that 676 
requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or an event that is disabling, causing permanent damage, life 677 
threatening, or causing death).  Any treatment necessary related to the AE will be documented.  AEs will [ADDRESS_308847] is discharged  from the study  early.  Adver se events will be 679 
documented and reported so that the safety profile of this system  may be further understood.    680

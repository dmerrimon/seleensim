 4.   INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background I nformation:  
 Influenza is estimated to result in 9.2-35.[ADDRESS_1166202] effective method of preventing influenza virus infection , and annual influenza vaccination 
is recommended for all persons aged >6 months in the [LOCATION_002].  However, the efficacy of 
licensed influenza vacci nes varies annually depending on the match between vaccine strains and 
circulating strains and by [CONTACT_839251] a virus type and subtype.  In a me ta-analysis of published  
influenza vaccine effectiveness studies conducted  during 2007 -2015 , pooled influenza vaccine 
effectiveness  was estimated as 61% (95%CI 57 -65) against A/H1N1 viruses circulating after the 
2009 A/H1N1 pandemic and 54% (95%CI 46 -61) against influenza B viruses, but only 33% 
(95%CI 26 -39) again st influenza A/H3N2 viruses.[ADDRESS_1166203] A/H3N2 viruses than A/H1N1 viruses for the past several 
influenza seasons in the [LOCATION_002] .3, [ADDRESS_1166204] influenza A/H3N2 viruses is particularly concerning given that influenza A/H3N2 
viruses have been associated wi th higher influenza -associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839235].5, 6 
 Questions about the preventive benefit of influenza vaccines are especially relevant to 
healthcare personnel (HCP). Although HCP are believed to be at increa sed risk of influenza  virus  
infection7, there is limited information on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines among HCP.[ADDRESS_1166205] 
demonstrated that repeated va ccination can blunt the antibody response to hemagglutinin12 and 
neuraminidase .13  
 The conventional method of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) production relies on 
propagation in embryonated chicken eggs of a n egg -adapted vaccine seed strain derived from a 
circulating influenza virus.   Both the adaptation process and  serial passage of influenza viruses 
in chicken eggs can result in the development of mutations that may introduce important 
antigenic differences between  the vaccine strain and circu lating wild -type strains.14-[ADDRESS_1166206] influenza A/H3N2  viruses  in some studies despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a reportedly 
good match between vaccine  seed strains and circulating stra ins.16, 18, [ADDRESS_1166207] been licensed in the [LOCATION_002], including a cell  
culture -based  influenza vaccine (Flucelvax ™ by [CONTACT_839252], Inc .) licensed for persons aged > 4 
years  and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok® by [CONTACT_35346] ) licensed for persons age 
> [ADDRESS_1166208] measured antibody responses to cell  culture -
grown  viruses in some cases which may be more representative of immun e responses to 
circulating viruses if cell  culture -grown viruses possess fewer mutations acquired during the  
adaptation and  viral passage process.  
Flucelvax ™ is a subunit vaccine formulated from in fluenza virus cultivated in Madin -
Darby [CONTACT_155664] (MDCK ) cells.   A version known as Optaflu is also licensed in Europe.   
Although cultivation of vaccine strains is done using MDCK cell lines, seed viruses for the 
vaccine may be either egg -derived or cell culture -derived.  In a phase III, randomized, placebo -
controlled, observer -blinded trial comparing either cell  culture -based  trivalent IIV (Optaflu) or 
egg-based  trivalent IIV (Aggripal) to placebo among 11,404 adults aged 18 -49 years , the cell  
culture -based  vaccine was 70% (lower bound of  the 95% CI=55%)  efficacious against all 
culture -confirmed influenza -like illness (ILI), 84% (lower bound of the CI=61%) against ILI 
associated with vaccine -like viruses, and 59% (lower bound of the CI=34%) against ILI 
associated with drifted viruses .20  Efficacy was similar for these outcomes for the cell culture - 
and egg -based  vaccines, but relative efficacy was not assessed.  In other studies evaluating the 
immunogenicity of Flucelvax ™ or Optaflu compared to standard dose egg -based  vaccines, 
immune responses to the cell  culture -based  vaccines were generally  similar  or non -infer ior to 
egg-based  vaccines when evaluating responses against  homologous egg-grown virus antigens .21, 
[ADDRESS_1166209] homologous 
         
9 
 cell culture -grown virus antigens.21, 23, 24 Early trials of Flucelvax ™ used vaccine produced in 
cell culture from egg -derived seed viruses (likely resulting in vaccine viruses that were more  
similar to  those used in egg -based vaccines ), whereas more recent formulations  of Flucelvax ™ 
(e.g. the 2017 -2018 formulation) included an H3N2 vaccine strain  grown from a cell culture -
derived  seed virus.  The 2018 -2019 formulation of Flucelvax ™ will be made from cell -culture 
derived seed strains for both the H3N2 and H1N1 vaccine st rains . 
Flublok® is a recombinant vaccine formulated with purified HA protein  
from  cell-culture isolates of the vaccine reference  virus.  HA is  grown using baculovirus vector 
technology in an insect cell line from the fall armyworm.  Since production of Flublok® does not 
use egg -adapted seed strains, the recombinant HA (rHA) antigens contained in the vaccine are 
thought to completely match those in the vaccine reference virus.[ADDRESS_1166210] other  
vaccines licensed for use in adults aged 18 -64 years  in the [LOCATION_002] , Flublok® contains 4 5 
μg of HA per strain .  In a ph ase III randomize d placebo -controlled trial of trivalent Flublok® 
among health y adults aged 18 -49 years, Flublok® was 45% (95%CI 19 -63%) efficacious against 
culture -confirmed influenza during the 2007 -2008 influenza season when the majority of 
circulating influenza A/H3N2 and B viruses were drifted from the vaccine strains.  Flublok® was 
also found to be highly immun ogenic for all three  vaccine strains with 99% of participants 
having an HI titer of >1:[ADDRESS_1166211] -vaccination, 97% 
against the H3N2 vaccine strain, and 96%  against the B vaccine strain; HI was measured against 
baculo virus derived rHAs.26  In a subsequent phase III randomized trial comparing quadrivalent 
Flublok® to quadrivalent Fluarix, an egg -based vaccine, among adults aged 18 -49 years,  
Flublok® and Fluarix recipi[INVESTIGATOR_839236] -vaccination HI titers against all four vaccine 
components  using egg -grown antigens .27 Randomized trial s in adults aged >[ADDRESS_1166212] 
baculovirus derived rHAs between trivalent Flublok® and Fluzone®28 and showed that Flublok® 
was more efficacious than Fluarix against RT -PCR -confirmed ILI (relative vaccine efficacy, 
30%, 95% 10 -47%) during the 2014 -2015 influenza season when drifted A/H3N2 viruses 
predominated .29   
Both Flucelvax ™ and FluBlok® were licensed in the [LOCATION_002]  based on 
demonstration s of clinical efficacy and non -inferiority using immunogeni city outcomes 
according to the criteria  of the Centers for Biologic Evaluation and Research .  Studies assessing 
         
[ADDRESS_1166213] dose (15µg of HA per strain) influenza 
vaccine s among persons aged 18 -64 years  using both cell -grown  and egg -grown vaccine 
reference viruses as antigenic tar gets.  Two egg -based influenza vaccines will be included as 
comparators in this trial since other vaccine components that vary by [CONTACT_839253] (N A) content, preservatives, and other substances retained as part of the 
inactivation or purification processes.   The primary study hypothesis is that  a single dose of  cell 
culture -based or recombinant influenza vaccine may be more immunogenic than a single dose of 
split-virus/subvirion egg-based influenza vaccine  to cell -grown viruses that are more 
representative of circulating strains, regardless of the vaccine  product among person s aged 18 -64 
years.   
4.2  Justification:  
 Influenza vaccines are the most effective method of influenza prevention and are 
recommended for all persons aged >[ADDRESS_1166214] influenza A/H3N2 viruses 
combined with studi es documenting challenges with growing recently circulating influenza 
A/H3N2 viruses in embryonated chicken eggs for vaccine production have raised questions 
         
[ADDRESS_1166215] of egg adaptation and propagation of vaccine viruses on the effectiveness of 
egg-based influenza vaccines.  At the same time, influenza vaccines made by [CONTACT_839254]/or egg propagation steps are now licensed in the 
[LOCATION_002], including cell  culture -based vaccines and recombinan t influenza vaccines.  At 
present, the Advisory Committee on Immunization practices does not preferentially recommend 
any specific influenza vaccine for use in adults in the [LOCATION_002].  Studies are needed to 
compare the immunogenicity of conventional e gg-based vaccines versus vaccines manufactured 
using alternative methods of production using standard assays and endpoints.  Data from such 
studies will inform whether a preferential recommendation for vacc ines based on a specific 
method  of production are warranted.   
  
4.[ADDRESS_1166216] effective method to prevent influenza and its complications. Through this study, we will 
gain a better understanding of whether  the cell  culture -based  vaccine  Flucelvax ™ Quadrivalent  
or the recombinant vaccine  Flublok® Quadrivalent  offer  greater protection to HCP aged 18 -64 
years  than the conventional egg -based  vaccine s Fluzone® Quadrivalent  and Fluarix® 
Quadrivalent  as measured primarily by [CONTACT_839255] e responses to MDCK cell-grown  
vaccine strains . Because we will assess immune responses at 6 months   after influenza 
vaccination  (or the end of influenza virus circulation)  in all participants, this study will also 
provide information about how long protect ive immune responses to  each influenza vaccine last.  
In the [LOCATION_002] , all four study vaccines are licensed for use in adults aged >[ADDRESS_1166217] circulating influenza viruses 
during the 2018 -19 and 2019 -20 influenza seasons.

 Study Design: Randomized , open -label  study  (Overview  of stratified randomization and study 
activities at each site,  Figure s 1 and 2 ) 
Consent/Screening/ Enrollment  
The study will be open to HCP meeting the eligibility criteria at the two study sites . HCP  
will be recruited using site -specific methods.  Consent, screening, and  enrollment, and all s tudy 
visits will take place at designated study site locations.  All HCP  who are potentially eligible for 
the study will receive a description  of the study (purposes and procedures) and will b e asked to 
read, sign, and date the consent form.  The consent form will explain stud y details, risks, and 
benefits.  Study staff will administer the consent form to  HCP .  The consent process  will take 
approximately 20 minutes . In addition to receiving  a copy of the full consent form, all 
participants will receive  a brief summary of the consent form and an outlined schedule of study 
visits . All potential study participants will be free to decide whether or not they want to 
participate in the study.    
From the start of enrollment , sites will make efforts to recruit participants to fill each of 
the four age and prior vaccination strata shown in Figure 1.  If enrollment into the strata for 
persons with no influenza vaccination during the preceding season are not met after a certain 
period of time, sites may enroll participants with receipt of influenza vaccination during the 
preceding season into all unfilled strata if mutually agreed upon by [CONTACT_839260] .  During the consent proces s, all participants will be asked to give consent for 
collection of an additional 30mL of whole blood for PBMC collection at study visit 3 outlined 
below if they develop RT -PCR -confirmed ILI during the influenza season.   
All potential participants  will ta ke a self -administered survey or study staff may 
administer a survey  to determine whether or not inclusion/exclusion criteria are met (Appendix 
B, Eligibility Screening Form ). Participants will be enrolled in the study if they meet inclusion 
criteria and provide consent  to be in the study  (Appendix C, Consent Form) .   
Stratified enrollment will be used to ensure an even mix of  age groups (18 -44 years and 
45-64 years) and prior vaccination status (received or did not receive influenza vaccine during 
the previous influenza season ) (Figure 1 ).  Eight  hundred and sixty -four participants will be 
enrolled in year 1 (432 at each site).  Additional participants will be enrolled at the start of year [ADDRESS_1166233] to follow -up or withdrew from the study i n year 1 
so that there are 864 participants (432 at each site) enrolled in the study at the start of year 2.  In 
         
21 
 order to enroll this number of participants, site investigators will  plan to screen an additional 
30% of potential ly eligible HCP (i.e. screen approximately 560 participants at each site)  during 
year 1 . 
Study Visit 1  of Year 1  [day 0  defined as day of vaccination ]:  
Study visit [ADDRESS_1166234] on the same day as study screening and consent  or at a later 
date if screening and consent is conducted prior to study vaccine availability at the site .  
Participants will complete a brief questionnaire about demographic characteristics, health stat us 
(body mass index, self -perceived health status), history of chronic medical conditions during the 
preceding year, concomitant  immunosuppressive medication use, household size , history of 
influenza vaccination during the preceding five years, and hours and types of patient contact  
[CONTACT_839261]  (Appendix D , Enrollment  Questionnaire ). 
All study participants will complete  a brief questionnaire to determine whether they are 
currently experiencing fever or other acute illness symptoms (Appendix E, Pre -vaccination 
Questionnaire/Vaccine Administration Form).  Participants  who present with  moderate -severe 
illness with fever and/or acute illness during the study visit will not receive study vaccine until 
their illness has resolved. In this case, a follow up appointment will be made after resolution of 
the illness, at which time the participant will receive the vaccine .  
Randomization: Stratified block randomization will be used at each site to ensure even allocation 
of age groups (18 -44 years and 45 -64 years) and prior vaccination status (received or did not 
receive influenza vaccine during the previous influenza season) to each study ar m.  Within each 
of the four strata , participants  will be randomized 2:2:1:1 to receive one 0.5 mL i ntramuscular 
dose of  a study vaccine :  Flucelvax ™ Quadrivalent , Flublok® Quadrivalent,  Fluzone® 
Quadrivalent  or Fluarix ® Quadrivalent .   Randomization list s will be generated using a 
computerized random -number  generator to select  randomly permuted group blocks of twelve 
with four in each block assigned to Flucelvax ™ Quadrivalent  and Flublok® Quadrivalent  and 
two in each block assigned to Fluzone® Quadrivalent  or Fluarix ® Quadrivalent . The next 
available sequential study -number will be assigned to each enrolled participant upon study -entry . 
‘Opt-In Consent for Longitudinal PBMC C ollection:  
After participants have been randomized, they may be invited to participate in longitudinal 
PBMC collection that requires collection of an additional 30mL of blood at study visits 1, 2, and 
[ADDRESS_1166235] 
completed PBMC collection at study v isits 1 and 1b.   During year 2 of the study, recruitment 
methods for PBMC collection may be modified to target selected participants based on their 
immune responses to vaccination or natural infection during year 1 of the study.  A new consent 
will be req uired for additional longitudinal PBMC collection activities in year 2.   
Blood Draw:  All study participants will have [ADDRESS_1166236] an additional 30  ml of venous blood drawn for collection of PBMCs  to 
assess cell -mediated immune responses to vaccination . 
Vaccine administration: Prior to receiving the influenza vaccine, all stud y participants will 
receive an influenza vaccine fact sheet which outlines potential risks, side effects, and benefits of 
the vaccine.  Participants will receive a single (0.5ml) do se of study vaccine administered in the 
deltoid muscle of the arm opposite the blood draw.  Vaccine administration will be performed by 
a qualified nurse trained in the delivery of the study vaccines  and documented o n Appendix E , 
Pre-vaccination Questionnaire/Vaccine Administ ration Form ).  
Blinding:  Both participants and study investigators will be aware of study arm assignments with 
the exception of laboratory investigators who will be blinded to assignment until testing is 
completed, as appropriate.      
Post vaccination safe ty monitoring:   Since all study vaccines are licensed for use in participants 
meeting the eligibility criteria and safety and tolerability of each vaccine have been established 
in prior studies, data on reactogenicity events and adverse events will not be solicited.  However, 
study staff will provide participants with a phone number to call in case they have any questions  
after vaccination .  
Study Visit 1b of Year 1 [days 6-9]  
Blood Draw:  Participants who had blood collected at day 0 for collection of PBMCs will be 
instructed to return on day  7 (acceptable range days 6-9) to have 30 ml of  venous blood drawn 
for collection of PBMCs  to assess cell -mediated i mmune responses to vaccination.  
Study Visit 2  of Year 1  [optimal timing days 21 -35 (acceptable timing days 21 -62)] 
         
23 
 Blood Draw:  All study participants will hav e [ADDRESS_1166237] an 
additional 30 ml of venous blood drawn  for collection of PBMCs . 
Stud y Visit 3  of Year 1  [optimal timing days 180 -190 (acceptable timing days 180 -210) or 
after influenza circulation has ended ] 
Blood Draw:  All study participants will hav e [ADDRESS_1166238] an additional 30 ml of veno us blood drawn  
for collection of PBMCs  at study visit 3 .  
Stud y Visit 1 of Year 2 [day 0 ] 
All p articipants will complete a follow -up questionnaire during study visit 1 of Year 2 (Appendix 
D, Enrollment  Questionnaire ).  All study participants will also complete  a brief questionnaire to 
determine whether they are currently experiencing fever or other acute illness symptoms 
(Appendix E, Pre -vaccination Questionnaire/Vaccine Administration Form).  Participants  who 
present wit h moderate -severe illness with fever and/or acute illness during the study visit will not 
receive study vaccine until their illness has resolved. In this case, a follow up appointment will 
be made after resolution of the illness, at which time the particip ant will receive the vaccine . 
Randomization  of Participants from Year 1 of the Study :  Participants from year 1 of the study  
will remain  in the same study arm to which they were assigned by [CONTACT_839262] 1 (i.e. 
during study visit 1  of year 1 ).   Study nurses administering vaccine will consult participants ’ 
study files to confirm which study vaccine participants  from year [ADDRESS_1166239] year 
of the study.  
Randomization of Newly Enrolled Participants  in Year 2 : Study staff will review participant 
allocation across age and prior vaccination strata within each study arm to determine the number 
of new participants that need to  be recruited to maintain even allocation across each group.  
Stratified block randomization with randomly permuted group blocks of appropriate size will 
then be used at each site to randomize participants as needed into each of the four study arms to 
make  up for attrition from year 1 enrollment.  
Blood Draw:  All study participants will have [ADDRESS_1166240] an additional 30  ml of venous blood drawn for collection of 
PBMCs to assess cell -mediated immune responses to vaccination.    
Vaccine administration: Study participants will receive the  study vaccine to which they are 
assigned.  The same procedures for vaccine administration outlined above for study visit 1  in year 
1 will be followed for vaccine administration during this study visit.   
Study Visits 1b, 2, and 3  of Year 2  
Study visits 1b, 2, and 3 during year 2 will be conducted at the same  time points (i.e. days post -
vaccination  or after influenza  virus  circulation has ended ) as in year 1 and will include the same 
study activities as in year 1.   
Monitoring of Adverse Events   
Because all four study vaccines are licensed for use in the study population and previous 
studies demonstrated a good safety profile30-33 in adults for each vaccine, active monitoring for 
adverse events will not be conducted as part of this trial.  Study staff will refer participan ts who 
passively report a potential adverse event to their primary care provider for further evaluation as 
needed.  
Active Surveillance for Influenza -Like Illness  
For the purposes of active surveillance, ILI will be defined as new onset of cough  or 
worsening of chronic cough during the preceding seven  days.   Active and passive surveillance 
for ILI will be conducted during the influenza seasons at each site defined as the time period 
when influenza viruses are detected through local (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ) and/or state surveillance.  At 
enrollment, participants will be advised that they will receive notification from the study team 
once the influenza season begins at their site and will be instructed to report any illness meeting 
the ILI case definition to study staff as soon as they dev elop symptoms.   Sites may opt to give 
participants small items such as refrigerator magnets with the study phone number to remind 
participants of how to report ILI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Participants will also receive an orientation about 
self-collection of mid -turbin ate nasal swabs and a self -collection swab kit.   Throughout the 
influenza season , study staff will also contact [CONTACT_839263], email, or text 
messaging on a weekly basis to ask whether participants have experienced onset of ILI during 
the preceding seven days. Participants who have illness meeting the ILI case definition will be 
asked to  self-collect a mid -turbinate nasal swab on the same day and deliver the swab to  the 
study site within [ADDRESS_1166241] the mid -turbinate nasal swab, they will be instructed to come to the study site or receive a 
home visit from study staff fo r swab collection within 3 days  of reporting the  ILI epi[INVESTIGATOR_839238] 0 .  Participants will return to active surveillance 14 
days after illness onset.   At the end of the active surveillance period during each study year, 
study staff will complete an Active Surveillance Tracking Form (Appendix J) for each 
participant to capture aggregate indicators of participant response to surveillance contacts, 
including the number of weeks that the participant was under active sur veillance, the number of 
surveillance contacts that the participant received, the number of contacts to which the 
participant responded, and the number of ILI epi[INVESTIGATOR_839239].  
In addition, electronic surveillance for participant visits  for medically -attended acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (MAARI) will be conducted  daily  Monday through Friday during the 
influenza season.  When study staff identify MAARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], they will contact [CONTACT_839264] 1 day , especially for  MAARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s identified on Monday 
through Thursday , but no later than within 3 days to confirm that the participant’s illness met the 
case definition for ILI .  Participants with ILI will be asked to self-collect a mid -turbinate nasal 
swab  (or have a staff -collected swab if the participant prefers) using the same procedures as 
outlined above for active ILI surveillance . 
Electronic Medical Record Extraction /Abstraction  
When feasible, sites investigators will extract (or abstract if necessary)  data from 
participants’ electronic medical records  and state immunization registries  on influenza 
vaccination history during at least the preceding five years to include, date of receipt, vaccine 
product name, vaccine lot number, and route of administrati on (Appendix G, EMR Chart 
Extraction/Abstraction Form) .  Participants may be asked to sign release of medical information 
forms to allow access to vaccination records as needed to meet site -specific data access 
requirements.  
Protocol Deviations  
Study staff will report protocol deviations using a Protocol Deviation Log for each 
participant (Appendix H).  Sites may also complete additional protocol deviation forms as 
required by [CONTACT_9918] s.  Sites will report deviations to their local IRBs accordin g to site -
specific reporting requirements.   
         
26 
 Data Linkage with Previous Study of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness among HCP during  
the 2010 -2011 Influenza Season  
 For participants who previously participated in a CDC -sponsored study of influenza 
vaccine eff ectiveness that was conducted at both study sites during the 2010 -2011 influenza 
season, study investigators may link data from the previous study with data collected during the 
current study.   
Protocol Completion or Termination  
 Study staff will complete  a protocol completion or termination form for each participant 
at the time the participant either completes all protocol procedures or at the time of termination if 
early termination occurs (Appendix I, Study Status Change Form).  
Site Monitoring Plan:  
CDC will  conduct  site monitoring through teleconference calls and site visits (as needed)  
to ensure that human subject protection, study procedures, laboratory procedures, vaccine 
administration, and data collection procedures are high quality an d meet guidelines, and that the 
study is conducted in accordance with the protocol and sponsor standard  operating procedures .  
CDC will summarize requests to address any areas for improvement or modification that are 
identified during teleconference calls or site visits through written communication to site PIs.

 Statistical Analysis:  
Humoral antibody responses  as measured by [CONTACT_132370]  (and MN, NAI and ADCC , as 
appropriate)  at baseline (day 0), approximately [ADDRESS_1166242] -vaccination will be 
compared between participants  in each study arm using Flu zone® Quadrivalent and Flu arix® 
Quadrivalent as the comparator groups.  Participants in the Flu zone® Quadrivalent and Flu arix® 
Quadrivalent  groups  initially will be evaluated separately for the primary endpoints of SCR and 
GMT  at [ADDRESS_1166243] -vaccination .  If the absolute difference in S CR is <15 % and the re is a  <[ADDRESS_1166244] -vaccination GMT between participants in the Fluzone® Quadrivalent and 
Fluarix® Quadrivalent arms, then participants in these two study arms will be combined for the 
final analysis of the primary endpoint s at [ADDRESS_1166245] -vaccination GMT of >[ADDRESS_1166246]-vaccinatio n.  Ninety -five percent  confidence intervals will be calculated for relevant 
antibody response measures as outlined in the study endpoints at each time point (day [ADDRESS_1166247] -vaccination).  Post-vaccination titers > seropositive 
thresholds at 1:40, 1:80, 1:160,  SCR, GMTs, and MFRs  at each time point post -vaccination will 
be compared between study arms using ANOVA .  In addition, a sensitivity analysis w ill be run 
using ANCOVA with baseline titers as a covariate.    
A sub -group analysis to assess prior vaccination status (number of influenza vaccinations 
received during the preceding five years) as an effect modifier of differences in GMTs between 
study ar ms at 28 days will also be conducted using ANCOVA.  
Cell-mediated immune responses at baseline and approximately 7 days, 28 days, and 6 
months (or at the end of influenza virus circulation)  will be compared between partic ipants in 
each study arm . Non-parametric tests will be used to carry out comparisons of cell -mediated 
immunity studies given the small sample size.   
All primary analyses will be  conducted as intention -to-treat. All tests will be  2-tailed with 
a level of significance of .05 .   
Powe r/Sample size calculations:   
 Study sample size was determined based on available resources.  Assuming  a Type 1 
error of 5% , a Type 2 error of 20% , an overall sample size of 864 with 2 88 participants in the 
Flucelvax® Quadrivalent and Flublok® Quadrivalent arms and 144 participants in each of the 
Fluarix® Quadrivalent and Fluzone® Quadrivalent arms  would provide adequate statistical power 
to detect a 30% relative difference in SCR between study arms  if the SCR among Fl uarix® 
         
30 
 Quadrivalent and Fluzone® Quadrivalent is >50%. Using the same assumptions and sample size 
would also provide adequate statistical power to detect a difference in post-vaccination GMT of  
>[ADDRESS_1166248] -vaccination GMT is >20.  Table 3  provides estimated sample 
sizes required for varying SCR  among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_839240] ™ Quadrivalent and Flublok ® 
Quadrivalent recipi[INVESTIGATOR_839241] .   
 Based on  prior experience enrolling participants at the two study sites, we will assume 
that 10% of participants from year [ADDRESS_1166249] specified differences in SCR between either 
Flucelvax™ Quadrivalent or Flublok® Quadrivalent compared to Fluzone Quadrivalent or 
Fluarix Quadrivalent at approximately [ADDRESS_1166250] -vaccination comparing

Laboratory Protocol:  
Specimen Collection/ Processing/ Storage:    
• Serologic studies:  20 mL of blood will be collected  from all participants  via venipuncture in 
10 ml serum separator  tubes with clot activator and gel according to CDC guidelines 
(Appendix K, Human Sera Collection Guidelines for Influenza Serology ). Each tube will be  
labeled  or barcode linked  with the participant ID number, study visit number, and date of 
collection .  See Table 4  for specimen collection schedule. Collected blood will be stored at 
         
31 
 4°C immediately either by [CONTACT_839265], in a 4°C refrigerator, or in a cooler with 
cold packs. Blood may be stored at 4°C for up to 18 hours. Sometime between 1 hour a nd 18 
hours after collection, the blood collection tube will be centrifuged to separate the clotted  
blood from the serum and the serum removed to a clean tube labeled  or barcode linked  with 
the study participant ID number, study visit number, and date of c ollection. The clotted blood 
will be discarded. The serum will then be divided into approximately 8 -10 aliquots of 100 
microliters/aliquot  into labeled tubes. After aliquoting, the serum samples will be 
immediately stored at -20°C or colder.  
• PBMC studies : [ADDRESS_1166251] 
RT-PCR -confirmed ILI  (see table 2  for specimen collection schedule) and placed in 
vacutainer tubes containing ethylenediaminetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparin. PBMCs will 
be isolated from whole blood and divided into approximately six aliquots of 5x10 million  
cells/aliquot  according t o CDC Guidelines for Freezing Human PBMCs  (Appendi x L).  
Specimens will be processed within 24 hours of collection. PBMCs will be shipped to the 
Influenza Laboratory at CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, [LOCATION_002].  
• Mid-turbinate nasal swabs will be collected either by [CONTACT_38767] -collection or staff 
collection  from participants meeting the study case definition for ILI using flocked dacron 
swabs.  Swabs will be placed immedia tely into viral transport media.  Participants who self -
collect swabs will be asked to store the swab in viral transport media in their re frigerators and 
deliver the swab to the study site within [ADDRESS_1166252] o perating 
procedures .  Swabs that are collected by [CONTACT_839266] 4°C for no 
more than [ADDRESS_1166253] operating proc edures .   
• Participant  specimens (blood and respi[INVESTIGATOR_135608]) will be store d indefinitely for future 
use at a CDC -designated facility for future testing to evaluate aspects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_839242]/or immune re sponses to influenza vaccine or influenza virus infection, as needed.  
• Participants will also be asked if they would like to be contact[CONTACT_839267].

Specimen Testing:  
Sera will be tested by [CONTACT_839268] -grown and egg -
grown vaccine reference viruses at approximately [ADDRESS_1166254] -vaccination  or at the end of influenza virus circulation at each site  
will be tested by [CONTACT_132370] (and MN, if appropriate) to evaluate duration of immune re sponse.  Sera 
may also be tested by [CONTACT_839269] -grown wild -type influenza strains, as appropriate .  
MDCK -SIAT cells or another appropriate cell line will be used to cultivate cell -grown virus 
strains.  A subset of sera from each study ar m may al so be tested by [CONTACT_839270], ADCC , and other 
immunologic assays as appropriate  to measure activity against antigens represented in the study 
vaccines at day [ADDRESS_1166255] array of 
assays that may include HI, MN, NAI, ADCC and other assays as appropriate.  
Four parameters will be analyzed  for HI: SCR, GMT, MFR, and post-vaccination titers > 
seropositive thresholds at 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160 . Three parameters will be analyzed for MN:  
SCR , GMT and MFR.  SCR  will be defined as the proportion of participants  with paired samples 
that achieved ≥ [ADDRESS_1166256] vaccination titers ≥ 
1:40. To allow for calculation of HI GMTs, a titer of 1:[ADDRESS_1166257] -vaccination HI/MN titer  and 
pre-vaccination HI/MN titer  for each subject . 
PBMCs will be tested with B and T-cell assays to understand vaccine -induced B, CD4 and 
CD8 T -cell responses. Immune responses will be quantified and characterized using  
flurochrome -conjugated HA -probes for H1 and H3 HA components of A viruses and HA -probes 
for B (Victoria and Yamagata)  viruses. If reduced binding to sialic acid (RBS) mutants for B 
viruses is observed , an intracellular cytokine staining  protocol  will be used  on influenza -
stimulated PBMCs. I FN-gamma and TNF -alpha, IL -2 and other T -cell-based cytokines will be 
examined. The mean percentages of influenza strain -specific plasmablasts and memory B cells  
and cytokine secreting  CD4 and CD8 T -cells will be compared between participants in each 
study arm . Where feasible, HLA -typi[INVESTIGATOR_839243] -specific T cell analysis, 
vaccine  component (HA, NA, M2e and stem) -specific B and T cell repertoire and single cell 
transcriptome will be ass essed. Responses  will be examined at baseline and at approximately [ADDRESS_1166258]-vaccination.   Influenza HA or NA -specific B cells may also  be 
isolated from a subset of PBMC samples  using flow cy tometry and single -cell sorting.  RNA 
libraries will  then be prepared from these B cells, and the sequence of the heavy and light chain 
variable regions will be analyzed using next -generation sequencing (NGS).  
Mid-turbinate nasal  swabs will be divided into 3 aliquots for testing for influ enza viruses by  
[CONTACT_937]-PCR  using primers for influenza B, A/H1N1,  and A/H3N2  viruses.  Specimens may also be 
cultured for influenza viruses or undergo  additional influenza virus testing such as for influenza 
viral load using quantitative RT -PCR methods and for  antiviral resistance using neuraminidase 
inhibition assays and sequencing. Remaining samples will be stored at -[ADDRESS_1166259]:  Four  vaccine products will be used in this trial:  Fluzone® Quadrivalent, 
Fluarix® Quadrivalent, Flucelvax ™ Quadrivalent , and Flublok® Quadrivalent.  CDC or study 
sites will purchase vaccine.  All four vaccines are inactivated influenza vaccines that are 
appro ved for use  in adults aged >18 years in the [LOCATION_002].  All four vaccine products will 
contain vaccine strains representative of the following four strains in the 2018 -2019 formulation:  
an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09 -like virus; an A/Singapore/INFI MH-16-0019/2016 
(H3N2) -like virus; a B/Colorado/06/2017 -like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and a 
B/Phuket/3073/2013 -like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).  
Fluarix® Quadrivalent is a split-virus/ subvirion vaccine manufactured by 
[CONTACT_35316].  It is f ormulated from influenza virus grown on embryonated chicken eggs.  
Vaccine virus is harvested, concentrated and purified using zonal centrifugation, and then 
inactivated with sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde.  The resulting vaccine suspension is 
clear and is available for use in adults as prefilled single -dose 0.5mL syringes.  Each dose is 
formulated to contain 15 μg of HA per strain.   Each 0.5mL dose of vaccine also contains  
octoxynol -10 (TRITON X-100) up to 0.115 mg, α -353 tocopheryl hydrogen succinate up to 
0.135 mg,  and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) up to 0.550 mg. Each dose may also contain resi dual 
amounts of hydrocortisone up to 0.0016 mcg, gentamicin sulfate up to 0.15 mcg, ovalbumin 355  
up to 0.050 mcg, formaldehyde up to 5 mc g, and sodium deoxycholate up to 65 mcg.33   
Fluzone® Quadrivalent is a split-virus/ subvirion vaccine manufactured by [CONTACT_35346].  
It is formulated from influenza virus grown on embryonated chicken eggs.  Vaccine virus is 
harvested, in activated with formaldehyde, purified by [CONTACT_839271] a sucrose 
gradient, split by [CONTACT_839272]® X-100, and then further purified to a split-virus/ subvirion form.  The 
resulting vaccine suspension is clear and is available for use in adults as a pr efilled single -dose 
0.5mL syringe or a 5mL multi -dose vial; the vaccine is administered intramuscularly.  Each dose 
is formulated to contain [ADDRESS_1166260] common reactions occurring after vaccine administration in 
adults are pain at the  injection site, myalgia, headache, and malaise.  The majority of these 
reactions are mild to moderate.32 
Flucelvax ™ Quadrivalent is a subunit vaccine manufactured by [CONTACT_839273].  The vaccine 
is formulated from influenza virus cultivated in MDCK cells.  Vaccine virus is harvested, 
         
[ADDRESS_1166261] common reactions occurring after vaccine administration in 
adults are pain or erythema at  the injection site, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and malaise.  The 
majority of these reactions are mild to moderate.31 
Flublok® Quadrivalent  is a recombinant vaccine manufactured by [CONTACT_35346].  The 
vaccine is formulated from purified HA protein from cell -culture isolates of the vaccine 
reference virus grown using baculovirus vector technology in an insect cell line ( expres SF+®) 
from cells of the fall armyworm.  HA is removed from cells using Triton® X-[ADDRESS_1166262] be stored at 2° 
C to 8° C [35.6° F to 46.4° F] until needed. Vaccine products should not be f rozen and should be 
protected from natural light. Documentation of proper vaccine storage will be monitored daily 
and maintained during the duration of the trial. In the event of accidental deep -freezing or 
disruption of the cold chain, study vaccine will not be administered.  
8.0 Ethical Considerations  
8.1 Possible Risks  
The poten tial discomforts from study participation  include having blood draw n, 
intramuscular injection of vaccine, and possible reactions to vaccine.  Blood samples will be 
taken from all participants at each study visit. Participants may experience some minimal pain 
and/or bruising at the site of the blood draw. To prevent or lessen bruising, study staff will apply 
pressure or ask participants to apply pressure to the draw site for several minutes  after the blood 
         
36 
 draw . There is also a slight risk of infection associated with blood draws. Study staff will swab 
the site with  alcohol and use sterile equipment to make infection at the site where blood is dra wn 
or where vaccination is given extremely unlikely.   
All study vaccines are licensed for participants who meet the eligibility criteria for this 
study.  Occasionally, adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_839244] -like reactions 
such as fever, body aches, headache, malaise, myalgia, and/or nausea. If present, these symptoms 
usually occur soon after vaccination and may last up to [ADDRESS_1166263] vaccination. Some 
participants may develop reactions at the site of vaccination (redness, swelling, pain, or 
tenderness). Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen and rest will generally relieve or 
moderate these symptoms. Acute and potentially life -threatening allergic reactions are also 
possible. Severe reactions from influenza vaccine are estimat ed to occur in < 1 per 4 million 
persons vaccinated. Signs of a severe allergic reaction may include shortness of breath, 
wheezing, hives, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, swollen face/ tongue/ pharynx, tachycardia, 
and dizziness. During the swine influe nza campaign in the [LOCATION_002] in 1976, about [ADDRESS_1166264] persons who develop 
Guillain -Barré synd rome recover completely. There may be other unknown side effects.  
8.2 Provisions for protecting privacy/ confidentiality:   
All data collected in this study will be kept confidential. All written information will be stored in 
locked cabinets with limited a ccess, and electronic information will be stored on secured servers.  
Blood samples that will be sent to collaborating institutions for processing and analysis will not 
contain any personal identification information. Collaborating institutions will destroy any stored 
data after completion of the study and data analysis. During the study, only a few members of the 
research team  will have access to personal  identifying  information about the study participants. 
All member s of the research team, including the study investigators, research nurses, research 
assistants, and research coordinators, will have access to de -identified data during the study.  
Individuals who are not a part of the research team will not have access t o the study information 
or data while the study is taking place . With an official letter and a clearly stated objective, 
scientists who are not a part of the research team may receive access to de -identified data.  
8.3 Consent f orms for study volunteers: Written informed consent will be obtained for all 
potential participants prior to enrollment. In understandable language, trained project staff will 
explain study procedures to potential participants and discuss the advantages and disadvantages 
of participat ing. Participants will be given a copy of the  full consent form. Participants will be 
         
37 
 asked to read the full consent before agreeing to be in the study and providing their signature.  
Study coordinators will emphasize the voluntary nature  of the study, the  possible benefits and 
outcomes, alternatives to participation, confidentiality of participation, and the participant’s right 
to refuse and/or withdraw from the study at any time. It will be explained to participants that 
discontinuation of participation o r choosing not to participate will not affect  their professional 
standing .  
9.[ADDRESS_1166265] research organization (to be determined) ; the steering committee will be consulted on 
over-arching project issues including final protocol decisions, adjudicating any protocol 
deviations that might occur, reviewing and confirming anal ysis plans, and making final decisions 
on analyses, manuscripts, and authorship as needed.  Upon the completion of all study 
deliverables and after a suitable moratorium, external parties may request de -identified study 
data from the steering committee as specified in U.S. Government Data Sharing guidelines.

 1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Neovascular age -related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of adult 
blindness [1]. While anti -VEGF therapy significantly reduces the rate of severe vision 
loss and may improve vision, subject s with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) continue 
to lose vision long -term and experience an eventual decay in visual acuity [2]. Recent 
advancements in OCT -Angiography  (OCTA)  have enabled for the first time the ability to 
directly identify  and analyze  the detailed microvascular structure and morphology of 
neovascular complexes in AMD [3 -6]. OCTA utilizes amplitude or phase decorrelation 
technology with high -frequency and dense volumetric scanning to detect red blood cell 
movement and to visualize blood  vessels at depth resolved levels throughout  the retina 
and choroid [3].  OCTA  enables more accurate identification of neovascular lesions 
compared to traditional fluorescein angiography (FA). Historically, FA findings such as 
irregular elevation of the RPE  with stippled fluorescence were interpreted to suggest the 
presence of occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) [ 7]. As opposed to FA where 
vessel leakage and blurred edges lead one to infer the presence of occult CNV, OCTA  
reveals the vessel s themselves  and enables more accurate identification of the 
morphology of the neovascular complex  and monitoring of its structural response to 
therapy.  
 
OCTA therefore may provide critical information relating to the development and 
progression of neovascularization in AMD and the response of these lesions to anti -
VEGF therapy. Identifying biomarkers of neovascular activity and progression using 
OCTA may provide further guidance and advancement in  the management of 
neovascular AMD, may provide better outcome parameter s for clinical trials that study 
neovascular AMD therapy, and may permit the development of more effective 
therapeutic agents for neovascular AMD.  
1.[ADDRESS_378678] not been able to analyze the complex micro vascular anatomy 
of the various forms of neovascula r lesions in AMD . With the advent of OCTA , we are 
able to directly assess the microvascular morphology and structural architecture of 
neovascular membranes that occur in AMD and assess the responsiveness o f these 
neovascular membranes to anti -VEGF therapy [3, 7]. Early studies using OCTA  in 
neovascular AMD have shown that type 1 and type 2 neovascular membranes continue to 
grow and mature despi[INVESTIGATOR_308832] -VEGF therapy and develop a resistant and 
mature  core of large dilated feeder vessels that do not respond to any of the approved 
anti-VEGF agents [3, 8-11]. Understanding the development and progression in the 
growth of these neovascular membranes and determining the detailed microvascular 
anatomy and st ructure of these resistant neovascular complexes will spur the 
development of improved therapeutic options that can more efficaciously treat CNV 
leading to better long term visual and anatomic outcomes. In addition it is important to 
identify markers of ne ovascular activity using OCTA which will better guide therapy in 
 
 the future and will provide important parameters to be used for future clinical trials 
assessing the efficacy of neovascular AMD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
1.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection

6.3.3 Safety Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Information Collection  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur during the study  from baseline 
through End of  Study Visit or Early Termination  on the AE pages of the case report form 
(CRF) .  Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_378693] udy drug.  Therefore, an AE is any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug.   
An AE also i ncludes any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant change in frequency 
and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of 
the study drug.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_378694] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (e.g. a car accident in which a subject  is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the subject  is at immediate 
risk of death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869].  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308837] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308838] 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308839] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24929], or is 
prolonged due to the development of a new AE  as determined by [CONTACT_25043].  
• Results in  persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical ev ent - Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may 
jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious 
outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in a n emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  Any 
malignancy (other than basal cell skin cancers) would be considered a medic ally 
important event.  
7.[ADDRESS_378695] ’s source documents.  
Laboratory or vital signs abnormalities will be recorded as AEs only if they are medically 
relevant.  
All SAEs,  regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug will be reported 
to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
The investigator will promptly report  to the IRB  all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subject s.  This includes death from any cause and all SAEs related to the use of 
the study drug.  All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, regardless of assessed causality.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_378696]  signs the informed consent fo rm (“ICF”) until 28 days after dosing will be 
reported to the appropriate IRB and to Regeneron Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the death.   
Any available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports will be sent to Regeneron  
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as soon as possible.  
To report an SAE, Regeneron will be contact[CONTACT_308846]:

7.2.2 Pregnancy and Other Even ts that Require Accelerated Reporting  
The following events will be reported to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. within 24 
hours of learning of the event:  
 
 
 Overdose:   Accidental or intentional overdose of the study drug or concomitant 
medication, whether or n ot it is considered an AE.  
Pregnancy:   Although it is not considered an AE, the investigator will report to 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., any pregnancy occurring in a female subject  or female 
partner of a male subject , during the study or within [ADDRESS_378697] dose of 
study drug.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until delivery, or longer.  If the 
pregnancy continues to term (delivery), the health of the infant will also be reported to 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

as an AE are as follows:  
• the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention, and/or  
• the test result leads to a change in dos ing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therapy.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE .  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an AE.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_378701] make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome 
of any SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
 
 
 7.3 Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
7.3.1 Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of an AE will be graded by [CONTACT_308847] a 3 –point scale (mild, 
moderate, or severe) and reported in detail as indicated on the CRF and/or SAE form, as 
appropriate.  
• Mild:   Does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject ’s normal 
functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily 
needed for relief of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the 
subject . 
• Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to 
health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be 
needed.  
• Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the subject ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given 
and/or subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity will be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.   
7.3.2 Evaluation of Causality  
The relationship to treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_308848]/o r SAE form, as appropriate.  The following terms will be used:  
Not Related:   likely or clearly due to causes other than the study drug.  
Related:   possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug.

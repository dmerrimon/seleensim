Letter of Amendment  #[ADDRESS_464913] P1110  Version 2.0, dated 18 January 2017  Summary of Modifications and Rationale  
 
The purpose of this LoA is to:  
 
1. Provide background, c larify maternal inclusion criterion 4.11 and to define the terms used.  
 
Background:  In designing P1110, the team recognized that in some countries mothers with a history 
of HIV infection could present in labor at delivery sites separate from where they received their 
routine HIV care.  At some research sites, mothers travel to delivery si tes with Prenatal Cards that 
serve as medical records for their prenatal history, laboratory tests results, documentation of 
antiretroviral treatment, and overall delivery of health care. Mothers with HIV infection may be 
referred to another location for d elivery by [CONTACT_371673].  
 
Clarification of Maternal Inclusion Criterion 4.11:  To be eligible to enroll in IMPAACT P1110, 
participating infants had to be enrolled within [ADDRESS_464914] results “documented in the clinical record from past testing may be used to satisfy the criteria for 
documentation of HIV -1 infection.”  Documentation  in the medical record that the diagnosis of HIV 
infection had previously been done using in -country standard of care diagnostic tests could be used to 
document HIV infection , qualifying the mother as “known to be HIV infected,”  and therefore 
additional HIV testing as part of study procedures would not be required .  An additional pragmatic 
factor, which further made the medical record documentation of past HIV positive test results an 
inclusion criterion was the situation that f or women known to be HIV positive for some duration of 
time and on  cART,   they might have such low viral load that test results from re-confirming HIV 
infection could take longer than [ADDRESS_464915] results of no usefulness, being obtained after the baby [CONTACT_371674]. The 
algorithm for newly diagnosing HIV would be the less useful approach for a woman known to be 
HIV positive and medically managed for a period of time prior to study entry.  
 
Definitions  
“Known” to be HIV infected: can be documented in the medical cl inic file at the research site and 
may include the following: 1) maternal subj ect is documented to be HIV positive in the medical 
record per the usual designation at the site, either on or starting prescribed treatment with cART 
(combination Anti -Retroviral Treatment) for the current pregnancy ; 2)  based on available medical 
records, or per her history  obtained at the research site  , from a referring clinic  documented by  [CONTACT_2319] ( 
electronic or other) , or phone contact [CONTACT_371675] e provider .    
 
“Medical record” can include: Mobile paperwork carried throughout the pregnancy as a mother gets 
treatment in one or more clinics ; patient file  hard-copy or electronic  copy in the research clinic or 
from another clinic which notes the HIV status of the mother; or other medical record that is normally 
accepted by [CONTACT_250113].  
 
“HIV test results” documented in the clinical record for “known” HIV positive women: the stand ard 
method of designation will be confirmed by [CONTACT_250113]. This may include t he designation of 
RVD positive=Retroviral Disease Positive. This designation is routinely used in some countries to 
document positive HIV test on the Prenatal Cards.  This is done to protect the confidentiality of the 
HIV status of women where stigma and discrimination are potential barriers to their health care.  
 
Letter of Amendment  #[ADDRESS_464916] P1110  Version 2.0, dated 18 January 2017  In summary, “HIV testing documentation required for mothers known to be HIV -infected”:  For 
mothers known to be HIV-infected (as defined above) , testing obtained and documented per the local 
in-country health department standard of care applicable to the research site (e.g. SOC using 2 
separate tests  and samples , without naming them) are sufficient for meeting the requirement of HIV-[ADDRESS_464917] as clarified under part (i) in Section 4.11.   After noting 
the HIV positive designation in the maternal medical record, per the health department guidelines for 
the site, if two samples and t wo timepoints are used, no further HIV testing is needed for enrollment.  
The HIV testing documentation algorithm only applies for mothers identified as HIV infected at the 
time of labor or in the immediate postpartum period, as clarified under part (ii) in Section 4.11.   
 
 
Implementation  
 
The modification included in this Letter of Amendment  will be incorporated into the next protocol 
amendment as specified below.  Additions to the text are indicated in bold; deletions are indicated by [CONTACT_135721] -
through.   
 
1. Section 4.11, Maternal Inclusion Criteria , is clarified regarding the required source documentation 
for mothers known to be HIV infected versus mothers diagnosed at the time of labor or in the 
immediate postpartum period.   Additions to the text are indicat ed in bold.  Furthermore, formatting 
changes have been made separating the first paragraph after “Documentation of HIV infection” into 
three paragraphs  with added text shown in bold .  The first paragraph applies to both groups of 
mothers, whereas the second paragraph is clarified as only applying to mothers who are known to be 
HIV infected (clarified under i). The third paragraph (newly added) and all remaining text under 
Section 4.11 is clarified as only applying to mothers who are diagnosed at the ti me of labor  or in the 
immediate postpartum period  (clarified under ii). 
 
4.11   Mother is either i) known to be HIV -1 infected prior to labor (testing obtained and designated 
per local SOC  in the medical record  and either on or recently started CART prior to delivery   
or ii) identified as HIV -1 infected at the time of labor or in the immediate postpartum period . 
 
Documentation of HIV infection for (i) and (ii): 
 
Documentation of HIV -1 infection is defined as positive results from two samples (whole blood, 
serum, or plasma) collected at different time points.  This can occur at enrollment or can be 
historical and documented by a notation of HIV positivity in the maternal medical record for 
women known to be HIV positive before delivery.   
 
(i):  Results documented in the clinical record from past testing may be used to satisfy the criteria for 
documentation of HIV -1 infection.  No further testing for HIV is needed for this group of 
mothers. 
 
(ii): For mothers identified as HIV -[ADDRESS_464918] be tested in a 
laboratory that operates according to Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) guidelines and 
participates in an appropriate external quality assurance program .  If nucleic acid testing is used, at 
least one test must be performed in a CLIA -certified (US sites) or VQA -certified (non -US) 
laboratory.  For tests performed in other (non -GCLP-compliant or non -VQA-certified) settings, 
Letter of Amendment  #[ADDRESS_464919] be available.  
 
Sample #[ADDRESS_464920] be tested using any of the following:  
• Up to two rapid antibody tests from different manufacturers or based on different principles and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  
• One EIA OR Western Blot OR immunofluorescence OR chemiluminescence  
• One quantitative HIV RNA PCR ( above the limit of detection of the assay ) 
• One HIV DNA PCR  
• One qualitative HIV RNA PCR  
• One total HIV nucleic acid test  
 
Note: Confirmatory testing (Sample #2) may be pending at the time of enrollment of the mother -
infant pair.  If maternal confirmatory testing is negative, the infant will be removed from active 
dosing but will be followed for safety as part of the study.  
 
Sample #[ADDRESS_464921] be tested using any of the following:  
• Rapid antibody test. If this option is used in combination with two rapid tests for Sample #1, at 
least one of the three rapid tests m ust be FDA -approved, and the third rapid test must be from a 
third manufacturer or based on a third principle or epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230].  
• One EIA confirmed by [CONTACT_371676]  
• One quantitative HIV RNA PCR (above the limit of detecti on of the assay)  
• One HIV DNA PCR  
• One qualitative HIV RNA PCR  
• One total HIV nucleic acid test

A Phase I Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in 
HIV-1-Exposed Neonates at Risk of Acquiring HIV -1 Infection  
 
 
DESIGN:   Phase I, open label, non -comparative d ose-finding study  
 
SAMPLE SIZE : Approximately 50 infants in order to accrue a minimum of 32 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) evaluable HIV -1-exposed infants, and their 
mothers. Cohort 1 will enroll a minimum of 12 PK evaluable infants and 
Cohort 2 will enroll a minimum of 20 PK evaluable infants.  
 
Note:  Cohort  1 RAL-naïve, Cohort 1 RAL-exposed, and Cohort 2 RAL -
naïve group s were fully accrued under protocol Version 1.0 . Cohort 2 
RAL-exposed group will be opened to accrual under protocol Version 2 .0 
and will enroll a minimum of 8 PK evaluable infants.  
 
POPULATION : HIV-1 exposed full -term infants (aged ≤48 hours in protocol Version 1.0 
and ≤ 60 hours in protocol Version 2.0)  assessed as risk of acquiring HIV -
1 infection  and their mothers.  Two group s of infants will be enrolled in 
each Cohort  according to infant in-utero exposure to maternal raltegravir  
(RAL):  
 RAL–naïve (infants born to mothers not receiving RAL prior to 
delivery) and  
 RAL–exposed (infants born to mothers who received at least one dose 
of RAL within 2 – 24 hours prior to delivery) .  
 
REGIMEN : Cohort 1:  Raltegravir as oral granules for suspension administered at two 
time points:  as a single dose within [ADDRESS_464948] prophylaxis, wit h a second single dose 
administered at 7 -10 days of life .   
   
Cohort 2:  Raltegravir as oral granules for suspension initiated in RAL–
naive infants within 48 hours of birth and in RAL–exposed infants 
between [ADDRESS_464949] prophylaxis .  
 
 1.5 mg/kg once daily dur ing Days 1 –7 of life (week 1)  
 3.0 mg/kg twice daily during Days 8 -28 of life (weeks 2 -4) 
 6.0 mg/kg twice daily during Days 29 -42 of life (weeks 5 -6) 
 
Based on ongoing interim analysis of pharmacokinetic data and safety

IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 9 of 92  18 January 2017  1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
 
Although significant progress has been made in identifying strategies to prevent perinatal of 
HIV transmission by [CONTACT_371679], new pediatric HIV infections continue, with an esti mated 370,000 
infant infections in 2009 [1-3]. It is estimated that only 35% of pregnant women with HIV 
infection in low-resource countries rece ived antiretroviral prophylaxis for prevention of 
mother-to-child HIV transmission [1]. When the diagnosis of HIV infection in a pregnant 
woman goes unrecognized and antiretrovirals have not been used during pregnancy and 
labor, infant prophylaxis with zidovudine and either nelfinavir plus lamivudine or nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_371661] H IV transmission by 44% compared with the use of zidovudine alone 
[4].  In HIV endemic settings up to 3 -10% of pregnant women become infected during 
pregnancy placing their infants at even higher risk for acquiring HIV infection [5].    
 
It is critically important to develop new and potentially more effective regime ns for postnatal 
prophylaxis for perinatal transmission in high -risk settings. Use of integrase inhibitors as part 
of neonatal prophylaxis may further reduce transmission risk as these agents block 
integration of viral DNA into the host cell, a critical st ep in the virus lifecycle required for 
productive infection to occur. Integrase inhibitors as part of postnatal infant prophylaxis also 
have a potential role in the setting of high -risk pregnancies or maternal infection with drug -
resistant HIV.  
 
In addition, i ntegrase inhibitors have theoretical advantages as part of early highly active 
antiretroviral therapy for neonates with HIV infection.  Neonates with HIV infection can be 
identified in the first few weeks of life, allowing for immediate or early  initiation of HAART.  
Early therapy is now standard of care for infants with HIV infection globally due to the 
survival benefit conferred, but limited antiretroviral agents are available for this purpose [6]. 
As such, there is a critical need for additional potent antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of 
pediatric HIV infection. Studies such as P1115 involving s trategies for early treatment of 
newborns infected with HIV with more intensive antiretroviral drug regim ens are being 
conducted , with the goal of either improving clearance of HIV -infected cells that contribute 
to prolonged second -phase decay in plasma viremia during HAART in infants, or even 
potentially to eradicate or lower HIV reservoirs throughout the bo dy of the infant  with HIV 
infection.  In a recent study, time to undetectable plasma viremia in infants treated with a 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]-based HAART regimen (PACTG P1030) was strongly correlated with resting 
CD4+ T cell latent reservoir size at two years of age [7].  This relationship suggests that more 
rapid clearance of plasma viremia during HAART may reduce viral reservoir seeding in 
infants with HIV infec tion and antiretroviral drugs that block viral integration may have a 
role to play in accelerating the rate of viral decay.  
There are limited safety and dosing information for ARVs in neonates.  Only zidovudine 
(ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC) , nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (NVP), and stavudine (d4T) are 
approved for use in neonates < 14 days of age.  Nelfinavir (NFV) pharmacokinetics and 
safety have been studied in neonates and used as part of a prophylaxis regimen in the recently 
reported HPTN/NICHD 040 trial [8], but its use is not approved in children less than [ADDRESS_464952] experience in neonates for prophylaxis 
and treatment is ZDV/3TC/NVP.  Of the protease inhibitors, only NFV has pharmacokinetic 
data available for neonates, but these data demonstrate highly variable plasma concentrations 
and the opti mal dosing regimen remains uncertain [9, 10].  Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritona vir, the protease 
inhibitor used most commonly to treat HIV infection in infants, is available as a pediatric 
solution, but dosing is uncertain in the first weeks of life.  The solution contains 15% 
propylene glycol and 42% ethanol, and its use in the firs t two weeks of life is not 
recommended after several cases of life -threatening brady -arrhythmias and cardiac 
dysfunction were identified in preterm infants [11, 12].  Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics 
and safety of additional antiretroviral drugs for use in neonates for prevention or treatment of  
HIV infection is vitally important.   
Raltegravir has the potential to play an important role in both prophylaxis and treatment of 
infants at high risk of HIV -1 infection.  Raltegravir, an integrase inhibitor, has a unique 
mechanism of action, is effectiv e in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_371662], and is well tolerated in 
children and adults.  Overall, the currently available preclinical and clinical data support the 
evaluation of this highly promising antiretroviral agent in neonates exposed to HIV who are 
at risk of becoming infected. The primary goal of this protocol is to define the 
pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in  at risk infants less than 6 weeks of age in order to develop 
an appropriate raltegravir dosing regimen for prophylaxis and or treatment of HIV in exposed 
neonates.  This current study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in 
neonates at risk of acquiring HIV -1 infection and determine the appropriate dose that can be 
administered to infants. It is also hoped that a multi -dose regimen will be established for 
subsequent use for treatment in order to examine the effects of early neonatal therapy with 
integrase inhibitors towards eliminating widespread  establishment of HIV reservoirs.  
1.2 Raltegravir  
 
Raltegravir (Isentress™) is a potent and selective HIV -[ADDRESS_464953] 4 weeks of age [13-20].   
1.21 Raltegravir Pharmacokinetics in Adults  
 
There is considerable variability in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.  In adults 
raltegravir has an initial (α) t ½ of approximately 1 hour and a terminal  elimination (β) t 
½ of approximately 7 to 12 hours [21].  In normal adults, approximately 7 -14% of an 
administered raltegravir dose is excreted unchanged in urine.  The primary route of  
raltegravir elimination is hepatic metabolism by [CONTACT_31672] (uridine diphosphate) -
glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), primarily UGT1A1 but with minor contributions from 
UGT1A3 and UGT1A9, followed by [CONTACT_371680] -glucuronide via stool and 
urine [22].

1.22 Summary of Raltegravir Drug -Drug Interactions  
 
The potential for raltegravir drug -drug interactions was investigated in a series of clinical 
studies in uninfected adults.  A summary of drug interaction studies appears below.   
Table 1 
Comparison of Drug -Drug Interactions of Raltegravir Plasma  
Pharmacokinetic  Parameter: Mean % Effect on Raltegravir  
 
Raltegravir was shown not to be an inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4, as demonstrated in 
the midazolam interaction study, suggesting that raltegravir will not impact the 
pharmacokinetics of drugs metaboli zed by [CONTACT_097]3A4  [21]. Raltegravir is approximately 
83% bound to plasma proteins.  
1.23 Raltegravir in Pregnancy for Prevention of Perinatal Transmission of HIV  
 
In the [LOCATION_002], while transmission has been significantly reduced, perinatal 
transmission of HIV continues to occur.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
conducts Enhanced Perinatal Surveillance in 15 U.S. jurisdictions.   In a study evalua ting 
transmission risk in 2005 -2008 in 8,054 births to mothers with HIV infection, 179 infants 
(2.2%) were diagnosed with HIV infection [24]. The odd s of having an infant with HIV Antiret roviral  C12h  AUC †

antiretroviral (ARV) medications, abused illicit substances, breastfed, or had lower CD4 
cell counts.  In another report of nearly 8,600 births  to women with HIV infection 
reported to the CDC, 8% of women did not receive prenatal care; of those with prenatal 
care, 3% did not receive HIV testing during pregnancy; of those with HIV testing, 6% did 
not receive ARV prophylaxis or treatment during pre gnancy; of those who received 
antenatal therapy, 5% did not receive ARV drugs during labor and delivery [25].  In a 
study of 707 women receiving HAART during pregnancy, overall transmission was 
1.6%; MTCT was directly correlated wit h HIV viral load nearest delivery and duration of 
HAART during pregnancy and CD4 count near delivery were correlated with viral load 
[26]. A number of studies have demonstrated that duration of ARV prophylaxis during 
pregnancy is significantly associated with the risk of MTCT  [27], [28]; in the European 
Collaborative Study, MTCT was significantly related to insufficient antenatal HAART, 
defined as no  or <13 days of HAART  [27].  An additional important risk factor for 
transmission in the U .S. is acute HIV infection during pregnancy in women with initially 
negative HIV tests, who therefore initiate ARV late and have high levels of viremia 
[29].  Perinatal transmission with multi -class drug resistant virus despi[INVESTIGATOR_371663], even with viral suppression, has been descr ibed [30]. Finally, the number of 
women with HIV infection giving birth in the U.S. has increased by [CONTACT_3450] 30% 
since the year  2000 to approximately 9,000 annually, which can result in increased 
perinatal transmission secondary to these mi ssed opportunities for prevention [25].  Thus, 
infants born to mothers with late diagnosis of HIV, receiving no antiretroviral drugs or 
short duration of HAART, have multi -class drug -resistant virus, or detectable viral load 
at delivery, are at particularly high risk of HIV transmission in the U.S. as well as in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696].  
 
Raltegravir is now included in the list of recommended regimens for use in pregnant 
women[31]. Raltegravir pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated in [ADDRESS_464956] P1026s study. Raltegravir PKs in these women showed 
extensive variability as seen in non -pregnant individuals. Median raltegravir area under 
the curve was reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50% during pregnancy. No significant 
difference was seen between the third trimester and postpartum trough concentrations. 
Plasma HIV RNA levels were under 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL in 92% of women a t delivery. Given 
the high rates of virologic suppression and the lack of clear relationship between 
raltegravir concentration and virologic effect in non -pregnant adults, no change in dosing 
was recommended during pregnancy  [32]. In a study of [ADDRESS_464957] trimester/postpartum values were AUC0 -12hr 0.71 (0.53 –0.96), Cmax  0.82 (0.55 –
1.253), and C12hr  0.64 (0.34 –1.22). One patient was below the target C12hr  in the third 
trimester and none were below the threshold postpartum. No change in dosing during 
pregnancy was recommended based on these data  [33]. 
 
In the P1026s Study and the PANN A study, raltegravir was well tolerated, with no 
treatment -related serious adverse events in pregnant women, and all infants were at least 
36 weeks’ gestation at delivery  [32, 33]. Raltegravir has been shown to induce a rapid 
decline in viral load and could be beneficial in women who present late in pregnancy 
with detectable virus [34].  In multiple case reports and case series of 4, 5, and [ADDRESS_464958] P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 13 of 92  18 January 2017  pregnant women treated with ra ltegravir in combination with 2 or 3 other antiretroviral 
drugs because of persistent viremia or late presentation, the drug was well tolerated and 
led to rapid reduction in HIV RNA levels [35-40].  
 
1.[ADDRESS_464959] P1066, conducted by [CONTACT_371681], Pediatric, Adolescent AIDS 
Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group and entitled “A Phase I/II, Multicenter, Open -Label, 
Noncomparative Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Antiretroviral Activity of Raltegravir (Isentress™, MK -0518) in HIV -1 Infected Children 
and Adolescents ,” evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters, and 
efficacy of three raltegravir formulations across the pediat ric age range of [ADDRESS_464960] (Cohort I) and then 
successively younger children. Patients received the film -coated tablet formulation 
(Cohorts I and IIA; 6 through 18 years of age) ; or the chewable tablet formulation 
(Cohorts IIB and III; 2 through 11 years of age) ; or the granules for oral suspension 
(Cohorts IV and V; 4 weeks through 2 years of age) .  Raltegravir was administered with 
an optimized background regimen.   
 
The initial dose -finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose 
selection for each cohort (see Table 2, Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III and Table 4, Cohorts IV 
and V) was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough 
concentration as s een in adults, with a specific goal to maintain both a geometric mean 
(GM) AUC 0-12hr between 14 and 25 uM*hr and a GM C 12hr greater than 33 nM (the in 
vitro IC95 for antiviral activity), and acceptable short term safety.  After dose selection, 
additional p atients were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy.  
 
2 to 18 Years of Age  
As shown in Table 2, for Cohorts I -III, the targeted PK parameters (area under the curve 
[AUC]0-12hr and C12hr) were achieved for each cohort allow ing for dose selection.  
 
  
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_464961] P1066  
Cohorts I - III 
 
Of the 126 children and adolescents enrolled ( All Treated population ), 96 patients 
received only the recommended dose of raltegravir  (Final Dose population). In the 96 
patients who received the recommended dose of raltegravir, the frequency, type, and 
severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those 
observed in adul ts [41-45].  One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse 
reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior and insomnia; one 
patient experienced a Grade [ADDRESS_464962] and Grade 3 ALT, which were 
considered serious. These adverse events did not result in discontinuation.  
 
Ninety-one (94.8%) patients 2 through 18 years of age completed 48 weeks of treatment. 
At Week 48, 78.9% achieved ≥1 log 10 HIV RNA drop from bas eline or <400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL; 
56.7% achieved HIV RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. The mean CD4 count (percent) increase from 
baseline to Week 48 was 155.7 cells/mm3 (4.6%). 
 
In December 2011, based on review of complete Week 24 and partial Week 48 data from 
this study, the U nited States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved the use 
of raltegravir (as chewable or 400 mg film -coated tablet) in combination with other 
antiretroviral agents in pediatric patients 2 through 18 years of age.

Twenty-six enrolled and were treated in Cohorts IV (6 months to < 2 years) and V (4 
weeks to < 6 months) [20]. All 26 patients were included in the safety analysis. Through 
Week 48, there were 10 patients with Grade 3+ AEs. Two were judged related to study 
drug. There was 1 discontinuation due to an AE of skin rash, 1 event of immune 
reconstitution syndrome, and no drug -related deaths.  
 
Of the 26 patients treated, 23 patients were included in the efficacy analysis.  At Week 
48, for Cohorts IV and V, 87.5% of patients achieved virologic success and 45.5% had 
HIV RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. At Week 48, g ains in CD4 cells of 527.6 cells/mm(3) and 
7.3% were observed. A total of 6 mg/kg per dose twice daily of RAL for oral suspension 
was well tolerated and showed favorable virologic and immunologic responses.  
 
Based upon these data, US FDA in December 2013 a pproved the use of raltegravir (as 
granules for oral suspension) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in pediatric 
patients 4 weeks to 2 years of age.  During review of this data, the raltegravir pediatric 
dosing and administration (D&A) was res tructured to a weight -based rather than age 
based cut-off approach.  Table [ADDRESS_464966] Circular (USPC), are as follows:

1.25 Relative Bioavailability of Raltegravir Formulations  
 
Protocol 068 provides relevant biocomparison data in adults for the current approved 
pediatric formulations oral granules for suspension) and/or approved and chewable 
tablets.  The data provided below indicate that both oral granules for suspension and the 
chewable tablet formulations have somewhat greater bioavailability than the adult, f ilm-
coated tablet. Protocol 068 was an open label, 4 -period, randomized, crossover study in 
healthy, adult, male and female subjects. Twelve (12) subjects each received 4 treatments 
(Treatments A, B, C, and D) rand omized in a balanced, crossover design in Periods 1 
through 4. Treatment A consisted of a single oral dose of 400 mg raltegravir adult 
formulation tablet. Treatment B consisted of a single oral dose of 400 mg raltegravir 
ethylcellulose pediatric chewable tablet formulation (administered as 4 x 100  mg tablets). 
Treatment C consisted of a single oral dose of 400 mg raltegravir oral granules in a liquid 
suspension. Treatment D consisted of a single oral dose of 40 0 mg raltegravir 
ethylcellulose pediatric chewable tablet formulation (as 4 x 100 mg tabl ets) administered 
following a high fat meal. Treatments A -C were administered in the fasted state.  All 
doses of raltegravir, regardless of formulation, were administered  under supervision and 
retention of  drug in the mouth was not permitted.  There was a minimum of 4 days of 
washout between the single doses in each treatment period.  
 
The geometric mean pharmacokinetic parameter values for the raltegravir pediatric 
chewable tablet and oral granules for suspension formulations were estimated and 
compared to the corresponding values for the adult tablet, all following single dose 
administration of 400 mg in the fasted state, with result s shown in Table 8 . The geometric 
mean C 12hr values were similar for all formulations, while AUC 0-∞ and Cmax values were 
higher for both the pediatric chewable tablet and the oral granules formulation compared 
to the adult tablet. For the oral granules formulation, AUC 0-∞ and Cmax were moderately 
higher (2.6 - and 4.6-fold) than those obtained with the adult tablet and slightly hi gher 
(1.5- and 1.4-fold) than those obtained with the pediatric chewable tablet. Both the 
pediatric chewable tablet and oral granules formulations had earlier median T max values 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 18 of 92  18 January 2017  compared with the adult tablet (0.5 and 1.0 hours for the chewable tablet and oral 
granules, respectively, compared to 4.0 hours for the adult tablet). Half -life values for 
both the initial (α) and terminal (β) phases were similar for all formulations.  The results 
were consistent with some difference in the absorption portion of th e pharmacokinetic 
profile among the formulations, but little difference in the later part of the profile. Mean 
plasma concentration –time profiles for all formulations are shown in Figure 1.  
 
The higher AUC 0-∞ and Cmax values for the oral granules formulati on are not expected to 
have any meaningful clinical consequences. The pharmacokinetic properties of the two 
pediatric formulations are similar to the raltegravir Phase I lactose formulation which was 
well tolerated in adults.  To date in the development pr ogram for raltegravir, there have 
been no acute safety findings that were temporally associated with peak concentrations, 
and raltegravir has been found to be generally well tolerated in the clinical program with 
no dose-related toxicities. Based on the la ck of a statistically significant difference in 
trough values, and the otherwise moderate dissimilarities in the other pharmacokinetic 
parameters, these results supported continued clinical development of both the chewable 
tablet and oral granules for susp ension pediatric formulations in IMPAACT P1066.  
Acceptable pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles for the chewable tablet and oral 
granules for suspension formulations have been observed in pediatric patients in 
IMPAACT P1066 to date [46, 47].

1.26 Raltegravir Resistance  
 
The mutations observed in the HIV -1 integrase coding sequence associated with 
phenotypic resistance to raltegravir include the following amino acid substitutions: at 
either Q148H/K/R, N155H, or Y143C/H/R) plus one or more additional substitutio ns.  In 
the raltegravir clinical development program, virologic failure was associated with 
emergent integrase signature [CONTACT_89483] (at amino acids 143, 148, and 155) in 66% of 
treatment -experienced adults and 44% of treatment -naïve adults failing raltegrav ir 
therapy. 
 
In IMPAACT P1066, the emergence of raltegravir -resistant viruses was monitored by 
[CONTACT_371682], hr0 [ADDRESS_464969] P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 21 of 92  18 January 2017  amino acid sequences of the HIV integrase gene, the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, and 
the protease inhibitor (PI) gene if the HIV RNA plasma level was >1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, the 
approximate limit of the resistance assay, and adequate sample was available for testing.  
In Cohorts I, II, and III (N=126), a total of 27 (21.4%) patient s were considered virologic 
failures by [CONTACT_10585] 24 and 36 (28.6%) patients were virologic failures by [CONTACT_10585] 48.  Of the 
33 Cohort I -III patients for whom genotypic data were available, viruses from 12 (36.4%) 
displayed signature [CONTACT_371784] :  1 at AA 143, 7 at AA 148, and 8 at 
AA155, which is consistent  with observations in adults .  In Cohort IV, no patients failed 
by [CONTACT_10585] 24 and 4 patients failed by [CONTACT_10585] 48. No patients in Cohort V met virologic 
failure criteria by [CONTACT_10585] 24 or 48.  Because o f limited blood volume obtained, only 2 of 
the 4 patients with virologic failure had genotypic data available. One patient had a 
mutation at AA155 (without other raltegravir associated resistance mutations), and one 
patient had no known raltegravir mutatio ns detected during study treatment.  
1.27 Special Concerns for the Use of Raltegravir in the Neonate  
 
UGT1A1, the enzyme primarily responsible for raltegravir metabolism, is also the only 
enzyme that contributes to bilirubin glucuronidation in human hepatoc ytes, and as such is 
essential for the biliary elimination of bilirubin from the body [48]. Glucuronidation 
activity is low in fetuses and in the newborn immediately after birth but increases 
exponentially over the first weeks and months of life.  Hepatic UGT activity i n liver 
samples is very low in samples from 2nd trimester fetuses, and increases roughly [ADDRESS_464970] 3 months following a 
full term delivery [49].  The low level of hepatic UGT activity at birth plays a major role 
in the elevations of bilirubin routinely seen in the newborn, referred to as physiologic 
jaundice.   
 
In adults, decreased UGT1A1 activity h as been shown to result in increased plasma 
concentrations of both bilirubin and raltegravir.  Atazanavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, is 
also an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and elevation of direct bilirubin is a very common side 
effect of atazanavir use in HIV inf ected adults.  When raltegravir and atazanavir are co -
administered, raltegravir AUC increases on average by 41% and C max by 77% [50]. 
Similarly, the UGT1A1 *28/*28  genotype, one of the common genotypes found in 
individuals with Gilbert’s Syndrome, is characterized by a roughly 30% decrease in 
UGT1A1 activity and increased serum bilirubi n concentrations [51, 52]. Following 
standard dosing with raltegravir, individuals with the UGT1A1 *2 8/*[ADDRESS_464971] on 
average an increase of 40% in raltegravir AUC and C max and of 90% in trough 
concentration compared to individuals with wild type UGT1A1.  Raltegravir elimination t 
½ was not prolonged in the UGT1A1 *28/*[ADDRESS_464972] pass metabolism may play a 
major role in the increase in raltegravir plasma concentrations seen in these individuals 
[53].   
 
Administration of an exogenous drug that is eliminated by [CONTACT_371683]. Low UGT activity that results in decreased elimination of 
endogenous bilirubin and physio logic jaundice will also result in decreased metabolism 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_464973] is glucuronidation.  A neonatal 
dosing regimen for such a drug extrapolated from older infants or children may result in 
accumulation of unexpected ly high and potentially toxic plasma drug concentrations [54]. 
Chloramphenicol, a drug metabolized predominantly by [CONTACT_371684], provides the classic example 
of the harm that may result from using a drug in the newborn without an adequate 
understanding of its pharmacology in this population.  When chloramphenicol was fi rst 
administered to neonates in the 1950s, the use of neonatal doses extrapolated from those 
used in older infants and children in ignorance of the low level of neonatal 
glucuronidation activity led to the accumulation of chloramphenicol to toxic 
concentra tions and the clinical syndrome of fatal cardiovascular collapse known as gray 
baby [CONTACT_371685] [55]. More recently, elimination of zidovudine, which is also metabolized 
by [CONTACT_371686], ha s been shown to be decreased in neonates, necessitating use 
of reduced doses during the first months of life in both term and preterm infants [56, 57]. 
The reduction in neonatal zidovudine glucuronidation was associated not  only with 
reduced clearance but also with higher bioavailability, consistent with decreased first pass 
metabolism [58].   
 
Another potential risk posed by [CONTACT_371687] a drug metabolized by 
[CONTACT_15924]1A1 is an increase in neonatal bilirubin levels.  Since both the drug and bilirubin 
share the sa me elimination pathway via UGT1A1 metabolism, the drug may compete 
with bilirubin for UGT binding sites, leading to a further reduction in bilirubin clearance 
and an increase in total serum bilirubin.  This is unlikely to be a problem for raltegravir, 
which has a Km for UGT1A1 of 99 µM  and binds much less avidly to UGT than does 
bilirubin, which has a Km of 5 µM for  UGT1A1 [22]. Km, the Michaelis constant, is the 
substrate concentration at which an enzymatic reaction rate is at half its maximum speed.  
A low Km value indicates high affinity between substrate and enzyme, while a high Km 
value indicates low affinity.  
 
Competition for neonatal albumin binding sites between bilirubin and an exogenous drug 
may also present a significant risk to the infant.  Under normal circumstances, most 
circulating bil irubin in the newborn is in the unconjugated (indirect) form rather than the 
glucuronidated (conjugated or direct) form.  Unconjugated bilirubin bound by [CONTACT_371688] -brain barrier.  If the concentration 
of circulating unconjugated bilirubin exceeds the capacity of albumin for bilirubin 
binding, then the excess bilirubin will be unbound or “free”, with the potential to cross 
the blood -brain barrier and cause kernicterus [59]. In the newborn when bilirubin 
concentrations are high, a drug that displaces bilirubin from albumin binding sites may 
place the infant at increased risk of kernicterus and death,  as was the case when 
sulfisoxazole was first used in premature neonates [60]. However, raltegravir is unlikely 
to cause a significant problem by [CONTACT_371689].  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_371664] 3.5 to 4.5 g/dL, or 
529 to 680 µmol/L [61]. After factoring in raltegravir protein binding of 83%, raltegravir 
should occupy approximately 2% of albumin under normal physiologic conditions, which 
should not increase kernicterus risk signifi cantly.  By [CONTACT_2163], kernicterus developed 
in premature infants when sulfisoxazole concentrations exceeded 205 µmol/L [62].  
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_464974] of raltegravir on bilirubin -albumin binding was 
performed  in pooled neonatal serum using the peroxidase method [59, 61, 62]. 
Raltegravir had minimal effect on bil irubin-albumin binding at concentrations of [ADDRESS_464975] of raltegravir on 
neonatal bilirubin binding i s unlikely to be clinically significant unless concentrations 
exceed typi[INVESTIGATOR_371665] 10 µM (4440 ng/mL) by 50 –100-fold [63]  
 
Recently a genetic variant in the SLCO13 gene  (rs2117032 -C/T) was found to have a 
strong association with bilirubin levels in neonates [64] 
In order to try to identify potential predisposing factors that might be associated with 
elevated bilirubin levels in the study population, the UGT1A1 and SLCO1B3  (rs2117032) 
genetic variant will be evaluated at the end of the study.

IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 25 of 92  18 January 2017  1.28 P1097:  Raltegravir Washout P K Results  
 
IMPAACT P1097 is an ongoing multicenter trial to determine the washout PK  and safety 
of in utero/intrapartum exposure to RAL in both low birth weight (≤ 2500 grams) and 
full-term infants born to pregnant women with HIV infe ction receiving RAL at the FDA 
approved adult dose of [ADDRESS_464976] blood 
and a single maternal blood sample are collected at delivery.  In Version 1 , which 
enrolled full term infants has been completed  [65]. In full term i nfants, blood samples 
were collected at 1 -5, 8-14, 18-24, and 30 -36 hours after birth.  In version 2 , which is 
currently enrolling low birth weight infants , blood samples are collected at 1 -6, 12-24, 
36-48, 72-84, and 108 -132 hours after birth. RAL concent rations are measured using a 
validated HPLC -MS-MS method. Infant t ½ is estimated using terminal 2 or 3 
concentration -time points for each infant.  Safety of in utero/intrapartum exposure to 
RAL has been evaluated in the full-term infants for up to 6 months of age.  
 
In full-term infants, t wenty-two mother-infant pairs were enrolled: 5 9% of the mothers 
were African American, 3 6% were Hispanic.  Evaluable PK data were obtained from 1 9 
mother-infant pairs  (Figure 3) .  Median (range) n g/mL RAL  plasma concentration values 
were: maternal at delivery: 540 (12-5809); cord blood 9 57 (24-3974); ratio of 
cord/maternal blood: 1.48 (0.32 -4.33); initial infant plasma: 6 71 (13-2672); and infant 
plasma at 30 -36 hours: 291 (<10-1402). Median infant apparent t ½ of RAL was 26.6 
(9.3-184) hours.  Infant washout RAL concentrations initially increased before decreasing 
in 9 of 19 (47%) evaluable infants. All infants tolerated RAL exposure well with [ADDRESS_464977] ed adverse events or transmission of 
HIV infection  [66]. 
 
Raltegravir readily crosses the placenta. The plasma t ½ of RAL in  neonates is highly 
variable suggesting potential roles for developmental aspects  of neonatal UGT1A1 
enzyme activity, redistribution and/or enterohepatic recirculation of RAL. Understanding 
the features of RAL PK in neonates will be critical for development of a neonatal dosing 
regimen. P1097 version [ADDRESS_464978] P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 26 of 92  18 January 2017

P1110 Cohort [ADDRESS_464979] of care antiretroviral agents (ARVs) for prevention of 
perinatal transmission, and a second dose administered at 7 - 10 days of life. The initial 
dose was RAL 3 mg/kg and doses were adjusted on a rolling basis.  RAL -exposed infants 
(infants born to mothers receiving RAL prior to and during delivery ) were excluded 
initially but later were allowed to enroll and received a lower initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg.   
 
Sixteen mother -infant pairs enrolled : 10 RAL- naïve infants (born to mothers who did not 
receive RAL during pregnancy and delivery ) and 6 RAL-exposed infants.  There were 8 
females and 8 males ; the median (range) gestational age was 38.7 (37-40) weeks; and the

IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 27 of 92  18 January 2017  median birth weight  (range) was  3.02 (2.32 -4.20) kg.  Evaluable PK results were 
available for [ADDRESS_464981] 6 RAL naïve infants  received 3 mg/kg initial 
doses.  While none of the 6 infants exceeded the Cmax upper limit, there were 3  out of 6 
infants who exceeded the AUC12 upper limit of 28 mg*h/L.  The initial dose was 
reduced after interim analysis and for subsequent enrollments RAL-naïve infants received 
a 2 mg/kg dose while RAL -exposed infants received a 1.5 mg/kg for the initial dose.  All 
infants, regardless of maternal RAL usage , received 3 mg/kg for the second dose at 7 -10 
days of life.   
P1110 Cohort 1 (RAL -naïve): Raltegra vir Pharmacokinetic Preliminary Results  
 
PK results from Cohort 1 [67-69] were combined with that from older infants and 
children receiving daily dosing in a population PK model and simulations performed to 
develop a daily RAL dosing regimen to be evaluated in 20 infants in Cohort 2  [70-72]. 
The RAL dosing regimen studied in Cohort 2 for infants unexposed to RAL in utero is: 
1.5 mg/kg daily startin g within 48 hours of life through day 7; 3 mg/kg twice daily on 
days 8-28 of life; 6 mg/kg twice daily after 4 weeks of age  [71, 72].  
 
PK results and [ADDRESS_464982] 10 RAL-naïve infants who 
received the dose under study: 1.5 mg/kg daily through day 7; 3 mg/kg twice daily on 
days 8-28 of life; 6 mg/kg twice daily after 4 weeks of age  [69, 73, 74].  After the first 
dose of 1.5 mg/kg, geometric mean RAL AUC 24 was 38.9 mgxh/L (range18.6 -78.3 
mgxh/L).  On 3 mg/kg twice daily the geometric mean for RAL AUC 12 was 12.1 mgxh/L 
(range 4.7 -24.5 mgxh/L) and C min estimated to be 120.4 ng/mL. Sparse sampling 
confirmed that RAL plasma concentrations were within the expected range.   
 
There have been no safety concerns associated with daily RAL administration based on 
safety data through [ADDRESS_464983] ARV prophylaxis to infants exposed to HIV -1 assessed at risk 
of infection.

UGT1A1 genotype  and whether there is an association of UGT1A1 (*28/*28) and 
SLCO1B3  (rs2117032 -C/T) with hyperbilirubinemia.  
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a Phase I multi -center, open label, non -comparative study to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of raltegravir (RAL) administered to HIV -1-exposed neonates at risk of 
acquiring HIV -[ADDRESS_464984] 6 
weeks of life .  
 
The study will enroll approximately 50 mother -infant pairs in order to accrue a minimum of 32 
PK evaluabl e HIV-1-exposed infants.   
 
Mother-infant pairs will enroll at the time of delivery/birth (up to 48 hours of life  under protocol 
Version 1.0 and up to 60 hours of life under protocol Version 2.0) .  Pregnant women who are 
expected to have a full term uncomplicated delivery will be identified prior to delivery . The 
informed consent process will typi[INVESTIGATOR_371666] 2nd or 3rd trimester; however, the 
consent process may be conducted in whole or in part af ter infant birth.   Women will be  followed 
until discharge from the labor and delivery unit . Infants will be followed on study for [ADDRESS_464985] P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 29 of 92  18 January 2017   
 
Cohort 1:   
 
A minimum of 12 neonates will be enrolled into Cohort 1 to provide data for 12 PK evaluable 
neonates. All neonates enrolled in Cohort 1 will receive RAL 2 mg/kg as oral granules for 
suspension administered as single dose within [ADDRESS_464986] dose (<48 h ours) will provide PK data when infant glucuronidation is known 
to be at its nadir, and the se cond dose (7 -10 days) will provide information about changes in 
metabolism in Week 2. The 2 mg/kg single starting dose of RAL is 25% of the total daily dose (6 
mg/kg BID) that was studied in infants with HIV infection 4 weeks to < [ADDRESS_464987] P1097, the 3 mg/kg single dose was selected as a conservative first 
dose to minimize potential safety concerns and still provide informative P K data. 
 
RAL dosing in Cohort 1 may be modified in the range of 1.5 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg per dose. The PK 
results and safety will be assessed through regular team monitoring (done at least every 4 weeks) 
and at full cohort accrual to ensure that the individual  RAL concentrations are in the target range 
(not exceeding C max of 19.63 µM and not exceeding an AUC12 of 63.05 µM -hr) and that there

birth (if not done as per standard of care), and at [ADDRESS_464999] 
hematology, chemistry, lymphocyte subsets, and HIV viral load laboratory evaluations 
performed every 3 months up to 24 weeks of life.  
3.2 Optional genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ( Cohorts 1 and 2 ): 
 
Optional genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_371667]1A1 and SLCO1B1  polymorphisms will be performed in infants 
undergoing PK sampling to determine how polymorphisms, such as UGT1A1*28/*[ADDRESS_465000] P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 32 of 92  18 January 2017  3.3 Raltegravir Compassionate Use (Cohorts 1 and 2):  
 
Raltegravir will be provided to infants  through the protocol for the  duration of the study as 
part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but the choice of the ARV regimen will 
be left to the discretion of the site investigator.  At the end of the study, infants with HIV 
infection who are receiving the RAL granules as part of their cART regimen  at sites where 
the RAL granules are either  1) not commercially available in that country for the caregiver to 
purchase, or 2) the caregiver cannot gain access to the granules via a government progr am, 
then [COMPANY_006] will arrange for access to the granules through the local [COMPANY_006] subsidiary at no 
cost to the patient.

Phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin:  RAL is eliminated mainly via a UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 -mediated glucuronidation pathway and may be subject to 
drug-drug interactions when co -administered with drugs that are known to be UGT1A1 
inducers or inhibitors. However, RAL is not anticip ated to affect the metabolic clearance of 
drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_15924]1A1 given its low UGT1A1 inhibitory (IC 50 for the inhibition of 
UGT1A1 >50 µM) and induction potential. Since RAL is neither an inducer nor inhibitor of

6.0 PARTICIPANT  MANAGEMENT  
6.1 Toxicity Management  
 
The DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS 
AE Grading Table), Version 1.0, December 2004, Clarification August 2009, which is 
available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance  will be 
used for screening eligibility and for grading toxicities when specifically noted below .  
Alternate explanations for clinical or lab oratory abnormalities that may at first appear to be 
related to the stu dy agents(s) must be explored.   Expedited Adverse Event (EAE) reporting 
must be done according to Section 7.1  
 
*NOTE: SPECIAL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES FOR BILIRUBIN WILL BE USED 
ACCORDING TO SECTION 6.13  
 
6.11 Reporting  of Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions (for bilirubin  management, see 
Section 6.13)  
 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 41 of 92  18 January 2017  A suspected adverse drug reaction (SADR) is an adverse event that could potentially 
have a causal relationship to the study agent (definitely,  probably, or possibly related).  
General guidelines for study drug suspected adverse drug reactions SADRs are provided 
below. 
 
 Grade 1 - All study drug SADRs should be recorded on Case Report Forms 
(CRFs) at each visit.    
 
 Grade 2 - All study drug SADRs should be recorded on CRFs at each visit.   
Inform team monthly whether toxicity has resolved or not.   
 
 Grade [ADDRESS_465020] be notified of study drug SADRs within 24 hours at 
[EMAIL_7148] . 
o The investigator should confirm all Grade [ADDRESS_465021] results as soon as possible but always within 72 hours .    
o Expedited Adverse Event (EAE) reporti ng must be done according to Section 
7.1.  
 
6.12 Management of RAL toxicity  (for bilirubin  management, see Section 6.13) 
 
Cohort 1:   
 
Grade 1 - The second RAL dose can be administered; routine monitoring.  
Grade 2 - The second RAL dose can be administered ; monitor closely with more frequent 
visits; as per site PI, and work -up to exclude other causes.  
Grade 3 - The second RAL dose should be withheld while awaiting confirmatory results; 
other PMTCT antiretroviral prophylaxis may be continued.  If Grade [ADDRESS_465022] the study team and the second RAL dose should be withheld until the 
abnormalities are Grade 2 or below unless the clinician, with the approval of the study 
team and medical officer, believes that the event is unlikely rela ted to RAL 
administration and that antiretroviral therapy (including RAL) should be continued.  
Grade [ADDRESS_465023] unless the clinician, with the approval of the study team and medical 
officer, believes that withholding antiretroviral prophylaxis (including or excluding RAL) 
would be harmful to the participant  and that continuing them would p ose little additional 
risk. If the Grade [ADDRESS_465024] the team to determine if and when the 
second RAL dose should be administered; other antiretrovir al drugs used for PMTCT 
prophylaxis can be restarted when abnormalities are Grade [ADDRESS_465025] the study team for further instructions.   
 
Attempt to confirm any unexpected laboratory results as soon as possible, but al ways 
within 72 hours of the recognition of the event .  The protocol team should be notified of 
the results at [EMAIL_7148]  
 
 
*NOTE:  In the event of treatment discontinuation, participant s will be asked to continue 
to be followed until the 24 week visit.  
 
Cohort 2:  
 
Grade 1 - Continue RAL; routine monitoring.  
Grade 2 - Continue RAL; monitor closely with more frequent visits; as per site PI, work -
up to exclude other causes.  
Grade [ADDRESS_465026] prophylaxis should be held until 
the abnormalities are Grade 2 or below unless the clinician, with the approval of the study 
team and medical officer, beli eves that the event is unlikely related to RAL 
administration and/or that PMTCT prophylaxis should be continued.  
Grade 4 – Contact [CONTACT_3476]. Hold RAL and concomitant antiretrovirals used for 
PMTCT immediately unless the clinician, with the approval of the study team and 
medical officer, believes that withholding antiretroviral prophylaxis (including RAL) 
would be harmful to the patient and that continuing them would pose little additional risk.  
Attempt to confirm any unexpected laboratory results as  soon as possible, within 72 
hours of awareness of the event. The protocol team should be notified of the results at 
[EMAIL_7148] . 
 
For confirmed drug related Grade [ADDRESS_465027] the team to determine when RAL may be safely resumed.  
 
*NOTE:  In the event of treatment discontinuation, participant s will be asked to continue 
to be followed until the 24 week visit.  
6.13 Bilirubin Management  
 
Due to the potential for interactions between RAL and bilirubin affecting RAL 
pharmacokinetics and bilirubin elimination and toxicity (see  Section 1.27) special 
management procedures for bilirubin will be used.  Bilirubin concentrations and 
interventions to lower bilirubin (such as phototherapy and exchange transfusion) will be 
recorded but bilirubin will be graded according to the DAIDS Toxicity Table  and 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 43 of 92  18 January 2017  managed acc ording to the schema described below .  Hyperbilirubinemia will be managed 
by [CONTACT_371700].  If total bilirubin  is >16.0 
mg/dL or an exchange transfusion is performed, no further RAL doses will be 
administered but  participant s will continue to be followed for safety assessments.  
Participant s who receive phototherapy may continue to receive study drug as long as total 
bilirubin concentration  ≤16.0 mg/dL. 
 
The protocol team must be notified if study drug is held due to elevated bilirubin or of 
Grade [ADDRESS_465028] possibly related  within 24 
hours of site awareness at [EMAIL_7148] . 
 
6.14 Follow-up of Abnormal Events and Laboratory Values  
 
All abnormal clinical events and laboratory values , not related or probably not related  
(non-SADR events) , occurring in enrolled participant s will be followed closely until 
resolution. The urgency and frequen cy of repeat evaluations will depend on the clinical 
significance of the specific abnormality.  Study clinicians will provide appropriate 
clinical management of adverse events according to their best medical judgment and local 
practice.  For any persistent  Grade 3 or 4 clinical or laboratory study drug SADRs, 
evaluations should be repeated approximately weekly (or more frequently  if necessary) 
until toxicity falls to Grade 2 or below and as appropriate thereafter.  Alternate 
explanations will be sought for all clinical and laboratory  abnormalities.  
 
6.2 Study Management Plan  
 
The Data Management Center (DMC) will maintain a web page informing sites as to the 
availability of enrollment slots per cohort.  The protocol team, including the co -chairs, 
medical officers, pharmacist, and pharmacologist, will respond to sites who contact [CONTACT_371701], dosing, or other issues within one business 
day.  Team responses will include the entire team.  
 
Sites will be given [ADDRESS_465029], [COMPANY_006] and/or the study team, a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) wi ll be 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 44 of 92  18 January 2017  appointed to review the data understanding that Cohort 2 will not open without [COMPANY_006] 
approval.  See Section 8.51 for more details on SMC monitoring of study data and progress.  
 
The P1110 team will notify sites of any change in dose and/or dosing freq uency through an 
appropriate mechanism. Dosing tables found in Appendix III will be used for dosing changes 
and are based on weight bands.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_465030] given within 48 hours of 
birth and a second dose administered at 7 to 10 days of life, with PK assessed after each 
dose.  The PK results and safety will be assessed through the regular team monitoring 
(done at least every 4 weeks) and at full cohort accrual to ensure that the RAL 
concentrations in each individual do not exceed a C max of 19,630 nM  (8,720 ng/mL) and 
do not exceed an AUC12 of 63,050 nM -hr (28,000 ngxh /mL), and that no life -threatening 
toxicities probably related to RAL administration have occurred.   
 
Based on the team assessment of the PK data and review of safety information, the d ose 
may be modified for the subsequent participant s receiving the 2 doses in Cohort 1, in 
which RAL dosing may be modified in the range of 1.5 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg per dose.  
       
Cohort 2 
After enrollment of participant s into Cohort 1 RAL-exposed or RAL -naïve group is 
completed with acceptable safety and an appropriate multiple dose regimen from birth to 
6 weeks is determined, Cohort 2 will open  for the respective group .  The initial multiple 
dose regimen for Cohort 2 may be determined based on results fr om P1097,  P1110 
Cohort 1, P1066 (Cohorts IV and V), P1026s, and PK modeling and  simulation.  The PK 
targets for Cohort 2 are geometric mean target exposures for:   
 
 once-daily dosing of AUC24 of 28 -90 µMxhr (12 -40 mgxh/L) and an 
approximate GM trough (C24h r) > 75nM (33ng/mL)  
 twice-daily dosing of AUC12 of 14 -45 µMxhr (6 -20 mgxh/L) and an approximate 
GM trough (C12hr) > 75nM (33ng/mL)  
 
A minimum of 20 neonates will be enrolled into Cohort 2 to provide data for 20 PK 
evaluable infants.  The dosing for RAL  is further detailed in Section 5.11 of this protocol.   
 
Cohort 2 dosing may be modified based on observed pharmacokinetic data coupled with 
modeling and simulation to determine the optimal multiple dose regimen capable of 
meeting the selected PK targets:  If the minimum targets above are not achieved, the dose 
will be increased in linear fashion.

not symptomatic or related to study  drug, and  all other Grade [ADDRESS_465036] be commu nicated as soon as possible to the appropriate IRB or EC and/or reported in 
accordance with local law and regulations.   
 
For all SAEs submitted to RSC, sites must file an updated SAE report to RSC with the final 
or stable outcome (Status Code p. 5 of the E AE form) unless the SAE reported in the initial 
EAE form already had a final or stable outcome.  
7.3 Grading Severity of Events  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events 
(DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 1.0,  December 2004, Clarification August 2009, must 
be used and is available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -research-

IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 47 of 92  18 January 2017  7.4 Expedited AE Reporting Period  
 
The expedited AE reporting period for this study is the entire study duration for an individual 
participant  (from initial administration of study drug until study completion or 
discontinuation o f the participant  from study participation for any reason).  
 
After the protocol -defined reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only  S[LOCATION_003]RS as 
defined in Version 2.0 of the EAE Manual will be reported to DAIDS if the study staff 
become aware of the even ts on a passive basis (from publicly available information).  
 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONS IDERATIONS  
8.1 General Design Issues  
 
This is a Phase I multi -center, open label, non -comparative study to assess the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of raltegravir administered to full-term neonates, aged  ≤ 48 hours (protocol 
Version 1.0) and ≤ 60 hours (protocol Version 2.), at risk of acquiring HIV -[ADDRESS_465037] 6 weeks of 
life.  Both the mother and the infant will be enrolled, with the mother having only a study 
entry visit and the infant followed through 24 weeks of life.  
 
Safety data will include si gns/symptoms, diagnoses and laboratory test results, which will 
include results of evaluations specified in the protocol and results from the infant’s clinical 
care.  Infants will be evaluable for safety analysis if they received at least one dose of 
raltegravir. For CRF reporting and analysis of safety data, the sites’ assessments of AE 
relationship to raltegravir will be used.  However, with regards to participant  safety and PK 
evaluations which will support the selection of a dose for a given cohort, the  protocol team 
will also have input as to the causality and drug relation of specific adverse experiences .  
Regular monitoring of RAL safety, which could result in dose or study modification, 
described in detail in Section 8.5.

The attribution of relationship  of serious adverse events to study drug  for the purposes of 
employing the start, stop and pause rules will be by [CONTACT_371703], 
study team (which includes representatives from [COMPANY_006]) and DAIDS  medical officer; if 
unanimous agreement between them cannot be established, the attribution made by [CONTACT_371704] 3 persons or entities will be used.  Gradation of relationship wi ll use the

(DSMB), i t is the responsibility of the protocol team to interpret safety data, and make 
decisions regarding SADRs that are needed to protect participant s from undue risk.  
 
The safety and tolerabili ty of the study agent will be monitored by [CONTACT_371706].  It is required 
that the data required for the toxicity reports be entered into the database within 72 hours 
of the time at which the results of the laboratory tests or clinical examinations become 
available.   
 
Reports compi[INVESTIGATOR_371670] (DMC) will be reviewed and 
discussed by [CONTACT_371707] [ADDRESS_465044] Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review 
this study regularly, following policies described in the IMPAACT Manual of 
Procedures.  The composition of the SM C will include the SMC Chair; IMPAACT Chair 
or Vice Chair; IMPAACT Treatment Scientific Committee Chair or Vice Chair; 
representatives of the IMPAACT Operations Center, Statistical and Data Management 
Center, and Laboratory Center; and representatives of N IAID and NICHD.  
 
SMC reviews will occur at least annually and on a more frequent or ad hoc basis if any 
safety issues or concerns arise.  Ad hoc reviews may also be triggered by [CONTACT_371708] e to safety concerns , 
as outlined in Section 8.52 below.  Based on any of its reviews, the SMC may 
recommend that the study proceed as currently designed, proceed with design 
modifications, or be discontinued.  The SMC may also provide operational 
recommen dations to help address any study implementation challenges that may be 
identified during their reviews.   
 
The SMC will monitor study progress  (see Section 8.6) , quality of study conduct, and 
participant safety.  The SMC will generally review the same typ es of data reports as the 
Protocol Team.  For ad hoc or triggered safety reviews, more limited data may be 
reviewed, focusing on the events that triggered the reviews.   
 
8.52 Guidelines for the Evaluation of Safety Data (See Section 9 .0 for Pharmacokineti c 
Guidelines)  
 
Accrual to Cohort 1 will be temporarily suspended if:  
 any participant  has a new life threatening event or death judged to be a 
Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) or if any of the participant s has a

participant s based on safety data through  6 weeks of life, for the purpose of 
determining whether accrual to the full cohort can proceed and determining if any

Grade 4 event that is probably or definitely attributable to the study medication and 
no more than 25% of the participant s on the final dose for Cohort [ADDRESS_465053].  Two types of 
sampling error s are possible :  
 
1) In a group where the true rate of toxicity is too high to warrant increased exposure to 
the current starting dose of the medication, the sample data may pass the safety 
guidelines;  
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.0 Page 53 of 92  18 January 2017  2) In a group where the true rate of toxicity is low enough  that further exposure to the 
current starting dose is warranted, the sample data may fail the guidelines.  
   
The extent to which the safety guidelines protect against the errors described above can 
be assessed by [CONTACT_50796] "true toxicity" which could occur, 
if the study medication were used extensively among the participant  populatio n at the 
dose level under question.  The hypothetical situations presented in Tables 11,12, and [ADDRESS_465054] 8 participant s for the 
interim analysis for Cohort 2, and 20 participant s for final analysis of Cohort 2, 
respectively. Should there be a dose change following the interim analysis of Cohort 2, 
then only the 12 remaining participant s will be exposed to the new dose; in that case the 
probabilities presented in Table 11  will apply.  Tables 11 ,12 and 13  show the 
probabilities of failing the safety guidelines for a range of conditions under which a given 
dose level would cause a high incidence of severe and life threatening SADRs to 
conditions under which severe SADRs would be rela tively rare and would not be life 
threatening.  For each of these hypothetical situations, we assume that the sample is 
drawn from the participant  population and that the safety guidelines for Cohort 1 (Section 
8.521), interim analysis for Cohort 2 (8.522)  and final analysis for Cohort 2 (Section 
8.523) are followed.

For example, Table 11 shows that for a sample of size 12, there is a 97% chance of 
failing the safety guidelines under conditions in which the true rate of life -threatening 
toxicity is 5% and the rate of non -life threatening SADR is 50%. Assuming that it would 
be undesirable t o accrue additional participant s at a dose that had these true rates of 
adverse events, the 3% chance of NOT failing  the safety guidelines would represent the 
probability of error.

8.71 Primary and Secondary Safety Analyses of the Primary Safety Endpoints  
 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of RAL through 6 weeks of  life, descriptive 
statistics will be calculated summarizing the safety data from study entry thr ough 6 
weeks of life from all safety  evaluable infants in the four study groups: (i) Cohort 1 
RAL-naïve, (ii) Cohort 1 RAL -exposed, (iii) Cohort 2 RAL -naïve, and (iv) Cohort 2 
RAL-exposed infants.  Overall summary statistics for the cohort will be provide d if the 
data suggests that there is no difference between RAL -naïve and RAL -exposed infants 
within that cohort.   The primary safety analysis will be the calculation of the point and 2 -
sided 90% confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper -Pearson exact meth od estimates of 
the proportion of infants meeting the primary toxicity endpoint of adverse event Grade 3 
or 4 severity or death. Secondary safety analyses will include point and 90% CI estimates 
of infants with a SADR of Grade 3 or 4 severity or death. Tab le 14 shows the precision 
with which confidence intervals around proportions of serious adverse events can be 
estimated, for  the 12 participant s in Cohort 1 and for the 8 and 20 participant s in the 
interim and final analyses for Cohort  2.

for raltegravir AUC.  
 
Similar descriptive analyses will also be performed to investigate the association of 
UGT1A1 (*28/*28) and SLCO1B3 (rs2117032 -C/T) with hyperbilirubinemia .  If the 
sample size and the data distributions make this possible, a logistic regression model 
predicting for probability of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with UGT1A1 (*28/*28)  
genotype, SLCO1B3 (rs2117032 -C/T) genotype, gestational age and gender as 
predictors will be fitted on the pooled data across the two cohorts.  Note that the 
sample size may be too small and/or there may be insufficient cases of 
hyperbilirubinemia to make this possible.  If this analysis can be done, it will have 
minimal power, but the size and directionality of effects will be compared with those 
predicted on the basis of previous findings.  
 
9.0 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y PLAN   
 
Protocol exposure limits from non -compartmental analysis for each participant  were Cmax ≤ 
8723.6 ng/mL and AUC12 ≤ 28 mg*h/L. A population PK model was developed incorporating 
cohort 1 PK data with RAL concentration data from 24 infants and children ages 4 weeks to < [ADDRESS_465058] P1066, a phase I/II, multicenter, open -label non-comparative 
intensive PK  treatment study of RAL in infants and children  [20]. Population modeling using 
PsN/3.7.6, NONMEM/7.3.0 and R/3.1.[ADDRESS_465059] met PK 
exposure targets (Ctrough, Cmax, AUC) defined for safety and efficacy from studies in older 
infants, children, and adults was selected for evaluation Cohort 2 infants (RAL -exposed and 
RAL- naïve).  
 
 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_465060] P1097 and P1066, a starting dose of 3 
mg/kg has been chosen, which is 25% of the total daily dose (6 mg/kg BID) currently under 
study in infants 4 weeks to <[ADDRESS_465061] P1066.  In Cohort 1 of the study, 
raltegravir will be administered as a single dose using 3 mg/kg of the oral granules for 
suspension within [ADDRESS_465062].  
 
The PK targets for Cohort 1 are:   
 
 RAL concentrations in each individual that do not exceed a C max of 19.[ADDRESS_465063] prophylaxis, Cohort 2 
will receive the following dosing regimen (refer to tables in Appendix III):  
 1.5 mg/kg once daily during Days 1 -7 of life (week 1)  
 3.0 mg/kg twice daily during Days 8 -28 of life (weeks 2 -4) 
 6.0 mg/kg twice daily during Days 29 -42 of life (weeks 5 -6)  
 
The PK target AUC will depend on whether the  drug is dosed once or twice daily.  The PK 
target GM trough i s the same for both once daily and twice daily dosing.  
 
The PK targets for Cohort 2 are target exposures for:   
 
 once-daily dosing of AUC24 of 28 -90 µMxhr (12 -40 mgxh/L) and an 
approximate GM trough (C24hr) > 75nM (33ng/mL)  
 twice-daily dosing of AUC12 of 14 -45 µMxhr (6 -20 mgxh/L) and an approximate 
GM trough (C12hr) > 75nM (33ng/mL)  
9.2 Primary and Secondary Data  
 
The primary data to be collected are plasma raltegravir concentrations for pharmacokinetic 
parameter estimation.  All PK samples will be registered in the Lab Data Management 
System (LDMS) database, and will be sent to the University  of Alabama (UAB) Laboratory.  
The study database will be kept up to date by [CONTACT_50808].  Intensive PK sample 
 
IMPAACT P1110 Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_465064] non -compartmental methods. Whole blood for determination of raltegravir in 
plasma will be collected according to cohort.  These sample collection times may change 
depending upon the ongoing analyses of the pharmacokinetic results.   
 
Cohort 1  
Pharmacokinetic sampling for infants in Cohort 1 include d the following:  
 
Dose 1 (within  48 hours of birth): Pre -dose, and [ADDRESS_465065]-dose, 12 
(±1) hours post-dose, and 24 (± 1) hours post-dose. 
 
Day 3-4 of life: One random PK sample will be obtained with laboratory evaluations.  
 
Dose 2 (7 -10 days of life): Pre -dose, and 1-[ADDRESS_465066]-dose and 24 (± 1) hours post-dose.  
 
*Note:  For the [ADDRESS_465067] blood 
samples within the window of ±1 hour for the accurate calculations of PK parameters of 
raltegravir.  However, in  the event that a sample collection in this window is not possible, the 
sample should be obtained within ±2 hours and this deviation from the sampling instructions 
should be recorded.  
 
Modeling and simulation will be utilized after the completion of each RAL-exposed or RAL - 
naïve group in Cohort 1 to generate a multiple dosing scheme for the respective group in 
Cohort 2.  Specifically, data may be integrated from P1110 Cohort 1, P1097, P1066 (Cohorts 
IV and V), P1026s, and adult oral granule data to construct a population PK model capable of 
describing the raltegravir pharmacokinetics of oral granules for suspension.  A two-
compartment model will be fit using NONMEM version VII software, where various 
population attribut es including, but not limited to, age, weight, sex and creatinine clearance 
will be examined to determine their influence on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir, 
including the absorption, bioavailability and clearance.  Both intensive and sparse PK data 
from the above mentioned studies in both adults and children will be utilized to maximize the 
available information on the oral granules formulation and provide a rich and diverse dataset 
with regards to patient population, which should enable characterizati on of the population PK 
and associated variability for the oral granules for suspension formulation.  By [CONTACT_371709]1A1 
ontogeny with age, the model can be used to simulat e an optimal dosing scheme (with dose 
and/or frequency adjustments at appropriate times, such as at Day 14 and Day 28) to meet the 
PK targets throughout the course of dosing  [76].

INTRODUCTION                                
 
You and your baby [CONTACT_371713] (HIV), the virus that 
causes AIDS and your baby [CONTACT_371714] . 
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681].  The doctor in charge of 
this study at thi s site is: ( insert name [CONTACT_789] ).  Before you decide if 
you want to be/want your baby [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a part of this study, we want you to know about 
the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study.  The study staff w ill 
talk with you about this information.  You are free to ask questions about this study at 
any time.  If you agree to be/allow your baby [CONTACT_371715], you will be asked to 
sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEI NG DONE?  
 
The purpose of this study is to find out if Raltegravir, an anti -HIV medicine, when 
given with other anti -HIV medicines, can help prevent infants from getting HIV.  
Raltegravir is a drug that has been used to treat infants and children with HIV.  
Raltegravir is not yet approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in 
children less than two year of age and its use in this study is experimental. We are 
trying to find out the best dose (amount) of Raltegravir to use to prevent babies from 
getting HIV infection.  Another purpose of this study is to look for possible bad 
effects of Raltegravir in ba bies such as more jaundice (yellow color to skin).  Another 
purpose of this study is to look at your baby’s DNA (genes) and to see how it breaks 
down the raltegravir.  Some people break down medicines differently based on their 
DNA and this can change the levels of the medicines in their bodies.  Information 
from this study will help us to find the right dose (amount) of Raltegravir to give to 
infants to prevent them from getting HIV infection.

Raltegravir is a drug that has been used to treat infants and children with HIV.  
Raltegravir is not yet approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in 
children less than [ADDRESS_465116] dose (amount) of Raltegravir to use to prevent babies from 
getting HIV infection.  Another purpose of this study is to look for possible bad 
effects of Raltegravir in babies such as more jaundice (yellow color to skin).  Another 
purpose of this study is to look at your baby’s DNA (genes) and to see how it breaks 
down the raltegravir.  Some people break down medicines differently based on their 
DNA and this can change the levels of the medicines in their bodies.  Information 
from this st udy will help us to find the right dose (amount) of  Raltegravir to give to 
infants to prevent them from getting HIV infection.

 PROTOCOL TITLE: Sensory Stimulation during Constraint- Induced Movement Therapy  
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_137514] , PhD  
 
1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims  
 
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_294330], named TheraBracelet,  in enhancing outcomes of 
constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). 
TheraBracelet is peripheral sensory stimulation involving application of low- level  
(imperceptible) , random -frequency vibration to the wrist skin. The hypothesis  is that 
improvement in upper extremity  function will be greater for the experimental  group receiving the 
TheraBracelet stimulation during CIMT  compared with the control group who will wear the 
device with no vibration (placebo). 
  2.[ADDRESS_358418] effective treatment approaches for children with unilateral 
motor weakness or hemiparesis, regardless of the neuromotor impairment’s etiology (Ramey et 
al. 2013). CIMT involves applying a hand splint and mitt on the stronger, unaffected upper extremity a hand splint and mitt on the stronger upper extremity  to encourage use of the affected 
upper limb in intensive therapy.  Research evidence supports the use of intensive therapy models, such as CIMT, to improve overall function in adults and children with one-sided motor weakness or a hemiparesis (Taub et al. 2007 & 2004, Eliasson et al. 2005, Brady and Garcia 2009, Case-Smith et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2009, Coker et al. 2009, DeLuca et al. 2003, 2007, 2012a,b, Nelles 2004, Sakzewski et al. 2009, Al-Oraibi and Eliasson 2011, Barry  2001, Bower and McClellan 2004).  
 
Patty Coker -Bolt, PhD, OTR, FAOTA co -developed and currently hold a yearly one- week 
modified pediatric CIMT camp at MUSC which has provided an intensive CIMT therapy program for over 200 children ( approximately 3 to 9 years of age) with hemiplegic CP since 
[ADDRESS_358419] demonstrated significant improvements in overall self-care, upper extremity function and mobility skills (Coker et al 2010, Ramey et al 2013).    
3.[ADDRESS_358420] the cortical sensorimotor activity during concurrent upper extremity 
activities, with an intent to increase outcomes of therapy. Unlike existing methods including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulati on, muscle/tendon vibration, and repetitive transcranial 
  Version # 3,  July 2 4, 2018  
 
   
 magnetic stimulation that require prior exposure to the sensory stimulation as long as 2 hours 
before each therapy session, TheraBracelet can immediately and continuously prime the central sensorimotor system based on preliminary data using neuroimaging (in preparation), and enhance hand motor scores (as measured by [CONTACT_294338]) (Seo et al. 2014) and finger sensory scores (as measured by [CONTACT_294339] -Weinstein Monofilament Test) 
(Enders et al. 2013) in adult stroke survivors while TheraBracelet was on. TheraBracelet stimulation is given to the wrist so that the entire hand is exposed to receive relevant sensory information and appropriately manipulate objects. Wearable wrist devices with a vibrating function are low cost and can be easily adopted for rehabilitation purposes to impact a wide range of patients with sensorimotor impairment. TheraBracelet has been used concurrently 
during 2-week therapy in adults with stroke and resulted in significantly greater improvement in the hand dexterity score compared to dose- matched therapy with no TheraBracelet, in the PI’s 
previous study (in review).  
Device: TheraBracelet stimulation is provided by a vibrator connected to an MP3- playing watch 
via an audio jack (see the pi[INVESTIGATOR_294331]; total weight 40g, watch=3.7cm×5.3cm) . No external 
power source is needed, since t he MP3 player drives the vibrator with its internal battery. Both 
the vibrator and watch are off -the-shelf products (i.e. available to purchase for anyone). The 
MP3 player/watch is charged using a conventional phone charger. The MP3 player can play any file including the treatment vibration file with white noise vibratory signal and control file with zero amplitude (i.e. no vibration). The treatment vibration will be scaled to a level that is 40% below the sensory threshold for healthy adults without neurologic disorders, neuropathy, or compromised skin (i.e., the treatment vibration is imperceptible to healthy  adults). The rationale 
for the subthreshold intensity is that our previous studies with TheraBracelet showed that this level of imperceptible vibration intensity improved finger sensation more than suprathreshold (i.e., perceptible) vibra tion in healthy adults as well as adult stroke survivors. Adults’ sensory 
threshold will be used, as children could not reliably respond regarding their perception of barely noticeable or unnoticeable vibration.  
 
      
 
FDA : The use of the vibrator for this proposed purpose of affecting the cortical sensorimotor 
activity during therapy  with an intent to increase therapy outcomes has not been approved by [CONTACT_1556]. The vibrator is a general -purpose vibrator, not specifically designed for any particular 
purpose.  
 
Safety : Currently there is no vibration exposure guideline for this small level of vibration ( at 
40% below the sensory threshold). People are exposed to higher- intensity, suprathreshold

 vibration daily (e.g. from a phone, riding a car). Truck drivers who get exposed to whole-body 
vibration are limited to driving 11 hours after 10 consecutive hours off duty, according to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. TheraBracelet has been u sed during 2- week therapy (2 
hours/session, 3 sessions/week for 2 weeks) in adults with stroke and resulted in significantly greater improvement in the hand dexterity score compared to dose-matched therapy with no TheraBracelet, without adverse events (i.e., no skin irritation, no numbness) in the PI’s previous study (in review). In the PI’s current study, TheraBracelet is being used all day (during waking hours), everyday, for a month, in adult stroke survivors, without a safety concern thus far. TheraBracelet has not been used in children, although high-level (i.e. perceivable) vibration has been used in children with CP to treat spasticity and motor function (Katusic et al. 2013).   
Control/placebo: No vibration will be the control condition. The MP3 player will play a zero-
amplitude file, producing no vibration.  
 
4.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria / Study Population  
 
Children will be  between the ages of [ADDRESS_358421] no other health impairment other than hemiparesis.  No 
inclusion or exclusion criteria will be based on race or gender.   
 
5.0 Number of Subjects  
 Total Planned Enrollment: 20  
6.0 Setting  
 
Site: Laboratories of the College of Health Professions, 151A Rutledge Ave., Charleston SC 
The camp will be directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Coker- Bolt who is a licensed occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294332] a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294333].  The camp counselors will be occupational 
and physical therapy students enrolled in programs at the Medical University of South Carolina.  This will allow each camper to have [ADDRESS_358422] 
experience working with children.    
7.0 Recruitment Methods  
 
Participants for this study will be recruited children who attend the yearly camp CIMT program. Parents/guardians of all children who will attend the CIMT program will be informed of the study. The CIMT is an ongoing yearly camp.   
8.0 Consent Process 
 
  Version # 3,  July 2 4, 2018  
 
   
 Study personnel will obtain the informed consent of the parent, parent/guardian, or guardian of 
each chi ld participating in the study. In a private setting, the content of the consent will be 
verbally explained and the parent/guardian will be asked to raise any questions and concerns. If 
the person requests a waiting period, then one will be given. If the person desires to consent immediately, then the person will provide consent immediately.  
 9.0 Study Design / Methods  
 
Study design : The study will be  a double-blinded  stratified randomized controlled trial. 
Consented children will be stratified in terms of their functional levels  (based on MACS). Within 
each functional level, children will be randomly assigned to either the experimental  or control 
group, in a balanced manner (half the children assigned to one group, and the other half assigned 
to the other group). All consented children will receive CIMT 6 hours/day, 5 consecutive days for 1 week. This duration of CIMT resulted in significant improvement in capacity and quality of affected upper limb functioning (Coker et al 2010, Ramey et al 2013, Coker-Bolt et al 2017). All consented children will wear the TheraBracelet device during CIMT.  The device will provide 
treatment vibration to the experimental group and no vibration to the control group.  
 
Blinding : A custom MATLAB program will perform group assignment and produce a treatment 
vibration or zero vibration file depending on the group assignment for each child. The produced vibration file will be uploaded to the TheraBracelet device for each child , and used throughout 
CIMT. The treatment vibration is imperceptible to healthy adults. Therefore, all personnel 
involved in CIMT will be blinded to the group assignment. It is anticipated that children who 
receive treatment vibration would not perceive the vibration from the TheraBracelet device. In an 
unanticipated case where  a child indicates t hat s/he perceives vibration  any time during CIMT , 
the vibr ation intensity will be lowered immediately .  
 
Pediatric CIMT protocol :  1) The soft mitt will be worn on the child’s stronger, less affected 
upper extremity during CIMT . 2) The child will be engaged fun, playful camp- based activities to 
encourage repetitive practice with the weaker limb and shapi[INVESTIGATOR_294334].  These play activities will be implemented by [CONTACT_294340] [INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 3) Tasks such as 
reaching, graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and manipulation of objects, weight-bearing, and making hand gestures with the weaker limb will be encouraged during play activities. 4) When the children demonstrate new motor movements, students and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294335].  
 
Outcome Measures:  Experimental and control groups will be compared for post- therapy changes 
in the upper limb functioning. The upper limb functioning in daily living will be measured by 
[CONTACT_294341]’s questionnaire  assessment s  before and after therapy.  The 
quality and quantity of upper limb movements will be measured by [CONTACT_294342], and the Box and Block  and Nine -Hole Peg T ests, respectively . 
Additionally, goal attainment s caling  will be used to measure achievements  of goals  after CIMT. 
Lastly, we will measure  the wear time of the device and the child pain level at  each  CIMT  day.

10.0 Data Management 
 
Confidentiality protection: The data from test results will be de -identified once it has been 
collected and before it is stored. This means individual results would not be able to be linked to 
the participant by [CONTACT_247349]. The linkage between participant codes and identities as well as all other identifiable information including consent forms will be stored in a locked room and be accessible only to the study personnel. 
 
Analysis : Repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc comparisons will be used to determine if 
each clinical hand function score improves more for the experimental compared with the control group. A significant interaction between time (pre/post) and group (experimental/control) will support the hypothesis that improvement of upper limb function will be greater with the low -
level vibration stimulation.  
 
Sample size determination : This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_97576] a convenience sample of children who will 
attend the summer CIMT camp program at MUSC.  
 
Data sharing : Only de-identified coded data will be reported and/or shared with the public in 
publications, in ClinicalTrials.gov, or upon written request.  
 11.[ADDRESS_358423] (DSMB) : The primary purpose of the DSMB is to ensure the 
safety of participants and the validity and integrity of data collected during the study. By [CONTACT_247350], safety concerns will be assessed and addressed objectively. If the intervention 
definitively has safety concerns, the DSMB may make recommend ations to address the safety 
concerns.   
 The DSMB will be composed of (1) a board certified physician with expertise in neurologic disorders, (2) a registered and licensed occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294336], and (3) a biostatistician with expertise in design and analysis of clinical trials.  
 The responsibilities of the DSMB are as follows. Prior to enrollment, the DSMB will review the study design, protocol, recruitment/enrollment plan, statistical analysis plan, and data safety monitoring plan, and document the agreement or recommendation. Af ter enrollment begins and 
the CIMT camp is provided, the DSMB will convene again  to review the safety data, enrollment 
data including any discontinuation of participation in the study with or without adverse events, and study results . Safety data will incl ude emergence of  skin irritation, increase in muscle tone, 
reduction in the number of functional tasks completed by [CONTACT_7683], worsening in the quality of motor movements in children, and any other adverse events noted by [CONTACT_294343]/or licensed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], regardless of whether it is r elated to the device use or not.  The DSMB will 
review the aggregated summary data as well as the individual participants’ data (de -identified). 
The DSMB will have access to coded (de- identified) data but not identifia ble data. The group 
  Version # 3,  July 2 4, 2018  
 
   
 assignment information will become available upon completion of the data collection. The 
DSMB will provide recommendations for adverse events and safety concerns. The DSMB will also provide a report to the IRB to summarize oversight activities, recommendations, and any concerns regarding participant safety.    
Reporting : All safety data including adverse events will be reported to the DSMB  and IRB. 
Summative data will be reported in ClinicalTrials.gov and in publications. Following the guidelines, we will register this study in ClinicalTrials.gov as soon as the study commences (at the latest within [ADDRESS_358424] participant is enrolle d) and report results including all 
adverse events as soon as the study is completed (at the latest within  12 months of the trial’s 
primary completion date). To protect participants’ confidentiality, personally identifiable information will not be used for reporting. Only de-identified or aggregated data will be used for reporting.  
 
Endpoint : Participants will be assured of their right to discontinue their participation in the study 
at any time. In addition, [CONTACT_47268]- Bolt may recommend discontinuation of participation if 
his/her adverse event is deemed to warrant discontinuation, without breaking the double-blinding.  
 12.0Risks to Subjects  
 
• Confidentiality: There is a risk for loss of confidentiality.  
• Injury: There is a risk for injury during engagement in play activities involved in therapy 
interventions. Although therapy interventions used in the pediatric CIMT involve those play 
activities that a child would normally engage in during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_5707], children are at risk for 
injury during play and daily activities. There is a risk of physical and mental fatigue from 
engaging in the CIMT. 
• Mitt restraint: There is a risk of skin breakdown or irritation from the soft mitt restraint and  
stiffness in the less involved limb being constr ained . The children could become frustrated or 
anxious from having their stronger hand restrained for several hours a day. 
• Randomization: The treatment a person receives may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study treat ment or other available treatments.  
• Watch/Vibration: There is a minor risk of skin irritation from wearing the wristband and/or 
from vibration. There is a minor risk of discomfort in moving the arm/hand due to the weight of the device on the wrist, although the device weighs only 40g. Potential risks that may be associated with prolonged use of wrist vibration, including irritation , muscle tones, reduction 
in the number of functional tasks completed by [CONTACT_7683], and worsening in the quality of motor movements in children will be noted during each day of CIMT, and formally assessed 
during pre/post assessments.  
• There is also a risk of unexpected medical emergencies.  
  
13.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects or Others   
 
There may be no benefit from participating in this study. The potential benefit is that the vibration the person receives may help their upper extremity functional recovery, although this 
  Version # 3,  July [ADDRESS_358425] is important to increase functional recovery of children with CP and may benefit 
those with CP in general. The risks are deemed reasonable in relation to the potential gain of knowledge regarding TheraBracelet’s fe asibility, safety, and efficacy in potentially enhancing 
upper extremity function.   
14.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
 
The results of the standardized tests will be shared with each child’s parent/guardian .

Intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_690975]: determining the optimal dose  
  
 2  
 
Background and Significance  
Intrathecal (IT) opi[INVESTIGATOR_690976] a safe and efficacious modality to treat postoperative pain .1–[ADDRESS_937369] incorpora ted intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_690977] ( ERAS ) 
pathways.1,2 
 
While m orphine has traditionally been considered the “gold standard” in IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_690978], 
hydromorphone has been gaining popularity as an alternative .11 The doses ranging between 0.005  mg to 0.25 mg for 
hydromorphone12–15 and 0.05 mg  to 0.625 mg (with doses as high as 10 mcg/kg in the setting of cardiac surgery)  for 
morphine11,[ADDRESS_937370] , the incidence of nausea with IT morphine has been reported to be 33%.[ADDRESS_937371] where 
interactions with opi[INVESTIGATOR_690979]. Some studies  (performed in the women undergoing cesarean delivery ) have  
also found that hydromorphone causes less nausea and pruritus than morphine18, while others have n ot.14,19,[ADDRESS_937372] previously  performed a do se-finding study of IT 
hydromorphone and morphine in women undergoing cesarean delivery .14 Briefly, 80 parturients  scheduled for elective 
cesarean delivery  were randomized to receive IT morphine or IT hydromorphone at a dose determined using up –down 
sequential allocation with a biased -coin design to determine ED 90, which was found to be [ADDRESS_937373] previously used in the obstetric population to the patients undergoing 
colorectal resection and aims to identify the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone and morphine that provides good pain 
relief without causing sig nificant side effects.  Secondarily, we will compare each drug at its optimal dose in terms of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_663996]. Based on our prior finding s, we hypothesize that the optimal dose of intrathecal 
 3 hydromorphone will be 75 mcg and the optimal  dose of intrathecal morphine will be 150 mcg. Additionally, we 
hypothesize that exploratory findings comparing the two drugs at their optimal doses will show no difference in the 
incidence of adverse effects .  
 
Specific Aims  
Specific Aim 1: To determine t he dose of IT hydromorphone  that optimizes pain reduction after colorectal 
surgery . 
 
Specific Aim 2: To determine the dose of IT morphine that optimizes pain reduction after elective colorectal  
surgery . 
 
Specific Aim 3 : To preliminarily compare the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone to the optimal dose of IT 
morphine  for elective colorectal surgery  in terms of pain reduction , side effects, and quality of recovery 
scoring . 
 
Study Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that the optimal dose of IT hydromor phone will be [ADDRESS_937374] protocol to IT morphine . 
 
Methods  
Design:  Single Center, Double -blinded, Randomized  control trial  
 
Subject Selection  
To qualify for the study, subjects must meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
 
Inclusion  criteria : 
1. Adult  patients  with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physiological status I -III 
2. Undergoing colorectal  minimally invasive surgery  (MIS)  
3. Age between  18 and 75 years of age   
4. Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 40 
5. Ability to understand and read English  
 
Exclusion  criteria : 
1. Not able or unwilling to sign consent   
2. Patients undergoing ileostomy closure  
3. Patients undergoing ambulatory surgery or anticipated to be discharged sooner than 24 hours after surgery  
 4 4. Patients with chronic pain, requiring daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_690980]  
5. Patient intolerant or allergic to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], NSAIDs, or acetaminophen  
6. Patients requiring emergent surgery  
7. Any contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia (coagulopathy, localized infection at the site of injection, pre -existing 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_690981], or peripheral neuropathy)  
8. Any patients currently receiving any anticoagulation medication other than aspi[INVESTIGATOR_690982]22, and/or an abnormal INR  
9. Patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency in as much as the patient is not a candidate for acetaminophen or 
NSAIDs, respectively  
 
All efforts will be made to enroll participants regardless of ethnic heritage , race, or gender .  No passive recruitment 
methods (newspapers, advertisements, or flyers) will be used.  
 
Subject Enrollment  
Patients will be identified from the preoperative surgical listing schedule. Recruitment will ideally occur at the 
patient’s last clinical visit prior to surgery. If not feasible, the patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
contact[CONTACT_426] p hone prior to scheduled surgery to review the study , have their questions answered while having the 
opportunity to think about the participation and discuss it with their family and friends . Only physician study personnel 
(HPS, AWA, JP, EES, JKP, DAO, AND , and JP ) will approach potential subjects for recruitment. If patients express 
interest in participation, they will be approached again in the morning of the surgery, the consent form will be 
reviewed in detail with them, they will then have  their final questions answered  prior to signing the consent form . 
 
A total of [ADDRESS_937375] technique for administration of spi[INVESTIGATOR_690983]. The randomization 
process will occur through the use of a computer -generated  randomization scheme with allocation concealment in 
numbered opaque envelopes carried out  by a blinded observer.  Doses of IT hydromorphone and morphine will be 
selected according to a sequential  up-and-down method, using a biased coin design to find the estimated dose at which 
90% of patients would have desired  pain control while minimizing side effects  (ED 90). Given the sequent ial up -and-
down design, the dose of the next patient will be based on “success” or “failure” of the prior patient. For that reason, if 
a patient withdraws from a study prematurely (i.e., before the primary outcome can be collected), the same dose will 
be repeated in the next patient. To account for the potential withdrawal s/attrition , we plan to accrue a maximum of 85 
patients. We anticipate that up to 120 patients will be screened to achieve th e accrual goal .  
 
Study Procedures  
IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_690984], a n anesthesia provider  not involved  in patient care or assessment will 
prepare the opi[INVESTIGATOR_690985]. The dose of IT morphine or hydromorphone will be determined by [CONTACT_1629] 
 5 up-and-down method utilizing a biased coin design. The initial starting dose of IT hydromorphone will be 50 
micrograms. The initial starting dose of IT morphine will be 1 00 micrograms. The dose will be ad justed in subsequent 
patients as determined by [CONTACT_691008] (or failure) in providing good pain control , with success defined as numerical 
rating scale  (NRS )  4 or less  with movement at  12 hours   and not requiring substantial doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ( ≤ 15 oral 
morphine equivalents (OME ) within first 12 hours after IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_690986] ). NRS with movement will be elicited  by [CONTACT_691009], as described by 
[CONTACT_470905].[ADDRESS_937376] and follow at the same analgesic dosing.  
 
We are attempting to find the ED 90 dose of IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], which would correspond to 90% of patients obtaining “good” 
analgesia. When ED 90 is to be determined ( ʈ=0.9); the probability B = (1 -ʈ)/ʈ = (1-0.9)/0.9 = 0.1/0.9 ≈ 0.11. If no 
positive response is encountered, the dose is stepped up for the next pa tient. When a success is encountered, the next 
patient is randomized with probability B ≈ 0.11 to the next lower dose and with probability 1 - B = 0.89 to the same 
dose.  
 
Doses for intrathecal hydromorphone are as follows (in micrograms):  
10 - 25 - 50 (starting dose) - 75 - 100 - 125 - 150 - 175 - 200 
 
Doses for intrathecal morphine are as follows (in micrograms):  
25 - 50 - 100 (starting dose)  - 150 - 200 - 250 - 300 – 350 - 400 
 
Definition of success:  
1) NRS ≤4 at 12 hours  after IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_690987]  
2) Analgesic requirement ≤15 OME within  12 hours  after IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]  (excluding intravenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_690988] -anesthesia 
care unit, PACU)  
Definition of failure:  
1) NRS  score of   > 4 at 12 hours  after IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_690989] 
2) Analgesic requirement of  >15 OME within  12 hours after IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499] (excluding intravenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_690990])  
 
 6 The maximum dose of IT hydromorphone and morphine will be 2 00 micrograms and 400 micrograms, respectively. 
All patients will receive some amount of IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (minimum 10 micrograms and 25 micrograms, respectively).  
 
Preoperative care  
Preoperatively, patients will be sedated, under the discretion of the anesthesiologist, with intravenous midazolam (1 -2 
mg) and fentanyl (50 -100 mcg) for alleviation of anxiety and pain.  Additional sedatives will be given at the discretion 
of the anesthes ia team. The spi[INVESTIGATOR_690991] L3 -[ADDRESS_937377] of either morphine or hydromorphone according to study protocol and 
randomization. Normal saline will  be used to dilute the total volume to 2 mL. Time of spi[INVESTIGATOR_671871] “0”. Strict aseptic techniques, as in current clinical practice, will be utilized throughout each procedure; these 
include the anesthesiologists using hat, mask and  sterile gloves during spi[INVESTIGATOR_100126] .  
 
Intraoperative care  
Following the spi[INVESTIGATOR_100126], a ll patients will undergo general endotracheal anesthesia. All patients will receive a 
standard perioperative analgesi c and antiemetic regimen (Figure 1). Additi onal intraoperative intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_690992] . 
 
Postoperative care  
Postoperatively, all patients will follow standardized multimodal analgesia pathway (Figure 1) . Additional analgesic 
treatment will be given at the discretion of the care team. All patients will be monitored per institutional guidelines for 
administration of  IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_690993] 24 hours after administration .

QoR 15 is a multidimensional, valid, reliable, responsive, and easy -to-use method of measuring quality in patients’ 
postoperative recovery, will be used as the secondary outcome measure.25  Similarly, OBAS  is a validated measure 
incorporating both effectiveness of pain control and unwanted effects related to analgesic treatment.26. Grading of 
nausea and pruritus (none, mild, moderate, severe) will be defined by [CONTACT_78037]’s perception of severity.  
 
In addition, t he following  data will be collected from patient electronic  medical  records:  
1) Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_57288] 12 and 24  hours of IT opi[INVESTIGATOR_69274]

Early end points:  
1) Change patient’s  health mandating the use  of other anesthetic techniques  
2) Inability to perform the spi[INVESTIGATOR_671877]    
3) Withdrawal of subject consent at any  time 
4) Surgical complications resulting in the need for additional surgical procedures  
 
Subject Costs:  
There will be no additional costs to the patient as a result of participation in this study.  The costs of routine 
perioperative analgesia and anesthetic  care will be the responsibility of the patient and their insurance provider.   
 
Statistical Analysis  
NRS  scores, nausea, and pruritus  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_141611]. Patient  demographics will be 
tested by [CONTACT_134245] (continuous data) or chi -square (categorical data) as appropriate.  Statistical significance will be 
assumed when P <0.05.  The primary analyses will be performed according to an intention -to-treat principle and will 
include data from all randomized subjects.  Compliance with trial procedures, dropouts, and reasons for subject 
withdrawal will be tracked throughout the study.  For subjects who are withdrawn, the last observed values will be 
utilized. Adverse events will be tabulated , with severity and resultant treatment recorded.  For each adverse event, the 
treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s exact test.   
 
Risks and Discomforts  
As this is a dose -finding study, it is possible that medication doses of intrathecal hydromorphone and morphine that are 
less (or more)  than what is commonly used in clinical practice may be used. However, any and every pati ent who 
experiences postsurgical  pain will be treated with standard analgesic medications titrated to patient comfort, regardless 
of type and amount of intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_388474].  
 
Approximately 10-40% of the time, nausea may occur.  If nausea occurs, it will be treated and managed according  to 
usual measures. Approximately 10-40% of the time, pruritus may occur.  If pruritus occurs, it will be treated and 
managed according to usual measures . 
 
The risk of a post dural puncture headache (PDPH) exists for spi[INVESTIGATOR_671879].  The risk is <1% in non -obstetric 
population  and will not be increased by [CONTACT_691010] .  If a PDPH occur s, various methods 
are available for treatmen t and will be discussed with the patient.  
 9  
Rare (less than 0.1 %) but possible sequelae include infection, epi[INVESTIGATOR_671880], and nerve injury. The use 
of the study medications will not increase these risks.  
 
Potential Benefits  
Patients may exper ience improved pain control with fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277]. The information from this study 
may benefit other patients undergoing colorectal surgery . 
 
Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
Assurance of safety and tolerability:  
Following continuous care during surgery, all patients  will have a scheduled visit at 12 hours  after intrathecal  injection 
to evaluate the efficacy of analgesia. As noted, numerical rating scale  (NRS ) pain scores, satisfaction, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_690998] a blinded observer who will be able to immediately notify a  physician investigator if 
problems or concerns are noted. Unscheduled interventions for alterations in patient condition will be dictated by [CONTACT_691011] , nursing, and anesthetic providers in care of the patient; appropriate treatments will be at the discretion of the 
treating provider.  All scheduled and unscheduled interventions will be recorded.  Due to the short duration o f this 
study, there are no plans for interim analyses; however, should it appear to any investigator or surgical , nursing or 
other anesthetic provider that adverse events or treatment failures are occurring;  such an analysis will be conducted. A 
patient ma y withdraw from the study at any time . 
 
Serious Adverse Experiences:  
Any serious or unexpected adverse experiences (AE), whether or not considered to be related to the study, shall be 
reported immediately to the Research Compliance Office at Mayo Clinic , followed by a letter summarizing the  event 
within [ADDRESS_937381] recruitment and will review any AE encountered in each patien t, with emphasis placed 
on known AE related to acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211] , namely respi[INVESTIGATOR_199724] .  
 
All adverse experiences will be recorded and evaluated for causality with the techniques used in this study.  The 
method of causality will b e determined by [CONTACT_691012], but not limited to:  A reasonable temporal relationship between the AE and the techniques, an AE 
that is not a common, expected sequelae of the techni ques, an AE that cannot be adequately explained by [CONTACT_691013].

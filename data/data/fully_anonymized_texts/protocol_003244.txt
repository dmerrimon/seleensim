Section C: Background Information
Obesity in children as in adults has rapi[INVESTIGATOR_342448] a public health concern. In the state of [LOCATION_007], the
incidence of childhood obesity is higher than the national average at 20-23% in 4th to 8th graders, with a
more marked increase in the minority ethnic groups. The population of obese children presenting for surgery
at [LOCATION_007] Children's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539536] a recent study showing that 21% of children
presenting to the operating room meet the criteria for obesity. Obesity, as defined by [CONTACT_539541] a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 95th percentile. The anesthetic management of
obese children poses a variety of significant challenges. These include difficulty with placement of a breathing
tube for delivery of anesthesia gases, body positioning to avoid nerve injury and determination of the
appropriate dose of anesthetic intravenous agents. It is a common practice to administer anesthetic drugsPage 2of9 Human Protocol Report
9/1/2020 https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=[ADDRESS_703203] anesthetic agents is based on the ED 50 or
effective dose in 50% of patients, however, as anesthesiologists, ideal situations are those in which
unconsciousness is induced in majority or 95 % of patients. Anecdotally, it appears more intravenous
medicines are required in obese patients to induce unconsciousness. This study would determine what the
ED95 of propofol is in obese and non-obese children.
Section D: Purpose and Objectives
This is a study to test the hypothesis that the dose of propofol (a highly lipophilic sedative hypnotic drug )
required for induction of anesthesia will be different in obese children compared to non-obese children.

Section F: Design/Procedure
F1. Design
Select one category that most adequately describes your research:
z.z) ARCHIVED DO NOT USE - Other
Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probability of group assignment,
potential for subject to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.
This study will include patients who require general anesthesia with propofol for procedures at [LOCATION_007]
Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The patients will be assigned to groups based on their body mass index (BMI). All
patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Measurements of body weight and height, which are
part of admission vital signs, will be made at the time of patient pre-anesthetic assessment. Patients will be
assigned to groups based on their body mass index (BMI). Group A: BMI between 25th and 84th percentile
for age(non-obese or healthy weight) and Group B: BMI greater than 95th percentile for age (obese). This
study will involve two studies in one. The effective dose of propofol in 95% of non-obese children and 95% of
obese children will be determined. Pre determined sequential doses of propofol to be administered are: 1.0
mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 1.75 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg; 2.25 mg/kg; 2.5 mg/kg; 2.75 mg/kg; 3.0 mg/kg; 3.25
mg/kg; 3.5 mg/kg; 4.0 mg/kg and 4.25mg/kg. The recommended dose range for propofol is 2.5-3.5 mg/kg.
The lower doses of 1 or 1.25 mg/kg may insufficiently induce unconsciousness within the specified time but if
this occurs, additional medication will be given till a satisfactory level of unconsciousness is attained.The
doses of 4.0 and 4.25 mg/kg are beyond the recommended dose range for propofol in children however the
purpose of administering propofol is to induce unconsciousness in order for procedures to proceed and the
patients will only receive these doses if a satisfactory level of unconsciousness is not achieved with the
preceding doses within the expected period. The first patient in each study group will receive the same
initial/lowest dose of propofol from the listed doses; the response to this dose of propofol would be deemed
positive if there is loss of lash reflex within 20 seconds of administering the dose and negative if there is no
response (no loss of lash reflex within 20 seconds). The subsequent patient would receive the next
appropriate dose of propofol based on the biased coin design method of sequential dosing ( Stylianou M,
Flournoy N: Dose finding using the biased coin up-and-down design and isotonic regression. Biometrics 2002;
58:171-7). If patient #1 falls asleep with a given dose of propofol, then patient #2 is randomized to receive
either a lower dose with a probability of 0.05 OR the same dose with a probability of 0.95. If patient #1 does
not fall asleep with a given dose of propofol, then patient #2 will automatically receive the next higher dose of
propofol. In situations where the patient does not lose the lash reflex after 20 seconds, the patient would be
documented as having a negative response to the assigned dose of propofol and will be given additional
propofol till an adequate level of unconsciousness that will allow the procedure to be performed is achieved.
Inclusion Criteria:
The subject population will include patients between ages 3 -18 years of age presenting for surgery at [LOCATION_007]
Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539537]:
The following patients will be excluded from the study: 1.Patients classified as ASA (American Society of
Anesthesiology) Class 3 or greater. 2.Patients with documented kidney or liver disease or those presenting
for open surgery on the liver or kidney. 3.Patients who will NOT be receiving propofol for induction as part of
their anesthetic regimen. 4.Patients who are currently on anti-convulsant medication or receiving drugs with
sedative effects. 5. Patients currently being treated for attention deficit disorder. 6. Patients who arePage 4of9 Human Protocol Report
9/1/2020 https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=[ADDRESS_703205] others. Once the patient meets study criteria, consent will be
obtained (and assent in children aged 12 years and above) and the body mass index (BMI) will be calculated
from the body weight and height. The patients will be classified at that time into Group A (BMI between 25th
and 84th percentile) OR Group B (BMI greater than 95th percentile). An intravenous catheter will
subsequently be placed in the hand and the patients will proceed to the procedure area. On arrival there,
routine ASA monitors including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitors will be placed and lastly, a
Bispectral index monitor (BIS monitor) will be placed on the patients¿ forehead. The Bispectral index monitor
(BIS) monitor is a monitor that gives a dimensionless empi[INVESTIGATOR_539538], the BIS value, which correlates with the
depth of anesthesia. The BIS value, which ranges from [ADDRESS_703206] suggested that titrating anesthetics to keep the BIS value between 40 and 60 will provide the
optimal depth of anesthesia. There is some preliminary data that suggests that routine monitoring of the BIS
level may decrease the incidence of intra-operative awareness in adults considered to be at high risk for this
complication e.g. adults on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. There is limited data on the usefulness of this monitor in
children however it is a harmless tool and the information gathered from it (BIS value at time of loss of lash
reflex) would be examined retrospectively to see if there is correlation between this value and loss of lash
reflex. In addition, your child will be given a syringe full of water to hold tightly in their hand as they fall asleep,
the time it takes for their hand grip to weaken, causing the syringe to drop from their hands after receiving
propofol will also be noted. These end points: loss of lash reflex and time to weakening of handgrip has been
used in previous propofol studies. Obese patients with a body mass index greater than 99% will receive three
big breaths of oxygen prior to the beginning of the study in order to compensate for the desaturation that may
occur if apnea results from their study dose of propofol. Once monitors have been placed on the patient,
intravenous lidocaine 1mg/kg ( to a maximum of 60 mg) will be administered prior to the assigned dose of
propofol. This is in order to decrease the mild to moderate burning sensation experienced on administration of
propofol. The lidocaine would be immediately followed by [CONTACT_539542] a stopcock with
0.[ADDRESS_703207], to ensure an adequate level of sedation. The next
subsequent patient in this group will then receive the next higher dose of propofol according to the previously
stated dosing interval regimen. If there is loss of lash reflex at 20 seconds, the next patient would be
randomized to receive either the next lower dose or the same dose administered to the previous patient.
Section G: Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1. Sample Size
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?
Local: 85 Worldwide: 85
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
The up and down study design is characterized by [CONTACT_105]-independence of data and an unknown distribution,
which preclude the development of rules to calculate a sample size for determination of the effective dose of a
drug in a certain percentage of patients. As a result, statistical simulations have suggested that approximately
20-[ADDRESS_703208] cases. 40 patients will be
evaluated in Group A and 40 in Group B.
G2. Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of
means, comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMARY
comparison/analysis? How will the analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
Data will be analyzed with the use of the isotonic regression estimator with confidence intervals derived by
[CONTACT_63676][INVESTIGATOR_539539]95 of propofol in obese patients. Isotonic regression is a general technique
for estimating quantities that are assumed to be non-increasing. This method produces estimates of the
probability of toxicity (or estimates of the probability of a positive response in this case) for each dose level,Page 5of9 Human Protocol Report
9/1/2020 https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=251983
under the assumption that the dose response function is not decreasing i.e. the higher the dose level the
higher the probability of response.
Section H: Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess
the likelihood and seriousness of such risks:
Propofol is a widely used sedative hypnotic agent in both children and adults. Administration of propofol may
result in a 30% decrease in the blood pressure. This is usually resolved with administration of fluids being
infused during surgery routinely. There is minimal risk to taking part in this study, as patients enrolled will be
those that would receive propofol regardless of their participation in the study. A potential risk is that your
child does not fall asleep (does not stop blinking when the eyelashes are gently touched) with his/her
assigned dose of propofol. If this happens, your child would be noted to have a negative response to the
given dose of propofol and more propofol would be given to make sure that he/she is in an adequate state of
deep sleep (anesthesia) before proceeding with their procedure. Another risk maybe that your child receives a
dose of propofol that may cause a decrease in the blood pressure. This is commonly seen when children
receive medicine to fall asleep for procedures. The blood pressure usually returns to normal within a few
minutes. If not, fluids or additional medicines are given to bring the blood pressure back to normal levels. An
additional potential discomfort to receiving propofol involves a mild burning sensation, which sometimes
occurs on injection. Precautions will be taken to decrease this discomfort by [CONTACT_539543].
Section I: Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned
work.
There is no direct benefit to the patient for participating in this study.
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
This study will allow a better understanding of the response of obese children to this lipophilic, sedative
-hypnotic agent and would allow for proper dose adjustment which will in return, lead to improved care for this
increasing segment of our population.
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
Anticipated benefits of this study long term do outweigh the potential risks. The only potential risk to patients
is loss of confidentiality. The possible benefits to society are greater than potential risks of this study.
Therefore the risk-to-benefit ratio is favorable for this study.

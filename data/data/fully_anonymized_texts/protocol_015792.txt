Study P rocedur es: IntheDose Adjust mentPhase, alleligible subjectswillreceive
daltepa rin sodium subcutaneously every  12hours ±1hour (no less 
than 8 hours between doses) for up to 7days. However, if a dose is 
not able to be delivered every  12hours ±1 hour, admi nister the dose 
(no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing 
time. 
The first anti-Xalevel after initial study  medication treatment may 
be taken 4 hours ±1hour after thefirst, second orthird dose per 
Investigator judgment .  All pl asma samples should be drawn within 
the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, 
record the actual time the sample is drawn. Plasma samples drawn 
during the 
Dose-Adjustment phase that deviate outside the 4 ± 1hr 
window cannot use the anti -Xa reference range, 0.5 -1.0IU/ml , and 
should be repeated the next day for both central lab and local lab. The 
actual dosing time prior to the repeat plasma sample draw and the 
actual time of the repeat sample draw must be recorded .  Subsequent 
anti-
Xa levels will be measured to determine if the anti- Xa level is 
within the target therapeutic range of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL .  If the 
therapeutic range is not achieved, the dalteparin dose must be adjusted 
per protocol.  After any dose adjustment, anti -Xa should be re -drawn 
after the first, second or third dose per Investigator judgment.  If the 
target range is not achieved within the [ADDRESS_652665]’s 
study  participation will be terminated.
In the PD Phase, subjects completing the Dose Adjustment Phase will 
receive their maintenance therapeutic dose of dalteparin sodium (last 
dose from Dose Adjustment Phase) subcutaneously every  12hours 
±1hour (no less than 8 hours between doses). However, if a dose is 
not able to be delivered every  12hours ±1 hour, administer the dose 
(no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing 
time.   Subjects from each age group will be randomized to two 
different 
plasma sampling windows (1 to 3hand5to 8h or 3 to 5h
and8to 12 h) for the anti- Xa pl asma samples for the central lab, only .  
A total of two plasma samples will be drawn for each subject per their 
randomization schedule during the PD Phase.  The plasma sampling 
times can be spread over the duration of the PD phase ( up to 7days) if 
necessa ry.All plasma samples should be drawn within the assigned 
window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual 
time the sample is drawn.   The sample should be repeated if possible 
at the correct time point.
IntheFollow- UpPhase (Visits 5, 6, 7) ,subjects will continue to 
receive their maintenance therapeutic dose of daltepar in sodium
subcutaneousl yevery  12hours ±1hour (no less than 8 hours between 
doses) through Visit 7. However, if a dose is not able to be delivered

Anti-Xa level sand 
safet y/efficacy assessmentswill be conducted at Visits 5, 6 and 7 . 
Anti- Xa plasma samples will be collected at 4 hours ± [ADDRESS_652666] the actual time the sample is dra wn. Plasma samples 
drawn during the Follow -Up P hase that deviate outside the 4 ± 1hr 
window cannot use the anti -Xa reference range, 0.5 -

patients should be aligned with the [ADDRESS_652667] 
Physicians ( ACCP )Guidelines15which s uggest a total duration of 
anticoagulation treatment of between 6 weeks and 3 months rather 
than shorter or longer durations (Grade 2C), following completion of 
the PD Phase
.Non-cancer patients will be required to remain in the 
study , however for the ful l 3months to complete all remaining study  
visits , regardless of dalteparin treatment duration. For non- cancer 
patients who stop dalteparin treatment prior to 3 months, Anti -Xa and 
Anti-IIa plasma sampling will not be required after study  medication 
discontinuation

3.INTRODUCTION
3.1.Background
This protocol i
mplements apost-approval clinical commitm entoriginally  with Eisai I nc and 
now between [COMPANY_007] Inc.,a
ndtheFood and Drug A dministration (FDA) relating tothe
dalteparin sNDA 20-287/S - 035, “for the extended treat mentofsymptomaticvenous 
thromboembolism [VTE (proxi maldeep vein thrombosi s [DVT] and/orpulmona ry
embolism [PE])] toreduce recurrent VTE insubjects with cancer”, hereaft erreferred to
asthe“CLOTindication”.1The Agencyindicated that apost-approval study to
investi gatethe safety a n d ef ficacy  ofdalteparin in apediatric cancer population requiring
anticoagulation was warranted. Following a Ty pe C Meeting with FDA on October 5, 2015, 
this study  now includes both pediatric patients with and without cancer.
This phase IIpharmacody namic (PD) study isintended toprovide inform ation toguide the 
conditions under which dalteparin maybeused fortheacute treatment and secondary  
prophy laxis ofrecurrent VTE in children with orwithout cancer. Pharm acody nami csof
dalteparin isbeing m easured only using theAnti-Factor Xa (Xa) activity andnotthedrug
level inthebody. Inthisstudy,the PD effect(anti-Xalevel) isused asasurrogate forthe
time course ofdrug exposure because 1) analy tical diff iculty inmeasuri ngthe drug inplasm a
and 2) the i nstantaneous drug e ffectonanti-Xalevel. Hence, thestudyisonly
characterizi ngthePD of dalte parininpediatric subjects with andwithout cance r.
Figure 1.Chemical Structure of Dalteparin Sodium
3.2.Rationale
Dalteparin sodium (Fragmin®) isalowmolecular weightheparin (LMWH),produced by 
[CONTACT_505853], a mem beroftheglycosa minogly can(GAG) familyofbiological 
entities found intheintesti nalmucosa. Dalteparin was first appro vedintheUSin
Dece mber1994 for pri maryproph ylaxis ofDVT insubjects underg oing abdominal su rgery. 
This was followed by [CONTACT_505854] y duringacute illness. 
Dalteparin sod iumis also indicated fortheproph ylaxis ofische miccomplications in
unstable angina andnon-Q- wave my ocardial infarction, when concurrentl y adm inistered 
with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_505825] y.

Page 24Daltaperin was approved in2006 for the extended treatmentof VTE inadult patients (age
18years)with cance r. Forthese indications, dalteparin hasanaccepta ble safet yprofile. 
Further infor mation regar ding dosage, safety profile, etc., canbefound inthecurrent US
Package Insert or local Summary  of Product Characteristics ,which willserve a
sthe
Investigators’ Brochure forthisstudy.
Multi pler etrospec tivestudies have shown thatcance r-associ ated throm bosis (CAT)isa 
significant entity previously under recognized andunder treated.2-9  When compared to
subjects without cance r
,cancer subjects are farmoreprone todevelop VTE; infact, VTE
may represent the initial presenting finding foranotherwise occult cance r .10When
compared to cance r-free subjects with symptomaticVTE, cancer subjectswith VTE are
moreprone torecurrence andtotrea tment-related bleeding complications.
The CLOTstudy [“Rando mizedComparison ofLowMolecular Weight Heparin
(Dalteparin, Frag min®)versus OralAnticoagulant Therap yfor Long Term Anticoagul ation in
Cancer S ubjects with Venous Thro mboembolis m”]was thefirst multinati onal prospective
rando mized clinical trial inageneral cancer population toshow t he superiority of
LMWH therapy forsecondary  proph ylaxis compared to standard of care therapy using
vitamin K antagonists (oral antic oagula nts[OAC ] ) incancer subjects with confirmed
sympto maticl
ower extre mityDVT ,PE, or both.1Howeve r,theCLOT study didnot include
pediatric subjects andthere is lim ited in form ation in theliteratureregardingtheprope r
dosing of dalte parin fortreatmentofVTE in pediatric subjects with cance r .
Theuseof LMWHs has been evalu ated in sever a lpublished pediatric studies. Ina
1996 report, Massicote etal.,11described theirevaluation ofenoxaparin in25pediatric
subjects inCanada either with VTE oratrisk of VTE, and dee med by[CONTACT_505855].  Itwasobserved thataninverse relationship
existed between the subje c
t’s age (correlated with body weight) anddosing required to
achieve e
ffective anti-Xa inhibition, with “newborns” requiringagreater than 50% increa sed
dose perkg(perhaps due
to a lar gervolumeof distribution [Vd]).
Likewise, in a 1999 report by[CONTACT_505856].,12doses ofdalteparin in48children were shown to
be effective(129±43 anti-XaInternational Units (IU)/kg, q24h fortreatment;92±52 anti-Xa
IU/kg, q24h forprophy laxis asrecom mended inthe7thACCP Guidelines15),with higher
dosing required for younger children toachieve thesame targetanti-Xalevel. Risk factors
forthrombosis inthis cohort included thepresence of carcinoma insomeof the children.
Dosing with enoxaparin in173pedia tricthrom bosis subjects wasalsoevaluated by[CONTACT_505857].
and reported in2000.13Theauthors concluded again, asabove, thattheuseof LMWH in
children was “…a safeand ef fective form of anticoagulation”.
Thecombination of thepublished data andrecognition that formorethan 10years children 
worldwide have been treated with LMWH forVTE,outside of theapproved indication,
supports the safet y oftherecommended doses of L MWH in children.

function ofageinorder to achieve Anti-Xalevels of 0.5 to1.0IU/ mL at4 hour
(±1hour) post-dose inchildren with or without various cancers and requiring
anticoagulation forthetreatmentandsecondary prophy laxis ofVTE. Thestudy is divided
into3phases: 1)Dose Adjustm entPhase of up to7days;2)PDPhase; and 3)Follow -Up 
Phase, to complete up to 90days of treat mentfor cancer patients and treatment of non -cancer 
patients should be aligned with the [ADDRESS_652686] a total duration 
of anticoagulation treatment of between 6 weeks and 3 months rather than shorter or longer 
durations (Grade 2C) , following completion of the PD Phase. Non-cancer patients will be 
required to remain in the study , however, for the full 3 months to complete all remaining 
study  visits, regardless of dalteparin treatment duration . For non-cancer patients who stop 
dalteparin treatment prior to 3 months, Anti -Xa and Anti -IIa plasma sampling will not be 
required after stud y medication discontinuation.

This isa multi-center open -labelstudy  with no cont rolgroup. This Phase IIPDstudy is
intend ed toprovide inform ation to guide theconditions under which dalteparin maybeused
forthe treatm entofacute andsecondary prophy laxis of VTE inchildren with or without 
cance r. Subjects willbe enrolled intothefollowing fiveagegroups:
0to < 8 Weeks ;
≥8Weeks to < 2 Years ;
≥2Years to < 8 Years ;
≥8Years to < 12 Years ;
≥12Years to < [ADDRESS_652687] ment Phase :
The Dose Adjust ment Phase willbeginfollowi ng the first dose andcontinue for upto
7days. During theDose Adjust mentPhase, doses areadjusted acc ording toAnti-Xalevels. 
Thestarting doses forthefive agegroups areasfollows: 
0to<8weeks –
125IU/kg ;
≥8weeks to< 2 years– 150 IU/kg ;
≥2yearsto<8years–125IU/kg ;
≥8yearsto<12years–125IU/kg and
≥12yearsto<19years– 100 IU/kg.
ThefirstAnti-Xa plasma sample drawn after the initial dose of study  drug treatment should 
beconducted 4hours ±1hour after thefirst, second orthird dose of study  medication per 
Investigator judgment . Subsequent A nti-Xaplasma samples conducted following dose 
adjustments will also be drawn at4hours ±1hour post-dose, after the first, second or third 
dose of study  medication per Investigator judgment .Doses will beadjusted inincre mentsor 
decre mentsof 25 IU/kg in order toachieve targetanti-Xa levels (0.5-1.0IU/mL).All plasma 
samples should be drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not 
possible, record the actual time the sample is drawn. Plasma samples drawn during the 
Dose-Adjustment Phase and F ollow -Up P hase that deviate outside the 4 ± 1hr window 
cannot use the anti -Xa reference range, 0.5 -
1.0IU/mL, and should be repeated the next day
for both central and local labs . The actual dosing time prior to the repeat plasma sample 
draw and the actual time of the repeat sample draw must be recorded .
PD Phase :
Subjects completing theDose Adjust mentPhase will ente rintothePD Phase . Daltepar in 
sodium will b e administered subcutaneously every 12 hours ±1hour (no less than 8 hours 
between doses) with the maintenance therapeutic dose from theDose Adjust mentPhase .

ACCP Guidelines, Anti -Xa and Anti -IIa plasma sa mpling will not be required after study  
medication discontinuation.
Throughout the3 month study period, theactual timesof do sing andanti-Xablood draw 
times will be captured on the patie nt Case Report Form(CRF).
The use of intravenous or intra -arteria l cannulas for blood sample collection is not permitted.
5.3.Definition of End of Study and Early Discontinuation
Endof study (EOS) is defined as Day 90(±14days) after study Baseline .Early
Discontinuation from S tudy Drug: Early discontin uationfrom study drug treatmentwillbe 
defined asless than 90daysofstudy treatmentfor cancer patients .For non- cancer 
patients, between 6weeks and 3 months , rather than shorter or longer durations (Grade 2C), 
following completion of the PD Phase (2012 ACCP Guidel ines15) due to:1)new or
recurrent VTE; 2)bleeding necessitating permanent disconti n uation of anticoagulant
therap y;3)unexpected permanent discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy; 4)AEs
necessitating disco

6.3.1. Unscheduled Termination from the Study
Withdrawal of consent: Subjects or parents/guardians who request to discontinue study  
treatment will remain in the study  and must continue to be followed for protocol specified 
follow -up procedures.  The only  exception to this is when a subject or parents/guardians
specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact [CONTACT_505862]/guardians to provide this information. Subjects or 
parents/guardians should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw 
consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. 
The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_1275], as to whether the withdrawal is on ly from further receipt of investigational 
product or also from study procedures and/or post -treatment study  follow -up, and entered on 
the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) 
is being measured, publi cly available information should be used to determine vital status 
only as appropriatel y directed in accordance with local law.
Lost to follow -up: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and 
report their ongoing status. 
This in cludes follow -up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_439707]/guardians as noted 
above.  Lost to follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_199857] a minimum of 
2documented phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response by  [CONTACT_505863]/guardians to 1registered mail letter.  All attempts should be documented in the 
subject’s medical records.  If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use 
permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of de ath.  If the investigator’s use of a 
third- party representative to assist in the follow- up portion of the study  has been included in 
the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may  use a sponsor -retained third- party 
representative to assist site 
staff with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_110448] -up portion of the study .  The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact [CONTACT_3031].  If, after all attempts, 
the subject remains lost to follow- up, then the last -known- alive date as determined by  [CONTACT_74087]’s medical recor ds.
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol -required schedule of study  
visits or procedures at a given study  site. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_439707]/guardians and information receive d 
during contact [CONTACT_155806]’s medical record.  In an y 
circumstance, every  effort should be made to 
document subject outcome, if possible.  The 
investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the sub ject return all 
unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if 
applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).

The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products ( including any  comparator and/or marketed products )are stored in a 
secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with 
the labels. 
See the I nvestigational P roduct (IP) manual or package insert for storage condi tions of the 
product once diluted.
Any storage conditions stated in the single reference safet y document (SRSD) will be 
superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the product label.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example , via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt t hroughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confi rm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order.

Subjects completing t he Dose Adjust mentPhase will ente rinto thePDPhase and
will continue with daily dosing every  12 hours ±1hour with dalteparin sodium with
thefinal dose from theDose Adjust ment Phase (no less than 8 hours between doses) .
However, if a dose i s not able to be delivered every  12hours ±1 hour, administer the 
dose (no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing time. S ubjects

8 h or 3 to 5 h and8to12 h) for anti -Xa plasma samples (for the central lab, only )via 
the [COMPANY_007] Interactive Web Response Sy stem ( IWRS)system, IMPALA (see below) . 
IMPALA will only  provide the subject Screening ID number and randomized plasma 
sampling group assignment (and r espective Randomization Number) during the study
(it will not manage drug supply  inventory ). Theplasma sampling times can take
placeover t heduration ofthePDPhase to avoid blood volum eshiftsif necessary .  If 
a plasma sample is not drawn during the correct assigned time point, it should be 
repeated if possible, at the correct time point when appropriate.

9.1.5. Pregnancy Test
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy  test, w ith 
sensitivity  of at least 25 IU/mL , will be performed at screening, before investigational 
product administration at the Baseline visit , unless the Baseline visit is conducted within 
2days of th e Screening Visit, and at 
all other study  visits.  During the Dose Adjustment 
Phase, if multiple study  visits are conducted, the pregnancy  test will only  be required once in 
the 7- day Dose Adjustment Phase .  A negative pregnancy  result is required before t hesubject 
may receive the investigational product.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever 
1menstrual cy cle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy  
is otherwise suspected), and repeated at follow -up visits and at the
end of the study  to 
confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study .  Pregnancy  tests may  also be 
repeated as per request of institutional review boards ( IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if 
required b y local regulations.
In the case of a p ositive confirmed pregnancy , the subject will be withdrawn from 
administration of investigational product and from the study .
All male subjects who are able to father children and female subjects who are of childbearing 
potential and are sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  must agree to use a highly  
effective method of contraception consistentl y and correctly for the duration of the active 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_652708] of contraception methods (see below) and instruct the 
subject in its consistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that they  meet the criteria 
for correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or 
his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  effective contraception 
consistently  and correctly  according to the schedule of activities and document such 
conversation in the subject’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will 
instruct the subject to call immediately  ifthe selected contraception method is discontinued 
or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or the subject’s partner. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% p er year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Correctl y placed copper - containing intrauterine device (IUD). 

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_652709] (ie, foam, 
gel, film, cream, or s uppository ).  For countries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate (See Appendix 4regarding countries where this method of birth 
control is not considered highly effective ).
3.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate.
4.Bilateral tubal ligation / bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirm ed in accordance with the device’s label).
NOTE : Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study  
treatments) may  obviate the need f or contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject. 
The u se of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal methods of 
contraception arenot allowed due to risks of VTE.  If a subject was using a hormonal based 
contraceptive prior to study  entry , it should be discontinued prior to study  entry .  There is no 
required wash -out period required for recentl y discontinued hormonal based contraception.
9.1.6. Imaging
Docu mentation ofanobjectivel ydiagnosed venous thro
mbotic event will bediagnosed using 
the following acceptable i
maging at Screening:
Compression ultrasound with Doppler [CUD] ;
Computed tomography with/ without venography [CT/CTV] ;
Magnetic resonance imaging with/without venography [MRI /MRV] ;
Conventional venogr aphy [CV]) ;
Ventil ation-perfusion s c an[V/Q](for pul monary artery);
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_505816] y[SCTA] ;
Conventional pulm onary angiogram [CPA] .

Acopyofallimages should be kept with thesource docu ments.
9.1.7. Vital Signs
Vitalsigns willbe measured at each vis it. Evaluations will include thefollowing
measure ments, a resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_159353] 2 minutes:

Page 48Temperature (recorded inCelsius) ;
Heart Rate;
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581];
Height andWeight .
For the weighing of infants and newborns, clothing should be removed leaving only  a clean, 
dry diaper and be positioned in the center of the scale tray , which should be placed on a 
stable, flat surface. For older children, 
a scale with appropriate range and resolution should
beused. Shoes, bulky  layers of clothing and jackets must be removed prior to weight 
measurement 
so that only  light clothing remains. The contents of pockets should be emptied.   
Subjects should remain still during the measurement of weight.
9.1.8. Clinical La boratory Assessments
Anti-Xaassessm ents will be conducted at both the local and central laboratories at each 
visit, except during the PDPhase , when the Anti-Xa assessment willbe conducted atonly the 
central laborator y.  Additionally , t he A nti-IIaassessmentswillbe conducted only atthe
centr al labor atory at each visit . Anti- Xalevels willbe m easured at 4hours (±1hour)
post-dose daily forupto7daysduring theDose Adjust mentPhase. ThefirstAnti- Xalevel
after initial study  medication dosing m
ay be drawn after thefirst,second or thirddose or per
Investigator judgment andsent toboth thecentralandlocall aborator ies until atarget 
therapeutic range of 0.5 to1.0IU/mLisobtained. Plasma samples may  be drawn after the 
morning or evening dose.   After an y dose adjustments, the Anti-Xa samples may  also be 
drawn after the first, second or third dose , per Investigator judgment
.
During thePDPhase, subjects will berandomized to1 of 2 diff erent plasma sampling
windows. The Anti-Xaplasma sam ples ([ADDRESS_652710]) willbeobtained at either
1to3hours and5to8hours or 3 to5hours and8to12 hours (for central lab, only ). This
plasma sampling canoccurover a 7-day timeframe. Once intheFollow-up Phase,
subjects will then have Anti-Xaplasma samples drawn atVisits 5, [ADDRESS_652711]-dose andsent
toboth thelocal and central laborator ies.
The use of cannulas for blood collection are not permitted.
NOTE : Plasma sam ples drawn for A nti-Xa and A nti-IIa must not be hemolyzed. All 
precautions must be made to ensure that the plasma samples are not hemolyzed. 
Throughout the
3 month study period, theactual timesofdosing andAnti-Xablood draw
times will be captured on the patie ntCRF .
Pharmacod ynamic Measurements
Blood volumes for PD measurements (A nti Xa and Anti IIa) will be as follows for the 
Central Lab blood sample collection:

Pre School, School Age and Teen Cohort Groups: One 3.0 mL Blue Topped Tube, 
filled to the top with 2.7 mL of blood (tube provided by  [CONTACT_221452]) for processing 
the plasma samples (contains 0.3mL  of sodium citrate anticoagulant).
The 2.0 mL tubes will be provided to the site in a bulk shipment, whereas the 3.0 mL tubes 
will be provided in kits per visit.

analysis by  [CONTACT_505887].  Please refer to the 
Laboratory  Manual for all details regarding the drawing and processing of the anti Xa and 
anti IIa plasma samples.
Unfractionated heparin contamination is a major concer n when blood samples are taken from 
a port when testing for low molecular weight heparin (Fragmin®).  The following procedure 
will help eliminate the interference of unfractionated heparin in the anti Xa PD samples:
Access the port according to the institu tional protocol.
Prior to plasma sampling, flush the port with [ADDRESS_652712].
For children <[ADDRESS_652713] for children > 7kg body
 weight.  The institutional protocol takes precedent 
over the above procedure for saline flush and discard volumes.
Subjects will be randomized to two different plasma sampling windows (1 to 3hand5to 8h 
or 3to5 hand8to 12 h), so each subject will have two blood draws during the PD Phase for 
the central lab, onl y.  The plasma sampling times can be spread over the duration of the PD 
Phase (up to 7 days) to avoid blood volume shifts if necessary .  All plasma samples should be 
drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the 
actual time the sample is drawn.   If the PD Phase sample is drawn outside the required 
randomization assigned time period, it should be repeated i f possible. 
Plasma samples drawn during the Dose Adjustment Phase and Follow Up Phase that deviate 
outside the 4 ± 1hr window cannot use the A nti Xa reference range, 0.5 1.0IU/mL , and 
should be repeated the next day .  The actual dosing time prior to the repeat plasma sample 
draw and the actual time of the repeat sample draw must be.
In this stud y, the PD effect ( Anti Xa level) is used as a surrogate (PK of dalteparin) for the 
time course of drug exposure because 1) anal ytical difficulty  in measuring the dalteparin 
levels in plasma and 2) the instantane ous drug effect quantitated by  [CONTACT_505888].  Hence, 
the study  is only  characterizing the PD of dalteparin

10.ADVERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS ADVE RSE EVENTS AND REPOR TING
10.1. Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
repre sentative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by  [CONTACT_8889].  The investigator is required to assess causality .  
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_505891] r esolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_652714]’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_652715] after the active 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigat or becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investiga tor believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the ca se report form (CRF) from the 
time the subject has taken at least [ADDRESS_652716]’s last 
visit. 
10.1.2. Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical exa mination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;

Page 58Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported 
as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by  
[CONTACT_265360].
10.2. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wron g product, b y the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a sp ecific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be noti fied 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, any  associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.
10.3. Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria fo r determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptom s; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not requi re 
reporting as an AE.
10.4. Serious Adverse Events
Aserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016
Page 59Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24600];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect ;
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and sy mptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the 
safety reporting period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505843].  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome
during the study  or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death 
must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 5 (see the section on Severity  Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is dete rmined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development o f drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
Medical device complaints may  meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see the section 
onSponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory  Authorities).  An incident is any  
malfunction ( ie, the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as 
intended; performance specifications include all claims made in t he labeling for the device) 
that, directly  or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, 
or of other persons, or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. 
Alife-threatening illness, even if temporary  in nat ure;
Apermanent impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; 
A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 
2bulleted items;
Any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in v itro diagnostic 
device test results when used within the manufacturer’s instructions for use;
Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects.
10.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no proto col-specified SAEs in thi s study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).

Page 6010.4.2. Pote ntial Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of o ther causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liv er injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal 
range who subsequentl y present with AST or ALT values 3times the upper limit 
of normal (× ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value 2× ULN with no 
evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 2 × ULN or not 
available;
For subjects with preexisting AL T OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
ULN, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned 
above:
For subjects with preexisting AS T or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values 
2times the baseline values and 3 ×ULN, or 
8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with preexisting values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubi n level increased from baseline b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or
if the value reaches ≥3× ULN (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physical assessment .  For oncology  studies, the 
possibility  of hepatic neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.
In addition to repeating measurem ents of AST and AL T, laboratory  tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamy
l 
transferase, prothrombin t ime (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug, and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for Liver Function Test ( LFT)abnormalities identified at 
the time, should be considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availability  of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal L FTs.  Such 
potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported as SAEs.

includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergenc y room visit does not necessaril y constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.

development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, 
for workup of persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_154015]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the 
baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or fo r the individual subject;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedur e was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No change from normal or reference (This grade is not included in the Version 
4.03 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD adverse event
2 MODERATE adverse event
3 SEVERE adverse event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headach e may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of th e 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
10.7. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided f or all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such a n assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational prod uct” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see the section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product," 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE repo rting 
requirements, if applicable.
10.8. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapprove d/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to t he investigational
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product; 

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_652717] in a pregnant woman (eg , a nurse reports that she 
is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is expos ed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safe ty unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information 
subm itted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The i nvestigator wi ll follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure tes t 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE ( ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_652718]. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (e g, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must do cument in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )

Page 6410.9. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when , during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a heal thcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using t he SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not repo rted on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
10.10. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page. 
When a subject withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
10.11. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject /parent(s)/legal guardian/legally  acceptable representative.  In addition, each 
study  subject /parent(s)/legal guardian/legall y acceptable representative will be questioned 
about AEs.
10.12. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as approp riate.
10.12.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_652719] be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to t he initial and follow-up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediatel y (eg , if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_652720] awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obliga ted to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016
Page 65on the AE CRF.  I n general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality . 
Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, 
vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a summary  of 
available autops y findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
representative. 
10.12.2.
Nonserious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE informa tion.
10.12.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AEreporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried ou t 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

13.DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE
This study  will not use a data monitoring committee.
Itshould be
emphasized thatthesubject, thesubject ’sparent and/or legal representative are
at liberty towithdraw their consent toparticipate atanytime,without penalty orlossof
benefits to which thesubject isotherwise entitled. Subjects, their parents and/or legal
representatives, who refuse togive, orwithdra w,written infor medconsent maynot be
included or continued in this stud y, but this willnotimpact their subsequent care.
13.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent /assent documents, and other rele vant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an am endment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_652727] of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , International Confer ence on 
Harmonisation (ICH 6), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 
(1996 & 2008).
In addition, the study  will b e conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I CHguideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
13.3. Subject Information and Consent
Protection and safet y of vulnerable subjects (including illiterate subjects) will be ensured to 
uphold the subjects’ well -being, rights, and confidentiality  and the integrity of their data will 
be safeguarded.  This includes both consent procedures and methods to ensure the veracit y of 
study  assessments.
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
or other identifiable data in any  reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where 
required b y law. 
When study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_47581], subject 
names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code based on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  study  subjects.   The study  site 
will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study ,linking each 
subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subject
s’personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent /assentdocuments must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local 
regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent /assent documents used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC before use, and available for 
inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative ,or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor, is fully  informed about the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative/parent(s) or 
legal guardian, the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently  be obtained 
when the subject has the capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the 
investigator determines that a subject’s d ecisional capacity  is so limited he/she cannot 
reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consiste nt with local 
regulatory  and legal requirements, the subject’s assent may  be waived with source 
documentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the stud y subject does not provide 
hisorher own consent, the source documents must record wh y the sub ject did not provide 
consent (eg, minor, decisionally  impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the 
person signing the consent was the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, the consent

Page 71signer’s relationship to the study  subject ( eg, pare nt, spouse) ,and that the subject’s assent 
was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally  it must be documented in the source 
documents.
If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as 
recognized under loca l law, they  must re -consent as adults to remain in the study .  If the 
enrollment of ‘emancipated minors’ is permitted by [CONTACT_43038] y age criteria, the I RB/EC, and 
local law, they  must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the 
permissi on of a parent or legal guardian. 
The investigator, or a person designated by  [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative ,parent(s) or legal 
guardian and the subject’s assent , when applicable, before an y stud y-specific activity  is 
performed , unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by  [CONTACT_2717]/EC .  The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent /assent document.
13.4. Subject Recruitment
Advertis ements approved by  [CONTACT_1202]/ECs and investigator databases may  be used as 
recruitment procedures.   [COMPANY_007] will have an opportunity  to review and approve the content of 
any study  recruitment materials directed to potential study  subjects before such materials a re 
used.
13.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately
. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study  subjects against any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.

Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_652728] to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Cli nical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, t
he study  site may  be subject to review 
by [CONTACT_21980] (IRB)/ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance 
audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to 
inspection by [CONTACT_47615].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediat ely of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be presen t during the inspection. The investigator will promptly  
provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
16.DA
TA HANDLING AND RECO RD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
16.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this s tudy.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or approp riate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_505908] -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_652729] be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ’s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be av ailable at the investigat ivesite as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
16.1.1. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authoriti es or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent /assent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator a ccording to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator r ecords must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_652730] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records,

INTRODUCTION
It isthem
ission ofthephysician tosafeguard thehealth ofthepeople. His or her
knowledge and conscience arededicated tothefulfillm entof this mission.
The Declaration ofGeneva oftheWorld MedicalAssociation binds thephysician with
the words, "The Health ofmysubject willbe my first consideration," andtheInternational
Code of Medical Ethi csdeclares that, "Aphysician shall actonly inthesubject 'sinterest
when providing m edical care which might have theeffectofweakening thephysical and
mental condition of the subject."
The purpose ofbiomedical resea
rchinvolving humansubjects must betoi m prove
diagnostic, therapeutic andprophy lactic procedures andtheunderstanding oftheetiology
andpathogenesis of disease.
Incurrent medical practice m ostdiagnostic, therapeutic orproph ylactic procedures involve 
hazards. This applies e s peciall ytobiome dical research.
Medic a
l progress isba s edonresea rch,which ultimately must restinpart on
expe rimentation involving humansubjects.
In thefield of biomedical research a fundamental distinction must berecognized between 
medical research inwhich theaimisessenti allydiagnostic orthera peutic for asubject, and 
medical research, theessential objectofwhich ispurely scienti ficandwithout implying
direct diagnostic or therapeutic value totheperson subjected totheresea rch.
Special caution mustbeexercised intheconduct ofresearch, which mayaffect the
environm ent, and thewelfareof ani malsused for research m ustberespected.
Because it
isessentialthattheresultsoflabor atory experi ments be appliedtohumanbeings
to further scientific know ledge and tohelp suffer ing hum anity ,theWorld Medical
Association has prepared thefollowing recom menda t
ions as aguide toevery physician in

8.Inpublication ofthe res ultsofhis or her research, the phy sician isobliged topreserve the 
accuracy oftheresults. Reports ofexperi mentation notinaccordance with theprinciples 
laiddown in thisDeclaration should not be accepted for publicati on.

Page 86Appendix 4. Regional Amendment for Highly Effective Methods of Contraception
As per the European Heads of Medicines Agency ’s Clinical Trial Facilitation Group’s 
recommendation (Recommendations related to contracept ion and pregnancy  testing
in clinical trials – Final Version 2014-09- 15) any European Union Member State or other 
country  that follows these recommendations and does not recognize condoms with 
spermicide as a highl y effective method of contraception will f ollow the highly  effective 
methods of contraception as indicated below in the revised Section 9.1.5, Pregnancy  Test.
9.1.5. Pregnancy  Test
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy  test, with 
sensitivity  of at least 25 IU/mL , will be performed at screening, before investigational 
product administration at the Baseline visit, unless the Baseline visit is conducted within 
2days of the Screening Visit, and at all other study  visits.  During the Dose Adjustment 
Phase, if mu ltiple study  visits are conducted, the pregnancy  test will only  be required once in 
the 7- day Dose Adjustment period.   A negative pregnancy  result is required before the 
subject may  receive the investigational product.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done wh
enever 
1menstrual cy cle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy  
is otherwise suspected), and repeated at follow up visits and at the end of the study  to 
confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study .  Pregn ancy  tests may  also be 
repeated as per request of institutional review boards (I RBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if 
required b y local regulations. 
In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from 
administration of investiga tional product and from the study .
All male subjects who are able to father children and female subjects who are of childbearing 
potential and are sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy must agree to use a highly  
effective method of contraception consis tently and correctly for the duration of the active 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_652738] of contraception methods (see below) and instruct the 
subject in its consistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that they  meet the criteria 
for correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or 
his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  effective contraception 
consistently  and correctly  according to the schedule of a ctivities and document such 
conversation in the subject’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will 
instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected contraception method is discontinued 
or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or the subject’s partner. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:

FRAG -A001-201(A6301094 )
Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016
Page 871. Use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal methods of 
contraception is not allowed due to risks of VTE. 
2.Correctl y placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD). 
3.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate.
4.Bilateral tubal ligation / bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).
Female partner who meets the criteria for non -childbearing potential, as described below:
Female subjects of non -childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following 
criteria:
Have undergone a documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral oophorectomy ;
Have medically  confirmed ovarian failure; or 
NOTE: Sexual abstinence , defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study  
treatments) may  obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty leof the subject.   If this option is selected for a female subject of childbearing 
potential, then the subject would be required to undergo interval urine pregnancy  testing 
(specify  a schedule) and would be asked to record stop and start dates for menstruat ion 
throughout the course of the study .
The use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal methods of 
contraception are not allowed due to risks of VTE.   If a subject was using a hormonal based 
contraceptive prior to study  entry , it should be discontinued prior to study  entry .  There is no 
required wash -out period required for recentl y discontinued hormonal based contraception.
All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be of 
childbearing pot ential.  All sexually  active male subjects must agree to prevent potential 
transfer of and exposure to drug through semen to their partners b y using a condom 
consistently  and correctly , beginning with the first dose of investigational product and 
continuin
g for at least [ADDRESS_652739] dose.

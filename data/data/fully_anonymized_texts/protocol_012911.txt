Abstract  
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) ,inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and lining of the nasal cavity 
for 12 weeks or more, affects up to the 12.5% of the US population and has a significant 
disease burden . Patients with CRS visit primary care physicians twice as often as those without 
the disease and have five times as many prescriptions fil led. Based on  national ambulatory 
data,  rhinosinusitis accounts for more outpatient antibiotic prescriptions than any other 
diagnosis . The annual total direct and indirect cost of CRS exceeds $[ADDRESS_323081] 
demonstrated that l arge- volume, low -pressure nasal saline irrigation can improve distribution of 
pharmacologic therapeutics throughout the nasal cavity and sinuses, and enhance removal of 
mucus and bacteria/bi ofilms. As a result of the  low-cost, excellent safety profile, and  high patient 
compliance, nasal saline irrigation is an appealing long- term topi[INVESTIGATOR_265647] .   
 
While the efficacy and safety of intranasal corticosteroids (INC S), such as budesonide,  are well-
established for the long -term management of CRS, penetr ation of INC S into the paranasal 
sinuses is limited. A recent clinical trial led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_265648]- volume, low -
pressure sinus saline irrigation for  one month resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in 
self-reported functional status and quality of life measures as well as objective measurements of 
CRS . Like budesonide, mometasone  furoate  (MF)  is a second -generation INC. Mometasone is 
currently used as an inhalational drug for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and nasal 
polyps. Due to its increased lipophilicity and extensive hepatic metabolism, however, 
mometasone has a markedly reduced systemic availability as compared to budesonide. In a 
recent double- blinded, placebo- controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), Harvey et al 
demonstrated that MF nasal irrigation was superior to MF nasal spray in the management of 
CRS sym ptoms following sinus surgery, as measured by [CONTACT_4676] -reported out comes and 
endoscopic findings.  
 
The goal of this research project is to explore the impact of the addition of mometasone  to high-
volume, low-pressure nasal sinus saline irrigation (aka “Neti -Pot”-type systems ) for surgery -
naïve patients with CRS  without nasal polyps . The overall objective of this study is to optimize 
medical management of CRS symptoms prior to escalation of surgery , and to evaluate a 
clinically meaningful question of whether steroid nasal irrigation is superior to steroid spray with 
saline nasal irrigation alone.   
 
 
The specific aims of this study are as follows:  
1. Compare the effectiveness of MF nasal irrigation to that of MF nasal spray in the 
management of CRS symptoms in surgery -naïve patients . 
2. Evaluate the effect of MF nasal saline irrigation on the HPA axis compared to that of MF 
nasal spray .

To answer the research questions, the study design will be a double- blinded, randomized 
clinical trial. Up to 5 0 adult patients with complaints of purulent nasal drainage accompanied by

weeks or greater will be eligible. The intervention will be 8 weeks of either 1) mometasone  nasal 
saline irrigation and placebo nasal spray  or 2) mometasone nasal s pray and nasal saline 
irrigation .  The primary outcome measure will be the average per -patient change in SNOT -[ADDRESS_323082] : 8 weeks

I. Statement of the Research Problem  
 
Definition and Burden of Rhinosinusitis  
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and lining of the nasal 
cavity for [ADDRESS_323086] 5 times 
as many prescriptions filled.5 Approximately $8.[ADDRESS_323087] ugs and office- based care .6 Surgery  for CRS , which costs on average $7,[ADDRESS_323088] a large degree 
of over utilization with development of serious adver se side- effects and resistant organisms.8-20 
 
Nasal Sinus Irrigation  
Nasal sinus saline irrigation (aka Neti -Pot) is widely recommended and is a common treatment 
for CRS.  The use of either isotonic ("normal" saline)  or hypertonic saline is recommended, 
andthere have been over [ADDRESS_323089], high patient acceptance, and high benefit -to-risk margin, l arge-volume, lo w-
pressure saline sinus irrigation is a widel y recommended treatment for CRS . 7,11,14,15,17   
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_265650] (INCS) are established as safe and effective monotherapy or  
adjuvant treatments for CRS. 21,22 A Cochrane Review in 201122 examined the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_265651]. When compared to pla cebo, topi[INVESTIGATOR_265652]  (standardised mean difference - 0.37; 95% CI ( -0.60 to - 0.13), P = 
0.002; five trials, n = 286) and had a greater proportion of responders (risk ratio 1.69; 95% CI 
(1.21 to 2.37 ), P = 0.002; four trials, n = 263 ). While the use of INCS is generally recommended 
in the setting of CRS, there is limited penetration of the steroid beyond the nasal cavity and into 
                                                                                                                                            Page [ADDRESS_323090] examined the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_265653] -pressure, high-
volume saline irrigation.  Snidvongs et al.22 examined a large cohort of patients with CRS  
(n=111) , 49 of whom had a diagnosis of CRS  without nasal polyps.  Treatment was with once 
daily nasal irrigations of 1mg budesonide /betame thasone in [ADDRESS_323091] -operative period. Significant improvements were seen in SNOT- 20 scores (2.3 ± 
1.1 vs 1.2  ± 0.9), symptom scores (2.5  ± 1.1 vs 1.4  ± 1.0) and Lund -Kennedy endoscopy 
scores (4.3  ± 2.0 vs 1.9  ± 1.6). No adverse outcomes were  reported. An open- label 
prospective study (n=9) by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_265654]26 evaluated 
the efficacy of once dai ly irrigation with budesonide (0.25 mg) . Subj ects also underwent adrenal 
function assessment with the cosyntropin test before and after budesonide therapy. All subjects 
showed appropriate adrenal response to cosyntropin stimulation before and after the 
budesonide trial, and the mean change in SNOT -[ADDRESS_323092] ; 4 subjects were classified as 
having aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]- exacerbated respi [INVESTIGATOR_3765], and all but 1 had physician- diagnosed asthma. 
The subjects received a 3- month course of twice daily budesonide  irrigations (500 μg into >100 
ml saline). The median sinus CT score before treatment was 15 (maximum =30), which 
improved to 5 ( p < .05) after treatment. After budesonide treatment, subjects’ sinus scores 
decreased (mean ± SD) from 43.1 ± 5.4 to 20.1 ±3.0 (P<.02). In addition, subjects reported a 
significant improvement in sense of smell.  Of the four patients with nasal polyps, three had 
complete resolution.  The authors concl uded that their study supports the concept that addition 
of budesonide  inhalation suspension to standard nasal saline irrigation produces subjective and 
objective benefit in eosinophilic sinus disease. Furthermo re, in a recently completed double -
blinded, placebo- controlled, randomized clinical trial by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_265655] 
(submitted), the addition of [ADDRESS_323093] of the INCS, 
mometasone is currently used as an inhalational drug for the treatment of asthma, allergic 
rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Due to its increased lipophilicity and ex tensive hepatic metabolism, 
however, mometasone has a markedly reduced systemic availability as compared to 
budesonide (<0.1% versus 34%, respectively) .[ADDRESS_323094] on the HPA axis. In 6 randomized 
control led parallel -group or placebo trials in adults and children , no evidence of HPA axis 
suppression was seen.  29  
 
In a recent double -blinded, placebo- controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), Harvey et al 
demonstrat ed that MF nasal irrigation was superior to MF nasal spray in the management of 
CRS symptoms following sinus surgery, as measured by [CONTACT_4676] -reported outcomes and 
                                                                                                                                            Page 7 of 19 
 endoscopic findings.23 In the study, participant s were assigned to either mometasone capsules  
(2 mg daily)  or placebo intervention for 12 months following sinus surgery. The MF nasal 
irrigation group had a significantly greater improvement in nasal blockage visual analog 
symptoms compared to that of the MF nasal spray group (p=0.029). Furthermore,  on 
endoscopic examination, the MF nasal irrigation group had significantly greater disease 
suppression than the MF nasal spray group, as evidenced by [CONTACT_265673]- Kennedy 
endoscopic scores ( p=0.018). Harvey et al reported no adverse effects from their dosage of 
mometasone.  
 
Due to mometasone’s favorable pharmacologic properties, we propose to evaluate the 
effectiveness  of the addition of mometasone to large- volume, low -pressure sinus saline 
irrigation for  patients with CRS without polyps in a single- site randomized clinical trial. We 
hypothesize that the addition of MF to a large- volume, low -pressure sinus saline irrigation will 
result in clinically meaningful benefits for patients with CRS as measured by [CONTACT_265674]. We  anticipate that MF dispensed in a large volume, low -pressure 
device will be superior to that of MF nasal spray  combined with nasal saline irrigation  in the 
medical management of CRS in surgery -naïve , non -polyp patients . 
 
II. Specific Aims  
The primary obj ective of this proposed project is to evaluate the effectiveness of MF nasal 
saline irrigation as compared to the commonly used MF nasal spray in the medical management 
of CRS symptoms in patients who have not undergone sinus surgery.  
Specifically, we propose:  
 
1. Compare the effectiveness of MF nasal irrigation to that of MF nasal spray in the 
management of CRS symptoms in surgery -naïve , non -polyp patients.   
 
Participants will be randomized to either  1) 8-weeks  of MF nasal saline irrigation and placebo 
nasal spray  or 2) MF nasal spray and nasal saline irrigation . The primary outcome measure will 
be the within subject changes in SNOT -[ADDRESS_323095] of 
mometasone nasal irrigation on the function of the hypothalamus -adrenal -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] (HPA) axis, 
as measured by [CONTACT_265675]. In prior studies 
on the safety of MF nasal spray in children and adults, no discernible effe cts of MF nasal spray 
on the function of the HPA axis were reported.[ADDRESS_323096] on the HPA axis.  Furthermore, subjects will be queried 
throughout their participation in the s tudy regarding any adverse events experienced with 
mometasone.

Randomizat ion 
 Using a randomization scheme with permuted blocks of varying sizes, participants will 
be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either 1) MF nasal saline irrigation ( 2.4 mg) and placebo 
nasal spray or 2) MF nasal  spray (50 mcg/spray) and nasal saline irriga tion.   
Intervention  
 MF nasal spray is currently dosed at 2 sprays/nostril for a total amount delivered of 200 
mcg. When a patient administers a nasal spray, approximately 70% of the dose is cleared from 
the nose into the throat and swallowed. The remaini ng 30% remains deposited in the nose. 
Therefore, if a patient receives 200 mcg of mometasone nasal spray, only 60 mcg of this dose 
remains in the nasal cavity. 28 Personal communication with Advanced Rx and revi ew of the 
literature regarding fluid/topi[INVESTIGATOR_265656] a total of 2.4 mg of MF powder 
reconstituted in 240 mL of nasal saline is an equivalent  dose to that of the metered spray.

Harvey et al recently completed a study evaluated the effectiveness of mometasone nasal 
irrigation dosed at 2 mg daily for management of CRS symptoms following sinus surgery with no 
adverse effects reported during the study’ s yearlong duration.30 
 
Participants will be provided with a 2- month supply of either 1) MF nasal spray  and nasal saline 
irrigation or 2) MF nasal irrigation and placebo nasal spray .  
 
All participants will be provided with an 8-ounce (240 ml) NeilMed Sinus Ri nse Regular Bottle 
Kit and a two -month supply of USP Grade Sodium Chloride & Sodium Bicarbonate Mixture (pH 
balanced, Isotonic & Preservative & Iodine Free) commercially prepared packets . Subjects may 
substitute  the NeilMed Sinus Rinse Regular Bottle Kit f or a nasal irrigation system, which in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237], is similar to the NeilMed system and embodies the low -
pressure, high -volume concept of nasal irrigation.  Examples of such system s include, but are 
not limited to, ceramic or  plastic neti pot or nasal douch (Nasendusche). Subjects will need to 
purchase distilled water or boil tap water for five minutes for  use with the saline irrigation. 
Subjects will be required to dissolve the contents of two capsules (either mometasone or l actose 
placebo) into the 8- ounce (240 ml) NeilMed Sinus Rinse Regular Bottle along with the saline 
rinse. All subjects will be instructed to irrigate both right and left nasal cavity with one -half of the 
content s of the nasal rinse once daily.  The subjects  will receive written instructions and a video 
prior to initiation of the intervention to ensure proper delivery.   
 
For participants randomized to  MF nasal spray, they will be instructed to  perform the following 
once daily:  nasal saline irrigation with lactose placebo capsules as outlined above im mediately 
followed by 2 sprays per nostril of MF nasal spray . For participants receiving MF nasal irrigation, 
they will be instructed to perform the following once dail y: nasal saline irrigation with 
mometasone capsules as outlined above immediately followed by 2 sprays per nostril of the 
placebo spray .  
 
Each study bottle (Mometasone capsule, placebo capsule, mometasone nasal spray, placebo 
nasal spray ) will be assigned  with a number from 1- 50. Only [CONTACT_265684]  will have a list that 
links the treatment type ( Mometasone  nasal irrigation arm versus mometasone nasal spray arm ) 
with the bottle number. The subject and the rest of the study team will remain blinded to the 
randomization assignment. [CONTACT_265684] is the biostatistician of the study and otherwise is not 
involved with the participants.  
 
In the event of a Serious Adverse Event determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_265657], the intervention assignment will be revealed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kallogjeri to the medical staff doctor 
caring for the patient. In the event [CONTACT_265684] is unable to be reached in a time needed, to

cost of a 30 day supply of placebo nasal spray will be $79/study participant. Therefore, t he cost 
for the active mometasone spray + placebo nasal irrigation will be $158/study participant and 
the cost for the placebo nasal spray + mometasone nasal irrigation will be $158/study 
participant.  
 
A randomized list will be provided to Advanced Rx and the medications mailed directly by

Mometasone  Nasal Irrigation  
Mometasone  is an anti -inflammatory glucocorticoid steroid that is used for a variety of common 
ailments. Among conditions related to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_265659], mometasone is used as an 
inhalational dr ug for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and nasal polyps. The mechanism 
of action of mometasone  is similar to other corticosteroids and includes a wide range of 
inhibitory activities against multiple cell types ( e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, 
macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (eg, histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and 
cytokines) involved in allergic - and non- allergic -mediated inflammation .28  
 
Subjects randomized to the mometasone nasal irrigation intervention arm will be required to mix 
2.4 mg of mometasone  into the sinus rinse bottle and rinse each nasal cavity with one half of 
the bottle (~ 4 ounces or ~120 ml) daily.   The inert ingredients are: loxasperse powder, which 
increases solubility and dispersibility of mometasone and is microbiologically safe; mannitol , 
which is widely used in pharmaceutical products as a capsule diluent; and Xylifos ™ powder , 
which  is a proprietary powder exc ipi[INVESTIGATOR_265660].  
 
Placebo Nasal Spray  
 The placebo nasal spray will be packaged in the same bottle as that of MF nasal spray. 
The nasal spray will prepared by [CONTACT_265678]: glycerin, microcystralline cellulose and 
carboxymethylcellulose sodium, sodium citrate, citric acid, benzalkonium chloride, and 
polysorbate 80. Subjects in the mometasone nasal irrigation arm will be instructed to first irrigate 
with mometasone followed by [CONTACT_265679].  
 
Mometasone Nasal Spray  
 
 Subjects randomized to the mometasone spray intervention arm will receive a 2 month 
supply of MF nasal spray (50 mcg/spray), which is commercially available as NasonexTM, but 
will be prepared for the study by [CONTACT_265680]. Participants will be instructed to use [ADDRESS_323100] to evaluate 
effects of exogenous corticosteroids on the HPA axis. The effects of mometasone nasal spray 
on the  hypothalamus -pi[INVESTIGATOR_265661] -adrenal (HPA) axis have been evaluated in 6 clinical trials in 
both adults and children (dose range 100 ug on ce daily to 400 ug twice daily) . In all [ADDRESS_323101]’s first visit. Subjects will then 
receive 0.25 mg of cosyntropin and 10 mg of mannitol reconstituted with 1 mL of 0.9% sodium 
chloride as an intramuscular injection to stimulate the adrenal cortex. Ser um will be drawn [ADDRESS_323102]-stimulation level is below 
the critical level of 18 µg/dL,  indicating an insufficient adrenal res ponse, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_265662]. With an abnormal cortisol level pre- intervention, the study 
participant will not be eligible for further participation in the study and the study coordinator will 
recommend that the partic ipant be evaluated by [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care physician.  
  
In the event that a post -stimulation level is below the critical level of 18  µg/dL indicating an 
insufficient adrenal response, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_265663] a referral to the study part icipant’s primary care physician. Study 
participants in either intervention arm will remain on the intervention until cosyntropin lab values 
are received and reviewed.  
 
Because certain medical conditions and me dications can affect the cosyntropin test and  result in 
spurious results, subjects will also be excluded from the test if they met any one of the following 
criteria: concurrent or recent use (within the past 30 days) of systemic corticosteroids; history of  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_136676]; morbid obesity  as measur ed by [CONTACT_43658]; concurrent or recent use of 
medications that accelerate the clearance of cortisol, such as dilantin, rifampin, amphetamines,

Exemption From IND Requirements  
The use of mometasone  in a nasal saline rinse is a change in the approv ed route of 
administration. An exemption from IND requirements will be requested as the proposed use of 
mometasone  in this study fulfills all of the criteria for exemption:  
 
 1. Mometasone  is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002] . 
 2.  This study is not i ntended to be reported to the FDA in support of a new indication or  
significant change in labeling.  
 3. This study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the  
drug.  
 4. The study  does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other  
factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk)  
associated with the use of mometasone . 
5. The study will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717]  
(21 CF R part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).  
 6. The study is not intended to promote or commercialize mometasone . 
 
 
Concomitant  Medications  
At the time of enrollment, subjec ts may  already be using a topi[INVESTIGATOR_265664] (ie., 
fluticasone or Flonase ®) or nasal irrigation.  Participants who have been previously using a 
nasal spray or nasal irrigation will be asked to discontinue use while enrolled in the study.  
 
Patient-reported Outcome Measure  
The SNOT- 22 (©2006, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) will be used to capture the 
physical, functional, and emotional consequences of rhinosinusitis .  The SNOT- 22 is a 
validated, patient -reported outcome measure applicabl e to chronic sinonasal conditions .33 The 
severity of 22 rhinosinusitis -related symptoms and physical signs are measured using a Likert 
scale as follows: 0= “ No problem ”; 1=”Very mild problem ”; 2=” Mild or slight problem ”; 
3=”Moderate problem ”; 4=” Severe problem ”; and 5=”Problem as bad as it can be”. Higher total 
scores on the SNOT- [ADDRESS_323104] worse patient functioning or symptom severity (score range: 0-
110). A minimally clinically improved difference (MCID) in symptom s that is perceptible and 
pertinent to the individual patient on the SNOT- [ADDRESS_323105] 9 points .33,34   
 
Primary Outcome Measure  
Study participants will be asked to complete the SNOT- 22 at baseline, two weeks, four weeks , 
six weeks, and eight weeks  following start of med ications . The SNOT- 22 score will be 
calculated as the average per item score for each of the 22 items and the value will range 
between 0 and 5.  For s ubjects who answer less than 22 items ( i.e., don’t completely answer the 
SNOT -22), the total score will be the average per item value for the items that were answered. 
The change in SNOT- 22 scores between baseline and eight  weeks will serve as the primary 
outcome measure in this study and will be cal culated as:  
 Primary Outcome Measure, ∆SNOT -22 = SNOT- 22baseline  — SNOT -228-week follow -up. 
To assess the trajectory of change within subjects randomized to the two treatment arms the 
baseline, two- week,  four-week, six-week, and eight -week  SNOT -[ADDRESS_323106] (UPSIT):  
The UPSIT is a test of olfactory identification and consists of four 10 -page booklets, with a total 
of 40 items. On each page, there is a diffe rent “scratch and sniff” strip and four choice options. 
Subjects are asked to scratch each strip with a pencil to release the scents, detect the smell, 
and identify the smell from the four choice options. The UP SIT comes from a scoring rubric that 
identifi es the normalcy benchmark based on age and gender. The UPSIT is commercially 
available, takes 10- [ADDRESS_323107] to assess smell 
identification. Subjects will complete the U PSIT at their baseline and final visit.  
 
Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) :  
The overall response to treatment will be measured with a modification of the Clinical Global 
Impression (CGI) scale.  32,35  Upon co mpletion of the study, subjects will be asked to answer the 
following question: " Overall, how would you rate your response to treatment ?"  Response 
options are: 1 = Very Much Improved, 2 = Much Improved , 3 = Minimally Improved , 4 = No 
Change, 5 = Minimally  Worse , 6 = Much Worse , 7 = Very Much Worse . 
In addition, subjects will be asked to rate their subjective sense of smell pre-  and post -
intervention.  
 
Questionnaire for Olfactory Dysfunction (QOD):  
The QOD is a validated quality of life questionnaire for patients with olfactory disorders. 
Subjects w ill complete the QOD at their baseline and final visit.  
 
Olfactory Dysfunction Outcomes Rating (ODOR):  
The ODOR is a quality of life measure capturing physical, functional, and emotional limitations 
specific to  smell loss. It is currently undergoing validation and is designed to be more concise, 
readable, and comprehensive than the QOD. Subjects will complete the ODOR questionnaire at 
their baseline and final visit.  
 
Physical Examination including nasal endoscopy performed for clinical purposes  The physical 
examinations will be done as part of routine care during the patients’ scheduled clinic visit.  The 
findings from the endoscopic examination  will be collected for research purposes and will be 
recorded using t he grading system proposed by [CONTACT_265681].[ADDRESS_323108] the results of the radiologic examination collected for research 
                                                                                                                                            Page 14 of 19

CT evidence of inflammation of the sinuses will be defined as mucosal thickening of at least one 
paranasal sinus and does not have to be severe enough to be classified as “partial 
opacification” or have a Lund and MacKay score of 1 or greater.  
 
Data Collection  
Sources of Research Material :  All research- related information , including responses to the 
selected patient -reported outcome measures, will be captured electronically ..  Week [ADDRESS_323109] linkage to REDCap™  (Research Electronic Data Capture) . All data will be stored in a 
specially designed database created by [CONTACT_265682] ™. Patient confidentiality  will be maintained through the use of unique patient ID.  
 
Assessment of Treatment  Efficacy : The change in the average SNOT -22 scores between 
baseline and eight  weeks will serve as the primary outcome  measure in this study and will be 
calculated as: 
 Primary Outcome Measure, ∆SNOT -22 = SNOT- 22baseline  — SNOT -228-week follow up . 
To assess the trajectory of change within subjects randomized to the two treatment arms the 
baseline, two- week, four -week , six-week, and eight -week  SNOT -22 assessment will be 
compared.  
 
Assessment of Treatment Safety : As described above, [ADDRESS_323110] to assess for effects of mometasone nasal irrigation on the 
HPA axis. Treatment  safety will also be assessed by [CONTACT_265683] -week participation.  
 
Risk Assessment : Mometasone has a potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid 
activity. As an inhaled product, mometas one has an onset of action in [ADDRESS_323111] 
between 1-4 weeks. The drug is well -tolerated and the more frequent side effects include: nose 
irritation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], lightheadedness, and upset stomach. At recommended daily doses in both 
pediatric and adult patients, no adverse effects were seen on the HPA axis.  29  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring: The Clinical Outcomes Research Office (CORO) created a set of 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the conduct of clinical research.  These SOPS are 
developed, in part, from and are compliant with Institutional guidelines for the conduct of human 
research.  The specific monitoring plan for this study is based on the potential risk of 
participation and size and complexi ty of the planned investigation.  Based on these 
considerations , this study will have a monitoring board comprised of  [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_265665]. 
                                                                                                                                            Page [ADDRESS_323112] every 6 months.  All reports of a  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or an Unexpected Adverse 
Event will be investigated by [CONTACT_244418]. All SAEs will be reported to Washington 
University HRPO.  
 
Statistical Analysis : Comparison of within subject difference in SNOT22 scores between 
baseline and eight -week  follow- up between the 2 treatment groups will be the primary outcome 
measure.  A clinically meaningful change is defined as a change of 9 or more  points  on the 
SNOT22 (scored as the average per item value for each of the 22 items) . The change in 
SNOT22 is calculated as: ∆SNOT -22 = SNOT- 22baseline  — SNOT -228-week follow -up. Independent 
samples t -test will be used to test for statistically significant difference in ∆SNOT- 22 between 2 
treatment groups. The statistical significance of the observed difference in the percentage of 
subjects who achieve a clinically meaningful difference will be assessed with the chi -square 
statistic .  The 95% confidence interval around the observed difference in the percentage of 
subjects who achieve a clinically meaningful difference will be calculated.  
 
To assess the time trajectory of change within subjects randomized to the two treatment arms, 
the baseline, 2 week , 4 week, 6 week, and 8 week SNOT -22 assessments  will be computed and 
compared.  Within group differences will  be compared using a repeated measure ANOVA. A 
general linear model (GLM) approach will be used to explore through the testing of an 
interaction effect (treatment group x time) whether the magnitude and pattern of change in 
SNOT -[ADDRESS_323113] regression model will be used if the assumption of the GLM model will not be met.  
The distribution of responses on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale will be calculated 
within each intervention arm and the difference in responses between the two intervention arms 
will be compared for statistical significance with the chi -square statistic.  
 
All statistical analyses will be  performed with the appropriate statistical  software  e.g. SAS, 
SPSS. Statistical significance will be defined as a two- tailed test of significance p value of 0.05 
or less.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265666] O'Brien and Fleming [ADDRESS_323114] of clinical trials will 
be followed. An Intentio n-to-Treat analysis will be used for the final data analyses.  
 
Sample Size Calculations : The sample size for this study was calculated based on achieving a 
difference of [ADDRESS_323115] with 80% power at 
the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a difference of 9 points or greater between the 2 treatment 
groups, a total of 50 subjects - 25 subjects per group-  will be necessary. With an antici pated 
15% drop out/non -compliance rate, the total sample size planned for this study will be 44 
subjects.  
Remuneration: Subjects will receive $ 50 after baseline and $[ADDRESS_323116], they will receive up to an additional $100. 
Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_323117] and another $[ADDRESS_323118].

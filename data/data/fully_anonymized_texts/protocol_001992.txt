CONFIDENTIAL  to dosing will be no more than 7 days ). For subject s randomized to the active arm of the study the maximum 
duration of treatment with FT218 will be 13  weeks incorporating up- titration over a period of 8  weeks with 5  weeks 
on stable dosing at 9.0  g/night. For subject s randomized to placebo, there is no exposure to the study treatment.  
A follow -up visit will occur at least [ADDRESS_320933] dose of FT 218 or placebo (i.e. Period  4, Visit 9, Week  15, 
Day 1 [+4/-0 (i.e. a minimum of [ADDRESS_320934] on  study dose )]). Additional follow -up for safety surveillance 
and management will be done for unresolved adverse events ( AEs) as determined by [CONTACT_1704].  
Number of Subjects:  
T
reatment:  
FT218 or placebo dosing will follow a 4 period up- titration as follows: FT218 4.5 g or placebo  daily for 1 week, 
FT218 6.0 g or placebo daily for 2 weeks, FT218 7.5 g or placebo daily for 5 weeks, and FT218 9.0 g or placebo 
daily for 5 weeks. Study drug will be taken orally at bedtime . 
Study Duration:  
There will be a 3 -week screening period, a 13 -week treatment period and a 1 -week follow -up period. Total duration 
of the stu dy will be approximately 17 weeks.  
Study Population:  
Male or female subject s 16 years of age or older; documented evidence of a diagnosis of NT1  or NT2 as, in part, 
determined by [CONTACT_263913] -day multiple sleep latency test ( MSLT ) with 2 or more sleep- onset rapid 
eye movement  (REM) periods  with mean sleep latency in the pathological range i.e . < 8 minutes (screening, Visit 1) 
and MWT < 11 minutes  (after 3 -week screening period) ; current continuing presence of EDS as defined by [CONTACT_263914] 3 months and an ESS >  10; for NT1 only, current continuing presence of cataplexy as defined by 
[CONTACT_263915] 3 months; subject s may use concomitant stimulants, but must comply with the following: 
they must be on a stable dose of stimulants for at least 3 weeks prior to starting the screening process for this study; 
AND they must use the same stimulant regimen throughout the entire study period, including during screening a nd 
posttreatment periods.  
Primary Endpoints : 
The primary criteria that efficacy determination will be based on include:  
• Longer MWT sleep latency  
• Improvement in CGI  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_263855]  
• Fewer cataplexy attacks as  recorded by [CONTACT_263916] D iary 
Secondary /Exploratory Endpoint s:

CONFIDENTIAL  Safety:  
Safety assessments includ e AEs, laboratory parameters, vital s igns, physical examination, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram , Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Statistical Analysis : 
A mixed -effects means model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze change f rom baseline for 
each of the co primary endpoints. Each model will include treatment, time, treatment– by [CONTACT_6491], site and 
baseline score as fixed effects and subjects as random effects.  
 
The primary hypothesis tests of the efficacy of individual doses will be performed as contrasts within the mixed 
models. The hypothesis testing will proceed in the following order: first, to test hypotheses for EDS, both MWT and CGI will be examined for statistical significance for the 9.0 g dose using the  data collected during Periods 3c(i) , and 
3c(ii). If both tests are significant, NCA for the same dose will be tested. If the first test fails (either MWT or CGI 
not significant), the data for the 9.[ADDRESS_320936] is significant (both MWT and CGI significant) but the second test (NCA) fails, the dose 
has been demonstrated to exceed placebo for EDS treatment but not for cataplexy. If both tests are statistically significant, the dose has been shown to be effe ctive for EDS and cataplexy.  
If the 9.0 g dose demonstrates efficacy for both EDS and cataplexy, the same sequence of testing will be followed for the 7.5 g dose using the data collected during Periods 3 b(i) and 3b(ii). If  the 7.[ADDRESS_320937] is reached via a step down procedure. Within each step , rejection terminates all subsequent 
hypothesis tests,  which will be deemed to be nonsignificant. A strictly exploratory analysis examining 
secondary/exploratory endpoints is also proposed to provid e evidence of consistency. The type I error rate for these 
endpoints will all be tested at the α  level of 0.05.

CONFIDENTIAL  6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Scientific Background  
6.1.1 Summary  
Sodium oxybate , also known as gamma -hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), was discovered in 1960. 
Sodium oxybate (GHB) is a metabolite of γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is synthesized by 
[CONTACT_263917] a neurotransmitter. Sodium oxybate is a central nervous 
system (CNS) depressant and produces dose -dependent sedation and anesthesia in laboratory 
animals. Sodium oxybate is currently indicated for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (EDS) in subject s with narcolepsy at doses up to 9.0 g/night. In 2002, the US 
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved Xyrem
® (sodium oxybate) oral solution as an 
orphan drug for the treatment of cataplexy in adult subject s with narcolepsy. In 2005, this 
approval was extended to the treatment of EDS for adults with narcolepsy. In Europe, sodium oxybate was granted Orphan Drug Designation in February 2003 (however, the orphan 
designation request has since been withdrawn), and the European Comm ission issued a decision 
in [ADDRESS_320950] s with 
narcolepsy that was extended in 2007 to treating EDS in adults with narcolepsy.  
As part of a recent meeting for the narcolepsy community initiated by [CONTACT_33438] ( FDA ), the FDA inquired “Assuming there is no complete cure for your 
condition, what specific things would you look for in an ideal therapy for your condition?” In an 
interim report circulated from the patient advocacy community, Unite Narcolepsy, summarizing 
the results from a patient survey with [ADDRESS_320951] statement responding to the FDA’s question was an excerpt from a patient response stating 
“A drug that would provide consistent and adequate control of the daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_263858] 1 dose taken at bedtime resulting in 8 hours of restorative 
sleep ”.
1 
Flamel Technologies has developed a drug delivery technology designed to extend and/or delay 
the absorption of a drug in order to control its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Based on this proprietary controlled- releas e delivery technology, Micropump
®, Flamel Technologies has 
developed a new formulation of sodium oxybate which is more convenient for the subject  in that 
it is dosed only once (i .e. at bedtime). The once nightly dosing is an improvement beyond the 
current approved dosing regimen for Xyrem that requires narcolepsy subject s to wake up in the 
middle of the night to take a second dose.  
6.1.2 Disease Under Treatment  
Narcolepsy is a chronic, life -disrupting neurologically- based sleep disorder characterized by 5 
major symptoms, EDS, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations  (HH) , sleep paralysis  (SP) , and 
disturbed nocturnal sleep  (DNS) . Narcolepsy is associated with increased morbidity,2,[ADDRESS_320952] s with narcolepsy, their families, and the healthcare system.10 
Narcolepsy is currently dichotomized by [CONTACT_263918] s-3 as 
either type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) or t ype 2 n arcolepsy (NT2).[ADDRESS_320953] (MSLT) indicating 2 or more 
sleep -onset rapid eye movement ( REM ) periods (SOREMs) and a mean sleep latency in the 
pathological ra nge (i .e. < 8 minutes), and/or low hypocretin ( ≤ 110 pg/mL). Type 2 narcolepsy is 
diagnosed in the absence of cataplexy and when hypocretin levels are greater than 110 pg/mL, but the other diagnostic criteria for NT1 are met, including EDS, a MSLT indicating 2 or more 
SOREM s and a mean sleep latency in the pathological range ( i.e. < 8 minutes), as well as the 
absence of another sleep disorder  that better explains the EDS.  
Narcolepsy is a rare disease, with 65,[ADDRESS_320954] a prevalence of 25 to 50 per 100,000 people and an incidence of 0.74 per 100,000 person -
years internationally.
12,13,14 Evidence indicates that NT1 is caused by [CONTACT_263919] (also 
called orexin) cells in the hypothalamus. Thus, the best biological marker for NT1 is the reduction or complete deficiency of hypocretin in the cerebros pi[INVESTIGATOR_872] . 
Over 92% of Caucasian subject s with NT1 carry the  human leukocyt es antigen 
(HLA) -DQB1*06:02, while HLA -DQB1*06:03 allele confers a strong protection.
15,16 The 
association with specific HLA alleles has allowed for the hypothesis that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease, and progress has been made further substantiating an autoimmune origin for N T1 including: 1) anti -TRIBBLES -2 antibodies
17, 2) elevated antistreptolysin O titers 
discovered close to disease onset18, and 3) the association with a polymorphism of T -cell 
receptor alpha gene and a polymorphism of the purinergic receptor P2RY11 gene.19 However, 
the mechanism for this autoimmune process remains unknown. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Symptoms of Narcolepsy 
The hallmark symptom of narcolepsy is EDS, and is hence required for the diagnosis of 
narcolep sy. It is also the most troublesome symptom and the one for which subject s most 
commonly seek treatment. E xcessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_263859], resulting in periods of involuntary sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_263860] “drowsiness” duri ng activities of daily living. In narcolepsy, EDS can exist despi[INVESTIGATOR_263861], is not caused by [CONTACT_263920], or persists when other conditions known to also cause EDS are treated. The chronic and severe nature of EDS predisposes these subject s to deficits in multiple areas of functioning. When 
alertness is compromised (i.e . sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_263862]), performance may be diminished across a 
variety of cognitive functions, work related safety may be compromised, and productivity and 
overall quality of life may suffer. It is possible the performance deficits may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_263863] -reported quality of life and difficulty with achievement in work and/or school. Beyond 
this, the sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_263864] s to socially withdraw, making 
relationships with family and frien ds difficult to maintain and potentially strained.  
Cataplexy, in the presence of EDS, is suggestive of NT1 and an indication for objective testing to 
confirm the diagnosis. Cataplexy is defined as a sudden muscle weakness epi[INVESTIGATOR_263865] 
a few muscl es (for example, facial muscles) or all skeletal muscles at once. As a result of the 
muscle weakness, subject s momentarily have head nodding from weakness in the neck muscles, 
sagging of the jaw, buckling of the knees, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_263866], and/or dysarthria or 
Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_320955] been combined to successfully identify cataplexy among 
cases and lack of cataplexy among controls with remarkable specificity. F or those with 
cataplexy, though, a wide range of emotions may be triggers, including surprise, rage, fear, 
enjoyment, love, accomplishment, and/or satisfaction from accomplishment ( e.g. winning in an 
athletic competition). Sometimes the emotions cause cata plexy in situations with a social 
component, meaning that others are involved in eliciting the emotion, including other family members, friends, children, and/or pets. At initial presentation and close to symptom onset, and especially in children and teenagers, the onset of a cataplexy attack may not be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_263867], termed atypi[INVESTIGATOR_263868].    
Cataplexy is the most narcolepsy specific symptom, and it is unclear as to how and why the frequency or  severity varies across subject s and may or may not change over time. Cataplexy is 
hypothesized to be a manifestation of REM  atonia in waking. Thus when these epi[INVESTIGATOR_263869] s and are perceived by [CONTACT_263921][INVESTIGATOR_1865] s with no memory of the cataplexy which preceded them. The onset of cataplexy 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_263870]. Less frequently it can occur years after the EDS. Aside 
from the emotional triggers for cataplexy attacks, w ithdrawal from REM suppressing drugs may 
also cause them.  
Additional symptoms completing the narcolepsy pentad include HH (vivid dreams at sleep onset 
or offset that are more often associated with negative emotions), and SP ( feeling unable to move 
the body during transition periods of sleep). These may occur simultaneously and are oft en 
frightening to the subject . More specific for narcolepsy is their occurrence at sleep onset. Like 
cataplexy, SP and HH are REM related phenomena. Thus, experiencing them at sleep onset is rare in the general population. Experiencing them at sleep offset may simply be an awakening from REM. Thus, their occurrence at sleep offset is seen in the general population. 
Disturbed nocturnal sleep (DNS) is the second most common symptom among narcolepsy 
subject s.
[ADDRESS_320956] s feeling 
poorly rested or that their sleep was not r efreshing. The contribution of DNS  to the EDS in 
narcolepsy is not well understood.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacologic Treatment O ptions  
Treatments for narcolepsy aim to relieve its symptoms, and are not directed towards any target 
known to be in the pathophysiological pathw ay of the disease.  Thus, treatment includes 
stimulants to relieve EDS, sodium oxybate for EDS and cataplexy, and REM suppressing drugs 
Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_320957] 2019  
CLFT218 -1501   Final v5.0  Page  18 of 97 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or 
monoamine oxidase inhibi tors (MAOIs) to relieve cataplexy as well as HH and SP. The severity 
of the symptoms can vary greatly from one person to another, and thus the response to any given 
medication is similarly varied from subject  to subject . 
Stimulants improve EDS in narcoleps y (eg, modafinil, armodafinil, methylphenidate, 
dextroamphetamine, or methamphetamine).21,[ADDRESS_320958] s who do not res pond satisfactorily to the 
“front line” stimulant options. Some subject s may need a combination of drugs or a mixture of 
short - and longer -acting medications for optimal treatment. This evidences the fact that while 
stimulants improve EDS they do not norm alize it. This is confirmed by [CONTACT_263922].
23, 24 
Potent REM suppressing drugs ( i.e. SSRIs, TCAs and MAOIs) are used to treat cataplexy as well 
as HH and SP; however, the efficacy of these drugs in treating cataplexy has not been established in controlled clinical studies , but is based on experience from  off-label use. Sodium oxybate 
(GHB ), was approved by [CONTACT_263923] [ADDRESS_320959] s with the same level of efficacy and safety as 
the current twice nightly therapy.  
6.2 Background to FT218 Controlled -Release Technology  
6.2.1 Sodium Oxybate Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics  
The active ingredient o f FT218, sodium oxybate, is a CNS  depres sant. Sodium oxybate is the 
nonproprietary name [CONTACT_263959], a metabolite of GABA, which is synthesized 
and accumulated by [CONTACT_263924]. It is present at μM concentrations in all brain regions 
investigated as well as in several peripheral org ans, particularly in the gastrointestinal (GI) 
system. Sodium oxybate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_263871] 25% due to a large hepatic first pass effect. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, following oral administration, the plasma levels of sodium oxybate increase more than 
proportionally with increasing dose. The clearance of sodium oxybate is almost entirely by 
[CONTACT_263925], which is then eliminated by [CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_1516]. On average, less 
than 5% of unchanged drug appears in human urine within [ADDRESS_320960] of sodium oxybate, 
Xyrem (NDA 021196) for treating EDS and cataplexy in subject s with narcolepsy. Flamel’s 
formu lation provides for a n extended -release of the active ingredient by [CONTACT_263926], Micropump. This technology is the same as that used for the marketed drug product Coreg CR
® (carvedilol, NDA 022012) for the treatment of hypertension, left ventricular 
dysfunction, and mild to severe heart failure. Coreg CR  has been marketed in the US  since 2007. 
The Micropump technology is designed to extend and/or delay the absorption of drugs, which 
allows more controlled regulation of the drug’s PK  profile. FT218 is intended to provide a 
formulation of sodium oxybate which is dosed once at bedtime rather than the twice nightly dosing regimen of Xyrem which is taken at bedtime and then again 2.[ADDRESS_320961]’s release mechanism and the differences between animal and human GI

CONFIDENTIAL  The submitted nonclinical data for Xyrem showed the safety of sodium oxybate in animal 
models, and it demonstrated transient drops in blood pressure (BP) as well as bradycardia. This was however limited to the species evaluated. Induced sleep from sodium oxybate, in both animal and man was found not to be accompanied by a decrease in oxygen consumption. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_263872]- wave/delta sleep is 
enhanced. A slight drop in body temperature was observed in rats given sodium oxybate. Some animal studies report apparent epi[INVESTIGATOR_44445] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_23935]/seizure -like) electroencephalography  
changes which have not been observed in human studies following sodium oxybate 
administration.  
Pharmacodynamic interaction during the concomitant administration of sodium oxybate with 
CNS depressants such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, and alcohol may result in additive increases in sedation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_263873]. They are thus contraindicated.  

Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_320963], FT218, which utilizes the company’s proprietary Micropump technology. The proposed innovation is clinically relevant as the current marketed product, Xyrem, has to be taken twice during the night, 2.5 to 4 hours apart, which is a li mitation.  
The FT218 Phase 1 study (study PKFT218-1301) confirmed the expected PK properties of the FT218 formulation i.e.  a release of the drug over at least [ADDRESS_320964]. The forced up-titration design of this study is 
expected to be particularly informative, allowing observations of efficacy and safety at 6.0, 7.5, and 9g doses. Three therapeutic doses will be tested under forced up- titration ( 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 g) 
since no concentration/response relationship is known. The study allows for forced dose 
increments at fixed times from 4.5 g/night followed by 1.5 g/night increments until the final 9.0 g dose is reached. Subjects will remain on the 4.5 g dose for 1 week, the 6.0 g dose for 2 weeks, the 7.5 g dose for 5 weeks and the 9.0 g dose for 5 weeks. Evaluations for efficacy and safety for 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 g will be done ove r a 12 -week period (total of 13 weeks on study drug) relative 
to the placebo group.  
The up- titration is based on the dosage schedule recognized as safe with Xyrem. A full efficacy 
assessment will occur for the 6.0 g/night dose after 3 weeks on study drug (including a titration 
from 4.5 g/night for the first week followed by 2 weeks at 6.0 g/night). The 7.[ADDRESS_320965] 2019  
CLFT218 -1501   Final v5.0  Page  25 of 97 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  assessment will occur after 8 weeks on study drug (including 1 week at 4.5 g and 2 weeks at 6.0 
g). A final titration occurs to maximum dose (i.e. 9.0 g). A full efficacy assessment will be done following 5 weeks on the final dose (that is following a total of 13 weeks on medication) relative to the placebo group. During both the 7.[ADDRESS_320966], Xyrem. All FT218 doses (6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 g) were selected for their safet y and efficacy profile in treating subject s with narcolepsy based on 
previous studies with sodium oxybate. In addition, results from the Phase 1 PKFT218-1301 study indicated that the study formulation is safe at 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 g/night in healthy volunteers. Given the PK characteristics of the current formulation of FT218, the proposed doses are not anticipated to be associated with any safety concerns.  
Full safety and efficacy of FT218 will be evaluated in this clinical study. A double-blind, 
placebo -controlled randomized methodology has been identified as the optimal design to support 
efficacy and safety evaluation.  
This FT218 clinical study has been designed to ensure conduct and analysis according to sound 
scientific principles to achieve study objec tives. Placebo has been selected as the choice for the 
control group, as this will optimize inferences drawn from the study. It will provide for an undiluted evaluation of total pharmacological and treatment effect ( i.e., study drug versus 
disease). In add ition, this approach lends itself to a smaller sample size requirement.   
Randomization will provide a means of assuring comparability of test groups  in expectation  and 
minimiz e selection bias, and the double- blind method will minimiz e risk of biased study 
outcomes. The set study enroll ment criteria, screenin g and baseline assessment, wash out 
requirements and on- treatment conduct and assessment will minimize variables that could 
influence outcome except for that of the study drug being evaluated. The proposed study population as defined by [CONTACT_263929] a consistent sample and one that is 
largely representative of the broader patient population with NT1 and NT2. Combined these will enhance the generalizability of the study results.   
The safety, dignity, and rights of study subject s predominate. It is thought that the proposed 
study design does not raise any ethical issues. The study is of appropriate duration for a chronic 
condition, there are no life-limiting effects from placebo, and study subjects can withdraw from the study at any time. This latter option will be made explicit during the informed consent process.

CONFIDENTIAL  summary from the Phase 1 safety study (discussed in Section 6.3) and to date are consistent with 
and similar to what has been previously reported with sodium oxybate.  
Clinical safety of Xyrem has been established and forms the basis for the FT218 safety plan. All 
causality and treatment- related events for Xyrem include: abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, 
vomiting, fatigue, peripheral oedema, anorexia, dizziness, headache, abnormal dreams, confused 
state, nightmare, sleep walking and enuresis. The most commonly identi fied AEs  for sodium 
oxybate are nausea, dizziness and headache. In terms of AEs  where there was a dose response 
relationship, these AEs  included nausea, vomiting, paraesthesia, disorientation, irritability, 
disturbance in attention, feeling drunk, sleepwal king and enuresis. These events are most 
pronounced at the higher, 9.[ADDRESS_320968] Coreg CR (carvedilol, NDA 022012) for the treatment of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction and mild to severe heart failure. T his has 
been marketed in the US  since 2007.  
In addition to clinical safety and efficacy, consideration to the risk- benefit profile as it relates to 
abuse potential warrants careful consideration. Flamel Technologies has considered the wider 
risks of abuse potential. Data relating to drug abuse potential of illicit forms of GHB, sodium oxybate and related products with abuse potential, underwent extensive review by [CONTACT_941] W orld 
Health Organization (WHO) E xpert Committee on drug dependence in 2012. At this meeting it 
was acknowledged that most GHB for abuse originates from clandestine manufacture and there was consensus on the associated narrow margin for safety. Outputs from Xyrem’s  risk evaluation 
and mitigation strategies  post marketing  data were also evaluated. The finding showed minimal 
abuse or diversion of Xyrem. Clinical study supply and distribution methods for FT218 will adhere to regulatory and current Good Clinical Practice ( cGCP) requirements. Within the clinical 
study framewor k a “closed system” of supply and distribution will be employed. Enhancement of 
this approach will be facilitated through implementation of study specific strateg ies to augment 
safety and mitigate abuse potential.  
FT218 will provide a beneficial and altern ative therapeutic strategy for subject s with narcolepsy. 
Sodium oxybate has a well characterized safety profile and is a known and establ ished 
therapeutic choice among  physicians for treating subject s with NT1 and NT2. Physicians are 
largely familiar with its use and application in clinical practice and the potential benefits of the sodium oxybate have been documented in the literature. The burden for the subject  enrolled in 
this study is concentrated but not significantly greater than that which they exper ience during 
routine clinical practice for disease management.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_320973] s with narcolepsy. Two populations of 
narcoleptic subjects will be studied in a single parallel group design: 1) NT1, and 2) NT2. 
The study treatment period from screening to follow- up will last approximately 17 weeks. There 
is a 3 -week screening p eriod, followed by a cen tral assessment of PSG and next-day MW T 
screening results  (may take up to 3 days). If the subject is eligible, then randomization occurs. 
After randomization, dosing must start within 5 days ( the window from randomization to dosing 
is to allow delivery of study drug to the site). There is a 13-week treatment period and a 1- week 
follow-up period. For subject s randomized to the active arm of the study the maximum duration 
of treatment with FT218 will be 13 weeks incorporating up- titration over a period of 8 weeks 
with 5 weeks on stable dosing at 9.0 g/night. For subject s randomized to placebo, there is no 
exposure to the study treatment.  
The follow-up study visit will occur at least [ADDRESS_320974] dose of FT218 or placebo i.e. 
Period 4 ( Visit 9, Week 1 5, Day 1 [ +4/-[ADDRESS_320975] on study dose] ). 
Additional follow- up for safety surveillance and management wil l be done for unresolved 
AE/residual effects of FT218 study drug following last dose as determined by [CONTACT_154953]/or sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Any other situation where, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_263880] , continuation of 
the study would not be in the interest of the subject  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Discontinuation of the study by [CONTACT_456]  
• Regulatory authority decision or change in Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/Institutional Review Board ( IRB) opi[INVESTIGATOR_263881] (if subject initiated w ithdrawal, this information must be voluntarily given by [CONTACT_1560]).

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_263882] a follow -up visit especially if any adverse event(s) 
remain unresolved.  
In the event a subject does not return for a scheduled visit after withdrawal, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]. This s hould be documented. Every effort to document subject 
outcome should be made.  
PSG and MWT are at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_263883]. Early withdrawal study 
subjects will be followed for a week after the last dose of study drug. All SAEs and nonserious 
AEs assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_263884].  
It will be left to the investigator ’s clinical judgement whether or not an AE is of nature, or 
severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment. A subject may also voluntarily 
withdraw from treatment due to what is perceived as an intolerable AE. If either of these occurs, 
the subjects must undergo an end- of-study assessment and receive appro priate care under 
medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  
Withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to lack of efficacy.  
If the subject withdraws due to a SAE, the SAE must be reported in accorda nce with SAE 
reporting requirements.  
Randomized subjects who have received at least 1  dose of study drug, who withdraw from the 
study prematurely will not be replaced.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Study subjects may not be pregnant or nursing during the course of this study as indicated in the inclusion and e xclusion c riteria. Subject s of childbearing potential include all females who are 
not postmenopausal for at least [ADDRESS_320989] 7 days before commencing FT218/placebo 
dosing. The results must be avai lable, documented and negative before the first dose of study 
drug is administered.  
After study drug is dispensed at Visit 3, urine pregnancy tests will be repeated at each study visit 
throughout the remainder of the study, including the final study visit  (Visit 9) or at the 
withdrawal visit if the subject  withdraws from the study. 
The investigator must report to the sponsor  any pregnancy occurring in a study subject, during 
the subject’s participation in this study.  The study Pregnancy Reporting F orm will be used. The 
report will be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE.  
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any 
abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported. In some circumstances, it may 
be necessary to monitor the development of the newborn for an appropriate period after delivery.  
Although pregnancy is not an SAE, and an elective abortion is not an SAE, any spontaneous 
abortion and/or any pregnancy that mee ts any regulatory serious criterion, or any pregnancy with 
an outcome for the pregnant person or the infant that meets regulatory serious criterion will be captured as an SAE.

The active ingredient of FT218, sodium oxybate ( GHB ), is a CNS depressant. Drug product 
formulations containing GHB that have no m arketing a uthorization are classified as Schedule I 
controlled substances  within the US. For all non- US sites classification across regions can vary, 
local/regional classification will apply.  
This study has been developed to ensure all local legal and regulatory requirements for the safe 
handling of Schedule I/Controlled Drug for all participating regions in the CLFT218- 1501 
clinical study are adhered to. 
8.4.1 Investigational Products Adm inistered  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Schedule I /Controlled Drug  Substance

safety for therapeutic use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS] FT218 Study Drug Risk Management   
The CL FT218- 1501 operational framework will be structured to mitigate safety, abuse, misuse, 
and diversion risks associated with FT218. The framework will:  
1. Safeguard subject safety and mitigate abuse, misuse, and diversion risk s, and minimize 
potential for public -health risk through the implementation of best practice handling and 
distribution processes and procedures  
Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_320991] safety , abuse, and misuse  potential  
[IP_ADDRESS] Specification for Managing Controlled Substances  
Systems and structures will be put in place to ensure compliance in the handling, distribution, 
prescription, and management of FT218. This will include :  
1. A “closed system” of FT218 distribution  
2. All study investigator s and investigative site facilities will be assessed and qualified in 
advance of site set up. Only investigative sites meeting requirements will be qualified for participation in this clinical study. All qualified investigative sites will be monitored on an ongoing basis for the duration of the clinical study to ensure ongoing compliance with 
all legal and regulatory requirements as applicable to the FT218- [ADDRESS_320992] education on FT218 handling 
4. Key investigator requirements include but are not limited to:  
a. Authorization to prescribe the FT218 controlled substance by [CONTACT_263937]  
b. Evidence of current registration (D rug E nforcement A gency  in the US, as per

CONFIDENTIAL  Placebo Match: Arm 2:  
Placebo kits and sachets will be identical in presentation and content feel to that of active drug. It 
will be labelled using the same strength dosages i.e.  3.0 and 4.5 g doses, with the exception of 
the Week 1 dosing kit, which will only contain a single dose strength of 4.5 g. Study subjects will be instructed on the reconstitution method identical to that of active study drug. Each allocated drug kit will supply study subjects with enough drug until their next scheduled study visit for assessment and resupply. No oversupply will be provided.  
Specifications of Study Drug Q uantities Supplied per K it per Dosing Week.  
Each study kit will provide enough study drug supply for the assigned dosing weeks. For weeks that require o vernight PSG and next-day MWT, as part of the full efficacy assessment 
requirement, study kit supplies will be modified to allow for study sites to dispense a single night time dose to subjects at the PSG laboratory. Kit supplies for such weeks will contain enough study drug for 6 nights of dosing in the home setting. Study drug dose for night 7 will be dispensed at the PSG laboratory.  
For all other weeks where there is no overnight PSG requirement study subjects will be supplied 
with the full quota of 7 nights drug supply for home dosing.  
Details of the specifications of study drug supply quantities for each week of dosing are 
presented in Appendix 17.2. 
Label ling 
FT218 and placebo will be dispensed to study subjects in a kit (s) containing study drug with 
sufficient drug supply to the next scheduled visit as detailed in Appendix 17.2.  
Label ling of both outer kit packaging and individual dosing sachets  for both FT218 and placebo 
will meet with all legal and regulatory labelling requirements . 
8.4.4 Method of  Assigning S ubjects to T reatment G roups  
The drug dispensing strategy will, where feasible, minimize quantities of study drug stored at site 
at any one time. This will be mediated thought a study specific interactive response technology (IRT)  system  (endpoint, San Francisco, US). 
Once the overnight PSG and next- day MWT has been completed, the results will be reviewed 
and scored by a central scoring laboratory ( Section 11.12). The targeted turnaround time for 
results following completion of MWT is ≤  [ADDRESS_320998] PSG and MWT eligibility has been 
received from the central scoring laboratory and all other study entry criteria are met, the PI/designee will randomize the study subject.   

Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_320999] randomization to the double -blind study period. The PI/designee enters the information 
into the IRT system, and the appropriate study drug is sent to the site. This process may take up to [ADDRESS_321000] i.e., Visit 3.  
1. Within 5 days of randomization where it took 2 days for the Central Scoring Laboratory 
to respond with the PSG/MWT eligibility response  
2. Within 6 days of randomization where it took 1 day for the Central Scoring Laboratory to respond with the PSG/MWT eligibility response  
As no oversupply of study drug will be provided. Study subjects will be reminded to adhere to 
the dosing schedule and assigned schedule of visits to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic. Periodically, electronic 
alerts via the ePRO systems will be sent to study subjects to promote compliance with the visit schedule and all dr ug handling and management requirements. 
Following randomization , study subjects will be treated with their assigned study drug for a total 
of [ADDRESS_321001] be stored at 25 °C with allowable excursions to 15° C to 30° C. 
As food significantly reduces the bioavailability of sodium oxybate , study subjects will be 
instructed to take their nightly dose at least [ADDRESS_321002]  visit scheduling and/or drug dispensing 
activities . 
Reconstituted product should be taken on the night it is reconstituted. In the event that reconstituted drug is not used it must be stored securely and returned to the study site at the next visit. Any reconstituted but unused study drug should not be substituted for the following nights dosing.  
Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_321003]  inadvertently fall s asleep but wakes 
again prior to taking their study drug, a delayed start may be possible  provided both  the 
following criteria are met: 
1. Study subjects feel awake enough to prepare and take the study drug as directed; and  
2. Study subjects have a minimum of [ADDRESS_321004] week of s tudy drug administration (Week 1 ) so 
that subject s are adequately prepared for the first up -titration  at the end of that week. Thereafter, 
a maximum of [ADDRESS_321005] will be assessed for potential withdrawal 
in conjunction with the sponsor.

during each of 8 activities on a scale from 0  through 3 (0=never; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=high). 
Higher total scores indicate a greater tendency to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
10.1.2 Safety Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Adverse events may include, but are not limited to the following: abnormal test findings, clinically significant signs a nd symptoms, hypersensitivity, any signs and/or symptoms from: 
drug overdose, drug administration/reconstitution error, any drug misuse, accidental exposure withdrawal, and or interactions, and exposure in utero.  
Symptoms and signs of clinical and functional deterioration as defined in study efficacy 
assessment criteria for subjects with NT1 and NT2 will be not be captured as AEs. These signs and symptoms will be captured in the context of efficacy assessments via the ePRO enabled Sleep and Symptom Daily D iary, CGI rating of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and on overnight PSG and next- day 5 
hour nap MWT and will be reported as part of the efficacy analysis.  
They include:  
• Excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• Number of cataplexy attacks 
• Disturbed nocturnal sleep 
• Nightly arousals  
• Sleep quality  
• Refreshing nature of sleep 
• Sleep paralysis  
All other signs and symptoms of clinical and functional deterioration as they relate to the 
underlying diagnosis of narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2), study drug, and concomitant medications , or 
other will be recorded as AEs. 

Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_321049] 2019  
CLFT218 -1501   Final v5.0  Page  63 of 97 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. AEs 
should be reported on t he appropriate page of the e CRF.  
Assessment of S everity  
Each AE will be  assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]:  
Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort , 
and does not interfere with everyday activities  
Moderate : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with norma l 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed  
Severe : An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of C ausality 
For each recorded AE or SAE, the investigator or designee must make an assessment of causality based on the following criteria to determine the rela tionship between the AE and study drug:  
 
Classification  Investigator’s 
Judgement  Definition  
Not Related:  
assigned when:  Not related  Where an AE or SAE is judged to be clearly and incontrovertibly due only to 
extraneous causes (e .g. disease, environment) and does not meet the criteria for 
study drug relationship listed under likely, possibly , or unlikely  
Unlikely  The AE or SAE is unlikely related to the study drug, when the AE or SAE (the 
first [ADDRESS_321050] be met):  
• Does not fol low a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug  
• May readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject 
• Does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug  
• Does not reappear or w orsen when the study drug is re administered  
Related:  
assigned in any 
other cases when:  Possibly  The AE or SAE is possibly related to the study drug, when the connection to 
the study drug appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. This 
causal relationship is assigned when the AE or SAE (the first [ADDRESS_321051] be 
met):  
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug  
• May have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental, 
or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
• Follows a pattern of response to the suspected study drug.  
Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_321052] 2019  
CLFT218 -1501   Final v5.0  Page  64 of 97 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   
Related:  
assigned in any 
other cases when:  Related  The AE or SAE is considered related to the study drug, when the connection to 
study drug can be made with a high degree of certainty. This causal relationship 
is assigned when the AE or SAE (the first [ADDRESS_321053] be met):  
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug  
• Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes 
of therapy administered to the subject  
• Disappears or decreases upon cessation or reduction in dose (note that 
there are important exceptions when an AE or SAE does not disappear 
upon discontinuation of the study drug, yet drug relatedness clearly 
exists [e.g. bone marrow depression or tardive dyskinesia ]) 
• Follows a known pattern of response to the suspect study drug  
• Reappears upon re challenge  
 
If the investigator determines that the causality is unknown, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_263903] a causality 
of “Possibly” for the purposes of reporting. The causality must be clearly documented in the subject’s medical notes and e CRF and report in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements 
if applicable.  
Action T aken  
The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the e CRF, as follows:  
• None 
• Study drug stopped 
• Study drug temporarily interrupted  
• Concomitant medication  
• Other, specify.  
Adverse Event Outcome 
The investigator will assess the outcome of the AE or SAE as follows:  
• Fatal (the subject has died)  
• Resolved (the AE or SAE has ended)  
• Ongoing (the AE has not ended)*  
• Unknown (lost to follow -up after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_423])  
* An AE outcome can only be categor ized as ongoing if the AE is: 
• Ongoing at the end of the reporting period: improved, stable or worsening  
• Ongoing: improved, stable , or worsening, and referred to the subject’s physician or a 
specialist.  
Flamel Technologies     [ADDRESS_321054] 1 week after study 
completion or 1 week after premature withdrawal. Baseline events (i .e. medical history events 
that are ongoing) captured at the first study visit will only be recorded as AEs if during the 
screening  and assessment period or double -blind period there is  deterioration.  
Information regarding all AEs, including SAEs, will be collected at each visit. All AE/SAEs that are encountered during the protocol specified AE/SAE reporting period will be followed to their 
resolutions, until the investigator assesses them as stable, or the subject  is lost to follow -up.  
Adverse events will be identified as treatment- emergent (TEAE) if the event occurs or increases 
in severity after the first dose of study drug is taken.  
Adverse events considered related to study drug at the E OS or Early Withdrawal Visit ( if 
applicable) will be followed until the subject  is stable or the AE is resolv ed or the subject  is lost 
to follow -up. 
Adverse event data will be obtained at all study visits scheduled or unscheduled. Reporting will 
be based on information provided spontaneously by [CONTACT_127205]/or through questioning of the 
subject .  
To elicit AEs, questioning at each study vis it should begin with simple nonleading questions.  
For example:  
• How have you felt since your last visit?  
• Have you had any health problems since you were here last?  
Complete an d appropriate data on all AEs experience (observed, volunteered or elicited) during 
the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the Adverse Event Form pages of the 
eCRF.  
The following information regarding any AE s will be determined and documented by [CONTACT_1275].  
• Subject number  
• The event  (diagnosis preferred)  
• The relationship of the AE to the study drug (causal relationship)

CONFIDENTIAL  • Study drug information 
• Seriousness (serious or not serious)  
As the quality and precision of acquired AE data are critical, investigators will use the AE 
definitions provided in the protocol and will observe the following guidelines when describing adverse ev ents in the Adverse Event Form pages of the e CRF .  
• Whenever possible recogni zed medical te rms will be used to describe AE s rather than 
colloquialisms (for exa mple, “influenza” rather than “f lu”) and abbreviations will be 
avoided  
• Adverse events occurring secondary to other AE s (e.g. sequela or complications) will be 
identified by [CONTACT_86187]. A primary AE , if clearly identifiable, generally represents 
the most accurate clinical term to record in the eCRF. The investigator will provide his/her 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_263904]  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_321056] that, at any dose,  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred, i .e. it does not include a reaction that might have caused 
death if it had occurred in a more serious form)  
• Requires or prolongs inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . (Complications occurring during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263905] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63336] a preexisting nonworsening 
condition is not, however, considered an AE . The details of such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s must be 
recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF)  
• Results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity . (An AE is incapacitating or 
disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to 
carry out normal life functions)  
• Resu lts in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
In addition, medical and scientific judgement is required to decide if prompt notifi cation is 
required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above . This may include  any event that 
the investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopard ized the subject or required intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed above, or 
that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , or precaution that may be 
associated with the use of the investigational product . 
Reporting of S erious A dverse E vents 
If a SAE occurs, the CRO /sponsor  is to be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the event by 
[CONTACT_093]. If the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to the CRO/ sponsor  must be 
made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This timeframe also

as to the initial and follow -up reporting of e xposure in utero cases.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere) the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of 
his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the CRO/ sponsor  
in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an investigator may 
be requested by [CONTACT_2024]/ sponsor  to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the SAE form. It will describe the SAE in enough detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case. Additional information concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the CRO/ sponsor .

11.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The material in this section provides the basis of the s tatistical analysis plan (SAP) for this study. 
A complete SAP has been prepared to accompany this protocol for submission to the FDA for 
the Special Protocol Assessment. Details are provided therein.  
11.2 Definition of the Analysis Populations 
The target population is individuals in need of treatment of EDS and cataplexy in subjects with narcolepsy. The full analysis population for efficacy is the intent- to-treat (ITT) population 
including all randomized subjects with at least one efficacy measurement after receiving  the 6 .0 
g dose (whether FT218 or placebo). 
11.2.[ADDRESS_321065] (DSMB) will be appointed to review and 
assess study conduct and safety for the duration of the clinical study. 
11.3 Analysis Sets  
The ITT and per protocol (PP) populations form the bases for the evaluation of effi cacy. The 
safety (S) population forms the basis for the evaluation of safety  
11.3.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population includes all randomized subjects with at least one efficacy measurement 
after receiving the 6 .0 g dose (whether FT218 or placebo). A valid diary measurement is defined 
to include at least [ADDRESS_321066] for the ITT population. Subjects wi ll be assigned to treatment arms  in the analysis as randomized.  
11.3.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population includes all subjects in the ITT population reduced by [CONTACT_263945] . These are, i nclusion or exclusion criteria 
not satisfied ( Section 8.3.2 and Section 8.3.3); deviations related to study drug administration, 
deviations to the schedule of visits and procedures , or deviations related to non-permitted 
concomitant medications ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Subjects will be assigned to treatment arms  as 
randomi zed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety (S) Population  
The S population includes all subjects that receive at l east one dose of study drug. Subjects will 
be assigned to treatment arms  based on the treatment actually administered  (FT218 if active drug 
was administered at any time, placebo otherwise) . 
11.4 Description of Statistical Analysis  
The formal statistical analysis and specific dose/placebo contrasts will be based on a mixed -
effects repeated measures model. Descriptive statistics characterizing the study population and the observed outcomes will be produced.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.1 General Considerations  
All statistical tests will be performed using a 2- tailed 5% overall significance level, unless 
otherwise specified. Descriptive statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_263946] a summary 
across both treatment arms.  
11.4.2 Use of Analysis Sets 
For the primary statistical analysis of efficacy endpoints, the ITT will be used; a supportive analysis will be carried out on the PP population unless it is essentially the same as the ITT population, if the difference in sample sizes is less than 10%. All safety endpoints analysis will be conducted on the S population. 
11.4.[ADDRESS_321068] Disposition  
The number of subjects within each treatment arm of each analysis population will be 
summarized. The number of subjects entering each period of the study will be tabulated along with the number of subjects who withdraw. The timing of withdrawal and reasons for withdrawal (Section 8.3.4) will be summarized  by [CONTACT_263947] p eriods in the randomized stage.

 Safety Analysis 
Safety evaluation will be conducted on the S population and using the same evaluation period as 
for efficacy analysis.  
Safety will be evaluated based on reports of AEs  either spontaneously reported or observed in 
clinical laboratory analyses. They will be coded according to the MedDRA . 
Adverse events will be summariz ed based on number and percentages of subjects with any AEs , 
SAEs , and permanent withdrawal from the study. Adverse events will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_263948].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Data 
Laborato ry data will be summarized in terms of the proportions of subject s with clinically 
relevant abnormalities using normal ranges. Shift tables will tabulate baseline to most extreme post baseline value. Summary statistics of raw data and change from baseline values , including 
means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges will be produced. Analyses will include all subjects in the S population who have had at least one laboratory test performed after the first study drug administration with an available baseline laboratory value. Baseline values will be measured as the last available measure before taking study drug.

The DSMB will be governed by a charter which will define the deliberative processes of the 
group, including event triggers which would necessitate an unscheduled review, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], unblinding, and any voting procedures to initiate any data review. Confidentiality of internal discussions and activities will be upheld with a systematic reporting process to sponsor and dissemination process to all study investigators, IEC/IRB s and regulatory authorities as 
appropriate. The membership of the DSMB will reflect necessary clinical, scientific, and related disciplines necessary to interpret data from the clinical study to allow for full evaluation of study

Study Number   OPI-NYXRM -302  
Clinical Phase   Phase 3   
Type of Study   Randomized, parallel -arm, double -masked, placebo -controlled study of the 
safety and efficacy of  Nyxol  (0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution) to 
reverse  pharmacologically  induced  mydriasis in healthy subjects   
Name [CONTACT_60294]® Eye Drops – 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution    
Duration of Study    2 days,  including screening/treatment  and follow -up  
Rationale   Nyxol  is a once -daily preservative -free eye drop formulation of 
phentolamine, which is a non -selective alpha -[ADDRESS_65260]  alpha -1 agonists (eg , 
phenylephrine, hydroxyamphetamine), by [CONTACT_60222] (eg, 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]) or with a combination (eg, Paremyd®, which is 
1% hydroxyamphetamine hydrobromide and 0.25% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]). 
Nyxol, either by [CONTACT_60223] -[ADDRESS_65261] of muscarinic blocking, 
can expedite the reversal of pharmacologically  induced mydriasis prior 
to natural reversal.   
Study Objectives   The objectives of this study are:   
• To evaluate the efficacy of  Nyxol  to expedite the reversal 
of pharmacologically  induced  mydriasis  across  multiple mydriatic 
agents , with an emphasis on  phenylephrine   
• To evaluate the efficacy of  Nyxol  to return subjects to baseline 
accommodation after worsening  with cycloplegic 
agents  tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60181]   
• To evaluate the systemic exposure of Nyxol based on 
pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling  
• To evaluate the safety of  Nyxol   
• To evaluate any additional benefits of the reversal  of 
pharmacologically  induced  mydriasis   
The Sponsor intends to  use this Phase 3 registration study to 
evaluate  Nyxol  for the indication “the treatment of pharmacologically  
induced mydriasis produced by [CONTACT_60224] (phenylephrine) or 
parasympatholytic (tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]) agents, or a combination thereof.”

Visit Schedule    At Visit 1 , subjects will be screened for study eligibility. After screening, 
eligible subjects will be rand omized 2:1 to one of the 2 treatment arms 
(Nyxol  or placebo , respectively ) and will  receive 1 of 3 approved mydriatic  
agents  approximately 1 hour prior to receiving study treatment. 
Randomization will be  3:1:1 to  mydriatic agent  (2.5% phenylephrine, 1% 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424], or Paremyd, respectively ). Each subject will receive  1 drop of 
mydriatic agent in each eye. At Visit 1,  measurements as defined  in Table  
1 will be made before ( -1 hour /baseline) and  60 minutes  after (max  pupil 
dilation /0 minutes) the mydriatic agent instillation in each eye (ie , right 
before t he study treatment is administered) . Additionally , measurements 
will be taken  at 30  minutes, 60 minutes , 90 minutes,  2 hours, 3 hours, 
4 hours, and 6 hours  after study  treatment dosing.    
At Visit 2  (Follow -Up Visit ), which is 1 day after Visit 1,  measurements as 
defined in  Table 1 will be measur ed 24 hours after study treatment dosing.    
Number of  
Investigational Sites   Approximately  16 sites  
Sample Size 
Justification   A sample size of approximately  330 subjects  (approximately 220 treated 
with Nyxol) in this study  will result in a total of >  300 subjects treated with 
Nyxol in the reversal of mydriasis  program  (including prior studies) ; this 
number of subjects  is needed to meet the minimum number of subjects 
exposed to Nyxol to assess safety in this population. The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be met if subjects  show a positive effect for  Nyxol  (α = 0.05, 
two-tailed).  A total of 330 subjects (Nyxol, n=220; placebo, n=110) will 
provide  > 90% power to detect a  difference of  25% between  the Nyxol  and 
placebo arms in percentage of subj ects returning to ≤ 0.2 mm  from baseline 
pupil  diameter at 90  minutes. This calculation is based on a  20% placebo 
effect  and a 45% Nyxol  treatment effect.   
Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint   Percentage of subjects’  study eyes  returning to ≤ 0.2 mm  from  baseline  
(-1 hour) photopic  pupil  diameter  at 90 minutes   
Secondary Efficacy 
Endpoints   Secondary efficacy endpoints  (for the study eye  and the fellow  eye, unless 
otherwise specified ; and binocular for select ed visual acuity  
measurements ) will include:   
• Percentage of subjects returning to  ≤ 0.2 mm  from baseline  
(-1 hour) photopic pupil diameter at each remaining time  point 
(0 minutes, 30 minutes,  60 minutes, 90 minutes [fellow eye ], 
2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours)

• Change in glare discomfort  from max pupil dilation  (0 minutes ) at 
60 minutes,  2 hours , and 6 hours  (study eye)  
Measurements:   
• Pupil  diameter  and pupil lary light reflex  will be measured  with 
a NeurOptics  VIP-300 pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]  (mm)  
• Accommodation will be measured by [CONTACT_60228] 
(RAF)  Near Point Rule (measured in cm and then converted 
to diopters ). Unchanged accommodation from baseline ( -1 hour) is 
defined as a change from baseline value  ≥ -1, as measured in 
diopters  
• Glare testing will be performed using the Marco BAT 2000  
• Glare discomfort will be  measured on a 4-point scale from 0 (none) 
to 3 (severe)  
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population will be used for the 
primary endpoint analysis and to analyze selected secondary efficacy 
endpoints. The Per Protocol (PP) Population will be used to analyze 
selected se condary efficacy endpoints.  Some of the efficacy endpoints will 
be analyzed overall, by [CONTACT_60229], and by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides at all time 
points.  
Safety Endpoints   The primary safety measures are  conjunctival hyperemia, impair ment  in 
visual acuity  (BCDVA  and distance -corrected near visual acuity 
[DCNVA ]), subjective ocular tolerability,  and adverse  events (AEs). 
Other  safety  measures  include  intraocular  pressure  (IOP),  subject  
questionnaire,  and systemic  safety  as measured  by [CONTACT_60231].

CONFIDENTIAL  16  09/23/[ADDRESS_65275] is Nyxol® Eye Drops – 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution ( 0.75% POS ) 
(herein refe rred to as Nyxol), a non -selective alpha -[ADDRESS_65276]. Note 
that the concentration of 0.75% refers to phentolamine free base and is the same  as and used in 
place of “1% phentolamine mesylate ophthalmic solution ”, which was how Nyxol had been 
described in  all studies prior to the End of Phase 2  meeting in mid -2020. Placebo control is 
Nyxol vehicle alone.  
2.2. Findings  from  nonclinical  and clinical  studies  
Detailed findings from nonclinical and clinical studies and potential risk are provided in the 
Investigators’ Brochure (IB ) (2021 ). 
Nyxol has been assessed in [ADDRESS_65277] 1 dose of Nyxol . 
In prior clinical trials, Nyxol  has demonstrated a consistent ability to decrease pupil  diameter  
(PD)  by [CONTACT_3450] 20% (~1  to 2 mm) in both mesopic and photopic conditions  with rapid 
onset and durable effects to 24 to 36 hours  (OP-NYX -01a2 CSR ; OP-NYX -SNV CSR ; OPI-
NYXG -201 CSR ; OPI-NYXRM -201 CSR ; Karpecki 2021 ; Pepose MIRA -2 2021 ; Pepose  
VEGA -1 2021 ; Pepose ORION 2021 ).    
Nyxol was observed to be well  tolerated in all studies  at single -doses and multiple daily doses for 
up to 14 days . Safety of the patients in these trials was evaluated by [CONTACT_60235] ( AE) 
monitoring, ophthalmic examinations , and vital sign assessments. Across all  trials, there were no  
treatment -related serious adverse events ( SAE s). No deaths occurred in any of the  trials. No 
clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital signs, including 
blood pressure  (BP)  and heart rate  (HR) . Adverse event s reported were mild to moderate in 
severity , with the most common being transient conjunctival  hyperemia and ocular irritation; 
however, Nyxol dosing at or near bedtime was observed to mitigate or minimize these side 
effects during the daytime.  
Phase 2  Reversal of Pharmacologically Induced Mydriasis Stud y (MIRA -1) 
In OPI -NYXRM -201 (MIRA -1), 32 heal thy subjects  were  randomized at Visit 1 in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive 1 drop of 1% Nyxol  (1% Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution)  or 1 drop of 
placebo (vehicle) in both eyes ( OU) at Visit  1 and 1 drop of the alternative study medication  OU 
at Visit 2. One hour before administration of study medication, subjects received 1 drop OU of a 
mydriatic agent ( 2.5% phenylephrine  or 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] ) to dilate their pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324] . Each subject 
received the s ame mydriatic agent throughout the study.  Pupil diameter  (PD)  was measured 
30 minutes  and 1 hour, 2 hours , 4 hours , and 6 hours after dosing at Visit  1 and Visit 2 and 
compared to baseline.  
In this study, Nyxol demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PD from max pupil 
dilation  (0 minutes  [60 minutes after mydriatic agent] ) compared to placebo  at 1 hour, 2 hours, 
4 hours, and 6 hours  after treatment . These statistically significant  (p<0.0001)  and clinical 
meaningful (typi[INVESTIGATOR_37497] 1 mm reduction) PD reductions were observed at each time  
point, including when stratified by [CONTACT_60236] (tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]) and adrenergic 
(phenylephrine) agents.  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.      OPI-NYXRM -302
                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  17  09/23/21 Additionally, Nyxol was effective at re turning a statistically significant percent of subjects’ eyes 
to baseline PD  compared with placebo treatment at every time  point with estimable results, 
regardless of whether the PD threshold used was ≤ 0.5 mm from  baseline (2 -hour time  point) or 
the more stringent, ≤ 0 mm from  baseline (4 -hour and 6 -hour time  points). The reduction in time 
needed to achieve reversal of mydriasis in either eye was statistically significant with Nyxol 
treatment compared with placebo treatment, regardless of the threshold exa mined or the 
mydriatic agent used. In this study, Nyxol led to an average time -savings of 2.2 hours to return 
PD to ≤ 0 mm from  baseline  compared to placebo . Additionally, 40% of subjects given 
phenylephrine and 30% of subjects given tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60188] a  time-savings of more than 
[ADDRESS_65278]-hoc analysis , a statistically significant  difference was observed in the  percentage of 
subjects return ing to baseline  in the Nyxol  group  compared to the placebo group (after dilation 
with either phenylephrine or tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] ) at 2 hours ( 29% vs 13%, respectively; p=0.03). This 
difference favoring Nyxol widened (68% for Nyxol and 23% for placebo) at 4 hours ( p<0.0001).   
In this study, t here were no severe AEs, with only mild -to-moderate conjunctival hyperemia that 
resolved in most subjects  within  6 hours.  
Phase 3 Reversal of Pharmacologically Induced Mydriasis Study (MIRA -2) 
The OPI-NYXRM -301 study  (MIRA -2) was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo -
controlled, double -masked clinical trial. In MIRA -2, 185 healthy subjects aged  ≥ 12 years from 
12 sites were randomized 1:1 to receive Nyxol or placebo  (2 drops in the study eye and 1 drop in 
the fellow eye) , 1 hour after pupil dilation with 1 of 3 mydriatic agents  (2.5% phenylephrine, 1% 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424], or Paremyd) . The primary endpoint of an increase in the percent of study eyes 
returning to baseline PD at 90  minutes after Nyxol compared to placebo was met  (Figure 1A 
[green box ]). For subjects in the Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT ) Population treated with Nyxol, 
49% had PD return to ≤ 0.2 mm from baseline at 90 min utes compared to only 7% of subjects 
treated with placebo ( p<0.0001). At 60 minutes, 28% of study eyes in subjects who received 
Nyxol had returned to baseline PD, compared to only 2% of participants who received  placebo. 
The differences in percent of patients returning to baseline were statistically significant across all 
time points from 60 minutes through 6 hours  (p<0.0001 ; Figure 1A). Additionally, multiple 
secondary endpoints  met statistical significance , including m ean PD, which  was significantly 
smaller  with Nyxol  compared with placebo at all timepoints after 30 minutes ( p<0.0001 ; Figure  
1B). Finally, t he mean time to return to baseline PD for subjects in the Per Protocol ( PP) 
Population was ~2 hours in Nyxol -treated study eyes compared to ~[ADDRESS_65279] ance visual acuity ( BCDVA ). 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs or SAEs. Vital signs were not affected by [CONTACT_60237]. Nyxol was also well tolerated in the pediatric population, with AEs in a single subject, 
who reported transient mild pain upon Nyxol instillation OU.

From  Baseline . B. Mean  Pupil  Diameter  Across  Time  Points.

2.3. Design  justification  
Pupil size is under the control of 2 opposing sets of muscles – the circular constrictor muscles 
controlled by [CONTACT_60238], controlled by [CONTACT_60239]  (Steinhaue r 2004 ; Yoshitomi 1985 ). The radial dilator muscles 
contain predominantly α -1 adrenergic receptors that can be inhibited by α -1 antagonists  (Yu 
2002 ); therefore , it is possible to inhibit dilation of the pupil through blockade of the radial 
dilator muscles.  
Pharmacologically induced mydriasis is achieved either by [CONTACT_60240] -1 agonists ( eg, phenylephrine , hydroxyamphetamine ) or 
by [CONTACT_60241]  
(eg, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424])  or with a combination (eg, Paremyd®, which is 1%  hydroxyamphetamine 
hydrobromide and 0.25%  tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]) . Pharmacologically  induced mydriasi s is commonly used 
to facilitate clinical examination of the retina and other intraocular structures. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
pharmacologically  induced mydriasis dilates the pupil to 6 to 8  mm, with effects lasting 6 to 
24 hours. However, factors such as an individual’ s iris pi[INVESTIGATOR_60189] , which ranges from hours to days. During this time, individuals may experience 
sensitivity to light, blurred vision, or cycloplegia (loss of accommodation via the temporary 
paralysis of the mu scle that allows the eye to focus on near objects). Accelerating mydriatic 
reversal after an eye exam may reduce the duration of these side  effects and be beneficial for 
many patients.  
Phentolamine is a non -selective alpha -[ADDRESS_65280] exam.  
Although accommodation will be studied across various mydriatic agents, a decrease in the 
amplitude of accommodation with mydrias is would only be expected with the use of mydriatic 
agents that inhibit muscarinic receptors , includ ing tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60190] P aremyd . These drugs  elicit

                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  19  09/23/[ADDRESS_65281] action on 
sympathetic nerve receptors located on the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60191] e of the iris, and as such would 
not be expected to cause  material changes in accommodation.  
In previous reversal of pharmacologically induced mydriasis clinical stud ies (MIRA -1 and 
MIRA -2), Nyxol was effective at inducing reversal of mydriasis with both adrenergic 
(phenylephrine) and parasympathetic (tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]) mydriatic agents , as described previously . 
The placebo outcomes in these studies  demonstrate d that the natural reversal of mydriasis takes 
longer with tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60192]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_60193], Nyxol was able to 
reverse mydriasis faster in the vast majority of eyes regardless of the mydriatic agent used , but it 
worked faster for phenyleph rine (an alpha -[ADDRESS_65282]) , as expected given the pharmacology of 
Nyxol  (an alpha -[ADDRESS_65283]) .  
Alpha -[ADDRESS_65284] been shown to be safe and effective for the pharmacological 
reversal of mydriasis. In 1990 , the [LOCATION_002] (US)  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) 
approved Dapi[INVESTIGATOR_60194] 0.5% (Rev -Eyes) for this indication ; 
however, the product was withdrawn and discontinued by [CONTACT_60242].  Many people who undergo pupil dilation for an annual ophthalmic 
examination or other ophthalmic procedure continue to request an option for rapid reversal of the 
mydriasis.  If Nyxol is a safe and effective treatment for the reversal of mydriasis, this may  
provide a new option for patients who experience side  effects of pupil dilation.  
2.4. Route  of administration,  dosage  regimen,  and treatment  period  
As the intended route of administration for Nyxol  is topi[INVESTIGATOR_31439], this is the route to be used in 
this study.   
The dos ing of Nyxol selected for this study, 0.75%, was based upon  1) preclinical safety studies , 
2) previous ophthalmic clinical studies  of Nyxol described above  and in the IB, and 3) clinical 
studies conducted with varying doses of drugs in the same class .  
Note that 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution, which expresses the phentolamine mesylate 
concentration in free base, is the new nomenclature being used in place of “1% Phentolamine 
Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution ”, which was how Nyxol had been  described in MIRA -1. 
2.5. Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with 
International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Guidelines for  Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) , the 
ethical principles set forth in the Declarat ion of Helsinki , and with the US Title [ADDRESS_65285] s ≥ 12 years of age will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 masked treatment arms  (Nyxol or placebo , respectively ). Randomization will 
be stratified 1:1 by [CONTACT_60230]/dark color irides  (Appendix 1 ) and further randomized 3:1:1 to  
unmasked mydriatic agent  (2.5% phenylephrine , 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] , or Paremyd , respectively ). 
Subjects will be recruited from approximately 16 investigational sites.

CONFIDENTIAL  20  09/23/21 3. OBJECTIVES  AND  PURPOSE  
The MIRA -3 study is a randomized, parallel -arm, double -masked, placebo -controlled study of 
the safety and efficacy of Ny xol (0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution) to reverse 
pharmacologically  induced mydriasis in healthy subjects.  
The objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol to expedite the reversal of pharmacologically  induced 
mydriasis across multiple mydriatic agents , with an emphasis on phenylephrine  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol to return subjects to baseline accommodation after 
worsening with cycloplegic agents tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60195]  
• To evaluate  the systemic  exposure  of Nyxol  based  on pharmacokinetic  (PK)  sampling   
• To evaluate the safety of Nyxol  
• To evaluate any additional benefits of the reversal of pharmacologically  induced mydriasis  
The Sponsor intends to use this Phase 3 registration study to evaluate Nyxol for the in dication 
“the treatment of pharmacologically  induced mydriasis produced by [CONTACT_60224] (phenylephrine) 
or parasympatholytic (tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]) agents, or a combination thereof.”  
4. STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a randomized, parallel -arm, double -masked,  placebo -controlled Phase [ADDRESS_65286] will be randomized to mydriatic  agent (unmasked) and treatment (masked). 
Treatment  randomization will be  2:1 (Nyxol  or placebo [vehicle], respectively). 
Stratification  by [CONTACT_60225] 1:1 (light or dark  irides) as shown in  Appendix 1 .  
The mydriatic agent randomization will be 3:1:1  (2.5% phenylephrine, 
1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424],  or Paremyd, respectively).  That is,  approximately 60% of the randomized 
subjects will receive 1 drop of 2.5% phenyl ephrine  OU 1 hour before treatment  (198 subjects), 
approximately 20% will receive 1 drop of 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60182] 1 hour before treatment 
(66 subjects), and approximately 20% will receive 1 drop of Paremyd  OU 1 hour before 
treatment (66  subjects).  Study treatm ent (Nyxol or placebo)  will be administered OU [ADDRESS_65287] 2 drops of study treatment (Nyxol or placebo) 
administered in the study eye (right eye [OD]). Each drop will be instilled [ADDRESS_65288] only 1 drop of study treatment administered in the fellow eye (left eye [OS]).    
The study eye and fellow eye will both be evaluated at  all assessments unless otherwise 
specified.    
Blood sampling for Nyxol PK measurements will be conducted in a  subset of approximately 
[ADDRESS_65289] study sites.   
4.1. Primary  and secondary  endpoints  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects’ study eyes  returning to ≤ 0.2 mm 
from  baseline (-1 hour) photopic pupil  diameter  at 90 minutes.

                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  21  09/23/21 The study  eye is defined  as the right  eye (OD).  The fellow  eye (also  referred  to as the non-study 
eye in MIRA -2) is defined  as the left eye (OS).  Unless  specified,  the study  eye and fellow  eye 
will both be evaluated  at all assessments.  In addition,  binocular  will be evaluated  for selected  
visual  acuity  measurements.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include:  
• Percent age of subjects returning to ≤ 0.2 mm  from baseline  (-1 hour)  photopic pupil 
diameter  at each remaining time  point ( 0 minutes, 30 minutes , 60 minutes , 90 minutes 
[fellow eye ], 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours)  
• Change (in mm) in photopic pupil diameter  from max  pupil  dilation  (0 minutes) at each

• Percentage  of subjects  with unchanged  (within  ± 4 letters)  BCDVA  under  glare  
conditions  (BAT ) from  baseline  (-1 hour)  at 0 minutes,  60 minutes,  2 hours,  and 6 hours  
(study  eye) 
• Change in glare discomfort  from max  pupil  dilation  (0 minutes) at 60 minutes, 2 hours , 
and 6 hours (study eye)  
Measurements:  
• Pupil  diameter  and pupil lary light reflex  will be measured  with a Neur Optics  VIP-300 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]  (mm)  
• Accommodation  will be measured  by [CONTACT_60243]  (RAF ) Near  Point  Rule  
(measured  in cm and then converted  to diopters ). Unchanged  accommodation  from  
baseline  (-1 hour)  is defined  as a change  from  baseline  value  ≥ -1, as measured  in 
diopters  
• Glare testing will be performed using the Marco BAT 2000  
• Glare discomfort will be  measured on a 4-point scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)  
Some of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall, by [CONTACT_60229], and by [CONTACT_60230]/dark 
irides at all time  points. Each mydriatic agent will be analyzed individually, and an additional 
analysis combining 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60197] a “tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60198] ” 
group will be  performed. Additional  analyses may be performed to compare efficacy endpoints

Measurements:  
• Conjunctival hyperemia will be assessed visually with a 4-point grading scale (0 -3) using  
CCLRU images ( Appendix 2)  
• Best-corrected distance visual acuity will be measured in photopic conditions by a 
standard Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) illuminated chart (on 
wall or stand) at 4 m (letters recorded)  
• Distance -corrected near visual acuity  will be measured in photopic conditions by [CONTACT_60244] 914 Illuminator Cabinet (light box)  at 
16 inches  (~40 cm)  (letters  recorded)   
• Subjective ocular tolerability  will be  measured on a 4 -point scale  (0-3) 
• Intraocular pressure  will be  measured with the Tono -Pen or Goldmann applanation 
tonometer

7. ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  
7.1. Specification  of the efficacy  parameters  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects’ study eyes  with 2 drops of treatment  
returning to ≤ 0.2 mm baseline (-1 hour) photopic pupil diameter  at 90 minutes.  
The study eye is defined as the right eye (OD). The fellow  eye is defined as the left eye (OS). 
Unless specified, t he study eye and fellow  eye will both be evaluated at all assessments. 
Specified  endpoints will also be analyzed for both eyes.  Secondary efficacy endpoints can be 
found in Section 4.1.  
The mITT Population will be used for the primary endpoint analysis and to analyze selected 
secondary efficacy endpoints . The PP Population will be used to analyze selected secondary 
efficacy endpoints.  Some  of the efficacy  endpoints  will be analyzed  at all time points  overall,  by 
[CONTACT_60260],  and by [CONTACT_60230]/ dark irides.   
7.2. Assessing,  recording,  and analyzing  efficacy  parameters  
Pupil diameter will be measured at Treatment Visit 1  and at Follow -Up Visit 2 . Accommodation , 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60199] , glare testing (BAT) , and glare discomfort will all be measured  only at 
Treatment Visit 1 . 
• Pupil diameter and pupil reactivity will be measured with the Neur Optics VIP-300 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]  (mm)  
• Accommodation will be measured by [CONTACT_60261] ( measured in cm and then 
converted to diopters ). Unchanged accommodation from baseline ( -1 hour) is defined as a 
change from baseline value ≥ -1, as measured in diopters  
• Glare testing will be performed using the Marco BAT 2000  
• Glare discomfort will be  measured on a 4-point scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)  
The photopic lighting conditions in the room will be defined as lights off with ambient light 
coming from the distance ETDRS  illuminated  chart (on wall or stand) [ADDRESS_65299] at a luminance 
level of 85 cd/m2 (or 85 lux) . Subject s will be allowed to acclimate to these lighting conditions 
(with the eyes open normally for a minimum of 2 minutes ) prior to the PD, BCDVA , and 
DCNVA (safety measures) measurements at all scheduled time  points. Subject s will sit in the 
exam chair facing the illuminated chart during the acclimation period and for all assessments. 
Scotopic PD will be measured OD with room lights and illuminated chart off and OS occluded. 
BAT testing will be performed OD with OS occluded. Room lights will be off with the distance 
ETDRS chart illuminated . Room lights should be turned on for accommodation measurements 
and for the rem aining safety assessments (eg , conjunctival hyperemia, AEs, brief subject 
questionnaire, etc.). The subject will be in the same room for all assessments, and every effort 
will be made to have the same person perform the measurements at all time  points.  
Some of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall, by [CONTACT_60229], and by [CONTACT_60230]/dark 
irides at all time  points. Each mydriatic agent will be analyzed individually, and an additional 
analysis combining 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60205] i nto a “tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60198] ”

CONFIDENTIAL  35  09/23/21 9. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
9.1. Specification  of safety  parameters  
The assessment of safety and tolerability is a secondary objective of this study. The assessment 
of safety will be performed by: 
• Conjunctival hyperemia  measured with CCLRU images  using a 4-point scale  (0-3) 
(Appendix 2). 
o None (0) = Normal ; appears white with a small number of con junctival blood 
vessel  easily observed  
o Mild (+1) = Prominent , pi[INVESTIGATOR_60207] -red color of both the bulbar and palpebral 
conjunctiva  
o Moderate (+2) = Bright, scarlet red color of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva  
o Severe (+3) = Beefy red with petechiae, dark red bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva 
with evidence of subconjunctival  hemorrhage   
• Subjective ocular tolerability  measure d on a 4 -point scale  
o 0 – No discomfort  
o 1 – Mild discomfort  
o 2 – Moderate discomfort  
o 3 – Severe discomfort  
• Best-corrected distance visual acuity  will be measured in photopic conditions by a 
standard ETDRS illuminated chart (on wall or stand)  at 4 m (letters  recorded)   
• Distance -corrected near visual acuity  will be measured binocularly in photopic conditions 
by [CONTACT_60263] 914 Illuminator Cabinet (light 
box) at 16 inches (~40 cm) (letters  recorded)  
• Intraocular pressure  will be  measured with the Tono -Pen or Goldman n applanation 
tonometer  
• Heart rate  and BP (as per the site’s normal equipment and procedure s) 
• Adverse event s 
• Brief subject  questionnaire  (Appendix  3) 
9.2. Assessing,  recording,  and analyzing  safety  parameters  
The timing for recording safety parameters may be found in  Section 4.2. 
9.3. Adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  
All AEs and SAEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit should be collected 
and recorded on the AE or SAE eCRF page . Only treatment -emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs) /adverse reactions will be summarized  (Section  10.3.6 ). 
All AEs/adverse reactions occurring during the study (ie , once the subject  has signed the 
informed consent /assent ) must be documented, regardless of the assumption of causal 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.      OPI-NYXRM -302
                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  36  09/23/21 relationship, on the respective eCRF. All  TEAEs/adverse reactions must be documented from the 
time the subject  receives the study medication until the subject ’s participation in the study has 
been compl eted. If a subject  has ongoing TEAEs/adverse reactions at the time of study 
completion  or discontinuation from the study , the ongoing TEAEs/adverse reactions are to  be 
followed and provided appropriate medical care until the signs and symptoms have remitte d or 
stabilized or until medical assessments  have returned to acceptable or pre -study limits.   
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and end date, severity, relationship 
to study medications , action(s) taken, seriousness , and outcome.  
9.3.1.  Adverse  event  definitions  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
Adverse event . An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a study 
medication  in humans, whether or not  considered drug related . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease 
temporari ly associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study 
medication. Study medication includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the 
comparator product or vehicle placebo that is given or administered during any phase of the 
study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatmen t are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results 
constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463] -ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic assessment /visit, study personnel should ask the following 
question: “Have you had any problems since your last assessment /visit?”. Adverse event s also 
may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_60264].  
Life-threatening adverse event or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction . An AE or 
suspected adverse reaction is con sidered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Ocuphire , its occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have  caused death.  
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Ocuphire,  it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  AE 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]  
• Persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  
life functions   
• Congenital  anomaly/birth  defect   
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.      OPI-NYXRM -302
                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  37  09/23/21 • Other  medically  important  serious  event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may requi re medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a p re-existing condition  that is 
unrelated to the medication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not 
considered an SAE.  
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug Application  safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is consi dered  “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or  elsewhere in 
the current application, as amended.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs 
or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological proper ties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
The study medication relationship  for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_60265]:  
• Not related  
• Unlikely related  
• Possibly related  
• Probably related  
• Definitely related  
• Unknown  
Unless the relationship is considered to be “Not related” or “Unlikely related” and there is any 
valid reason, even if undetermined , for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“related ”.  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the study medication  is determined by [CONTACT_60266] “Not related ” or “Unlikely related” the event will be considered to be 
related to the study medication  for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
Severity  of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discom fort of an AE as is 
determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423] . The assessment of severity  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.      OPI-NYXRM -302
                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  38  09/23/21 is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild: present, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activity  
• 2 = Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change  in severity  for a reported  AE will require  an end date for the previous  severity  and a 
new start and end date for the new severity.  For example,  a change  in severity  may go from  mild 
to severe  or from  severe  to moderate.  In either  case the start or end times/ dates  should  be 
recorded.   
The term “severe”  is used to describe  the intensity  of an event/reaction;  the event/reaction  itself  
may be of relatively  minor  medical  significance  (such  as a severe  headache) . This is not the same  
as a “serious”  AE, which is based  on a subject/event  outcome  or action  criteria  usually  associated  
with events  that pose a threat  to the subject’s  life or vital functions.  “Seriousness ” (NOT  
severity)  serves  as a guide  for defining  regulatory  reporting  obligations.  
Action  taken in response to an AE is coded as:  
• Dose increased : An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60267]; 
either by [CONTACT_60268], strength , or amount  
• Dose not changed: An indication that a medication schedule was maintain ed 
• Dose reduced: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_58413], 
either by [CONTACT_60268], strength , or amount  
• Dose interrupted: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60269] a prescribed reg imen of medication  
• Drug withdrawn: An indication that a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication  
• Not applicable: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context  
• Unknown: Not known, not obser ved, not recorded, or refused  
Additional other action taken:  
• Concomitant  medication  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60208]: 
• Fatal : The termination  of life as a result  of an AE 
• Not recovered/not  resolved : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  
that the event  has not improved  or recuperated  
• Recovered/resolved : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  that the 
event  has improved  or recuperated

                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  39  09/23/21 • Recovered/ resolved  with sequelae : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  where  
the subject  recuperated  but retained  pathological  conditions  resulting  from  the prior  
disease  or injury  
• Recovering/resolving:  One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  that 
the event is improving  
• Unknown:  Not known,  not observed,  not recorded,  or refused  
In previous clinical studies of Nyxol , the most frequently reported AE was conjunctival 
hyperemia.  
Investigators are cautioned to use the appropriate verbatim term on the AE form to 
describe this observation:  
• Redness related to instillation that is transient (ie, is no longer present 2 hours after 
instillation) = “conjunctival erythema upon instillation ” 
• Redness that is NOT transient (ie, is present 2 hours after instillation) = 
“conjunctival hyperemia”  
Expedited  reporting  of Serious  and Unexpected  Adverse  Events : All SAEs  (related  and 
unrelated)  will be recorded  following  subject  signature  [CONTACT_60298] /assent  and until 
the Follow -Up Visit  (Day 2). Any SAEs  “suspected”  to be related  to the study  medication  and 
discovered  by [CONTACT_60270].  
Any SAE  that occurs  must  be reported  to the clinical  research  organization  (CRO ) within  
[ADDRESS_65308]  should  be maintained  at 
the site with a copy  emailed  to [EMAIL_1175] . The Investigator  must  assess  the 
SAE  relationship  and complete  the SAE  form.  The CRO  may request  additional  information.  
Follow -up information  (eg, discharge  summary)  will be retained  in the subject ’s chart  and a copy  
will be emailed  to [EMAIL_1175] . In addition,  all SAEs  should  be recorded  on 
the AE eCRF  page  with the serious  question  marked  “Yes”.  
It is the Investigator’s  responsibility  to notify  the approving  IRB of any SAEs  on a timely  basis  
as instructed  by [CONTACT_60271] ’s determination  of causality.  All subjects  who 
experience  an SAE  should  be followed  clinically  and undergo  the appropriate  diagnostic  
evaluations  until stabilization  or resolution  of the event.  Ocuphire  will report  all SAEs  to the 
FDA  on the appropriate  schedule  depending  if the event  is drug related, not drug related,  
expected,  or unexpected  (based  on the available  information  in the IB). 
Any death  occurring  during  the study  and follow -up period  must  be reported  as an SAE.  For any 
death  occurring  through  the end of the study,  regardless  of the degree of relationship  to study  
medication , the SAE  resulting  in the death  must  be reported  to the CRO . A death  occurring  after 
completion  of the study  including  the Safety  Follow -up Visit s, that is not reasonably  associated  
with study  medication  administratio n, does not require  completion  of the SAE  form.

CONFIDENTIAL  40  09/23/21 9.3.2.  Follow -up of subjects  after  adverse  events  
If an AE/adverse reaction occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as 
deemed appropriate. All SAEs  ongoing  at the time of the last visit or discontinuation from the 
study will be followed up  until the AE/adverse reaction is resolved or stab ilized, the subject is 
lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event.  
10. STATISTICS  
A detailed presentation of the statistical approach  is outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
10.1. Sample  size 
A sample size of  approximately  330 subjects  (approximately 220 treated with Nyxol) in this 
study will result in a total of >  300 subjects treated with Nyxol in the reversal of mydriasis  
program  (including prior studies) ; this number of subjects  is needed to meet the minimum 
number of s ubjects exposed to Nyxol to assess safety in this population.  The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be met if subjects  show a positive effect for Nyxol (α = 0.05 significance, two -
tailed ). A total of 330  subjects (Nyxol , n=220; placebo, n= 110) will provide > 90% power to 
detect a difference of 25% between the Nyxol and placebo arms in percentage of subjects 
returning to ≤ 0.2 mm from baseline PD at 90 minutes. This calculation is based on a 2 0% 
placebo effect and a 45% Nyxol treatment effect.  The assumptions for this power calculation are 
estimated from the MIRA -2 Phase 3 results.  
All subjects  will be randomized  into the study  in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment  arms  (Nyxol  
or placebo , respectively ), with a 1:1 stratification  by [CONTACT_60230]/dark  irides  (equal  number  of light and 
dark irides  stratified  across  treatment  groups) . Furthermore,  subjects  will be randomized  into the 
study  at a ratio of 3:1:1  to mydriatic  agent  (2.5%  phenylephrine,  1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424],  or Paremyd , 
respectively) . Therefore,  if 198 subjects  are randomized  to 2.5%  phenylephrine,  then 66 subjects  
will be assigned  to 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60190] 66 subjects  to Paremyd,  resulting  in 330 total subjects.   
10.2. Analysis  Populations  
Modified Intent -to-Treat  Population : The mITT  Population will include all randomized 
subject s who received [ADDRESS_65309]-treatment PD measurement during  Visit 1. The mITT  Population will be used for the 
primary endpoint analysis and to analyze selected secondary efficacy endpoints , with subjects 
included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they actually received . 
Per Protocol Population : The PP Population include s all subjects in the mITT Population who 
had 2 drops of study treatment in the study eye, had all  scheduled PD measurements during Vi sit 
1, had an increase of > 0.2 mm in  PD in the study eye at 0 minutes  compared to baseline 
(-1 hour), and had  no major pro tocol deviations. The PP Population will be used to analyze  
selected secondary efficacy endpoints , with subjects included in their randomized treatment 
regardless of the treatment they actually received .  
All Randomized Population (AR P): The AR P will include all randomized subject s. This 
population is also known as the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population . The AR P will be used in 
confirmatory efficacy analyses , with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless 
of the treatment they actu ally received . 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.      OPI-NYXRM -302
                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  41  09/23/21 Safety Population  (SP): The SP will include all randomized  subject s who received at least 
1 drop of study treatment . The SP will be used to summarize safety variables , using  the treatment 
they actually received . 
Pharmacokinetic Population:  The PK Population will include all subjects who had at least one 
PK sample take n at any post -treatment timepoint . 
10.3. Statistical  methods   
10.3.1.  General  considerations  
All continuous variables will  be summarized by [CONTACT_60272] (as applicable) using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All 
categorical variables will  be summarized by [CONTACT_60272] (as applicable) using 
frequency co unts and percentages.  
All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject , and time  point (as applicable).  
All statistical tests will be performed using a  significance level of 5% (two -tailed). The p-values 
for the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints  will be considered descriptive.  
10.3.2.  Demographic  and baseline  characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, race, and sex will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_60273] , PP Population , SP, PK Population , and the AR P. 
These data will also be provided in by -subject  listings . 
10.3.3.  Subject  disposition  
Subject  disposition, including randomization, completion , and withdrawal from the study , will be 
summarized using the AR P. These data will also be provided in by -subject  listings . 
10.3.4.  Medical  history  and prior/concomitant  medications  
Medical history will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA)  and will be summarized by [CONTACT_60274].  
Prior medications (medications with an end date prior to the date of randomization) and 
concomitant medications (medications with a start or end date after the date of randomization) 
will be coded us ing WHODrug and will both be summarized by [CONTACT_60274]. 
Medical history  and prior and concomitant medications wil l also be provided in by-subject  
listings .  
10.3.5.  Analysis  of efficacy  
Efficacy will be assessed using the mITT  and PP Populations , with subject s included in the 
treatment arm into which they were randomized . For the analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, imputation will be performed for missing data as described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan. If the analysis using the mITT Population shows a positive effect for Nyxol at the 
0.05 level of significance, the primary endpoint will be considered met.  Confirmatory analyses 
may be performed using the AR P, with imputation performed for missing data. For the analysis 
of the secondary efficacy endpoints, only observed case data will be used.  
For all efficacy endpoints, baseline is defined  as -1 hour prior to treatment  on Visit 1 . Max pupil 
dilation  is defined as 0 minutes, during which maximum PD is expected .  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.      OPI-NYXRM -302
                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  42  09/23/21 All efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], study day , and time  point ( -1 hour 
[baseline] , 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes , 90 minutes , 2 hour s, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hour s, and  
24 hours ), as appropriate.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects  returning to ≤ 0.2 mm from baseline  
(-1 hour) photopic pupil diameter  at [ADDRESS_65310] an inc rease of >  0.2 mm  in pupil diameter  in the study eye at the max pupil dilation  
(0 minutes)  will not be counted in the PP Population as returning to ≤ 0.2 mm  from  baseline 
pupil diameter . The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model 
with treatment , mydriatic agent , and light/dark irides  as factors and the baseline  pupil diameter  as 
a covariate. T he percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting th e criteria  and the odds 
ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval  (CI) and p -value will be provided.  The analysis  will be 
performed using the mITT and PP  Populations , with subjects included in their randomized 
treatment regardless of the treatment they actua lly received.  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be completed using a logistic 
regression model with treatment  as a factor and the baseline  pupil diameter  as a covariate ; the 
mydriatic agent  and irides type are excluded from this  model.  
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  are indicated  in Section  4.1.  
Each of the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints  will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) , with change from baseline as the dependent variable, treatment , 
mydriatic agent , and light/dark irides  as factors , and the respective baseline ( -1 hour) value 
included as the covariate . Note that most  secondary efficacy endpoints are in relation to baseline 
(-1 hour), whereas some endpoint s are in relation to max  pupil dilation  (0 minute s). Each 
ANCOVA will be performed using the mITT  or PP Population s (as specified in the S tatistical 
Analysis Plan), with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment 
they actually received. The output from each ANCOVA will include the least squares mean 
(LSM ) and standard error  for both treatment groups, along with the placebo -corrected LSM , its 
95% CI , and associated p -value.  
A comparison of the study eye and fellow  eye for each subject will be completed for the primary 
efficacy endpoint, as well as by [CONTACT_60275]/dark irides .  
For each of the secondary endpoints related to p ercent age of subjects achieving certain criteria, 
the analysis will be performed using a logistic regression model with treatment, mydriatic agent , 
light/dark irides  as factors , and the respective baseline  as a covariate . For each analysis, the 
percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criteria  and the OR with 95% CI and 
p-value will be provided. For these endpoints, the mITT and PP  Populations will be used , with 
subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of the t reatment they actually 
received.  
The analysis of the time (hours) to return to ≤ 0.2 mm from baseline pupil diameter  (time -
savings analysis) endpoint will be performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model , 
with treatment, mydriatic agent, ligh t/dark irides  as factors , and the baseline pupil diameter  as a 
covariate.  
In addition, secondary efficacy endpoint s will be analyzed by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides and by [CONTACT_60276] a  factor , as 
appropriate . Each mydriatic agent will be analyzed individually, and an additional analysis

CONFIDENTIAL  43  09/23/21 combining 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60197] a “tropi[INVESTIGATOR_60198] ” group will be 
performed.  Other subgroups , such as age, sex, and race, may be analyzed as well . If there is 
sufficient sample, analysis  of selected efficacy  endpoints will be completed for the subgroup of  
pediatric subjects.   
10.3.6.  Analysis  of safety  
Safety will be assessed using the SP , with subject s included in the treatment gro up they actually 
received regardless of their randomized treatment. Observed case data will be used; no 
imputation will be performed for missing safety data.  
Safety  endpoints  are indicated  in Section  4.1.  
For HR and BP, baseline is defined as the screening  value. H eart rate  and BP values  and change 
from baseline in the values  will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571]  (screening , 
6 hours, and  24 hours).  
Observed values and change from baseline ( -1 hour) in conjunctival hyperemia at each time  
point (0 min utes, 30 minutes , 60 minutes , 90 minutes , 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 h ours, 6 hours, and 
24 hours) will be summarized for the study eye  and the fellow  eye. Treatments will be compared 
using the same ANCOVA model proposed for the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Conjunctival hyperemia will also be summarized categoric ally. 
Visual acuity assessments (BCDVA  and DCNVA ) will also be summarized at selected  time 
point s (BCDVA at 0 minutes, 60 minutes , 2 hours,  6 hours, and 24 hours ; DCNVA at 0 min utes, 
90 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours ) using the number of letters  correctly identified . 
Letters will be recorded and may later be converted to logMA R by [CONTACT_60277] . One letter is equivalent to 0.02 logMAR. As a reference f ive letters is represented by 
1 line. Treatments will be compared using the same ANCOVA model proposed for the 
continuous secondary efficacy endpoints.  Distance -corrected near visual acuity  will also be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_60278] a model that does not include the mydriatic agent as a factor.  
For IOP, baseline is defined as the screening value. Observed values and change from baseline in 
IOP at 6 hours will be summarized for the study eye  and the fellow  eye. Treatments will be 
compared using the same ANCOVA model proposed for the continuous secondary effica cy 
endpoints . 
Ocular tolerability values will be summarized by [CONTACT_60279]  
(0 minutes ). Additionally, the categories “No Discomfort” and “Mild Discomfort” will be pooled 
into a single category and summarized descriptively, as will  the categories “Moderate 
Discomfort” and “Severe Discomfort”. Treatments will be compared for the 2 pooled categories 
using a Fisher’s exact test.  
Subject  questionnaire values will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]  (overall and by [CONTACT_60280] ) and time  point  (-1 hour, 0 minutes, 60 minutes , 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours) . 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be coded using  MedDRA.  Only TEAEs  (those  that occur after 
the first dose of study medication or increasing in severity after initiation of s tudy medication ) 
will be summarized . Treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs will be summarized  by [CONTACT_1570], 
by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) , severity, and relationship to study medication. Deaths, withdrawal 
from study medication due to AEs, and withdrawal fro m the study due to AEs will each b e 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Note that in MedDRA, ocular events are coded to the SOC of

CONFIDENTIAL  44  09/23/21 “special senses” . Thus , using SOC in the summaries will provide a separation of ocular and non -
ocular AEs. 
All safety data will be provided in by -subject  listings.  Safety  tables  and listings for pediatric 
subjects may be  provided.  
10.3.7. Analysis of P harm acokinetics  
Nyxol plasma concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_60281]. Individual subject PK data will be listed.  
10.4. Procedure  for accounting  for missing,  unused,  or spurious  data  
For the summarization and analysis of the prima ry efficacy endpoint , imputation will be 
performed for missing data as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan . For the summarization

13.  ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  AND  GOOD  CLINICAL  PRACTICE  
COMPLIANCE   
13.1. Good Clinical  Practice  compliance  
The proposed study is subject to all applicable governmental rules and regulations concerning 
the conduct of clinical trials on human subject s. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to , 
the approval of I RBs, the Helsinki Declarat ion, US FDA law, ICH GCP Guidelines, obtaining 
prospective informed consent, monitoring of the conduct of the study and the completeness of 
the eCRFs  by [CONTACT_60283](s), and appropriate record retention by [CONTACT_737].  
13.2. Institutional  Revie w Board  
This protocol, materials used to recruit subject s, and materials used to document consent /assent  
must be approved by [CONTACT_60284]. Written IRB approval must 
adequately identify the protocol and informed consent /assent . In addition to approving the 
protocol, the IRB must also approve the Subject  Information and Consent /Assent /Parental

                     MIRA -3 
CONFIDENTIAL  45  09/23/[ADDRESS_65312]  enrollment into the study.  
13.3. Protocol  deviations/ violations  
The Investigator should not deviate from the requirements of this protocol without prior written 
approval of the Medical Monitor or Sponsor except in the event of a medical emergency.  
A reportable protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the protocol that involves 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, rights , or welfare, or has the potential to affect 
the integrity of the data. Examples of major protocol deviations  include study enrollment  by 
[CONTACT_60285] , loss of key data such as equipment  malfunction  (eg, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]), and/or use  
of a prohibited medication  during the study .  
All protocol deviations will be reported by [CONTACT_60286]. 
Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB -specific guidelines. If 
there is any question as to whether the deviat ion is reportable, Ocuphire or its designee and the 
IRB should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
All changes to the protocol will be made by [CONTACT_60287], submitted to the FDA, and approved by [CONTACT_14226] .  
Changes implemented without prior approval will be considered protocol violations.  
13.4.  Informed  consent  and assent  requirements  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each adult subject . A signed assent form will be 
obtained for all minors ages 12 to 17, as well as a separate parental/Legal Guardian consent. A 
copy of the signed and dated consent /assent  document will be given to each subject  or parent 
guardian . The original signed and dated informed consent /assent  document must be maintained 
in the study files at the Investigator’s site.   
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that no subject  is subject to any study -related 
examination or activity before that subject  has given informed consent /assent . The subject  must 
give written consent /assent after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal explanation will 
cover all the elements specified in the written information provided to the subject . 
It should be emphasized that the subject  is at liberty to withdraw consent /assent  to participate at 
any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject  is otherwise entitled. Subject s 
who refuse to give or withdraw written informed consent /assent  may not be included or 
continued in this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  
The Investigator will inform the subject  of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits , and potential 
hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may en tail. The subject  must be given every 
opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and , if necessary, ask for more 
information. At the end of the interview, the subject  may be given time to reflect if this is 
required, or if the subject  requests more time.  Subject s and/or legal guardian will be required to 
sign and date the informed consent form.  
A copy of the signed and dated consent /assent  document will be given to each subject . The 
original signed and dated informed consent /assent  docume nt must be maintained in the study

14.  DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_60209].  
14.1.  Data  entry 
Study -specific data that ha ve been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical 
database by [CONTACT_29569](s) designated by [CONTACT_737].  
14.2. Data  quality  control  and reporting  
Data are verified electronically using a series of programmed edit checks that have been created 
by [CONTACT_60288]. 
Data discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by [CONTACT_60289] ( CRA ) and site staff. C linical research as sociate s will review and 
verify all data collected in the eCRF against source documentation during scheduled monitoring 
visits. The CRA will work closely with the site staff to address any discrepancies that have been 
found so that proper resolutions can b e made and documented in the clinical database. An audit 
trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  
14.3.  Archiving  of data  
Archived versions of the database will be saved by [CONTACT_60290], complying with whic hever of the requirements is longer. Ocuphire will notify the 
Investigator when documents should be returned.  
14.4.  Records  retention  
The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all records related to the study in 
compliance with ICH GCP  Guideli nes. 
14.5.  Amendments  to the protocol  
Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by [CONTACT_60291]. The procedure for approval of a protocol 
amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol. The IRB must be informed of all 
protocol amendments and should be asked for its opi[INVESTIGATOR_12879] a full re -evaluation of the 
ethical aspects of the study is necessary by [CONTACT_942]. This should be fully documented.  
The Investigator  must not implement any deviation from or change to the protocol, without 
discussion with and agreement by [CONTACT_60292]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_60210], except where 
it is necessary  to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subject s, or where the change(s) 
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in monitor, change of 
telephone number ). 
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate authority(ies) as required by [CONTACT_12926](s).

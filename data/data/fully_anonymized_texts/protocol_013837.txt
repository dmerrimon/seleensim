Final Protocol 
Amendment 602May 2018 Major changes to the protocol include the following:
Section 4.1.1 Part A2 Monotherap y.
Change: Incorporated previous p rotocol 
administrative c hange s.
Rationale: Nivolumab has been approved for 
the treatment of HCC b y the FDA. 
Change: Revised Part A2 incl usion: Patients 
with histological or cy tological diagnosis of 
advanced/metastatic HCC who are treatment 
naïve and have declined standard of care, or 
have had at least 1 prior line of sy stemic 
therapy.  Prior anti-programmed death-ligand 
1 / anti-programme d cell death 
protein-1 ( anti-PD-L1/PD -1)therapy  is allowed.
Rationale: Clarification provided , as previous 
language allowed for 0 to 2prior li nes of 
therap y, and now includes prior 
anti-PD-L1/PD -1for HCC as well.
Change: Provided specific ANC inclusion value 
≥1,000/mm3or 1.0 x 109L for HCC patients 
only.
Rationale:  L owering the entry  criteria from 
1,500/mm3to 1,000/mm3for the HCC 
monotherap y cohort (A2) is not considered a 
significant safet y risk based on previous cohort 
data.   One out of [ADDRESS_152703] lower 
baseline ANC due to cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension.
Change: Removed i nclusion criteria 9 –Amylase 
and lipase <1.[ADDRESS_152704] for HCC only  patients. 
PF-04518600 a nd PF -05082566
B0601002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 02 May 2018 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 3Rationale:  There is no safety  concern for the 
removal of this criteria based on the previous 
cohort data.  As ymptomatic elevations of 
amylase and lipase have been noted on the study  
without clinical consequences, and am ylase and 
lipase are not reflective of liver function.
Section 3, Section 5, and the Study  Design 
Section of the Protocol Summary .
Change: Incorporated previous protocol 
administrative changes.
Rationale: Selected dose for PF -04518600 in 
the B2 combination therapy  dose expansion 
cohorts is 30 mg (a flat dose equivalent to 
0.3mg/kg) intravenously (IV) Q2W in 
combination with PF -05082566 20mg IV every  
28days.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Part B2 Dose Expansion Section 
4.1Inclusion Criteria, Sub- section 4.1.2 Part B 
Combination Therapy  –Part B2 Arm 1 only (a).
Change: (a) Ocular melanoma patients with 
advanced/metastatic disease.
Rationale: Provided clarification tothe inclusion 
criteria for the ocular melanoma patient 
population to now include all 
advanced/metastatic disease regardless of prior 
therap y.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Part B2 Dose Expansion Section 
4.1Inclusion Criteria, Sub -section 4.1.2 Part B 
Combination Therapy  –Part B2 Arm 1only (b).
Change:
(b) Cutaneous/acral melanoma patients with 
advanced/metastatic disease who have received 
checkpoint inhibitor (anti -PD-L1, anti -PD-1, or 
anti-cytotoxic T -lymphocy te antigen 
4 (anti-CTLA4)) based treatment on which 
disease progressed. [Note: Checkpoint inhibitor 
may have been part of a combination therap y, as 
long as the combination did not contain 
PF-[ADDRESS_152705].]  Any  questions on 
prior treatment may  be discussed with the 
Sponsor.
Rationale : (1) The specification anti-PD-L1, 
anti-PD-1, or anti -CTLA4 “give n as most recent 
line o f therap y”was removed, as well as the text 
regarding specific prior sy stemic therapy  for 
advanced/metastatic disease therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134877] .
Change: (2) Removed conditional statement “as 
long as progression did not occur in the first 
3mont hs of receiving checkpoint inhibitor 
treatment .”
Rationale: Stability  on checkpoint inhibitors 
may not necessarily  correlate with response to 
study  treatment.   As long as the cutaneous/acral 
melanoma patient has received checkpoint 
inhibitor based treatmen t and progressed, the 
patient qualifies for study  entry .
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Part B2 Dose Expansion
Section 4.1 Inclusion Criteria, Sub- section 
4.1.2 Part B Combination Therap y –Part 
B2Arm 2
Change –Part B2 Arm 2 : Histological or 
cytological diagnosis of N SCLC with 
advanced/metastatic disease.  Patients must have 
previously  received prior anti -PD-L1or 
anti-PD-1mAb on which disease progressed. 
[Note: Previous anti -PD-L1or anti -PD-[ADDRESS_152706].]
Rationale: Checkpoint inhibitors are 
increasingl y being used in combinations both as 
approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134878] y 
and experimental combinations.  As a result, this 
amendment clarified combination therap y as an 
acceptable previous line of therap y.
Change: The specification that previous 
PF-04518600 a nd PF -05082566
B0601002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 02 May 2018 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 5anti-PD-L1or anti -PD-1“given as most recent 
line of therap y” was removed for Part B2, Arm 
2,aswell as the conditional statem ent that 
NSCL C patients did not have progressive 
disease as best overall response on recent 
PD-L1/PD-1therapy  (ie, stable disease 
≥3months, PR, or CR).
Rationale: Patients may  have received treatment 
following a checkpoint inhibitor prior to 
enrollment .  Stability  on checkpoint inhibitors 
may not necessarily  correlate with response to 
study  treatment. Patient will now be eligible for 
enrollment regardless of prior best overall 
response.
PF-[ADDRESS_152707] 2017 Major changes to the prot ocol include the following:
The administrative changes described in past 
Protocol Administrative Change Letters (PACL) 
have been incorporated into the amendment.
Time ranges/windows of 2days have been 
added for follow -up phone calls to collect 
additional late immune related adverse event 
information .
PartB2Arm 1has been changed from head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
patients to melanoma patients (including both 
ocular and cutaneous melanoma).  Rationale for 
melanoma as tumor type: 1) 2 confirmed 
partial response s(PR) in the melanoma patients 
enrolled to date: 1in an ocular melanoma 
patient and 1in a cutaneous melanoma patient; 
2)no PRs observed in the HNSCC patients 
enrolled to date.
PartA2hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
patients are no w allowed to have up to 2 prior 
lines of approved therap y.  Rationale:
Regorafenib has been approved for HCC.
Part A HCC patients with thefollowing 
subty pes are exclusionary : fibrolamellar HCC, 
sarcomatoid HCC, and mixed 
cholangiocarcinoma.   Rationale: Itis important 
to exclude rare HCC subtypes, as these may 
introduce heterogeneit y into the patient 
population and make it more difficult to choose 
a recommended phase two dose (RP2D). 
PartA2HCC patients: patients with chronic 
hepatitis C virus ( HCV )infection are allowed; 
however, patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV )
infection must be receiving effective antiviral 
therap y (viral load <100 IU/ml).  Patients with 
active coinfection with HBV and HCV, active 
coinfection with HBV and hepatitis D virus are 
excluded.  Rationale: The updated hepatitis 
requirements are more in -line with standard of 
care practices and with the patient population

B0601002
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 02 May 2018 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 7enrolled in the Checkmate 040 trial. 
PartA2HCC patients who are positive for 
HBsAg, HBcAb or HCV Ab at screening, must
be retested every  3months and at the EOT visit.   
Rationale: Enable t he monitoring of viral load 
for patients with hepatitis.
PartA2HCC patients with detectable viral load 
for hepatitis B at screening must also be tested 
for hepatitis D antibod y (HDV Ab).  Rationale: 
Enable the monitoring of the new HCC 
exclusion criteria of active coinfection with 
HBV and hepatitis D virus.
Allowed anticoagulation now includes factor Xa 
inhibitors, as well as heparin.  Rationale: 
Factor Xa inhibitors are being increasingl y used 
in the treatment of thromboembolism and to date 
there have not been major bleeding events 
related to stud y drug.
The Background sections have been updated 
with the most up to date information (1.2).
Melanoma tumor type rationale Section ([IP_ADDRESS])
has been updated with information on ocular 
melanoma.  Rationale: PartB2Arm 1has been 
changed from HNSCC patients to melanoma 
patients (including both ocular and cutaneous 
melanoma).  And there is no proven standard of 
care for ocular melanoma.
HCC tum or type rationale Section ([IP_ADDRESS]) has 
been updated with information on r egorafenib.  
Rationale: Regorafenib has been approved for 
HCC.
Summary  of benefit risk assessment has been 
added (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Rationale :  Studies 
conducted in Europe and Cana da should include 
a Summary  of Benefit Risk Assessment.  This 
study  has sites in [LOCATION_009] and the Netherlands, so 
this section was added to be in compliance.

Page 8In addition to palliative radiotherap y, 
consideration may  be given for optional 
radiotherap y administered at palliative doses to 
a tumor between time of first progression b y 
RECI ST and when the patient has confirmed 
disease progression by  [CONTACT_134942]
(Section 5.7.9). Rationale :  There has been 
tumor regression observed in a non- irradiated 
tumor following p alliative radiotherap y in a 
melanoma patient treated with 10 mg/kg of 
PF-[ADDRESS_152708] and radiation.  Therefore, this 
section has been added to allow for optional 
radiotherap y, at the discretion of the 
Investigator.
For Parts A1and B1theinterval of radiographic 
assessments has an option for scans to be moved 
to every  12weeks after 24 weeks .  Rationale :
Reducing scan interval to every  [ADDRESS_152709] of care.
For Parts A2and B2 the interval of radiographic 
assessment s was changed from every  8weeks 
up to 48 weeks and then every  12 weeks to 
every  8weeks up to 24 weeks and then every  
12weeks.  Rationale : 48weeks may  be too 
long to perform more frequent scans .  Reducing 
scan interval to every  12weeks will be more in 
alignment with standard of care.
Table 6’s rows for Other non hematologic 
toxicities and laboratory abnormalities
Grade 4has the following added: Am ylase or 
lipase abnormalit y that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of 
pancreatitis.  Rationale: A patient on this study  
had transient, asymptomatic , Grade 4lipase 
elevation sbut was able to remain on study  
treatment with clinical benefit and no clinical

Figure 4.Study  Schematic has been updated 
with th e above information.
In the Anal ysis Sets, the immunogenicity  
assessment set has been defined.  Rationale :  
Wording added to define the immunogenicity  
assessment population, which will be part of the 
statistical analy sis.
Appendix 6has been updated with d efinitions of 
new measurable lesions for clarification 
purposes.

Amendment 408February  2017 Major changes to the protocol include the following: 
“PF- 05082566” replaced with the proposed 
International Nonproprietary  Name (INN), 
“utomiluma b”, throughout the protocol.
PF-04518600 and utomilumab clinical 
experience data (safet y, efficacy,
Pharmacokinetics [PK], and immunogenicity ) 
updated in the Introduction section.
Tumor ty pe rationales have been updated with 
recent publication findings.
Dosing rationales have been updated, including 
the addition of a rationale for flat dosing in 
Parts A2and B2 (Section 1.4).
The administrative changes described in past 
Protocol Administrative Change Letters(PACL)
have been incorporated into the amendment.
PartA1Monotherap y was updated to reflect that 
the study  is enrolling patients into the optional 
10mg/kg cohort, as the M aximum Tolerated 
Dose (MTD) has not been met.
PartA2Monotherap y was updated to reflect that 
only hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patients 
will be enrolled into the 2 arms at a high and 
low flat dose of PF -04518600 (randomized 1:1)
instead of an arm of HCC and an arm of 
melanoma patients at the same weight -based 
dose.  Rationale for HCC as tumor type: 
1)Tumor regressions seen in 5 of 19 patients 
with HCC, 1 confirmed partial response ( PR)
which is ongoing for >6 months; 2) 
Anti-programmed cell death protein-1 ( PD-1)
and anti -programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1)
are not standard therap y in HCC yet, so would 
be able to enroll immuno -oncolo gy (IO)naïve 
patients.  Rationale to explore 2 dose levels of 
PF-04518600 (30mg and 250 mg) at flat 
doses : 1)0.3mg/kg appears to be the lowest 
dose at which full receptor occupancy  (RO)
occurred for all p atients and had the most 
favorable safety , effic acy, PK, and 
pharmacod ynamics ( PD)data (30 mg

Page 11equivalent). 2) Although no responses were 
observed in the 3 mg/kg cohort, increases in peripheral blood central memory CD4 T cell proliferation and activation were also observed at 3 mg/kg (250 mg equivalent).  3) Patients enrolled in 3 mg/kg were a distinctly different population from those enrolled in lower dose cohorts, which could have accounted for differences in clinical outcome.  4) Evaluating 30 mg and 250 mg in randomized arms with a single tumor type  
 
•Part A2 inclusion criteria has been changed to 
HCC patients who 1) have had 0 to 1 prior 
line(s) of systemic therapy (ie, progressed or intolerant to sorafenib or have declined standard therapy) and 2) who have not received prior anti-PD-L1/PD-[ADDRESS_152710] effective in the early stages and limiting prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134879].
•Parts A2 and B2 on treatment biopsies were 
modified from 1 mandatory on-treatment biopsy 
at Cycle 4 Day 1(C4D1) to [ADDRESS_152711] be consulted. Rationale : Will provide an additional 
opportunity to obtain biomarker data at the point when treatment resistance (PD) or anti-tumor activity (PR) is occurring.

•The secondary endpoints of time to event 
endpoints have been re-categorized as 
“Anti-tumor activity assessments” to better reflect the endpoints as they are not all time to event endpoints in nature and this is more in alignment with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for endpoints for cancer drugs.  Time to Progression has also been added to this endpoint.
•The Schedule of Events and Pharmacokinetic 
and Pharmacodynamic Sampling Schedules for 
Parts A2 and B2 have been broken out from Parts A1 and B1 and aligned to differentiate the dose escalation and dose expansion parts of the study.
•For Parts A2 and B2 the interval of radiographic 
assessments was changed from every 6 weeks to 
every 8 weeks up to 48 weeks and then every 12 weeks. Rationale : [ADDRESS_152712] of care.

10mg/kg PF -04518600 in combination with 
100mg of utomilumab to be evaluated based on 
emerging data in the 10 mg/kg Part A1cohort.
PartB Combination Therapy  Exclusion #2 For 
PartB2, head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma ( HNSCC )patients will need to have 
either never been treated with anti -PD-L1or 
anti-PD-1mAb or those who 1) previousl y 
received prior anti- PD-L1or anti -PD-1mAb as 
most recent therap y, and 2) did not have 
progressive disease as best overall response on 
recent PD -L1/PD -1therapy (ie,stable disease 
3months, PR, or complete response [ CR]), and 
3)who subsequentl y progressed, or are 
intolerant to PD-L1/PD-1therap y.  
Pembrolizumab is now approved for HNSCC. 
The following Part B inclusion criteria has been 
removed: Sum of the longest diameter(s) of 
metastatic liver lesion(s) should be <5 cm. No 
liver toxicity  has been seen with either 
PF-04518600 or utomilumab that would warrant 
this criterion . 
The following exclusion criteria has been 
modified and added to Part A and Part B, 
respectivel y: Patients who have undergone solid 
organ or hematopoietic transplant.  
Rationale :Avoid an y graft versus hos t disease 
or graft rejection in all transplant patients.
Dosage Administration Instructions (DAI) has 
been replaced with Investigational Product (I P) 
Manual throughout the protocol.
Administration sections for Part A2and B2 have 
been broken out from Part A1and B1 to reflect 
the change to flat dosing from weight -based 
dosing mentioned above.

Page 31PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale :
Immunotherap y offers the opportunity  to not only  stop tumor growth, but also decrease the 
rate of tumor recurrence .1By [CONTACT_134945] -associated antigen T cells, it 
may be possible to enhance tumor immunity .  However, T cell activation is not mediated by  
[CONTACT_134946].  I nstead, co- stimulatory  receptors are required.  OX40 (CD134) 
and 4 -1BB (CD137) are co-stimulatory  receptors that act on antigen stimulated T cells but 
not native T cells.2,3OX40 plays a key  role in T cell survival, proliferation, and activation.  
Upon OX40 ligand (also known as OX40L, CD252 or TNFSF4 [tumor necrosis factor 
(ligand) superfamily , member 4] )binding , OX40 signaling upregulates anti -apoptotic 
molecules including B -cell ly mphoma -2(Bcl-2), B cl-xL, and survivin,4and increases 
interleukin -2(IL-2), IL -4, IL -5, and interferon gamma (IFN-) cytokine secretion.  Simil arly, 
activation of 4-1BB signaling leads to an upregulation of pro-survival factors Bfl-1 and 
Bcl-xL, down -regulation of pro -apoptotic protein Bim , increased Tcell proliferation and 
differentiation into T memory  cells .5
PF-04518600 is a fully  human I mmunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) agonistic monoclonal antibody  
(mAb) specific for human OX40 (CD134).  B y binding to OX40 on activated tumor 
infiltrating T cells, PF -04518600 may reverse T cells’ anergic state, and enhance t umor 
immunity . 
Utomilumab ( PF-05082566 )is a fully  human IgG2 agonist monoclonal antibody  specific for 
human 4- 1BB.  The safety  and tolerability  of utomilumab is currently being evaluated in a 
First-in-Patient Phase 1study  as a single agent and in combin ation with rituximab (Study  
B1641001, I ND109,154 ).6Utomilumab has been well tolerated (thus far up to 10mg/kg) 
when administered as a single agent every  4weeks ( Q4W ).The safety  profile of utomilumab
eithe r as single agent or in combination with rituximab was manageable without occurrence 
of treatment related life threatening ( >Grade 4) adverse events ( AEs). 
In this clinical stud y, PF -04518600 as a monotherapy (Part A), and PF -04518600 in 
combination with utomilumab (Part B) will be evaluated for the treatment of adult patients 
with select locall y advanced or metastatic cancers who are unresponsive to current available 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or for whom no standard therap y is available.
Study Design:
This is a Phase 1,open label, multi -center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safet y, 
pharmacokinetic, and pharmacod ynamic study  of PF-04518600 monotherapy in Part A, and 
PF-04518600 in combination with utomilumab in Part B.  Each part includes a dose 
escalation phase, and a dose expansion phase.  A maximum of approximately  210 patients 
are expected to be enrolled into the study .

Page 32All patients will complete up to 4 weeks of screening.  Following the initial dose (s), 
treatment with investigational product will continue until d isease progression by 
[CONTACT_44859] -related response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( irRECI ST), patient refusal,
unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the end of the study , whichever occurs first .  Patients will be 
allowed to stay  on study , if the treating phy sician feels that it is in the patient’s best interest 
in the case of radiological progression, and the absence of clear clinical progression (see
Section 5.4.6 Treatment after I nitial Evidence o f Radiological Disease P rogression) .  A 
follow -up visit approximately [ADDRESS_152733] dose for adverse event (AE) and serious 
AE (SAE) collection will be conducted.  Late immune related responses will be evaluated up 
to [ADDRESS_152734] dose (s) of Cycle 1. Because atypi[INVESTIGATOR_134886] -existing lesions or appearance of new lesions have been observed with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, study  B0601002 will assess tumor response based on both response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECI ST) and Immune -related Response Criteria Derived 
From RECI ST v1.1 (irRECI ST).  Survival data will also be collected (see Section 
5.4.6 Treatment after Initial Evidence of Rad iological Progression, Section 6.3 Follow -up 
Visit, Section 7.4 Tumor Response Assessments, and Appendix 6).  The time on study  can 
vary depending on the observed toxicit y and potential benefit an individual patient derives.  
It’s estimated that patients will remain on treatment for approximatel y 12-18weeks, making 
total study  duration approximately  20-26 weeks (exclusive of 2 year survival follow -up).  
Actual duration can be longer, if a patient derives benefit from stud y treatment.
Part A Monotherapy:
Part A1 Monotherap y Dose Escalation.
PartA1monotherap y dose escalation ph ase will enroll approximatel y 58adult patients with 
locally  advanced or metastatic cancers hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) .  The 
actual number of patients enrolled will depend on the obs erved safet y and tolerability profile 
of PF -04518600, the number of dose levels that will be tested and expanded to characterize 
the pharmacod ynamic or immunomodulatory  (IM) effects, and the number of dose levels 
required to identify  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD).   
Sixdose levels are proposed: 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.5 , 3and 10 mg/kg. Each cohort will include an 
initial cohort of 2-[ADDRESS_152735] 2dose levels (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Japan Participation in Part A Monotherap y).
A staggered start will be employ ed at all dose levels.  A single patient will be dosed and 
observed for 48 hours.  If no safet y concerns arise during this 48 hr period, a second patient 
will be enrolled into the same dose level cohort.  A modified toxicity  probability  interval 
(mTPI ) method, targeting a dose limiting toxicitie s(DLT) rate of 25% and an acceptable 
DLT interval (20% -30%) ,7will be utilized for dose escalation (see Section 3.1.5 Criteria for 
Dose Escalation ).  Ifperipheral blood samples indicate preliminary  signs of immune 
modulation in the first 2 -4 patients, the dose level will be expanded for pharmacod ynamic
evaluation ;these additional patients will undergo mandatory  pre-treatment and on treatment 
biopsies .If the Investigator judges the risk of certain on -treatment biopsies unacceptable for

Page 33the patient ( eg, based on site of tumor, potential for complications during/after procedure, 
etc.) the me dical monitor must be consulted (see Section 1.4Rationale for Pretreatment and 
On-treatment Biopsies).  Depending on observed safet y data and pharmacody namic data, 
additional cohorts (lower, intermediate or higher dose levels, up to maximum of 20 mg/kg, 
seeSection 3.1.5 Criteria for Dose Escalation) may also be tested. 
Part A2 Monotherap y Dose Expansion.
PartA2monotherapy dose expansion phase will randomize HCC patients 1:1to flat dose 
level s of either 30 mg (Arm 1) or 250 mg (Arm 2)of PF-04518600 given every  2weeks. 
Both doses were chosen based on data from Part A1. Each arm in Part A2will include 
approximatel y 20 HCC patients. 
Based on emerging data from the 10 mg/kg cohort of Part A1, an additional flat dose level of 
800mgPF-04518600 ( approximately equivalent to 10 mg/kg ), may  be added after initiation 
of enrollment into Arms 1and 2 . 
Patients will undergo mandatory  pre-treatment and on treatment biopsies as specified in the 
Schedule of Activities. If the Investigator judges the risk of certain on -treatment biopsies 
unacceptable for the patient ( eg, based on site of tumor, potential for complications 
during/after procedure, etc.) the me dical monitor must be consulted (see 
Section 1.4 Rationale for Pretreatment and On -treatment Biopsies).
Part B Combination Therapy:
Part B1 Combination Therap y Dose Escalation .
PartB1, the combination therapy  dose escalation phase ,will enroll approximately 55patients. 
At least [ADDRESS_152736] been evaluated for the 28 day DLT observation period at the 
0.3mg/kg dose level in Part A1PF-04518600 ( OX40 agonist) monotherapy before 
PartB1can be initiated.  PartB1will study  sequential dose levels of PF-04518600 (0.1, 0.3, 
1.0and 3 mg/kg with an option of 10 mg/kg pending data from Part A1)combined with 
either 20 mgor 100mgof utomilumab (4-1BB agonist ) in adult patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NS CLC), HNSCC , melanoma, bladder, gastric or cervi calcancer who are 
unresponsive to currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134887].  
The starting dose level will be 0.1 mg/kg of PF -04518600 and 20 mg of utomilumab , given 
no soone r than 30 minutes apart (for dosing schedule, please see 
Section 5.4.3 Administration Part B Combination Therap y). Based on emerging data in the 
10mg/kg Part A1cohort, an optional cohort of 10mg/kg PF -04518600 in combination with 
100mg of utomilumab may  be evaluated.
A mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_12183], targeting a DLT rate of 25% and an acceptable DLT interval 
(20% -30%) ,7will be utilized for dose escalation ( see Section 3.1.5 Criteria for Dose 
Escalation). If peripheral blood samples indicate preliminary  signs of immune modulation in 
the first 2-4 patients, the dose level will be expanded for pharmacod ynamic evaluation; these 
additional patients will undergo mandatory  pre-treatment and on treatment biopsies. In case 
of intolerable toxicity  at the starting dose level , the dose combination will be reduced to

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 02 May 2018 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 340.1mg/kg of PF -04518600 and 10 mg of utomilumab . Subsequent to the starting dose level, 
if dose de -escalation is recommended after evaluation, intermediate dose levels between the 
previous dose combination and current dose combination may  be studied.   Intrapatient dose 
reductions are not permitted during the combination therap y with PF -04518600 and 
utomilumab unless, in discussion with the sponsor, a dose combination level is deemed 
beyond the determined MTD for the combination . Each dose combination level will include 
an initial cohort of 2 -4patients th at may  be expanded up to approximatel y 10patients based 
on peripheral pharmacody namic assessments (see Section 7.3Biomarker and 
Pharmacod ynamic Assessments ).  To allow for better characteriza tion of pharmacod ynamic 
effects, these additional patients will undergo mandatory  pre-treatment and on treatment 
biopsies.  If the Investigator judges the risk of certain on -treatment biopsies unacceptable for 
the patient ( eg, based on site of tumor, potential for complications during/after procedure, 
etc.) the medical monitor must be consulted ( see Section 1.4Rationale for Pretreatment and 
On-treatment Biopsies).  The safet y of the first patient at each dose combination level will be 
observed for 48 hours prior to enrolling subsequent patients. 
Part B2 Combination Therap y Dose Expansion .
PartB2combination therapy  dose expansion phase will further evaluate safety  and 
anti-tumor activity  of PF-04518600/ utomilumab combination with a dosing regimen selected 
based on results of Part B1with flat dose equivalents of PF -04518600. 
From the results of Part B1, the s elected dose for PF -04518600 in the B2 combination 
therap y dose expansion cohorts is 3 0mg (a flat dose equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg) intravenousl y 
(IV) every  2weeks ( Q2W )in combination with PF -05082566 20 mg IV every  28days. 
PartB2will be divided into 2 arms: 
Arm1will enroll melanoma patients who have either :
a.Ocular melanoma patients w ith advanced/metastatic disease, or
b. Cutaneous/acral melanoma patients with advanced metasatic disease who have 
received checkpoint inhibitor (anti- PD-L1, anti -PD-1, or anti -cytotoxic 
T-lymphocy te antigen 4( anti-CTL A4)) based treatment on which disease 
progressed. [Note: Checkpoint inhibitor may  have been part of a combination 
therap y, as long as the combination did not contain OX40 or 4-1BB agonist] .  
Any questions on prior treatment may  be discussed with the Sponsor.
Arm 2will enroll patients with h istological or cytological diagnosis of NSCL C with 
advanced/metastatic disease.  Patients must have previously  received prior 
anti-PD-L1or anti -PD-1 mAb on which disease progressed.  [Note: Previous 
anti-PD-L1or anti -PD-1mAb may  have been part of a combinati on therapy , eg,in 
combination with chemotherapy, as long as the combination did not contain OX40 or 
4-1BB agonist.]

Page 486.Baseline Signs & Symptoms: On Day 1prior to the start of study treatment, patients will be asked about any signs and symptoms experienced within the past 
14days.  During the study, any new or w orsened conditions since baseline will be recorded on the Adverse Events (AE) case report form (CRF) page.
7.Weight: Patient’s body weight w ill be measured prior to the preparation of investigational product (PF-04518600) and patient’s dose of PF -04518600 for 
that cycle will be based on the patient’s body weight (see Administration Section 5.4). 
8.Vital signs: includes temperature (oral, tympanic , temporal or axillary), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate to be recorded in the sitting position after 
5minutes of rest.  On Day 1of each cycle, vital signs should be measured prior to infusion start (pre -dose) and 1 hour after the start of the infusion. 
9.Performance status: use Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale inAppendix 1.
10.Triplicate 12 -leads electrocardiogram (ECG): Triplicate ECGs will be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .  At each time point, at least a 
10second strip, three consecutive 12 -lead ECGs will be performed 1-5minutes apart to determine mean QTcF interval.  The Screening ECG will be a 
single, 12 lead ECG.  ECGs on Day 1of each Cycle will be collected prior to dosi ng, and at the end of infusion (approximately 1 hour) following 
administration of each dose of PF -04518600.  Additional ECGs will be collected on Cycle 1Day 2(C1D2), Cycle 1Day 8(C1D8), Cycle 2Day 8(C2D8), 
and Cycle 3Day 8(C3D8) and EOT.  When coin ciding with blood sample draws for pharmacokinetics (PK), ECG assessment should preferably be 
performed prior to blood sample collection, such that the blood sample is collected at the nominal time.  All ECGs will be re viewed by a centralized ECG 
vendor.  If the mean QTcF is prolonged (value of >500 msec), the ECGs should be reevaluated by a qualified person at the institution for confirmation.  
Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.  Refer to Section 7.1.5 (12-Lead) ECG for further details.
11.Hem atology: complete blood count (CBC) to include hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutro phils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes, eosin ophils, and basophils. Assessments conducted on Cycle 1Day 1(C1D1) must be completed within 48 hours prior to dosing .  If screening
assessments are performed w ithin 72 hours prior to C1D1, there is no need to repeat assessments on C1D1 .  Assessments per formed on 
Cycle2Day 1(C2D1) and Day 1of each subsequent cycle should be performed w ithin [ADDRESS_152748].
12.Blood Chemistry: Tests for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), 
gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT), sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, total calcium, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea, creatinine, 
uric acid, glucose (non -fasted), albumin, ph osphorous or phosphate, amylase, lipase and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) will be performed. 
Assessments c onducted on C1D1 must be completed within [ADDRESS_152749].
13.Coagulation Assays: prothrombin time (PT) and partial thrombopl astin time (PTT).  Assessme nts conducted on C1D1 must be completed within [ADDRESS_152750].
14.Urinalysis: Dipstick is acceptable. Microscopic analyses required if dipstick abnormal.  If 2+ protein on urine dipstick, then collect [ADDRESS_152751] (Serum/Urine):  For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivi ty of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be 
performed on two occasions prior to starting study therapy -once at the start of screening and once at C1D1, before investigational product administration.  
Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle prior to dosing during the active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally 
PF-[ADDRESS_152752] (IRB)/institutional ethics committ ee (IEC)s or if required by 
[CONTACT_427].
16. Hepatitis B, C and HIV Tests: Conduct tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatit is C antibody (HCV Ab) 
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. 
17. Cardiac enzymes: Troponin I (troponin T is allowed if the assay utilized can be verified to have cardiac specificity) and N-ter minal of the prohormone brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) will be evaluated in patients with  previous history of anthracycline treatment.  Assessments mus t be performed prior to 
dosing.  No need to repeat on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) if screening assessment performed within 72 hours prior to that date.  Assessment s performed on 
Cycle 3 Day 1 (C3D1) and Day [ADDRESS_152753].
18. Registration: Patient number and dose level allocation provided by [CONTACT_3954].  Treatment should begin no longer than four da ys from registration.
19. PF-04518600 Treatment: PF-04518600 will be administered once every 2 week s as an IV infusion over 60 minutes (-5 to +15 minutes) and s hould include 
the time needed to flush the infusion line .  Day 1 safety labs (blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) need to be reviewed by a physician prior to 
dosing at the beginning of each cycle. Treatment with investigational product will continue until disease progression by [CONTACT_134948] T, patient refusal, 
unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

Pharmacodynamic Sampling Schedule table below. 
 
26. Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using the National Cancer Ins titute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) version 4.03.  Patients must be followed for adverse events (AEs) for [ADDRESS_152754] resolved, whichever is later; or earlier than 28 days should the patient commence another 
anticancer therapy in the meantime.  However, late immune-related DLTs that are not SAEs need to be collected consistent with Section 3.2.1 .  For serious 
adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time that the pat ient provides informed consent, 
which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or r eceiving investigational product, 
through [ADDRESS_152755], 
whichever is later.  Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be report ed to the sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator believes have at least a rea sonable possibility of being 
related to investigational product are to be reported to the sponsor.
27. Concomitant Medications and Non Drug Supportive Interventions: all concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF inc luding supportive care 
drugs (eg, Anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), and the drugs used to treat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non-drug  supportive interventions 
(eg, transfusions).
28. Echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan: echocardiogram or MUGA will be evaluated in patients with previous his tory of anthracycline
treatment.  For these patients, an echocardiogram or MUGA will be performed at screening and every [ADDRESS_152756] on treatment a nd when clinically 
indicated.  An echocardiogram or MUGA will be performed at the end of treatment (EOT) visit if not performed within 3 months of discontinuation.
29. End of treatment visit (EOT visit): Obtain these assessments if not completed in the last week (last 6 weeks for tumor assessm ents). 
30. Follow up: At least [ADDRESS_152757] 
every 4 weeks until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, that no further improvement is ex pected.  Independent to time of 
disease progression, all patients (unless patients are lost to follow up, consent is withdrawn, or study is discontinued by [CONTACT_1142]) will be followed for 
survival for at least [ADDRESS_152758] additional late immune related adverse event information, any patient who  discontinue from 
treatment after 1 to 4 or 6 cycles of treatment will also be contact[CONTACT_134949] .  For patients who disco ntinues after receiving 
5 cycles of treatment, late immune information will be collected during the 28 to 35 day follow up visit.  If the patient disconti nues after receiving 6 cycles 
of treatment, they will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 14 days ( ±2 days) after EOT.  If the patient discontinues after receiving 4 cycles of treatment, they will be 
contact[CONTACT_3012] 42 days ( ±2 days) after EOT.  If the patient discontinues after receiving 3 cycles of treatment, they will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 56 days 
(±2 days) after EOT. If the patient discontinues after receiving 2 cycles of treatment, they will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 70 days ( ±2 days) after EOT. If the 
patient discontinues after receiving 1 cycle of treatment, they will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 84 days ( ±2 days) after EOT. If any concern arises, patient will be 
called in for an inpatient follow up visit within 5 calendar days of initial phone call (assessments will be the same as the asse ssments performed 28-35 days 
after end of treatment follow up visit).

exception of symptomatic patients to rule out CNS metastases.  CT or MRI scans to be done every 6 weeks ( ±5 days) from the start of study treatment until 
confirmed disease progression by [CONTACT_393] (1.1), irRECIST or death, or patient begins a different anti-cancer therapy. Scans may be  moved to every 
[ADDRESS_152769] less of treatment delays.  
Confirmation of response (complete response (CR)/partial response (PR)) is not required.  CT or MRI scans should be completed b efore tumor biopsy 
samples are collected.
 
 
 
 
 
 
24. PK Sampling: Specific timing for collection of pharmacokinetic samples can be found in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling schedule
table below. 
25. Anti-drug antibodies: Specific timing for collection of anti-PF- 04518600 and anti-utomilu mab antibody samples can be found in the Pharmacokinetic and 
Pharmacodynamic Sampling Schedule table below. 
 
27. Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using the National Cancer Inst itute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) version 4.03.  Patients must be followed for adverse events (AEs) for [ADDRESS_152770] resolved, whichever is later; or earlier than 28 days should the patient commence another 
anticancer therapy in the meantime.  However, late immune-related DLTs that are not SAEs need to be collected consistent with Section 3.2.1 .  For serious 
adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time that the pat ient provides informed consent, 
which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, 
through [ADDRESS_152771], 
whichever is later. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reporte d to the sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator believes have at least a reas onable possibility of being 
related to investigational product are to be reported to the sponsor.CCI

23. PK Sampling: Specific timing for collection of pharmacokinetic samples can be found in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling schedule
table below. 
24. Anti-drug Antibodies: Specific timing for collection of anti-drug antibody samples can be found in the Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Sampling 
Schedule table below. 
 
26. Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using the National Cancer Ins titute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) version 4.03.  Patients must be followed for adverse events (AEs) for [ADDRESS_152783] resolved, whichever is later; or earlier than 28 days should the patient commence another 
anticancer therapy in the meantime.  However, late immune-related DLTs that are not SAEs need to be collected consistent with Section 3.2.1 .  For serious 
adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time that the pat ient provides informed consent, 
which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or  receiving investigational product, 
through [ADDRESS_152784], 
whichever is later.  Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be report ed to the sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator believes have at least a rea sonable possibility of being 
related to investigational product are to be reported to the sponsor.
27. Concomitant Medications and Non Drug Supportive Interventions: all concomitant medications should be recorded in the CRF inc luding supportive care 
drugs (eg, Anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), and the drugs used to treat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non-drug  supportive interventions 
(eg, transfusions).
28. Echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan: echocardiogram or MUGA will be evaluated in patients with previous his tory of anthracycline
treatment.  For these patients, an echocardiogram or MUGA will be performed at screening and every [ADDRESS_152785] on treatment and when clinically 
indicated.  An echocardiogram or MUGA will be performed at the end of treatment (EOT) visit if not performed within 3 months of discontinuation.
29. End of treatment visit (EOT visit): Obtain these assessments if not completed in the last week (last 8 weeks for tumor assess ments). 
30. Follow up: At least [ADDRESS_152786] 
every 4 weeks until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, that no further improvement is ex pected.  Independent to time of 
disease progression, all patients (unless patients are lost to follow up, consent is withdrawn, or study is discontinued by [CONTACT_1142]) will be followed for 
survival for at least [ADDRESS_152787] additio nal late immune related 
adverse event information, any patient who discontinues from treatment after 1 to 4 or 6 cycles of treatment will also be contact[CONTACT_134955].  For patients who discontinues after receiving 5 cycles of treatment, late immune information will be collecte d during the 28 to 35 day 
follow up visit.  If the patient discontinues after receiving 6 cycles of treatment, they will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 14 days ( ±2 days) after EOT.  If the patient CCI

will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 70 days (2days) after EOT. If the patient discontinues after receiving 1 cycleof treatment, they will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 
84days (2days) after EOT. If any concern arises, patient will be called in for an inpatient follow up visit within 5 calendar days of initial phone call 
(assessments will be the same as the assessments performed 28 -35days after end of treatment follow up visit).

Page 801.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
PF-04518600 is a fully  human I gG2 monoclonal antibody  (mAb) specific for human 
OX40 (CD134).  OX40 is a member of the tumor -necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 
superf amily that is expressed primarily on activated T cells.2,3By [CONTACT_52999] a co- stimulatory  
receptor, OX40 plays a key  role in the regulation of antigen-specific T- cell expansion, 
differentiation and function.  Mechanisticall y, PF -04518600 has been shown to costimulate 
OX40, thereb y inducing a T cell mediated anti- tumor response in vivo.  In this clinical study , 
PF-04518600 as a monotherap y (Part A), and PF -04518600 in combination with utomilumab
(Part B) will be evaluated for the treatment of adult patients with select locally  advanced or 
metastatic cancers who are unresponsive to current available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or for whom no 
standard therap y is available.
1.2.Background and Study Ratio nale
Additional pre- clinical and clinical information for PF -04518600 may be found in the single 
reference safet y document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure for 
PF-04518600.
1.2.1. OX40 (CD134) 
The ability  to escape immune recognition i s a hallmark of cancer progression.  By  
[CONTACT_134956], immunotherapy  offers 
the opportunity  to not only eradicate or stop tumor growth, but also the opportunity  to 
decrease the rate of recurrence .1One strateg y for increasing tumor immunity  would be to 
activate and expand tumor -associated antigen T cells.  I t has long been recognized that T cell 
activation is not mediated by  [CONTACT_134946].  Indeed, tumor antigens may  induce 
T-cell anerg y, rendering T cells unable to proliferate in response to antigen, and 
hypo-responsive to further antigen encounter .8Instead, co- stimulatory  receptors are required 
to complete the pr ocess of T cell activation and expansion.  Thus, co- stimulatory  receptors 
may have the potential to prevent tumor -induced immune tolerance .9,10
OX40 (CD134) is a co -stimulatory  receptor that acts on antigen stimulated T cells but not 
native T cells.1,3OX40 expression is transient, and peaks 48to 72 hours following T cell 
receptor (T CR) stimulation.  High numbers of OX40 positive infiltrating T cells have been 
found within tumor biopsies, and ly mph nodes of primary  melanoma, breast, colon and head 
and neck cancer patients .11-14OX40 plays a key  role in T cell survival, proliferation, and 
activation.  Upon binding to OX40 ligand (also known as OX40L, CD252 or TNFSF4), 
OX40 signaling activates both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB (nuclear factor 
kappa -light-chain -enhancer of activated B cells) survival pathway s, leading to an 
upregulation of anti- apoptotic molecules including Bcl -2, Bcl -xL, and 
surviving.4Furthermore, OX40 engage ment may  enhance IL -2, IL -4, IL -5, IFN-cytokine 
secretion b y activated CD4 Tcells.  It is interesting to note that OX40 activation has been 
shown to not require co -stimulation from other co- stimulatory  receptors .15OX40L is usually  
expressed on activated B cells and dendritic cells, but due to the immunosuppressive 
environment within a tumor, OX40L was not detected in the tumor mass of several sy ngeneic 
mouse models .16Mechanistically, it is therefore possible that an agonistic mAb to

Page 81OX40 may reverse T cell’s anergic state, and enhance tumor immunity. Indeed, eradication 
of tumor growth has been observed by [CONTACT_134957]40 mAbs and OX40 agonists in preclinical models of melanoma, sarcoma, and glioma, and colon, breast, prostate and renal cancers.
3,12,17,18Given the potential for OX40 agonistic mAbs to enhance anti-tumor T cell 
responses, and induce tumor regression, a Phase 1 clinical trial with a murine anti-OX40 antibody has been completed.
19In this study, tumor regression was observed in 
12 of 30 advance cancer patients, as well as an acceptable toxicity profile. To date, two additional combination Phase 1/[ADDRESS_152802] been initiated.

human OX40 (PF-04518600).  PF-[ADDRESS_152803] OX40.  Furthermore, PF-04518600 can selectively and reversibly bind to human OX40 with a high affinity, and in conjunction with TCR signals, is able to functionally co-stimulate T cells as measured by [CONTACT_8668]- 2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and 
IFNγrelease in vitro.  In a syngeneic mouse model, a murine surrogate anti-OX40 agonistic 
antibody (OX86) demonstrated growth inhibition of colon tumors (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Efficacy).

[IP_ADDRESS]. PF-04518600 Clinical Safety
PF-04518600 as monotherapy has been well-tolerated in doses from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg. As of 
a data cut-off date of 24 May 2017, 52 patients (43 male and 9 female, mean ages of 60.0 years) were treated with PF-04518600 across 6 dose levels (0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.5, 3 and 10 mg/kg) in B0601002 Part A1.
The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) regardless of causality that 
occurred in ≥10% of patients were: fatigue (46.2%), nausea (28.8%), decreased appetite 
(23.1%), pruritus (23.1%), anemia (21.2%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (21.2%),
abdominal pain (19.2%), constipation (19.2%), dyspnea (19.2%), headache (17.3%), alanineaminotransferase increase (15.4%), chills (15.4%), cough (15.4%), diarrhea (15.4%), pyrexia (15.4%),  vomiting (15.4%), back pain (13.5%), blood bilirubin increase (11.5%), and insomnia (11.5%).
A total of 30 (57.7%) patients out of [ADDRESS_152804] 
frequent treatment-related AE experienced by ≥10% of patients was fatigue (25.0%). Most
treatment-related events reported were Grade 2 or below.  There was 1 Grade 3 treatment-related event of gamma-glutamyltransferase increased reported. There did not appear to be a dose-dependent increase in any treatment-related AEs. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed.
The only treatment-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reported to date was 
Grade 2 congestive heart failure (CHF) in an HCC patient receiving the 0.1 mg/kg dose. This patient had a prior history of anthracycline exposure. There were no treatment-related deaths in study B0601002. 
As B0601002 is an ongoing study, the available data are preliminary in nature and are subject 
to further review and quality control and may therefore change.

1.2.2. 4-1BB (CD137)
4-1BB (CD137, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 9 [TNFRSF9]), first identified as 
an inducible costimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells, is a membrane spanning glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF).  Current understanding of 4-1BB indicates that expression is generally activation dependent and encompasses a broad subset of immune cells including activated natural killer (NK and natural killer T (NKT) cells; regulatory T cells; dendritic cells (DC) including follicular DC; stimulated mast cells, differentiating myeloid cells, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and activated B cells.
22,23The ligand that stimulates 4-1BB (4-1BB Ligand [4-1BBL]) is 
expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), myeloid progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells.
4-1BB is undetectable on the surface of T cells but expression increases upon activation.  
Based on homology to other members of the TNFRSF, ligand binding is expected to induce receptor trimerization resulting in activation.
24Some members of the TNFRSF can cleave 
the extracellular domain from the cell surface and exist in a soluble form.  Soluble 4-1BB and soluble 4-1BBL have been demonstrated in the serum of some patients with autoimmune diseases and cancers.
25-27
Upon 4-1BB activation, TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 1 and TRAF 2, pro-survival 
members of the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) family are recruited to the 4-1BB cytoplasmic tail resulting in downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) and the Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase cascade including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk), c-Jun CCI

immunotherapy  approaches that break immune tolerance.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Utomilumab Clinical Efficacy
As of the data cut -off date of 06 June 2016, the safety  and efficacy  of utomilumab are being 
evaluated in 3 ongoing studies either as a single agent (B1641001 Portion A) or in 
combination with other anti- cancer treatments (B1641001 Portion B, B1641003, and 
B1641004).
For thes e ongoing studies, the available data are preliminary  in nature and are subject to 
change.
Study  B1641001
For B1641001, safety  and efficacy  data were recorded for 86 patients in Portion A treated 
with utomilumab in dose levels between 0.006 and 10 mg/kg an d 47 patients in Portion B 
treated with utomilumab in dose levels between 0.03 and 10 mg/kg in combination with 
rituximab at 375 mg/m2.
As of the data cut -off date 06 June 2016, in Portion A, 1 confirmed complete response ( CR)
and 1 confirmed PR in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) were reported in patients who were 
treated at 0.24 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg respectivel y. In addition, 1 patient with 
anti-PD-1refractory  melanoma treated at 0.24 mg/kg had a PR that was not y et confirmed at 
the time of data cut -off date; however, this response was confirmed at a subsequent 
assessment. In addition, 1 patient with anti -PD-1refractory  melanoma treated at 0.24 mg/kg 
had a greater than 30% reduction in the diameters of multiple target tumors but was 
considered to have stable disease (irSD) per Immune- related Response Criteria Derived from 
RECI ST version 1.1.
In Portion B, 8 patients with follicular ly mphoma (7 patients were refractory  to prior 
rituximab -containing regimen) achieved an objective response: 4 patients achieved a CR 
(2treated at 1.2 mg/kg, 1 at 0.12 mg/kg, and 1 at 0.03 mg/kg) and 4 patients achieved a PR 
(2treated at treated at 0.18 mg/kg, 1 treated at 1.2 mg/kg, and 1 treated at 5.0 mg/kg). One

1.2.4. Clinical Combination of PF 04518600 and Utomilumab
As of the data cut-off date of 24 May 2017, 42 patients (23 male and 19 female, mean ages of 
58.6 years) were treated with PF-04518600 across 5 dose levels of PF-04518600 (0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg) in combination with [ADDRESS_152818] frequent all- causality  TEAEs that occurred in  10% of patients include: decreased 
appetite (23.8%), nausea (21.4%), fatigue (19.0%), anemia (16.7%), p yrexia (16.7%), 
abdominal pain ( 14.3%), constipation (14.3%), diarrhea (14.3%), and pain (11.9%).
A total of 15 (32.1%) patients out of [ADDRESS_152819] 
frequent treatment- related TEAE experienced in 5% of patients include fatigue (9.5%) and 
nausea ( 7.1%). All treatment -related events reported were G rade 1or 2, with the exception 
of a Grade 3amylase and a Grade 4lipase elevation in a single subject receiving 0.3 mg/kg 
PF-04518600 and 100 mg utomilumab .No DL Ts havebeen reported.
The only treatment -related SAE , which occurred on 19 June 2017, was a Grade 3infusion 
reaction in a 67 year old patient with bladder cancer who was receiving 1 mg/kg 
PF-04518600 and 100 mg utomilumab. 
Preliminary  efficacy  data as of 24 May 2017, indicate d that there were 2ongoing partial 
responses (PR) in the 10 melanom a patients enrolled : 1confirmed in a cutaneous melanoma
patient at 0.3 mg/kg PF -04518600 and 20 mg utomilumab and 1 unconfirmed in an ocular
melanoma patient at 0.3 mg/kg PF -04518600 and 100 mg utomilumab .  Both patients are still 
ongoing in the study .  The cutaneous melanoma patient hadreceived prior pembrolizumab 
plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134890] a partial response ( PR), then progressed on pembrolizumab
maintenance .  The ocular melanoma patient had progressed after prior radiotherap y. 
As B0601002 is an ongoing s tudy, the available data are preliminary  in nature and are subject 
to further review and quality  control and may  therefore change.
1.2.5. Tumor Type Rationale
Anti- tumor immune response is the ability  for a tumor to elicit an adaptive immune response 
and prevent tumor growth.  I t has long been understood that immunodepressed patients have 
a higher incidence of cancer ,34and immunodeficient murine models have increased levels of 
tumor growth .35Central to the adaptive defense against tumor cells are the tumor infiltrating 
lymphocy tes (TILs) that include CD8+ effector T cells, and CD4+ T helper (Th) cells.  For a 
number of tumor ty pes, including melanoma, head and neck cancers, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) , bladder urothelial cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, a favorable 
prognosis has been associated with a high number of TILs.22,36-39High numbers of 
OX40 positive infiltrating T cells have been found within tumor biopsies, and ly mph nodes 
of primary  melanoma, breast, colon and head and neck cancer patients.11-14Thus, for these 
tumor ty pes, the abundance of activated TILs has been suggested to be a surrogate marker for 
anti-tumor immune response .40Indeed, it has been postulated that the host response to 
immunotherapeutics may be dependent on the anti-tumor immune response for a given 
tumor .40Nonetheless, a combination of immunotherapeutics may elicit a robust immune 
response even in a poorl y immunogenic tumor ty pe.41In the study  by [CONTACT_134959] (2015) ,41a 
combination of anti-4- 1BB/anti -PD-[ADDRESS_152820] treatment is available.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Melanoma
Melanoma is considered to be one of the most immunogenic tumor ty pes due to its ability  to 
undergo spontaneous regression.  Worldwide, an estimated 232,000 new cases are diagnosed 
each year.42It is a highly  aggressive tumor; 5 year survival rate for patient with regional 
metastasis is expected to be 63%, whilst survival for a patient with distant metastasis is 
expected be 16% .43Recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (a fully  human IgG1 anti-cytotoxic T -lymphocy te 
antigen 4 [CTL A-4]antibody ),nivolumab and pembrolizumab (both humanized I gG4 an 
anti-PD-1 antibodies )provide compelling evidence that melanoma is amenable to 
immunotherapeutic approaches.  In clinical Phase 3studies, metastatic melanoma patients 
treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134891] 10.1 months, compared to 
6.4months among patients receivi ng gl ycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine 
alone .44Notably , durable tumor control was observed, with overall survival (OS) noted for 
18% of patients at 5 years and 17% at 7 years, with no deaths reported afte r 
7year.45Historically , 3% Stage IV M1c, 6% Stage IV M1b and 16% of Stage IV M1a 
patients are expected to survive 10 years .46For pembrolizumab, clinical studies showed 
tumor shrinkage in 24% of treated advance melanoma patients that lasts from 1.4 to 
8.5months, overall median progression -free survival of longer than 7 months and an overall 
response rate of 26% .47Responses were durable .48With a median follow -up of [ADDRESS_152821] majority (88%) of responders were still on treatment at ti me of database 
lock.47In patients refractory  to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134892], objective response 
rate (ORR) b y RECIST was 28%, and again durable response was observed.48Combining 
checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134893] y ields a 
greater response rate of 57.6% versus nivolumab alone (43.7%) or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165] (19%). 
However, greater frequency  of Grade 3or 4treatment- related adverse events are seen in 
patients treated with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (55.0%) vs nivolumab (16.3%) or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (27.3%) .95In 2015 the FDA approved two BRAF and MEK inhibitor 
combinations to treat pa tients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF -mutated melanoma : 
cobimetinib with vemurafenib and dabrafenib with trametinib. The Phase 3Cobimetinib 
combined with vemurafenib in advanced BRAFV600-mutant melanoma (coBRI M)study
showed that vemurafenib with c obimetinib improved OS at 9 months of 81% vs 73% for 
vemurafenib with placebo , PFS 11.3 vs 6.0months, ORR of 68% vs 45%.123The 
Phase 3COMBI -dstudy  showed that dabrafenib with trametinib improved overall survival 
with a median survival of 25.1 months vs 18.7 months for dabrafenib alone , PFS 11.0 vs 
8.8months, ORR of 69% vs 53%.[ADDRESS_152822] common primar y intraocular malignancy in adults, representing ~85% of

Page 97(~10%).108The mol ecular profile of ocular melanoma is different from those of cutaneous or 
mucosal melanomas and is composed of a number of chromosomal abnormalities and 
somatic gene alterations.  As a result of these differences, no effective adjuvant systemic 
therap y has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of metastasis of ocular melanoma , as 
recentl y reviewed b y Triozzi and Singh.109And f or those patients with ocular melanoma
who do develop metastatic disease, there is no proven standard of care. Dacarbazine, a 
chemotherapeutic option for treatment of cutaneous melanoma, h as been used for ocular
melanoma; however, activity  has been limited.110,111,112Other chemotherapeutic regimens 
including temozolomide, cisplatin, treosulfan, fotemustine and various combinations have 
been investigated in ocular melanoma with disappointing results to date.113,114,115Immune 
checkpoint inhibitors evaluated in several small prospective and/or retrospective studies have 
rarelydemonstrated responses and no overa ll survival benefit.125Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134894] ~5%–10% in metastatic ocular melanoma, but evidence of a median overall 
survival (OS) of 6.0 –9.7months in these trials suggests that responses could be delay ed and

[IP_ADDRESS]. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
Approximately  650,000 new cases of head and neck cancers are diagnosed globally  each 
year, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common 
form .42,49,50HNSCC is an aggressive tumor t ype with a 10.1 month overall survival rate for 
patie nts with recurrent and/or metastatic disease .51HNSCC is considered to be an 
immunosuppressive tumor ,52circulating and tumor -infiltrating T cells of HNSCC patients 
have signaling defects ,53and immune effector cell anerg y is well described.  This, together 
with TILs’ ability  to act against HNSCC tumor antigens, makes HNSCC a good candidate 
for immunotherap y.  Cetuximab, an anti -EGFR ( epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]) antibody
targets,  EGFR , which is expressed on >90% of all HNSCC tumors.  I n Phase 3studies, 
recurrent and metastatic HNSCC treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy  increased overall 
survival from 7.4 months to 10.1 month s, when compared with HNSCC patients treated with 
chemotherap y alone .51Pembrolizumab has received accelerated approval from the FDA for 
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with disease progression on or after platinum-c ontaining 
chemotherap y based on the results of KEYNOTE -012, with an ORR of 16% and CR rate of 
5%.97TheFDA approved nivolumab for HNSCC that has progressed during chemotherap y 
with a platinum-based drug or tha t has recurred or metastasized after platinum- based 
chemotherap yin 2016.  Nivolumab improved overall survival with a median survival of 
7.5months vs 5.[ADDRESS_152823] therap y, ORR of 13.3% vs 5.8%, PFS was 
approximatel y the same 2.0 vs 2.3 months.131
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
An estimated 782,000 cases of HCC are diagnosed worldwide each year; it is the third 
leading cause of tumor deaths, with an expected 5 -year survival rate of 5- 6%.42,54Sorafenib, 
a multikinase inhibitor, was the first approved s ystemic therap y for unresectable HCC with

Page 98overall survival of 10.7 vs 7.9 months, PFS 5.5 vs 2.8 months, ORR of 2% vs 1%, disease 
control rate of 43% vs 32% compared to placebo.96Recently , regorafenib, another
multikinase inhibitor , was approved for HCC patients who have progressed during sorafenib
treatment. Regorafenib im proved overall survival with a median survival of 10.6 months vs 
7.8months for placebo , PFS 3.1 vs 1.5 months, ORR of 11% vs 4%, disease control rate of 
49% vs 23%.105Additionally, a Phase II stud yevaluating lenvatinib , a multi- tyrosine kinase 
receptor inhibitor ,for HCC treatment showed promising outcomes, with median survival of 
18.7 months, TTP of 7.4 mont hs, an ORR of 37%, and a disease control rate of 
78%.106There is evidence to suggest that HCC is amenable to immunotherapy .  Firstl y, HCC 
tumor recurrence has been linked to immunosuppression.  Secondly , HCC patients treated 
with autologous ly mphocy tes activated in vitro with recombinant interleukin -2and anti body  
to CD3 had significantly  improved recurrence -free survival and disease -specific survival.  
Thirdly , CD4+ regulatory  Tcells and immunosuppressive T regulatory  cells (Tregs) that may  
suppress T cell responses have been identified in tumors of HCC patie nts, and it has been 
demonstrated that engagement of another T cell co -stimulatory  receptor GITR can reverse 
the suppressive effect of Tregs .55,56It should however be noted that the liver has a unique 
intrinsic tolerogenic and intra- hepatic immunosuppressive environment, with mechanisms 
that preferentiall y inactivate T cells, as well as mechanisms that increase T cell tolerance, and 
apoptosis .57As such, for the limited number of immunotherapeutic trials completed to date 
involving therapeutic vaccination and cell therap y strategies, only  modest results have been 
observed .54There are data tha t suggest that immune checkpoint inhibition with 
anti-PD1 may have anti- tumor efficacy  in HCC. In the Checkmate 040 P hase 1/2study , 
patients with advanced or metastatic HCC were treated with nivolumab. Objective responses 
occurred in 16% and CR in 1% of 214 patients, and responses were seen regardless of 
PD-L1status, prior sorafenib treatment, or hepatitis C virus (HCV )or hepatitis Bvirus
(HBV )infection.98
[IP_ADDRESS]. Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) accounts for >90% of all kidney  cancers, and approximatel y 
338,[ADDRESS_152824] 30 years, the 
incidence of RCC has been raising by  [CONTACT_3450]  3% each y ear.59Clear cell RCC is the 
most common form of renal adenocarcinomas, representing 70% of all RCC, and the 
expected 5- year survival rate for these patients are 55% .60,61There is nonetheless other 
compelling evidence for an immunotherapeutic approach for this disease .64Increased 
expression of i mmune checkpoint PD -1receptor and PDL -1ligand have been identified on 
TILs and tumor cells from RCC patients, and this correlated with patient survival .64Lastl y, 
results of a Phase 3trial of nivolumab versus (v s)everolimus in metastatic RCC patients who 
failed prior (anti -VEGF [Vascular endothelial growth factor]) treatment found improved
ORR of 21.5 vs 5%, and median overall survival of 25.0 vs 19.6 months.104
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bladd er Cancer
For bladder cancer, tumor infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells has been associated with 
better overall survival.22,65Bladder cancer was the first indication with an FDA approved 
immunotherapy , and vaccination using weakened, live bacterium bacillus calmette -guérin 
(BCG) first took place in the 1970s.22,65Worldwide, it is estimated that386,000 new cases 
of bladder cancer will occur each year, with approximately  105,000 deaths.42Approximately

anti-PD-L1antibody , has received accelerated approval from the FDA for locally advanced 
and metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed following treatment with 
platinum -based chemotherap y following a single -arm multicenter trial with 310 patients that 
demonstrated an ORR of 14.8% in all patients (5.5% C R, 9.4% PR) and ORR of 
26%(12% CR, 14% PR) in patients with PD -L1expression in  5% of immune cells.99,100
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cervical Cancer
According to published data b y the International Association of Research in Cancer (IARC) ,
528,000 new cases of cervical cancer arediagnosed worldwide each year.42It is understood 
that cervica l cancer is caused by  [CONTACT_134960][INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) .  There are two 
main ty pes of cervical cancer. The first one, which accounts for about 90% of diagnosed 
cervical cancers, is squamous cell carcinoma that covers the cervix.126The second t ype of 
cervical cancer, located in the gland cells of the endocervix, is called cervical 
adenocarcinoma. There has been an increase in the incidence of cerival adenocarcinoma in 
many  countries, mainl y inwomen under the age of [ADDRESS_152825] son advance or recurrent tumor .71Spontaneous regression of premalignant 
lesions has been associated with circulating HPV sp ecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a 
higher ratio of effector T cells to Tregs.71The ratio between CD8 Tcells and Foxp3+ 
regulatory  CD4 Tcells (Tregs) ,and the number of tumor infiltrating M1 macrophages are 
also independent prognostic factor s.
Currently , there are a number of immunotherapeutics in development for cervical cancer .  
They  include T cell adoptive therapy ,72and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134897].73,74In 
a Phase 1study  of HPV infused TILs, out of 9 metastatic cervical cancer patients CR with 
long term durability  (22to 15 months) was observed in 2 patients, and PR was observed in 
1patient .72In a Phase 1/2study  ofipi[INVESTIGATOR_134898], preliminary results revealed 3PR (1 PR and 2 unconfirmed PR) and 8 SDin 
34patients.73In a Phase 1b study  KEYNOTE-028 pembrolizumab had a 17% ORR in 
24patients with PD -L1positive advanced cervical cancer.74
[IP_ADDRESS]. Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Gastric cance r is the 5thmost common cancer in the world, with 952,000 new cases reported 
in 2012.42Approximately 50% these cases were reported in Eastern Asia.  It is also the third 
leading cause of cancer deaths, with 7 23,000 deaths recorded in 2012.  Except in countries 
like Japan and Korea, gastric cancer often presents with advanced disease upon diagnosis.  
The principle treatment method is still surgical resection ; whilst 20 -30% patients will have 
resectable disease, those with ly mph node metastasis will be deemed inoperable.  Even for 
those patients treatable with surgical resection, the recurrence rate remain shigh andthe 
five-year survival rate is29%.[ADDRESS_152826] ood that gastric cancer is a histologically  diverse disease, and t he majority  is 
associated with infectious agents such as helicobacter p ylori and Epstein –Barr virus (EBV).  
Recently , the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network anal yzed the molecular 
characteristics of gastric adenocarcinoma (TCGA 2014) and identified [ADDRESS_152827] subty pes: 
tumors positive for EBV , microsatellite unstable tumors, genomically  stable tumors, and 
tumors with chromosomal instability . Each distinct subty pe may  therefore requi re a different 
therapeutic option.
Immunotherap y ma y offer an alternative treatment strateg y for gastric cancer patients.  
Gastric cancer patients with increased numbers of CD3, CD8, and CD45RO positive TILs 
have improved survival rates compared to patien ts with lower numbers of TILs .75
A limited number of immunotherap y approaches are currentl y being evaluated in gastric 
cancer.  Checkpoint inhibitors, including CTLA- 4, PD -L1and PD-1 are currentl y being 
evalua ted.  In the Phase 2study  with Tremelimumab (CTLA -1mAb), a 5% response rate 
was observed in 18 gastric cancer patients.84In the KEYNOTE -012 study , a multicenter 
open -label P hase 1b trial pembrolizumab for po sitive recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma 
of the stomach of gastro -esophageal junction, 36 patients evaluable for response 8 (22%) had 
overall response (all PR).101
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Lung cancer remains to be the most common cancer worldwide, with 1.8 million cases 
reported in 2012 .42In the US, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 85% of 
these cases, and with a 17.1% 5 -year surv ival rate .84NSCLCs represent a heterogeneous set 
of diseases with diverse pathological, genetic and cellular features, with three NSCL C 
histological sub- types:adenocarcinoma (~50% of cases), squamous cell car cinoma (~40% of 
cases) , and large cell carcinoma .132,133There are differences in mutation burden between 
smokers and non -smokers: 1) smokers have significantly  high er mutation frequencies; 
2)point mutations in smokers are predominantl y C:G->A:T, but non -smokers are 
predominantly  C:G ->T:A; and 3) the distinctive sets of mutations identified in non -smokers 
are EGFR mutations and ROS proto- oncogene 1 (ROS1 )and anaplas tic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK ) fusions, while smokers have Kirsten rat sarcoma proto- oncogene (KRAS ), tumor 
protein p53 gene ( TP53 ), BRAF, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3 ), and 
mismatch repair gene mutations .133For NSCL C with specific genetic alterations, including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) and anaplastic ly mphoma kinase (ALK) 
translocations (2-8%), molecular targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134899], have 
improved median overall sur vival (OS ).84However, the majorit y of NSCLC patients do not 
harbor these genetic mutations ,since only  15-18% of NSCL Chas EGFR genetic alterations 
and 2 -8% have ALK translocations.
In October 2015, nivolumab and pembrolizumab ( PD-1 mAbs ) were approved for the 
treatment of metastatic NSCL C.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_134900] ,84overall survival of 
12.[ADDRESS_152828] ove rall survival for 
docetaxel treated patients was 9.4 months.  Furthermore, PR/CR was observed in 19% of 
nivolumab treated patients.  I n the 495 patient study  for pembrolizumab, an overall response 
rate of approximatel y 20% was observed for previously  treated and treatment -naive advanced 
or metastatic NSCL C patients .84Patients with high PD- L1-expressing NSCL C had an even

for the same indication.134Moreover, pembrolizumab also received a pproval in [ADDRESS_152831]-line NSCL C treatment in patients with high PD -L1expressing tumors ( 50% of tumor

the RNA -seq data is generated from bulk tumor, spearman correlations of mRNA expression 
of target of interest (4 -1BB or OX40) to mRNA expression of markers of specific immune 
cell subsets was completed. This correlation was used as a guide for the determination of 
OX40 or 4-1BB expression levels within different immune cells. For 4- 1BB, since an

[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Benefit Risk Asses sment
Overall, the nonclinical package and the preliminary clinical experience with 
PF-[ADDRESS_152833] -in-patient (FI P) study  is to assess safet y, tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacod ynamics (immune- modulatory  or IM effects) of 
PF-04518600 in patients with advanced or metastatic HCC, melanoma, clear c ell RCC or 
HNSCC . 
The selected starting dose for PF -04518600, 0.01 mg/kg, represents approximately  60% of a 
theoretical receptor occupancy  calculated b y the Duff equation.84
The starting dose and subsequent PF-04518600 doses of 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.5, and 3 mg/kg were

[IP_ADDRESS]. PF-04518600
The initial proposed PF -04518600 dose is 0.1 mg/kg based on safety  information obtained in 
PartA monotherap y. Subsequently ,thedoses to be evaluated for combination are 0.3, 1.0, 
and 3 mg/kg. If preliminary data suggest that 10 mg/kg may  be effective and safe, an 
additional 10 mg/kg dose may  be studied in combination as well.  Except at 10 mg/kg, a
given dose of PF -[ADDRESS_152835] 
anone-half-log higher dose of PF -04518600 monotherap yhas been deemed to be safe and 
well tolerated.   Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Criteria for Dose Escalation Part B 
Combination Therapy) for dose combination level information.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Utomilumab
The proposed starting dose of utomilumab to be tested in Part B combination therap y is 
20mg. The starting dose takes into account potential safet y findings for OX40 monotherap y 
study  (Part A) but also the possible overlap in safety  prof iles between utomilumab and 
PF-04518600. Subsequently  the other dose to be evaluated for combination is [ADDRESS_152836]- In-Human Phase 1Study  B1641001, utomilumab as single agent has 
been well tolerated up to the dose of 10 mg/kg ( the highest planned dose level).  To date, no 
DLTs have been observed in Study  B1641001, either for utomilumab as a monotherapy  or 
utomilumab in combination with rituximab.  The safet y profile of utomilumab either as 
single agent or in combination with rituximab was manageable without occurrence of 
treatment related life threatening (>Grade 4) adverse events (AEs).
Activities of utomilumab were observed at doses as low as 0.24 mg/kg (approximately  
20mg) in MCC as a single agent. It is not clear if higher doses migh t be active as limited 
number of MCC patients (5 of 15 patients) were treated at higher doses. Responses were 
also observed with the combination of utomilumab and rituximab in R-refractory  
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma ( NHL )as low as 0.03 mg/kg with highest act ive dose of 
2.4mg/kg. These data suggest that the active dose range of utomilumab is quite broad, 
spanning an approximate 100 -fold dose range. Flat utomilumab doses of 20 (approximatel y 
0.2mg/kg), 100 (approximately  1.2mg/kg), and 500 mg (approximatel y 6mg/kg) are being 
tested in Study  B9991004.
1.4. Rationale for Flat Dosing in Part A2 and Part B2
Based on the population PK/PD analy sis using preliminary  data from Part A1(monotherap y 
dose escalation) of this study, the predicted median and 5thand 95thpercentiles of 
PF-04518600 exposure parameters, particularl y the trough concentrations of PF -04518600, 
over the weight range of the patient population are expected to be comparable between 
body -weight based and flat dosing. Therefore, PF -04518600 will be gi ven as a flat dose in 
the dose expansion cohorts (Part A2and Part B2) to simplify  the dosage preparation 
procedure.
PF-[ADDRESS_152837] on TILs in the tumor microenvironment will provide important data to estimate 
the optimal biological dose (OBD) of the PF-04518600 ( see Section 3.4Optimal Biological 
Dose ).  It has been shown that OX40 has negligible expression on resting T cells in 
peripheral blood, but is much higher in TILs and in tumor draining ly mph nodes in patients
with melanoma and head and neck cancer .11Similarly , 4-1BB is expressed on activated 
immune cells including activated CD8 cells, activated NK and natural killer T (NKT) cells; 
regulatory  Tcells; dendritic cel ls (DC) including follicular DC; stimulated mast cells, 
differentiating m yeloid cells, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and activated 
Bcells.5This difference in receptor expression suggests potential diffe rences between 
pharmacod ynamic (immune modulatory )effects of OX40 and [ADDRESS_152838] in tumor verses 
peripheral blood.  All patients will be required to provide an archival biopsy  sample , which 
will be shipped to the central lab after Cycle 1 Day 1(C1D1 ).  Except for the first 
2-4 patients in the each dose level in Part sA1and B1 , all other patients in this study  will be 
required to provide tumor biopsy  samples before, and on Cy cle4Day 1 (C4D1 )after 
PF-04518600 or PF -04518600/ utomilumab combination treatment.  Any CT or MRI  scans 
for tumor assessments should be completed before tumor biopsy  samples are collected. In 
PartA1, a second on treatment biopsy  is mandatory  on C7D1 for melanoma patients.  This 
second on treatment biopsy  is optional for all oth er patients in Parts A1.  In Part A2and B2, 
all patients will provide an archival biops y sample.  Additionally, there will be 2 to 
3mandatory  biopsy  collections: 1) fresh pre -treatment biopsy  (ie, collected during 
screening), 2) on-treatment biopsy  on Cy cle4Day 1(C4D1), 3) at time of initial response or 
initial progression (whichever occurs first), provided the biopsy  is not within 4 weeks of the 
C4D1 biopsy . If a patient terminates study  drug treatment before the scheduled on treatment 
biopsy  at C4D1, the patient will be asked to provide a fresh biopsy  at the termination visit. If 
tissue is collected from clinically  indicated procedures at other time points, a portion may  be 
submitted to the Sponsor.  If the Investigator judges the risk of certain on -treatment biopsies 
unacceptable for the patient ( eg, based on site of tumor, potential for complications 
during/after procedure, etc.) the medical monitor must be consulted.  Part B1patients will not 
be required to provide a second on treatment biopsy.
The number, t ype and location of TILs can present large heterogeneit y among different 
tumor ty pes and among patients.  Furthermore, it is hy pothesized that pharmacod ynamic 
effects may  vary  widel y from patient to patient.  Therefore, each dose level in Part A1 will be 
expanded to approximately  [ADDRESS_152839] 2 -4 patients.  Patients who are part of the expansion of any  dose level 
will undergo mandatory  pre-and on -treatment biopsies.  To bet ter estimate the OBD, tumor 
pharmacod ynamic data from all patients will be evaluated at the end of Part A1.
While the decision to dose escalate will depend on the adjudication of the safet y data from 
the initial data set of 2 to 4patients, safet y informat ion provided by [CONTACT_134962]2D determination.

1.6. Biomarker Rationale
The aim of biomarker collections and analyses is to provide evidence of target engagement 
(TE), pharmacodynamic activity and immune-m odulatory (IM) activity for PF-04518600 and 
utomilumab. This will provide data to guide dose selection, and allow characterization of the relationship between PF-04518600/utomilumab TE, pharmacodynamic activity and any observed anti-tumor effects.  Furthermore, this may enable the identification of patients and/or tumor types most responsive to PF-04518600 alone or in combination with utomilumab. 
TE by [INVESTIGATOR_16335]-04518600 will be assessed by [CONTACT_134963] a flow cytometry assay to measure unbound 
(free) OX40 receptor expressed on peripheral blood T cells.  The relationship between TEand the pharmacokinetics of PF-04518600 will provide guidance for dose selection for PF-04518600. The measurement of TE by [CONTACT_134964]-modulation upon antibody binding and the lack of an appropriate antibody (Ab) reagent; therefore only total 4-1BB receptor expression on peripheral blood T cells will be assessed as a measure of target load.  Other pharmacodynamic measures will be used to inform utomilumab dose selection. The goal of this analysis will be to select doses that result in full TE and pharmacodynamic activity while exhibiting an acceptable safety profile, and potentially providing evidence of anti-tumor activity.
The pharmacodynamic effect of OX40 or OX40 plus 4-1BB agonism will be investigated in 
peripheral blood for all patients and in tumor tissues for patients enrolled into the expansion cohorts in Parts A1 and B1, and in expansion Phases A2 and B2. Potential effects ofPF-04518600 or PF-04518600 plus utomilumab on relative proportions and phenotypes of T cells (including memory and regulatory subsets) and on T cell activation status will be assessed by [CONTACT_4133]. In the tumor tissue samples, the phenotype, quantity and tissue localization of TILs will be assessed by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC). These evaluations of peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating T cell subsets will be undertaken in an effort to identify components of cell-based immunity responsive to dosing with PF-04518600 or PF-04518600 plus utomilumab, and potentially serve as a guide for tumor or patient selection.

Page 115A maximum of approximately  210patients are expected to be enrolled into the study .  
Patients will complete up to 4 weeks of screening.  Patients in Parts A1and B1 who are part 
of the expansion of an y dose level and all patients in Parts A2and B2 will undergo 
mandatory  pre-and on- treatment biopsies.  If the Investigator judges the risk of certain 
on-treatment biopsies unacceptable for the patient ( eg, based on site of tumor, potential for 
complications during/after procedure, etc.) the medical monitor must be consulted (see 
Section 1.4 Rationale for Pre Treatment and On Treatment Biopsies).  Patients will receive 
doses of PF -04518600 intravenousl y (IV) over 60 minutes (-5 to +15 minutes) every  
2weeks .  Patients in Part Bwill also receive doses of utomilumab intravenously  (IV) over 
60minutes ( -5to +15 minutes) every  28days.  Following the initial dose, treatment with 
investigational product will continue until disease progression by [CONTACT_134942] (see 
Section 0 Treat ment after Initial Evidence of Radiologica l Disease Progression) , patient 
refusal, unacceptable toxicity  occurs , or the end of the study , whichever comes first .  Patients 
will be allowed to stay  on study , if the treating phy sician feels that it is in the patient’s best 
interest, in the case of rad iological progression and in the absence of clear clinical 
progression.  A follow -up visit after approximately  4weeks after the last dose for AE and 
SAE collection will be conducted.  Assessment of late immune related responses will be 
evaluated up to [ADDRESS_152848] been observed with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, study  B0601002 will assess tumor response based on both 
response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) and Immune -related Response Criteria 
Derived from RECI ST v1.1 (irRECI ST). S urvival data will be collected (by  [CONTACT_648], every  
8weeks, see Section 6.3 Follow -up V isit,Section 7.4 Tumor Response A ssessments and 
Appendix 5).85-87The time on study  can vary  depending on the observed toxicity  and 
potential benefit an individual patient derives.  It is estimated that patients will remain on 
treatment for approximately  12-18weeks, making total study duration approximately  
20-26weeks (exclusive of 2 -year survival follow -up).  Actual duration can be longer, if a 
patient derives benefit from study  treatment.   However, [ADDRESS_152849] surviving patient (whichever is 
later) the stud y will be closed.
Patients having an unresolved adverse event that is possibly  related to ADA formation will 
be asked to return for ADA and drug concentration blood sampling at approximately  3month 
intervals until the adverse event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and sponsor concurs with that the investigator’s assessment, up to 6 months 
from the end of treatment ( EOT) or the day of early  withdrawal .

alread y enrolled in Cohorts 1-5 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details), and ~10 patients enrolled 
into Cohort 7.  The actual number of patients enrolled will therefore depend on the observed 
safet y and tolerability profile of PF -04518600 monotherap y, the number of dose levels that 
will be explored or expanded to characterize the pharmacod ynamic effects, the number of 
dose levels required to identify  the MTD or OBD . All Japanese patient sin PartA1should be

A modified toxicity  probability  interval (mTPI) method, targeting a DLT rate of 25% and an 
acceptable DLT interval (20%- 30%) ,88will be utilized. 
When a dose level is deemed safe following a DLT observation period of [ADDRESS_152851] dose level .  For safet y 
reasons, a staggered start will be employ ed at all dose levels; 1 patient in each cohort of 
2-4patients will be dosed, and observed for 48 hours before subsequent patients can be 
dosed.  If no safet y concerns arise during this 48 hr period, a second patient will be enrolled 
into the same dose level.  A staggered start will not be implemented for the expansion phase 
of a dose level ; that is, the first patient within the expansion cohort will not need to be 
observed fo r 48hours before additional patients are enrolled into the same dose level .
Peripheral pharmacod ynamic assessments of an y given dose may  be completed after the dose 
is deemed safe, and escalation to the next dose level has already  occurred.  When peripher al 
monitoring indicates immune modulation in the first 2-[ADDRESS_152852] 2 -4patients in any  dose level, the dose level will not be 
expanded. 
Patients who are part of the expansion of any  dose level will undergo mandatory  pre-and 
on-treatment biopsies (See Schedule of Activities for specifics) .  To better estimate the OBD, 
tumor pharmacod ynamic data from all patients will be evaluated at the end of Part A1.
Safety information provided by  [CONTACT_134965]2D determination.  If the DLT rate is estimated to reach 
30% or more at an y dose level, enrollment at that level and all higher levels will be 
temporaril y stopped and the safet y data will be analyzed.  Decision on moving forw ard will 
follow the same DLT target as described previously .  Dose escalation will continue until an 
MTD has been established, maximum dose level (20 mg/kg, please see Section 3.1.5 Criteri a 
for Dose Escalation ) has been reached or until three sequential dose levels show a similar 
pharmacod ynamic signal. 
Late immune related DLTs that occur during the first 98days(or first 7 cycles if patient 
remains on treatment) will be taken into account for MTD determination (see 
Section 3.2.1 Late Immune R elated DLTs and Section 6.3Follow -up Visit ).  If late immune 
related DLTs occ ur, all safet y data will be reviewed and a decision will be made whether or 
not to permanently  stop enrollment in the higher cohorts and declare the MTD, to continue 
enrollment in the cohort, to increase the number of patients evaluated in that cohort or t o stop

for Dose Escalation) can be added.  Higher dose cohorts can only be initiated if the next lowest level is deemed safe.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part A2 Dose Expansion
Part A2 monotherapy dose expansion phase will randomize HCC patients 1:1 to flat dose 
levels of either 30 mg (Arm 1) or 250 mg (Arm 2) of PF-04518600 given every 2 weeks up to 20 patients per arm. These are doses chosen based on the following preliminary data from Part A1.
1. Partial responses were observed in 1 melanoma and 1 HCC patient at 0.1 (n=10) and 
0.3 mg/kg (n=11) dose levels. Full receptor occupancy in peripheral T cells was observed in both responders. 
2. Full receptor occupancy was achieved for all patients at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg. 
The flat dose that is equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg was determined to be 25 mg in terms of 
matching the center of the distributions based on the population PK/PD analysis using preliminary data from Part A1 of this study. However, 30 mg was chosen as the low dose (Arm 1) for Part A2 to ensure the 5
thpercentile of trough concentrations (C trough) to be at or 
above which the full receptor occupancy was observed. 
Although no responses were observed in the 3 mg/kg cohort, increases in peripheral blood 
central memory CD4 T cell proliferation and activation similar to the increases found at the 0.1 mg/kg were observed at 3 mg/kg. Therefore, Arm 2 will evaluate a 3 mg/kg flat dose equivalent of 250 mg.
An additional flat dose level of 800 mg, approximately equivalent to 10 mg/kg, may be 
added after initiation of enrollment into Arms 1 and 2 if this is supported by [CONTACT_134966] 10 mg/kg cohort of Part A1.
All patients in A2 will undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment biopsies (See Schedule of 
Activities for specifics).
If preliminary sign of efficacy from Part A1, or emerging data from other OX40 agonist 
programs indicate a rationale for exploration of a different tumor type, these may be added or substituted for HCC patients.

After initial safety data have been evaluated and deemed safe for the first [ADDRESS_152853] been evaluated for the 28 day DLT observation period at the 0.3 mg/kg dose level in Part A1 OX40 monotherapybefore Part B1 can be initiated.  Part B1 will study sequential dose levels of PF-04518600 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3 mg/kg, with an option of 10 mg/kg pending data from Part A1) combined with [ADDRESS_152854] therapy is available. The starting dose level will be 0.1 mg/kg of PF-04518600 and 20 mg of utomilumab, given no sooner than 30 minutes apart (for dosing schedule, please see Section 5.4.2 Administration Part B Combination 
Therapy). Base d on emerging data in the 10 mg/kg Part A1 cohort, an optional cohort of

[IP_ADDRESS]. Part B2 Dose Expansion
PartB2combination therapy  dose expansion phase will further evaluate safety  and 
anti-tumor activity  of the combination with a dosing regimen selected ba sed on results of 
PartB1with flat dose equivalents of PF -04518600. 
From the results of Part B1, the s elected dose for PF -04518600 in the B2 combination 
therap y dose expansion cohorts is 30 mg (a flat dose equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg) intravenousl y 
(IV) Q2W in combination with PF -05082566 20 mg IV every  28days.
PartB2will be divided into 2arms :
Arm 1will enroll melanoma patients who have either:
a.Ocular melanoma patients w ith advanced/metastatic disease; or,
b.Cutaneous/acral melanoma patients with advanc ed/metastatic disease who have 
received checkpoint inhibitor (anti- PD-L1, anti -PD-1, or anti -CTLA4) based 
treatment on which disease progressed. [Note:  Checkpoint inhibitor may  have been 
part of a combination therapy, as long as the combination did not co ntain OX40 or 
4-1BB agonist.]  Any  questions on prior treatment may  be discussed with the 
Sponsor.
PF-[ADDRESS_152857]: 
a.Histological or cy tological diagnosis of NSCL C with advanced/metastatic disease.  
Patients must have previously  received prior anti- PD-L1or anti -PD-1mAb on which 
disease progressed. [Note:  Previous anti -PD-L1or anti -PD-1mAb may  have been 
part of a combination therap y, eg in combination with chemotherap y, as long as the 
combination did not contain OX40 or 4-1BB agonist.]
PartB2will initially  enroll up to 20patients in each arm (including approximately  5ocular 
melanoma patients in Arm 1) , and all patients will undergo mandatory pre-and on- treatment 
tumor biopsies . If the Investigator judges the risk of cert ain on -treatment biopsies 
unacceptable for the patient (eg, based on site of tumor, potential for complications 
during/after procedure, etc.) the medical monitor must be consulted (see 
Section 1.4 Rationale for Pretreatment and On- treatment Biopsies) .
The dose level of PF -04518600 and the dose level of utomilumab within the dose 
combination level will be selected from MTD or OBD established in Part B1. If the MTD is 
not reached , the maximum administered dose (MAD )maybe selected. A flat dosing strategy  
for PF -04518600, similar to one implemented for Part A2, will be implemented if supported 
by [CONTACT_134967].
Based on emerging data from Parts B1and B2, if no response has been seen by [CONTACT_134968] 
10thpatient enrolls in either arm in B2, enrollment may pause until a patient experiences a 
response or after the [ADDRESS_152858] 
10 patients. If there are responders in both arms before the 10thpatient enrolls, then 
enrollment will continue to the fu ll 20 patients for each arm.

3.1.5. Criteria for Dose Escalation
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part A Monother apy
A mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_12183], targeting a DLT rate of 25% and an acceptable DLT interval 
(20% -30%) ,88will be utilized in Part A1 dose escalation phase .  Initial 2 to 4patients will be 
enrolled in each cohort with a targe t size of 3 patients.  In dose cohorts with 2 patients 
enrolled, an additional patient may  be enrolled for dose escalation assessment if one of the 
two patients has a DLT event observed.   Decisions to escalate to the next dose level will be 
determined usin g safety  assessments obtained from these initial 2 -4 patients. 
The d ose levels to be evaluated are listed in Table 2. Beginning with the starting dose o f 
0.01 mg/kg, if either a DLT related to PF -04518600 or a grade 2cytokine release s yndrome, 
infusion reaction, or allergic reaction is observed, subsequent dosages will not be increased 
by[CONTACT_726] 3-fold, or one -half a log (eg,increases from 0.01 mg/kg will be to 0.03 mg/kg ,
and increases from 0.3mg/ kg will be to 1.0mg/kg ). If dosages greater than 3 mg/kg are 
evaluated, if DLTs are absent, subsequent dose levels may  include a maximum of 5- fold 
increase.  If a DLT considered related to PF -04518600 is observed, the next dose level will 
not be greater than 3 -fold the previous dose level.   Up to a maximum of 20 mg/kg may be 
evaluated.  If a high DLT rate is observed at the starting dose, the study  may  be stopped.

occurring in the first two cycle of treatment (28 days) will be classified as DL Ts, unless there 
is a clear alternative explanation (eg ,related to underly ing disease/progression):
Hematologic:
Grade 4neutropenia lasting >7 days.
Febrile neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000/mm3 with a

Non-hematologic:
Grade [ADDRESS_152865] not 
been maximall y treated (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhe a) or can be easily  treated 
(eg,electrol yte abnormalities) .
In addition, clinically  important or persistent toxicities (eg, toxicities responsible for 
significant dose delay as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Delay )that are not included in the 
above criteria may  be considered a DLT following review b y [COMPANY_007] and the investigators.   
All DL Ts need to represent a clinically  significant shift from baseline.
*Specificall y for HCC patients entering with a lower baseline value of platelets, change from 
baseline needs to be taken into consideration.
Information regarding DLT observation period can be found in Section 3.1.5 (Criteria for 
Dose Escalation) . Whilst DL T observation for [ADDRESS_152866] 98days (or completion of 7cycles) will be taken into 
account for MTD and RP2D selection ( see Section 3.3, MTD definition). During the 98 day 
assessment period, specific atten tion will be paid to late immune -related AEs(see 
Section 3.2.1 Late Immune Related DLTs ).  Late immune -related AE information will be 
collected from patient s who withdraw after 1 to 6cycles o f treatment during follow up visit s
(see Section 6.3Follow -up V isit). 
3.2.1. Late Immune R elated DLTs
Late immune related DLTs are immune -related AEs that meet the same grading criteria as 
DLT crite riaandoccur from Day 29through the 98 day assessment period (or completion of 
first 7 cycles if patient remains on treatment) .  If late immune related DLTs occur, enrollment 
intoany higher dose level cohorts will be placed on temporaril yhold. All saf ety data will be 
reviewed , and a decision will be made to either:
Continue enrollment in higher dose level cohorts.
Increase the number of patients in the cohort in which the immune -related DLT
occur redto 6total patients .  If the cohort has already  recruited [ADDRESS_152867] 98 days to reassess safet y at this dose level.   If no other late immune -related 
DLTs are observed (total late immune -related DLT rate is 1 out of 6 or 1out of 9 ), 
enrollment in higher dose level cohorts may  resume.  If after the enrollment of 
additional patient s the late immune -related DLT rate increases to 2 or more patients 
out of 6, this dose level will be considered above the MTD .  In this case, the next 
lower dose leve l cohort will be expanded to 6 then 9 total patients to reassess safet y at 
that dose level.

to be above MTD.  Increase the number of patients in the next lowest dose level 
cohort to [ADDRESS_152868] 98 days to reassess safety at this dose level. 
•Stop the study. 
For any given patient that is on-treatment at dose levels that are subsequently considered to 
be above the MTD, the option to dose reduce will be discussed (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose
Reductions, Interruptions and Discontinuation Criteria).  If a patient tolerated the above MTD dose level well and is benefiting, continuation of treatment at the above MTD dose level will require re-consenting.
3.3. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Definition
The estimated MTD is the dose level associated with approximately 25% of patients 
experiencing DLT.  The target interval for the DLT rate is 20%-30%.  Due to the discreteness of the dose levels and in the interest of safety of patients, the estimated MTD is the highest 
tested dose level with mean DLT rate ≤0.[ADDRESS_152869] 9 DLT evaluable patients.  This is with 
the exception of Grade 4 and 3 cytokine release syndrome, infusion reaction or allergic 
reaction.  If ≥1 patient out of 6 (or ≥17%) experiences a Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome, 
infusion reaction or allergic reaction, or if 2 patients out of 6 (33%) experiences 
Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome, infusion reaction or allergic reaction, the dose level will be considered to be above the MTD.  All safety data will be evaluated and a decision will be made whether or not to permanently stop enrollment in the higher cohorts and declare the MTD, to continue enrollment in the cohort, to increase the number of patients evaluated in that cohort or to stop the study (see Section 3.2.1 Late Immune Related DLTs).  The 
cumulative incidence of all late immune related DLTs will be taken into account for determination of the MTD/RP2D. An interim safety analysis will be triggered if the overall cumulative incidence of late immune related DLTs increases above 25% across all dose levels.  If a clear dose response is observed, the study may resume enrollment at the lowest dose level with incidence in [ADDRESS_152870] a dose response relationship (ie, consistently observed in all dose levels), the option to terminate the study will be considered. 
3.4. Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) Definitions
The Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) is the lowest dose that can produce a pharmacodynamic 
effect that is consistent with the proposed mechanism with an acceptable toxicity.   
 
 
 
 
 
3.5. Maximum Administered Dose (MAD)

In this stud y, male patients who are able to father child ren and female patients who are of 
childbearing potential will receive PF -04518600 or PF -04518600 in combination with 
utomilumab , which is a compound for which the teratogenic risk is currently unknown.  Two 
(2) methods of highly  effective contraception mu st be used throughout the study  and 
continued for 90days after the last dose.  The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation 
with the patient will confirm the patient has selected two appropriate methods of 
contraception for the individual patient from the list of permitted contraception methods (see 
below) and will confirm the patient has been instructed in their consistent and correct use.  
Patients need to affirm that they  meet the criteria for correct use of at least 2 of the selected 
methods of contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the 
patient the need to use highly  effective contraception consistently  and correctly  according to 
the S chedule of A ctivities and document such conversation in the patient’s chart.  In addition, 
the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately  if a 
selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the 
patient or the patient’s partner . 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonization (I CH) 
guideline s investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient 
or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way  different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).  Eligible patients will be enrolled 
to receive PF -04518600 (and utomilumab for Part B patients) in an open- labeled, unblinded 
manner.  Patients will be registered and successively  assigned to the next available treatment 
slot at a dose level or dose combination level decided on after the previous cohort’s safet y 
evaluation and ongoing observations o f earlier enrolled patients.  For monotherapy , patients 
will be dosed at 0.01 mg/kg PF -[ADDRESS_152879] cohort.  For combination therap y, 
patients will be dosed at 0.1 mg/kg PF -[ADDRESS_152880] ed dose for PF -04518600 in the B2 combination therap y dose 
expansion cohorts is 30 mg (a flat dose equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) Q2W in 
combination with PF -[ADDRESS_152881] completed the necessary  baseline assessments. The site staff will
e-mail a complete registration form to the designated sponsor study team member .  The 
sponsor wil l assign a patient identification number, which will be used on all Case Report 
Form (CRF) pages and other study -related documentation or correspondence referencing that 
patient and e -mail to the site.
No patient shall receive investigational product until the investigator or designee has received 
the following information in writing from the sponsor:
Confirmation of the patient’s enrollment .
Specification of the dose level for that patient ;and 
Permission to proceed with dosing the patient.
The sponsor or designee will notify  the other sites of the inclusion of a new patient, and will 
inform study  sites about the next possible enrollment date .
PF-[ADDRESS_152882] is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing 
appropriate clinical site documentation sy stem.  The existing clinical site's documentation 
system should capture all pertinent/required information on the preparation and 
administration of the dose.  This may  be used in place of the Preparation Record after 
approval from the [COMPANY_007] monitor. 
At each stud y visit, the Investigator, or designee, will assess the patient’s compliance with 
the study  requirements.  The assessment will include checks of protocol compliance and 
concomitant mediation use.

PF-04518600 will be administered intravenousl y with adjustment for body weight at every 
cycle.  A cy cle is defined as the time from Day1dose to the next Day1 dose.  If there are no 
treatment delay s, a cy cle will be 2 weeks in duration.  PF-04518600 will be administered on 
Day 1of each 2 week cycle per the IP Manual as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 
60minutes (-5 to +15 minutes and should include the time needed to flush the infusion line ) 
on an outpatient basis.  If infusion reaction occurs, infusion rate may be reduced ( refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions and Appendix 4for management of infusion reactions ).
The use of an infusion pump is the preferred method of admini stration to ensure accurate 
delivery  of the investigational product, but gravit y drips are allowed. 
Each patient may  receive PF -[ADDRESS_152884] (seeSection 
5.4.6 Treatment After Initial Evidence of Radiological Progression ), patient refusal, or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs , or end of stud y, whichever occurs first . 
The dose level will be assigned by  [CONTACT_456] ( Section 5.1Allocation to T reatment ).  Patient 
actual bod y weight will be used to calculate the mg/kg dose, and the calculated dose will be 
rounded off to the second decimal point.  All patients should be weighed within 72 hours 
prior to dosing for every  cycle to ensure they  did not experience either a weight loss or gain 
>10% from the prior weight used to calculate the amount of PF-04518600 required for dose 
preparation.   Decision to recalculate PF-04518600 dose based on the weight obtained at each 
cycle can be in accordance with institutional practice, however if the patient experienced 
either a weight loss or gain >10% compared to the weight used to calculate the initial dose, 
the amount of PF-[ADDRESS_152885] recent weight 
obtained. 
5.4.2. Part A2 Monotherapy
PF-04518600 will be administered intravenousl yas a flat dose .  A cy cle is defined as the 
time from current Day 1dose to the next Day 1dose.  If there are no treatment delay s, a 
cycle will be 2 weeks in duration.  PF-04518600 will be administered on Day 1of each 
2week cy cle per the IP Manual as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes ( -5to 
+15minutes and should include the time needed to flush the infusion line ) on an outpatient 
basis.  If infusion reaction occurs, infusion rate maybe reduced (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions and Appendix 4for management of infusion reactions). 
The use of an infusion pump is the preferred method of administration to ensure accurate 
delivery  of the investigational product, but gravit y drips are allowed.  Please refer to the IP 
manual for infusion rate and duration.
Each patient may  receive PF -[ADDRESS_152886] (seeSection

5.4.5. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every  effort should be made to administer study  treatment on the planned dose and schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity  dosing m ay be delay ed and/or reduced as described below.  
In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the highest -grade 
toxicity  observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify  investigators at the first occurrence 
of an y adverse s ymptom.
Dose modifications may  occur in three way s:
Within a cy cle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if 
required, during a given treatment cy cle.
Between cy cles: next cy cle administration may  be delay ed due to persisting toxi city 
when a new cy cle is due to start .
In the next cycle: dose reduction may  be required in a subsequent cy cle based on 
toxicity  experienced in the previous cy cle. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion Reactions
Following the first infusion of some monoclonal antibody  therapeutics, s ome patients 
experience fever, headache, nausea, vomiting or hypotension.   These adverse events (AEs) 
are generally  ascribed to ly sis of cellular targets, cy tokine release, or complement activation. 
In the case of infusion reaction, characterized by  [CONTACT_134974], and less commonly  
hypotension, either experienced by  a particular patient or if seen in other patients, 
pretreatment medication should be administered to reduce the incidence and severit y.  A 
regimen is suggested here; however, if local standa rd of care is a different regimen, this will 
be allowed.  In cases of infusion reactions, patients should be pretreated with acetaminophen 
and diphenh ydramine (or other antihistamine) approximately 0.[ADDRESS_152891] administrati on.  The pretreatment medications will not be supplied by 
[CONTACT_4618].  Suggested starting doses are 650 to 1000 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg

Page 142diphenhy dramine (or equivalent for other antihistamine s) either IV or oral.  Two (2) 
additional doses of acetaminophen ma y be administered approximately every 4 -6hours after 
the initial pretreatment or as needed.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypersensitivity Types 1 and 3
Type 1 hypersensitivity  or allergic (eg, shortness of breath, urticaria, anaphy laxis, 
angioedema) reactions are theoretically  possible in response to any  injected protein.  I mmune 
complex mediated Ty pe 3 hypersensitivity  reactions are similar to the adverse events (AEs) 
of Ty pe1reactions but are likely  to be delay ed from the time of infusion and may  include 
symptoms such as rash, urt icaria, pol yarthritis, myalgias, poly synovitis, fever, and, if severe, 
glomerulonephritis. 
All patients should be closely  observed while receiving investigational product infusions and 
monitoring for clinical signs of a s ystemic reaction will continue the reafter for clinical signs 
of allergic reactions/hy persensitivity . 
In the case of a h ypersensitivity  reaction, the patient will be treated s ymptomatically  with 
supportive care, further monitoring, and treatment with anti -histamines and/or 
corticosteroids.   Study  infusions may  be stopped and the patient will be followed until the 
end of the stud y. 
Detailed guidance on treatment, dose interruptions and potential retreatment is provided in
Appendix 4.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Extravasation
In the event of extravasation infusion should be stopped immediately  and the investigator 
needs to be consulted immediately .  Treatment of extravasation should follow local standard 
of care. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immune -Related Adverse Events (irAEs)
Although the mechanism of OX40 and 4 -1BB are different from check point inhibitors, both 
OX40 and 4 -1BB do stimulate the immune sy stem and thus immune -related AEs (irAEs) can 
occur.   Immune mediated etiology  of an AE will be adjudicated b y the investigator.  
Treatment of irAEs is mainly  dependen t upon severity  (NCI CTCAE grade v4.03):
Grade 1or 2: treat s ymptomatically  or with moderate -dose steroids, more frequent 
monitoring;
Persistent Grade 2: manage similar to Grade 3to 4AE;
Grade 3or 4: treat with high -dose corticosteroids.
Treatment of i rAEs should follow guidelines set forth in Table 4.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Delay
Re-treatment following treatment interruption for treatment related toxicity  or at the start of 
any new cycle may  not occur until all of the following parameters have been met:
ANC 1,000/mm3.
Platelets count 50,000/mm3.  HCC only : based on investigator judgment, after 
consultation with sponsor’s medical monitor, change from baseline will be 
considered, and levels of 25,000/mm3may be acceptable.
Non-hematologic toxicities have returned to baseline or Grade 1severity  (or, at the 
investigator discretion, Grade 2if not considered a safet y risk for the patient).
If a treatment delay  results from worsening of hematologic or biochemical parameters, the 
frequency  of relevant blood tests should be increased as clinicall y indicated.  Patients 
experiencing Grade 3or 4potentially  treatment related toxicity or intolerable 
Grade 2toxicit y despi[INVESTIGATOR_134912]/delay ed.  
Appropriate follow-up assessments should be done until adequate recovery (or until deemed 
irreversible) occurs as assessed b y the Investigator.
If these conditions are met within 2 weeks of treatment inter ruption or cy cle delay , 
PF-04518600 or PF -04518600/ utomilumab may be resumed.  For monotherapy , please refer 
to Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 (Dose Reductions, Interruptions and Discontinuation PartA

resumption. For combination therap y, intrapatient dose reduction will not be permitted (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 Dose Reductions , Interruptions and Discontinuation PartB Combination 
Therap y).
If these conditions are not met, treatment resumption must be delay ed up to a maximum of 
4weeks .  If these parameters have not been met after 4 weeks of dose interruption or 4 weeks 
of new cy cle delay , permanent discontinuation of treatment with PF-04518600 or

Page 147recovering from treatment -related toxicit y after 4 weeks of treatment interruption or cy cle 
delay can be considered only  if the patient is deemed to be deriving obvious clinical benefit 
per the investigator’s best medical judgment and needs to be agreed between the investigator 
and the sponsor.
If a treatment interruption continues bey ond Day 14 of the current cy cle, then the day  when 
treatment is restarted will be counted as Day 1of the next cy cle. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Reductions , Interruptions and Discontinuation Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Part A Monotherapy
Following dose interruption , cycle delay  due to toxicity , or observati on of late immune 
related DLTs such that the current dose of treatment is now considered to be above the MTD 
(see Section 3.2.1 Late Immune Related DLTs ), the PF -04518600 dose may need to be 
reduced when treatment is resumed.
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1/2treatment -related toxicity .  
However, investigators should alway s manage their patients according to their medical 
judgment based on the particular clinical circums tances.
Dose reduction of PF-[ADDRESS_152907] (0.01 mg/kg) 
cohort should be discontinued from the stud y if dose reduction is required.   Patients requiring 
more than 2 (or [ADDRESS_152908] cohort) dose reductions will be discontinued from the treatment 
and entered into the follow -up phase, unless otherwise agreed between the investigator and 
the sponsor .  For example, if a patien t has clear signs of clinical benefit, and if the 
investigator considered it to be in the best interest of the patient, they  may  be allowed to stay  
on study  at a further reduced dose after recovery  and appropriate dose interruption.  All dose 
modifications /adjustments must be clearl y documented in the patient's source notes and CRF. 
Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cy cles should be 
administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required.  Dose re -escalatio n 
is not allowed.
Patients experiencing a DL T may  resume dosing at the next lower dose level once adequate 
recovery  is achieved.  No dose reductions are planned for patients experiencing toxicities 
other than those listed as DL Ts.  However, patients experi encing recurrent and intolerable 
Grade 2toxicit y ma y resume dosing at the next lower dose level once recovery to 
Grade 1or baseline is achieved. 
Recommended dose reductions are illustrated in Table 5.

treatments may  be continued at the Inves tigator’s discretion while awaiting radiologic 
confi rmation of disease progression.
Patients may  receive study  treatments while waiting for confirmation of progressive disease 
(PD)if they  are clinicall y stable as defined b y the following criteria:
Absence of clinical signs and sy mptoms (including worsening of laboratory  values) 
of disease progression.
No decline in ECOG performance status.
Absence of rapid progression of disease b y radiographic imaging.
Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical s ites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
If repeat imaging no longer shows PD but rather CR, PR or SD compared to the initial scan, 
treatment may  be continued/resumed.  In determining whether or not the tumor burden ha s 
increased or decreased, Investigators should consider all target as well as non -target lesions 
(refer to the Appendix 6).
If the repeat imaging confirms PD, patients should be considered for discontinuation from 
both investigational products.  However, according to the I nvestigator’s clinical judgment 
and after discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor, if a patient with evidence of 
PD is still experiencing clinical benefit, the patient may  be eligible for continued treatment 
with both investigational products.  The Investigator’s judgment should be based on the 
overall benefit -risk assessment and the patient’s clinical condition, including performance 
status, clinical sy mptoms, adverse events and laboratory  data. 
Patients who stop treatment for reasons other than toxicity with either or both investigational 
products and then experience radiologic disease progression shortly  thereafter will be eligible 
for re -treatment with either or both investigational products at t he discretion of the 
Investigator and after discussion with the Sponsor.
PF-[ADDRESS_152911] once reconstituted and/or diluted.
Storage conditions stated in the single reference safety document (SRSD) (ie, investigator 
brochure [IB]) will be superseded b y the storage conditions stated in the labeling. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products) .  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active daily  evaluation 
for excursions should be documented.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device 
and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to 
ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon disco very.  
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to the labeled storage 
conditions, as described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined while 
maintaining appropriate storage conditions (2 -8C) and not used until the sponsor provides 
documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a 
protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the investigational product after the 
temperature excursion.   Use of the investigational product prior to sponsor approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site. The Investigational Product Manual should 
be referenced for an y additional guidance on storage conditions and actions to be taken when 
conditi ons are outside the specified range.
5.6. Drug Accountability 
The investigat ivesite must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  The sponsor or designee will 
provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site).
To ensure adequate records, all PF -[ADDRESS_152912] be returned to [COMPANY_007] or its appointed agent (eg, a contract research organization

drug-drug interaction.  If so it must be approved by [CONTACT_456].
5.7.5. Anti -inflammatory Therapy
Anti- inflammatory  or narcotic analgesic may  be offered as needed assuming there is no 
known or expected drug -drug interaction and assum ing the drug is not included in the 
Concomitant Treatment(s) section. 
5.7.6. Corticosteroids 
Chronic, sy stemic corticosteroid use (prednisone 10mg/day  or dexamethasone 
1.5mg/day ) for palliative or supportive purpose is not permitted.  Acute emergency  and 
short term administration, topi[INVESTIGATOR_14929], inhaled spray s, eye drops, or local injections 
of corticosteroids are allowed.   If immune -related AEs occur, immune -suppressive treatment 
should be administered according to local sta ndards or practice.
5.7.7. Surgery 
Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for an y surgical procedures during the study .  The 
appropriate interval of time between surgery  and PF -04518600/ utomilumab administration, 
required to minimize the potential risk of imp aired wound healing, risk of infection and 
bleeding, has not been determined.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_134916] -04518600 /utomilumab administration is 
recommended at least 7 days prior to surgery .  Postoperativel y, the decision to reinitiate 
PF-04518600 /utomilumab treatment sho uld be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory  
wound healing and recovery  from surgery .
5.7.8. Anticoagulation 
Anticoagulation (heparin and factor Xa inhibitors only, no vitamin -K antagonists) will be 
allowed if indicated. However, perioperative anticoag ulant use must be in alignment with 
the institutional standards for perioperative biopsy  procedures.
5.7.9. Radiotherapy
There has been tumor regression observed in a non-irradiated tumor following palliative 
radiotherap y in a melanoma patient treated with 10 mg/kg of PF-[ADDRESS_152913]. The irradiated tumor should preferably be a non- target 
lesion. If a target lesion is sele cted for irradiation, there should be other target lesions that 
can be followed for measurements. Palliative radiotherapy  on study is permitted (eg, for the 
treatment of painful bon y or skin lesions) if clinically  indicated at an y time. 
In view of the current lack of data about the interact ion of PF-04518600 and/or utomilumab
with concurrent radiotherapy , study  drug treatment should be interrupted during
radiothera py, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [ADDRESS_152914] 1 day after .Planned 
dosing schedule, treatment f ields and technique need to be discussed with and approved by

6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1.Screening
For screening procedures see Schedule of Activities and Section 7Assessments .
All patients being considered for the stud y and eligible f or screening must sign an informed 
consent for the stud y before completing an y stud y-specific procedures.   A patient 
identification number will be assigned.   The investigator (or appropriate delegate at the site) 
will obtain informed consent from each patient in accordance with the procedures described 
in the Schedule of Activities and Section 12.[ADDRESS_152915] 
with the patient to assess adverse events and concomitant medications and treatment is 
expected.  If laboratory  assessments are needed to follow -up unresolved adverse events, 
retrieval of assessments performed at an institution local to the patient is acceptable.
Independent to time of disease progression, all patients (unless patients are lost to follow up, 
consent is withdrawn, or study  is discontinued by  [CONTACT_456]) will be followed for survival 
for at least 2years from the time of their first dose of investigational product (s) . After the 
completion of end of treatment visits, Patients will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone every [ADDRESS_152916] surviving patient (whichever is later) the study  will be closed.
6.3.1. Follow -Up for L ate Immune -Related E vents
As outlined in Section 3.2.1 (LateImmune Related DL Ts), safety  and tolerability  assessment 
for the first 98 days (or completion of 7 cycles) will be taken into account for MTD and 
RP2D selection.  To collect late immune related DL T information, any  patient who 
discontinues after 1 to 4or 6cycles of treatment will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone as part of the 
follow up visit.   For patie nts who discontinue after receiving 5 cycles of treatment, late 
immune information will be collected during the 28 to 35 day follow up visit.  If the patient 
discontinues after receiving 6 cycles of treatment, they  will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone 14 days 
(2days) after end of treatment ( EOT).  If the patient discontinues after receiving 4 cycles of 
treatment, they  will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone 42 days (2days) after EOT.  If the patient 
discontinues after receiving 3 cycles of treatment, they  will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone 56 days 
(2days) after EOT. If the patient discontinues after receiving 2 cycles of treatment, they  
will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone 70 days (2days) after EO T. If the patient discontinues after 
receiving 1 cycle of treatment, they  will be contact[CONTACT_134982] 84 days (2days) after EOT.  
If any concern arises, patient will be called in for an inpatient follow up visit within 
5calendar day s of initial phone ca ll. For this inpatient follow up visit, t he Schedule of 
Activities will be similar to the follow up visit completed [ADDRESS_152917] every  4 weeks until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of 
the Investigator, that no further improvement is expected.
6.4.Patient Withdrawal
The reason for a patient’s discontinuation from treatment will be documented in the end of 
study /withdrawal CRF.  Patients will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_152918], or they  may  be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safet y or behavioral reasons, or 
the inability  of the patient to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site.

will be allowed to stay  on study .
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_4677].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_134983]’s medical record.   In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.   The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, requests the pat ient to return for a final visit, if applicable, 
and follow -up with the patient regarding any  unresolved AEs.
If the patient refuses further visits, the patient should continue to be followed for survival 
unless the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information or for further 
contact.  In this case, no further study  specific evaluations should be performed, and no 
additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data 
collected before such withdrawal of co nsent.

7.1.Safety Assessment
Safety  assessments w ill include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs and phy sical 
exami nation, electrocardiogram (ECG [ 12-lead] ), laboratory  assessments, including 
pregnancy  tests and verification of concomitant treatments.
7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing
For female patients of childbearin g potential (that is, patients who are not defined as a patient 
of non- child bearing potential, see Section 4.3[Lifesty leGuideline]) , a serum or urine 
pregnancy  test, with sensitivity  of at l east 25 mIU/mL  will be performed on 2 occasions prior 
to starting study  treatment-once at the start of screening and once at the baseline (C1D1) 
visit, immediately  before investigational product administration.  Following a negative 
pregnancy  result at scr eening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and a further 
negative pregnancy  result will then be required at the baseline visit before the patient may  
receive the investigational product.  Pregnancy  tests will also be routinely  repeated at every  
cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study  treatment , and additionally  
whenever [ADDRESS_152920] (I RB)/ institutional ethics committee (IECs) or if required b y local

at screening must also be tested for hepatitis D by [CONTACT_30936]  (HDV Ab) or polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) . All Part A2HCC patie nts with detectable viral load for HCV or HBV at 
screening , must be retested for viral load every  3months (i e,Cycle7Day 1, Cy cle13Day 1, 
Cycle19Day 1, etc) and at the EOT visit . Other tests may  be conducted per standard 
practice to confirm an active hepatitis or HIV infection.   In Part B, history  of human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) will be recorded for HNSCC patients. 
All laboratory  safet y assessments conducted on Cycle 1Day 1 (C1D1) must be completed 
within 48 hours prior to dosing.  Prior to dosing a patient , safet y assessments (hematology , 
chemistry , coagulation and urinaly sis) must be reviewed by  [CONTACT_134985].  If screening
assessments are performed within 72 hours prior to C1D1, there is no need to repeat 
hematology , chemistry  or coagulation assess ments on C1D1.  If screening assessments are 
performed within 7 days of C1D1, there is no need to repeat urinaly sis assessments on C1D1.   
Assessments performed on Cy cle2Day 1(C2D1) and each subsequent cycle should be 
performed within [ADDRESS_152921] additional blood tests 
performed for the purpose of planning treatment administration, dose modification, or 
following AEs.
If abnormalities are observed in Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH )values, a T4 thyroxine 
test will b e performed.

7.1.4. Vital Signs and Physical Examination
Patients will have a phy sical exam ination to include weight, vital sig ns, assessment of ECOG 
performance status and height; height will be measured at screening onl y.
7.1.5. (12-Lead) Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiogram (ECG): A single 12- lead (with at least a 10 -second rhy thm strip) tracing 
will be used for the screening ECG. Triplicate 12 -lead (with at least a 10 -second rhy thm 
strip) tracing will be used for all other scheduled ECGs.   Unscheduled visits do not require 
triplicate ECGs.   It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the 
PF-[ADDRESS_152922] intervals auto matically .  All 12 -lead ECGs will be reviewed by  a central laboratory .  
At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities) three consecutive ECGs will be performed 
at approximatel y 1-5minutes apart to determine the mean QTcF inter val.  Fridericia’s 
formula (QTcF) is calculated as follows:
QTcF= QT / (RR)0.33
If the mean QTcF is prolonged (>501 msec, ie,  CTC AE Grade 3), then the ECGs should 
be re -evaluated b y a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the finding is 
made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate.  If manual reading verifies 
a QTcF of >501 msec, immediate correction for reversible causes (including electrol yte 
abnormalities, hy poxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the potential to prolong 
the QTcF interval) should be performed.  In addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately  
performed hourl y for at least 3 hours until the QTcF interval falls below 501 msec.  If QTcF 
interval reverts to less than 501 msec, and in the judg ment of the investigator(s) and sponsor 
is determined to be due to cause(s) other than investigational product , treatment may  be 
continued with regular ECG monitoring.  I f in that timeframe the QTcF intervals rise above 
501msec the investigational product will be held until the QTcF interval decreases to 
[ADDRESS_152923] dose level.  
If the QTcF interval has still not decreased to 480 msec after 2 -weeks, or if at any  time a 
patient has a QTcF interval >[ADDRESS_152924] , thorough consideration should be given to potential precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4560] (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrol yte 
disturbance) and possible evaluation b y specialist.
If patient experiences a c ardiac or neurologic AE (specificall y syncope, dizziness, seizures, 
or stroke), an ECG (triplicate) should be obtained at the time of the event. 
When matched with PK sampling, the ECG should preferabl y be carried out before each PK 
sample drawing such tha t the PK sample is collected at the nominal time (ie, the timing of the 
PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections). 
7.1.6. Echocardiogram or Multigated Acquisition (MUGA) Scan
Echocardiogram or multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) will be evaluated inpatients with 
previous history  of anthracy cline treatment.  For these patients, an echocardiogram or 
MUGA will be performed at screening and every  3months whilst on treatment and when 
clinically  indicated.  An echocardiogram or MUGA will be performed at the end of treatment 
(EOT) visit if not performed within 3 months of discontinuation.  The following parameters 
will be evaluated: v entricular function (including left ventricular ejection fraction [L VEF] , 
end sy stolic volume [ESV] and end diastolic volume [EDV] ), qualitative evaluation of 
chamber size, and wall motion.  A Doppler examination will be completed and should 
include an assessment of mitral valve, atria, right ventricle, tricuspid valve, aortic valve, 
pulmonic valve, great vessels, and pericardi um.

7.2.1. Blood for PK Analysis of PF-04518600 and Utomilumab
For both Part A Monotherapy and Part B Combination Therapy, blood samples for the 
analysis of PF-04518600 concentrations will be collected into appropriately labeled tubes at times specified in the Schedule of Activities of the protocol.  For each analysis, 5 mL of 
blood samples will be collected to provide approximately 2 mL serum.  The PK sampling schedule may be modified based on emerging PK data.
For Part B Combination Therapy only, blood samples (2 mL whole blood at each time point) 
will be collected to provide serum for PK analysis of utomilumab as outlined in the Schedule 
of Activities .  The PK sampling schedule may be modified based on emerging PK data.
The 1 hr samples should be collected immediately before the infusion ends for the 
corresponding investigational agent from the contra-lateral arm of the infusion.
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, an additional blood sample should be 
collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or serious AEs and the date and time of blood sample collection and of last dosing prior to PK collection documented in the CRF.
Where noted in the Schedule of Activities , blood samples for PF-04518600 (both Part A and 
Part B) and utomilumab (Part B only) concentrations will be collected at approximately the same time as pharmacodynamic samples whenever possible. 
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the exact nominal time 
relative to dosing.  However, the exact time of the sample collection will always be noted on the CRF.  Samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) from dosing will be not be captured as a protocol deviation.  If a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for any reason, the missed sample time may be re-scheduled with agreement of clinical investigators, patient and Sponsor.

A tiered approach to screening, confirmation and titer/quantitation will be utilized. The screening assay with competitive confirmatory steps followed by [CONTACT_134986].  Samples may also be analyzed in neutralization assays (NAb).  Patients having an unresolved adverse event that is possibly related to ADA formation will be asked to return for ADA and drug concentration blood sampling at approximately 3 month intervals until the adverse event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at CCI

8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y of the 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_134987] a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AEs that ar e 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_3174] a nSAE.  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the co ntext of the clinical 
study .
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through 98calendar day s from first administration of the 
investigational product, or up to [ADDRESS_152926], 
whichever is later .  SAEs occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended 
should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, 
PF-[ADDRESS_152927] is administered, this information will be reported on a Serious Adverse Event Form 
and will be recorded in the safet y database.
AEs ( non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has taken at least 
1dose of study  treatment through [ADDRESS_152928] or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs i nclude but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasations;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);

Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported as AEs 
in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed b y measurement of 
malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product , by [CONTACT_4670], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF which is a specific versio n of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication error s involving patient exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], a s determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AEs arecaptured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page. 
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining wh ether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the abse nce of any  of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
PF-[ADDRESS_152929] medical occurrence at any  dose th at:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduc t normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect;
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and symptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the 
safet y reporting period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134920].  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome 
during the study  or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death 
must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with CTCAE Grade 5 (see Section 8.8on 
Severity  Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important me dical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medica l event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or dr ug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_134988] y 
database ( see Section 8.14.1 on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
level s concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events.

Page 171The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Patients who 
present with the following labora tory abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (x ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value [ADDRESS_152930] with no evidence of 
hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value  2x ULN or not available;
For patients with preexisting AL T ORAST ORtotal bilirubin values above th e ULN, 
the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:
Forpatients with preexisting AST or AL Tbaseline values above the normal 
range, AST or ALT value  2times the baseline values and [ADDRESS_152931], or 
[ADDRESS_152932] (whichever is s maller) .
Concurrent with
For patients with pre- existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total 
bilirubin level increased from baseline b y an amount of at least [ADDRESS_152933] or if the 
value reaches  [ADDRESS_152934] (whichever is smaller).
The patient sh ould return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  The possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and AL T, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase, pr othrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , 
including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug 
and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational ex posure, sexual history , travel 
history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver 
or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute 
hepatitis A, B, or C infection and live r imaging (eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All 
cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no 
other cause for liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities identified at the time, should be 
considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy ’s 
law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.7.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47575] y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medi cal floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril y constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];

Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a wor sening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of persistent pre -treatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission duri ng a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, suc h as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

GRADE Clinical Description of Severity
0 No Change from normal or reference range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.03 CTC AEdocument but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD adverse event
2 MODERATE adverse event
3 SEVERE adverse event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event
Note the distinction between the s everit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with the 
patient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for S AEs listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in acco rdance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (ev idence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor ( see Section 8.14 onReporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product," 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
Forboth unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products , an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
PF-[ADDRESS_152935] in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of tre atment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on a an SAE report f orm and an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  I n 
addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a 
[COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been 
exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP s upplemental form.  
This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of 
awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery  (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow -up to 
the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
the termination should be speci fied and, if clinically  possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_152936].
Addit ional information regarding the EDP may be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, t he 
investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information F orm to provide to his 
partner .

Page 1758.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however a cop y of the completed SAE Report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file .
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section 6.4 Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page. 
When a patient withdraws because of a nSAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient.  In addition, each study  patient will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_152937] be 
made immed iately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This time frame 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of EDP , exposure via breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event withi n [ADDRESS_152938] awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In add ition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  I n general, this will include a descript ion of the AE in sufficient detail to

possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the A E page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be used o n both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adve rse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
9.1.Analysis Sets
a.Safety  anal ysis set. 
The safet y analysis set includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of 
study  medicati on.
b.Full analy sis set.
The full anal ysis set includes all enrolled patients.
c.Per protocol analysis set (evaluable for MTD).
The per protocol anal ysis set includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one 
dose of study  medication and who do not have major treatment deviations during first 
cycle.  Patients with major treatment deviations in DL T observation period are not 
evaluable for the MTD assessment and will be replaced as needed to permit MTD 
estimation.  Major treatment deviations include:
Administration of less than 75% of the planned dose of PF-04518600 provided 
that the reduction is not due to toxicity  attributable to PF -04518600.
Administration of more than 150% of the planned dose of PF-04518600.
d.PK analy sissets.
The PK parameter anal ysis pop ulation is defined as all enrolled patients treated who 
have sufficient information to estimate at least [ADDRESS_152939] one time point.
9.2.Statistical Methods and Properties
9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Dose Escalation/De- Escalation
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part A Monotherapy
Forthe monotherap y portion of the study, a mTPI [CONTACT_8345]88will be adopted for dose 
escalation and de -escalation determination.  The mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_134921] a Bay esian statistics 
framework and a beta -binomial hierarchical model with prior distribution of DLT set a s a 
beta (0.75, 0.65) to compute the posterior probability  of three dosing intervals that reflect the 
relative difference between the toxicity  rate of each dose level to the target rate (pT=0.25, 
where pT is the target probability ).  If the toxicity rate o f the currently  used dose level is far 
smaller than pT, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_134922]; if it is close to target 
probability  (pT), the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_134923]; if it is far greater 
than pT, the mTPI  [INVESTIGATOR_128598] -escalating the dose level. 
Decision rules are based on calculating unit probability  mass (UPM) of three dosing intervals 
corresponding to under, proper, and over dosing in terms of toxicity .  Specifically , the under 
dosing interval is defined as (0 ; pT-e1), the over -dosing interval (pT+e 2;1), and the 
proper -dosing interval (pT - e1, pT+ e 2), where e 1and e 2are small fractions.  Based on the 
safet y profile of PF-04518600 as a single -agent in Study  B0601002, both e 1ande2are 
selected as 0.05.  Therefore, the target interval for the DLT rate is (0.20, 0.30).
The three dosing intervals and the penalt y functions are associated with three different 
dose-escalation decisions.  The under- dosing interval corresponds to a dose escalation (E), 
over-dosing cor responds to dose de -escalation (D), and proper -dosing corresponds to 
remaining at the current dose (R).  Given a dosing interval and a probability distribution, the 
unit probability  mass (UPM) of that dosing interval is defined as the probability  of a pati ent 
belonging to that dosing interval divided b y the length of the dosing interval.  The mTPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_134924], and the one with the largest UPM 
informs the corresponding dose -finding decision, which is the dose lev el to be used for future 
patients.  For example, if the under -dosing interval has the largest UPM, the decision will be 
to escalate, and the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.   Ji et 
al.88have demonstrated that the decision based on UPM is optimal in that it minimizes a 
posterior expected loss (ie, minimizes the chance of making a wrong dosing decision). 
The dose -finding portion of the study  is terminated when either approxim ately  40DLT 
evaluable patients have been enrolled or when at least [ADDRESS_152940] dose with mean DLT rate 30%, whichever comes first.   Refer to 
Table 3(Decision Rules) in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Criteria for Dose Escalation Part A

9.2.2. Statistical Method for Estimating the MTD
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part A Monotherapy
As previously  described, the estimated MTD is the highest tested dose leve l with mean DLT 
rate 0.[ADDRESS_152941] 9 DLT evaluable patients.  It is also assumed that at the estimated MTD, 
less than 17% patients will experience Grade 4cytokine release s yndrome , infusion reaction 
or allergic reaction during the [ADDRESS_152942] 98 days after 
initial treatment.  I t is also assumed that at the estimated MTD less than 33% of patients will 
experience grade [ADDRESS_152943] 98 days after trea tment .  We assume that higher doses of either PF-04518600 result 
in higher toxicity  rates.  But, due to the relatively  low number of patients that may  be 
potentially  allocated to any  dose combination, this assumption may  be violated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part B Combination The rapy
The estimated MTD is the highest tested dose combination level with mean DLT rate 
≤0.[ADDRESS_152944] 9 DLT evaluable patients.  It is also assumed that at the estimated MTD the
toxicity  of PF-04518600/ utomilumab combination follows the monotonicity ass umption that 
ahigher dose level of either PF -[ADDRESS_152945] both a baseline and on -treatment tumor biops y. Aggregate 
toxicity  will be monitored for patients in Part A 2.  DL T will continue to be assessed in 
PartA2, and data acquired in Part A1dose-escalation phase and Part A2dose expansion 
phase will be combined to assess the toxicity  (as suggested by  [CONTACT_134989] O’Quigley , 
2014).89In the event the observed toxicit y exceeds 30%, a revised MTD may be 
recommended.
Although t he A2 sample size is not based on any statistical considerations , the study  would 
have 69% power to assess an overall response rate of 10% with 20 patients assuming the 
overall response rate of current therap y is 2%,96using a one -sample test under a two- sided 
level of 0.1.  The stud y would have about 93% power if the true r esponse rate is 20%. A

ADA samples will be analyzed for the presence or absence of anti- PF-04518600 and 
anti-utomilumab antibodies following a tiered approach using screening, confirmation and titer/quantitation using a validated assay.  Samples tested positive for ADA will be further analyzed for NAb using a validated assay.  Listings and summary tabulations of the time course data on immune response endpoints will be generated.  Potential impact of immunogenicity on PK and clinical response including  safety/tolerability and efficacy of ADA will be explored, if data is warranted.
9.5.4. Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Endpoint
For biopsy samples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, and 
minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequencies and percentages of categorical biomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment.  For each pair of specimens, the percent change from baseline of these same parameters will also be calculated.
Data from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive 
statistics such as linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The statistical approach will examine correlations of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumor efficacy.
The percentage change from baseline for  over the period of 
the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_29569]. The mean change from baseline values over time per cohort will also be tabulated.  Data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
Adverse Events (AEs) will graded by  [CONTACT_134995] (CTCAE) version 4.03 and coded using the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).  The focus of AE summaries will 
be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial onset or increasing in severity  
after the first dose of study  medication.  The number and percentage of patients who 
experienced an y AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE, and treatment related SAE 
will be summarized accord ing to worst toxicity  grades.  The summaries will present AEs 
both on the entire study  period and by  [CONTACT_5265] (C ycle 1and C ycles beyond 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities
The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory  test abnormalities wi ll be 
summarized according to worst toxicity  grade observed for each lab assay .  The anal yses will 
summarize laboratory  tests both on the entire study  period and by  [CONTACT_5265] (Cy cle1and 
Cyclesbeyond 1).  Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of laboratory  
toxicities.
For laboratory  tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal, 
abnormal or not done . 
9.6.3. ECG
The anal ysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safet y analysis set with baseline 
and on- treatment ECG data. Baseline is defined as results collected at C1D1 prior to dosing.  
ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) will be used for the 
statistical analysis and all data presentations.  Any  data obtained from ECGs repeated for 
safet y reasons after the nominal time -points will not be averaged along with the preceding 
triplicates.  Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be included in the outlier 
analysis (categorical analy sis) as individual values obtained at unscheduled t ime points.
QT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors 
[ie,Fridericia’s (default correction), Bazett’s, and possibly  a study  specific factor, as 
appropriate].  Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, respo nse rate (RR) ,PR, QRS, 
QTcF (and other correction factors, eg, QTcB as appropriate), and by  [CONTACT_2715].  I ndividual QT` 
(all evaluated corrections) intervals will be liste d by [CONTACT_134996].  The most appropriate 
correction factor will be selected and used for the following analy ses of central tendency  and 
outliers and used for the study  conclusions.  Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be used to summarize the absolute corrected QT 
value and changes from basel ine in corrected QT after treatment by  [CONTACT_134997].  For 
each patient and b y treatment, the maximum change from baseline will be calculated as well 
as the maximum post- baseline value across time -points.  Categorical anal ysis will be 
conducted for t he maximum change from baseline in corrected QT and the maximum 
post-baseline QT value. 
PF-[ADDRESS_152947] on treatment corrected QT (one or more 
correction method will be used) using maximum CTC AE Grade.  Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality at baseline vs. on treatment (yes, no, not done: (n, %)).  Patients experiencing clinically-relevant morphological ECG changes will be summarized (including frequency and percentage).
The effect of drug concentrations on corrected QT change from baseline will be explored 
graphically.  Additional concentration-corrected QT analyses may be performed.  Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with PK/ pharmacodynamic models.
9.7. Analysis of Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) for PF-04518600 and Utomilumab
Summary of number of patients developed ADA for PF-04518600 and utomilumab will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_7169].  Subgroup analysis may be performed to assess the PK or pharmacodynamic response if data warrant.

Adapted from E.A. Eisenhauer, et al: New response evaluation criteria in solid tumors: 
Revised RECI ST guideline (version 1.1).   European Journal of Cancer 45 (2009) 228-247.85
A.Categorizin g Lesions at Baseline :
1. Measurable Lesions:
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension.
Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least [ADDRESS_152972] or MRI  (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
Lesions with longest diameter at least [ADDRESS_152973] X -ray. 
Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by  [CONTACT_4733].
Malignant ly mph nodes with the short axis [ADDRESS_152974].
NOTE:  The shortest a xis is used as the diameter for malignant ly mph nodes, longest axis for 
all other measurable lesions. 
2.Non-measurable D isease:
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable
(including nodes with short axis between 10 and 14. 9mm) and truly  non-measurable 
disease such as pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory  breast disease, 
leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions 
that cannot be accuratel y measured with calipers, abdo minal masses identified by  
[CONTACT_135002].
Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated b y CT or MRI and meet the definition of 
measurability  at baseline.
Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or lesion patientive to other 
local treatment) is non -measurable unless it has progressed since completion of 
treatment.
3.Normal Sites:
Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non -target disease.  Cy stic lesions thought to 
represent cy stic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they  meet the specific 
definition above.  If non -cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target 
lesions.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 207Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <10 mm are considered normal and should not 
be recorded or followed either as measurable or non -measurable disease.
4. Recording Tumor Assessments:
All sites of disease must be assessed at baseline.  Baseline assessments should be done as 
close as possible prior to study  start.  For an adequate baseline assessment, all required scans 
must be done within [ADDRESS_152975] be documented 
appropri ately.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generall y should be 
indeterminate. 
Note: For the patient population being evaluated in this protocol, the baseline assessment 
may be completed within 6 weeks prior to randomization. 
5.Target Lesions:
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability  for 
accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the 
case of pathological l ymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of 
the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study . 
If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the p arts is used.
Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesion becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_152976] disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm sho uld be 
recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement should 
still be recorded.
6. Non- target D isease:
All non-measurable disease is non- target.  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non- target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather 
assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMI NATE, PRESENT/NOT 
INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non- target lesions in one organ may  be recorded as a 
single item on the case report form ( eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic l ymph nodes’ or ‘multiple 
liver metastases’).

Page 208B.Objective Response Status at Each Evaluation :
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  If a change needs to be made the case 
must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate. 
1.Target Disease:
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of a ll target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
<10mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target 
lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
Stable: Does not qualify  for CR, PR or Progre ssion.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only  in the rare case that the sum increases by  [CONTACT_4736] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously  documented 30% decrease no 
longer holds. 
Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therap y), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. 
Indeterminate.   Progressio n has not been documented, and one or more target 
measurable lesions have not been assessed; or assessment methods used were 
inconsistent with those used at baseline; or one or more target lesions cannot be 
measured accuratel y (eg, poorly visible unless due to being too small to measure );or 
one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or 
increased. 
2.Non-target Disease:
CR: Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels.  All ly mph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm s hort axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of an y non -target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits. 
PD: Unequivocal progression of pre- existing lesions.  Generally  the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently  to merit discontinuatio n of therap y.  In the presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non -target 
disease should be rare.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 209Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or more non -target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at 
baseline.
3.New Lesions:
The appearance of an y new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify  the etiology .  
If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of 
the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be 
considered a new lesion.
4.Supplemental Investigations :
If CR determination depen ds on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completel y, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to 
necrosis, the lesion may  be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_134941]. 
5. Subjective P rogression :
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disea se 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health 
Status.  Every  effort should be made to document objective progression even a fter 
discontinuation of treatment.

v1.1 (irRECIST)
Increasing clinical experience indicates that traditional response criteria may not be sufficient 
to fully  characterize activity  in this new era of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or biologics. 
This is particularly  true for immunotherapeutic agents such as anti- CTLA -4, anti -PD-1and 
anti PD -L1which exert the antitumor activity  by [CONTACT_135003] 
T-cells, thus leading to tumor infiltration by  T-cells and tumor regression rather than direct 
cytotoxic effects.86,91Clinical observations of patients with advanced melanoma treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], for example, suggested that conventional response assessment criteria such as 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST) and WHO criteria are not sufficient 
to fully  characterize patte rns of tumor response to immunotherapy  because tumors treated 
with immunotherapeutic agents may  show additional response patterns that are not described 
in these conventional criteria .87,92
Furthermore, the conventional tumor assessment criteria (RECI ST and WHO criteria) have 
been reported as not capturing the existence of a subset of patients who have an OS similar to 
those who have experienced CR or PR but were flag ged as PD b y WHO criteria.
On these grounds, a tumor assessment s ystem has been developed that incorporates these 
delay ed or flare -type responses and designated Immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria 
In Solid Tumors (irRECIST ).[ADDRESS_152978]:
Requires confirmation of both progression and response by [CONTACT_135004] [ADDRESS_152979] documented; and,
Does not necessarily score the appearance of new lesions as progressive disease if the 
sum of lesion diameters of target lesions (minimum of 10 mm per lesion, maximum 
of 5target lesions, maximum of 2 per organ) and measurable new les ions does not 
increase b y 20%.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported target lesion(s) at baseline and throughout the trial.
irRECI ST responses are defined as follows:
Overall immun e-related complete response (irCR) : Complete disappearance of all 
lesions (whether measurable or not) and no new lesions. All measurable l ymph nodes 
also must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Overall immune -related partial response (irPR) : Sum of the longest diameters of 
target and new measurable lesions decreases 30%.

Page 212Overall immune -related stable disease (irSD) : Sum of the longest diameters of 
target and new measurable lesions neither irCR, irPR, (compared to baseline) or 
immune -related progressive disease (irPD, compared to nadir).
Overall immune -related progressive disease (irPD) : Sum of the longest diameters 
of target and new measurable lesions increases 20% (compared to nadir) with a 
minimum absolute increase of [ADDRESS_152980] documented.
New measurable lesions: I ncorporated into tumor burden.
In order to be selected as new measurable lesions ( 2lesions per organ, 5lesions total, per 
timepoint), new lesions must me et criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and 
meet the same minimum size requirements of [ADDRESS_152981] lesions shall be selected as new measured lesions.
All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non -measurable 
lesions and are followed qualitatively .
New non -measurable lesions: Do not define progression but preclude irCR.

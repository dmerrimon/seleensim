 Study Summary  
Title IMPROVING COORDINATI ON AND 
TRANSITIONS OF CARE FOR STROKE 
PATIENTS WITH AN ATT ENDING NURSE

IRB Number  .  
Protocol Number   
Phase  Phase III  
Methodology  Comparative Effectiveness  
Study Duration  7 months   
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Objectives   
Our central hypothesis is that the attending nurse will enhance critical 
patient -centered elements of care that will in turn improve patient 
education and shared decision -making, medication adherence, stroke -
related health literacy, and reduce early readmissions to ultimately yield 
improved patient quality of life. Our primary objective is to determine 
whether the attending nurse model of care improves str oke patients’ 
health  at [ADDRESS_662648]   
None  
This is a comparative effectiveness study comparing two models of 
nursing care delivery to stroke patients (attending nurse model vs. 
conventional inpatient  nursing care)   
Duration of 
administration (if 
applicable)  The dur ation of the intervention phase will depend on the duration of a 
patient ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] . 
Reference therapy  The reference therapy is standard inpatient nursing  care. 
Statistical 
Methodology  Our primar y outcome will be scores on scales  of medication adheren ce 
and stroke education retention. The scores on these tests will be 
compared between patients who were assigned  to the attending nurse 
model of care versus standard nursing care .  
 
Seco ndary ou tcomes will include  comparisons between groups of  the 
thirty day readmission  rate, scores on a patient -centered stroke impact 
scale , [ADDRESS_662649] a recurrent 
stroke in the [LOCATION_002] .2 Further, among 307,887 ischemic stroke patients in a Medicare database, 
14% we re readmitted to hospit als within [ADDRESS_662650] suboptimal personal health behaviors .5,6 Existing  care delivery models thus may  not 
optimally aligned with stroke patient s’ needs and goals.  
 
Poor adherence to prescribed medications following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512299], disability, other complications, and death.[ADDRESS_662651] observational study of 
medication compliance following stroke, the Adherence eValuation After Ischemic stroke –Longitudinal 
(AVAIL) registry, indep endent predictors of [ADDRESS_662652] also noted that inadequate care transitions and poor patient –provider communications contribute to 
medication non -adheren ce.[ADDRESS_662653] clearly 
been shown to eff ectively improve adherence to secondary stroke prevention strategies.10  
 
 
Attending Nurse  
 
The attending nurse model of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512300], 
shared decision -making, medication adherence,  and reduce early readmissions after discharge to 
ultimately yield improved patient quality of life. The care delivered and directed by [CONTACT_512317] a therapeutic relationship.11 On the inpatient stroke unit, t he 
attending nurse will take ownership of essential aspects of an individual stroke patient’s care, education, 
and transition out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. By [CONTACT_512318], advocate, and educator, t he 
attending nurse will be able to creat e a deep and meaningful therapeutic relationship with patients.  To 
further contribute to the patient’s plan of care, t he attending nurse will be present on daily teaching 
rounds . 
 
Allowing nurses to function as attending nurses is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_512301].[ADDRESS_662654] effective:  
the attending nurse model , as detailed a bove , or the standard care model . The tasks performed by [CONTACT_512319] n urse for each patient will be documented during the patients’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512302]. Patients who receive care from the attending nurse will be 
compared to those who are cared for by [CONTACT_512320].  
1.2.1  Clinical Data to Date :  
For [ADDRESS_662655] 2 years were estimated from the GWTG registry at our 
center. Our readmission rates (~10%) are lower than the national average (~15%) for stroke patients.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
 To determine whether patients report better understanding of stroke facts and medication 
adherence  when cared for by [CONTACT_512321]. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)  
 To determine whether a nurse attending model of care improves overall outcome following 
stroke or TIA  
 To determine whether newly devised questions focused on the inpatient experience as well 
as patient satisfaction can detect valid differences between tre atment groups .  
 To assess whether an attending nurse improves patient  perception of deficits  and quality of 
life compared to routine nursing care. 
 To assess whether an attending nurse reduces pati ent readmission rates compared to 
standard nursing care. 
 
 
[ADDRESS_662656] mo del of inpatient  nursing  care, stroke education is provided largely in the form of 
pamphlets distributed to patients and their families. Patients are cared for by a team of physicians and 
staff nurses with access to social worker s and case managers, howeve r, staff nurses do not routinely 
round on their patients with other members of the care team.   
 
Screening of patients  for this trial  will occur once the clinical decision to admit a patient to the Vascular 
Neurology  service has been made . All patients who meet inclus ion criteria will be assigned to a study 
arm, addition of an attending nurse versus  routine  nursing care, according to  the day of the week they  are 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients who are  admitted o n even  numbered week days will ha ve their care 
supplemented by [CONTACT_512322]. This is effectively a stratified random assignment, as there are no 
clinical or systematic features that otherwise are associated with odd or even numbered days.  The 
duration of the intervention will depen d on the duration of a patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] . 
 
To compare the  two models of nursing care, we will survey  all patients directly about the care they receive 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512303] . Surveys  tools  designed to ascertain medication adherence, 
disease specific knowledge , as well as  satisfaction with care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512304] 7, 30, and 90 days via follow -up structured telephone interviews . We will consider the 7 day follow -up 
phone call the baseline assessment . The Morizky scale  (MMAS -4),15 a well validat ed tool that has been 
studied in stroke victims ,16 will be used to determine medication adherence . The Stroke Patient Education 
Retention (SPER )[ADDRESS_662657] Scale ( SIS)18 will be 
used to evaluate self -perception of stroke deficits  by [CONTACT_1962] . Thirteen  other survey questions designed 
specifically for this study will also be posed to patients at 7, 30 and 90 days from follow up  along with two 
overall quality of life questions at 7 and 90 days . As a secondary outcome, w e will calculate and then use  
a global statistic as a general marker for success to compare the effectiveness of each nursing care 
model  in improving patient s’ overall outcomes .[ADDRESS_662658] care which includes educational interventions 
from staff nurses in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_512305]/ASA guidelines  Patients  assigned to 
routine care will not interact with the attending nurse. Patients  who are assigned  to the intervention will 
receive additional patient -centered supplementary care and education from the attending nurse.  
 
3.1.2   Follow Up Phase  
Patients  will be followed for a total of 90 days following discharge  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Patients  will be 
contact[CONTACT_6811] 7 , 30, and 90 days following discharge  via telephone  call. When patients  are unable to 
communicate their own views due to aphasia or other disability, caregivers will be asked to answer the 
applicable survey questions.  
3.1.3  Allocation to Interventional Group  
Stroke patients who are admitted on even -numbered weekd ays and enrolled in this trial will be assigned 
to care with an attending nurse; patients  admitted on odd -numbered weekdays w ill get usual routine care. 
The attending nurse will query the electronic medical record as well as communicate with the physician 
team so that all incoming admissions on even -numbered days  to the Vascular Neurology  service  are 
known to the attending nurse.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_662659] of the nurse atten ding. The mean scores on these two tests will be compared 
between groups at each time interval that they are administered.  
3.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
- We will compare the results of the newly designed survey questionnaire to capture patient 
impression  of their in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], transition home, and quality of life .  
- The results of the SIS will be captured at 30 days and compared between groups.  
- The proportion o f patients with readmissions within 30 days will be compared  between g roups  at 
30 days.  
- A global statistic  that incorporates all survey measures to determine whether the attending nurse 
model of care is consistent ly and persuasively more effective than routine nursing care  will be 
compared between groups.  
 
3.2.3  Primary Safety Endpoint s [if applicable]  
As this is a comparative  effectiveness  study of two models of nursing care that are currently both in use 
so there are no safety endpoints.  Safety  data will be collected during patients in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512306].   
4 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
 > 18 years of age  
 Admission to the  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512307]  
 Incident or recurrent:  
o Ischemic stroke : focal neurological deficit of likely ischemic vascular origin  
o Intracerebral hemorrhage : blood  seen  on initial head CT  
11 
 o Transient Ischemic attack: focal neurological deficit of likely isch emic vascular origin 
that has  clinically  resolved  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Pregnancy  
 Comfort or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473678] 
 Severe dementia prior to stroke  
 Non-communicative and have no family/social support   
4.[ADDRESS_662660] , the study intervention phase  will vary as this phase will depend  on the durat ion of each 
individual inpatient adm ission. The follow up time period will extend to 90 days a fter discharge for all 
patients.    
4.5 Total Number of Patients  and Sites  
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512308]. We plan to enroll 180 
patients  in each arm of the trial. At this site, there are approximately 700 -800 stroke patients admitted per 
year, so we anticipate recruitment will require approximately 7 months.  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
 Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not i ncluded in this research study.  
5 Study Intervention (Study drug, device, biologic, vaccine, food etc.)  
There is no  investigational product for this trial as it is a comparative effectiveness study designed to 
determine whether an attendin g nurse or standard nursing care improves outcomes for  stoke patients. .  
5.[ADDRESS_662661] will then become a part of the patient’s medical record . 
 
The Attending Nurse will have, in addition to a BSN and RN, at least [ADDRESS_662662] trainin g specific to the role of attending n urse through mentorship by [CONTACT_512323] .  
   
5.2 Intervention Regimen  
The attending nurse  will spend 30 minutes to 45 minutes upon initial eval uation t o determine the patient s’ 
goals , barriers,  and needs. The amount of time spent with each subject following the initial visit will vary 
based on the patient . To limit the demands on the attending nurse, she will never carry a case load of 
more than [ADDRESS_662663] will be assigned to the routine care arm of the trial. Patients  who are assigned 
to the attending nurse model of care will be seen by [CONTACT_512324] a daily (weekday) basis in addition to 
being cared for by [CONTACT_512325].  All staff nurses as well 
12 
 as the attending nurse will participate in morning interdisciplinary table rounds in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_512309].  
 
5.3 Blinding  
The 7, 30, and 90 phone surveys will be blinded to patients ’ group assignment. Staff nurses will not be 
blinded as to which patient the attending nurse is caring for. T he PIs will not be blinded to subject 
treatment assignment as they will need to assure subject assignment is preformed correctly.  Patients  will 
not be formally blinded to their arm assignment, though patients  may not realize that alternative model s of 
care exist  on the Vascular Neurology  service.  Waiving consent upon admission will help maintain 
patient s’ blinding. During  the first  follow up phone call , as part of the consenting proc ess, we will specify 
that we are comparing different nursing styles of care.  The interviewer preforming follow up phone calls 
and collecting  data from the patient electronic medical record  will be blinded to study group assignment.  
5.[ADDRESS_662664] ered by [CONTACT_512326] . 
Responses will be inputted by a study coordinator into a secure electronic database . All data will be 
monitored periodically to assure accuracy.  
 
Patients  will be assigned case numb ers at the time of enrollment . The key explaining the linkage between 
patients ’ PHI and case number will be kept in another password protected computer so that  each 
patients ’ PHI is well protected . Surveys responders will be identified via a case assignment number. 
Subject responses will be recorded on a standard form that will be kept on a password protected 
computer during the study period. Any clinical data that is abstract from the electronic medical record  for 
each patient will also be recorded in a standard form which identifies patients  only by [CONTACT_512327].  
5.[ADDRESS_662665] will also be obtained.

6.2 Study Intervention Phase  
If patients satisfy inclusion criteria and lack exclusion criteria they will be assigned  to the intervention arm 
or the control arm depending on their admission date. The intervention phase will be the duration of the 
patient ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] .  
 
No research related procedures that differ from standard of care will be conducted as this is a 
comparative effectiveness trial.

following stroke . The newly devised Likert -style questions as well as the [ADDRESS_662668] medical advice ( AMA ), this will be documented  in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_512310]. Follow up phone calls will still be sought on patients who leave AMA. Patients who  
are lost to follow up or decline  to participate in follow up phone calls  and do not consent to data 
abstraction from the inpatient record  will not have any further data collected.  
 
Patients who request to be removed from the study will have all available data expunged.  
15 
 6.6 Early Term ination Visits   
We will not perform  early termination visits or early phone calls .  
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this stud y will be a comparison of the mean scores on the SPER and the rate of 
adherence on the MM AS-4 (score < 2) and the SPER between groups  at 7 and again at 90 days.  
 
Scores on the MMAS -4 and SPER will be calculated per protocol. On the MMAS -4, affirmative answers 
will receive a point and negative answers will be assigned zero. The total score will be the sum of the 
answer to all four questions. The SPER, question 1 and 2 are scored as follows: 0  = no correct content in 
response to the question, 1= the patient provided some but not all of the correct content in r esponse to 
the question, and 2 = patient provided  all key content in response to th e question. Question 3 -5 were 
scored as follows as 0 =  no correct content in response to the question and 2  = the patient provided the 
correct response to the questions. A score of [ADDRESS_662669] responses to the  key content.  
 
The SIS is a patient -based, self -report scale in which each item is rated in a 5 - point Likert scale in terms 
of the difficulty the patient has experienced in completing each item. A score of 1 = an inability to 
complete the item and a score  of 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. Using an algorithm, summative 
scores are generated for each domain.  
 
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for this stud y are the  SIS at 30 days, newly devised patient centered outcome 
survey scales at 7 and  90 days, as well as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512311] 30 days in each group.  
 
The SIS is a patient -based, self -report scale in which each item is rated in a 5 - point Likert scale in terms 
of the difficulty the patient has experienced in completing each item. A sco re of 1 = an inability to 
complete the item and a score of 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. Using an algorithm, summative 
scores are generated for each domain. The SIS is scored in the following way, for each domain: 
Transformed Scale = [(Actual raw s core - lowest possible raw score) / Possible raw score range] x 100.  
 
The newly devised  13 Likert -questions are all scaled 1 to 5 with 1=strongly disagree and 5 = strongly 
agree . We have also included two modified  global  quality of health  questions based on  the EuroQol 
instrument where scales range from [ADDRESS_662670], we anticipate that 65% of patients  in the control arm will be adherent to medications 
(MMAS -4 < 2) based on literature reporting 60%16 adherence as evaluated using these scales in stroke 
patients and 70%[ADDRESS_662671] improve to by 15% in order to make this intervention worthy of f uture 
investigation in a larger study. Assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%, with a 1:[ADDRESS_662672] a very small difference of 0.3 (delta = .15 (SD=2)) in the mean scores 
of the SPER based on the published data.[ADDRESS_662673] descriptive statistics (including 
mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for 
categorical variabl es such as gender).  Stroke severity and PMH will also be collected and compared 
between the groups.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_662674] Population(s) for Analysis  
The entire subject population who undergo treatment assignment will be studied primarily via intention to 
treat analysis comparing data from follow up phone calls between groups. An as -treated analysis will also 
be performed .  
 
Analysis will be p erformed on some pre-defined subgroups  where we may expect to see effect 
modification: m ajor stroke  vs. minor strokes  (NIHSS ≤ 5), multiple medications vs. few medications, 
patients who were admitted fol lowing a recurrent stroke v s. a new stroke , and hemorrhagic stroke vs. 
ischemic stroke  subtypes .   
 
[ADDRESS_662675] i nclude falls, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_315340], and subsequent (post -discharge) major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) 
including stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unknown), myocardial infarction, and death of any 
cause.  Transfers to a higher level of care (e.g. to the Neuro ICU or medical ICU from the floor) that occur 
as part of routine care will also be considered events of interest. We will also report any unanticipated 
events.    
 
[ADDRESS_662676] clinical care. During follow up phone calls, the interviewee will ask patients 
and/or their family members specifically a bout the occurrence of MACCEs including and death of any 
caus e.  
 
 The safety of each mode of nursing care while the subject is in -house will be tracked using the quality 
control processes that are already in place as part of standard inpatient care.

9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Data  will be abstracted regarding d emographics,  medical/surgical history, stroke location, and dates of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] . The results of follow -up pho ne calls will be recorded by [CONTACT_512328]. The database will be kept in RedCap prior to data cleaning. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_512312].  
 
Data will be managed and stored using REDCap, the software toolset and workflow methodology for 
electronic collection and management of research data,  developed  specifically around HIPAA -Security 
guidelines. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application that is 
flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research. REDCap provides an intuitive user interface 
that streamlines project development and i mproves data entry through real -time validation rules (with 
automated data type and range checks). REDCap also provides easy data manipulation (with audit trails 
for reporting, monitoring and querying patient records) and an automated export mechanism to c ommon 
statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus). In addition to traditional data capture functionality, 
REDCap’s survey capabilities are a powerful tool for building and managing online surveys. The research 
team can create and design surveys in a web browser and engage potential respondents using a variety 
of notification methods. All data collection projects rely on a thorough, study -specific data dictionary, 
defined by [CONTACT_266605], self -documenting process. Th is iterative 
development and testing process results in a well -planned and individualized data collection strategy.  
The REDCap MySQL database is replicated in real time to a completely redundant instance of 
MySQL.   The redundant instance is available for r estoration of the primary database or for manual 
failover in the cas e of primary database failure.  Time -stamped backup files are made from the replicated 
database daily by [CONTACT_512329].      
  
Data and bac kups are stored in the HUP Research Information Systems Storage Area Network 
(SAN).   Access to the SAN directories where data are stored will be limited to Research Information 
Systems personnel, with authentication performed using HUP’s enterprise Active Directory service. De-
identified d ata will be analyzed using STATA  or SPSS .  
 
The data that is collected will have a unique code assigned by [CONTACT_512330] i s not collected and PHI is protected. 
This unique case number will not be possible to link to any other information pertaining to each subject. 
By [CONTACT_96399], the patients ’ privacy will be protected. Patients ’ names and medical record numbers will be 
coded  and kept separately from the database in a password protect ed file.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_512313].

10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the sponsor, 
government regulatory  bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of appl icable study -related facilities .  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].

This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal 
approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  
 
11.1 Risks  
The major risk of this study is a breach in PHI. Data will be protected as detailed above to avoid the 
damaging effects of a PHI breech. If patients or their family find follow up interview questionnaires  too 
burdensome  or psychologically straining during phone interviews , they can simply stop a nswering them.

 11.2 Benefits  
The potential benefit  of this comparative effectiveness study is improved inpatient care  for stroke 
patients —an area that is not well understood . Regardless of whether or not the individual patients ’ 
benefits f rom care, gaining knowledge about the best modality of inpatient nursing care for stroke patients 
will help society as a whole in the future.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_662679] model of inpatient  nursing  care as well as the nurse attending model of care are 
currently used in clinical practice; we are merely comparing the effectiveness of one to the other. The 
risks of breach of PHI will be guarded against by [CONTACT_512331] -identified data, a secure data collection and 
storage plan, as well as good clinical practices. The risk of emotional stres s associated with survey 
questions is also minimal as patients can simply refuse or stop answering these questions.  
 
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
A waiver of consent will be obtained for the initial intervention  as detailed below. We will obtain  informed 
consent using a verbal process, detailed below,  for data abstraction from the medi cal record as well as 
follow up phone questionnaires at the [ADDRESS_662680] privacy will be assured as all data will be stored securely  and interviews 
will be conducted in private space .  
 
Patients  will be permitted to provide consent at the time of th e consent discussion over the phone (e .g. 
verbal consent) given the low risks associ ated with this study. Patients  can ask the interviewer  to call 
back at a later time to avoid an y coercion associated with time pressures. The subject will be informed 
that  they can withdraw their consent at any point. Investigators will confirm that the patient  understands  
the study by [CONTACT_512332][INVESTIGATOR_512314] . 
 
Documentati on of informed consent  (e.g. date and time, who obtained consent, who gave consent and 
subject ID number)  will be made by [CONTACT_512333]. If 
the subject is unable to provide consent, their legally authoriz ed representative may.  
 
11.4.1  Alterations to Typi[INVESTIGATOR_48476] (only include if applicable)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Waiver of Consent (In some cases for screening/portions of that study that qualify as 
minimal risk, a waiver of documentation of consent may be permissible  per IRB SOP s) 
The research involves no more than minimal risk to the patients  as this is a comparative effectiveness trial 
of two modalities of inpatient care that are already  in use at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]. 
Medical care itself will b e no different between the two study groups . A major goal of this study is 
assessment of each individual patient’s (and family’s) perception of their care and their clinical outcomes. 
If patients  or their family members  know that they did or did not receiv e an attending nurse  model of care , 
knowledge of that fact alone may bias their expectations and their satisfaction with their care. Blinded 
allocation is  essential for unbiased assessment. T he risk of patients  not initially consenting or knowing 
that we are comparing the effects of two nursing modalities is minimal. It would be impractical to carry out 
this research without an initial waiver of consent.  
 
After discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], all subjects will receive a [ADDRESS_662681] protected through REDCap and and 
destroyed when the study is completed.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent  
 
There are  no scheduled in-person follow up  visits for our subjects, therefore  obtaining a signed consent 
form would be impractical.  We will obtain verbal consent as discussed above according to a prespecified 
script.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Waiver of HIPAA Authorization  
 
We will ask for a HIPAA waiver for the screening stage of this study, but obtain verbal consent as 
discussed above to administer questionnaires as well as to collect data from the medical record.

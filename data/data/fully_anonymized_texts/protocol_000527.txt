in lower quality and safety of patient care (Keykaleh 2018). It is incumbent upon healthcare organizations 
to mitigate burnout by [CONTACT_112381]. While there are many approaches to 
activating employee engagement, this program specifically utilizes techniques of engaged observation 
through visual arts instructional techniques to help nurses hone their skills of perception and to reconnect 
to their practice. The World Health Organization defines stress to be the “ body's response to anything that 
requires attention or action” (WHO 2022) and clinical workplaces are stressful environments of interruption, 
urgency and shifting attention.  More than ever, nurses need proficiency using in techniques, skills and

results will be analyzed and reported in aggregate and once the data is collected emails will be destroyed 
by [CONTACT_978]. Study team members are not direct supervisors of any potential participants. One of the art 
immersion program workshops will be held at the MET, the other session will be held virtually over 
WebEx. Research will be conducted outside of work hours where possible and appropriate to minimize 
the risk of breach of confidentiality. No data will be collected at The MET or any virtual session.  All 
research data will be collected via REDCap survey that will be sent as a link in an email or text message 
depending on the participants preference. The goal of this nursing study is to study the impact of an art 
immersion program on nurses and therefore the subjects must be nurses.   
 
Participation is voluntary. Decision whether or not to take part in this study will have no impact on the 
participants’ employment status, salary, or perfornance evaluation at NYU Langone Health.  
4.4 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Passive recruitment strategies will be used to minimize any coercion/undue influence. Recruitment will be 
conducted so to ensure employees initiate contact [CONTACT_7056]’s investigators and to self-identify as an 
interested participant in a way that maintains their confidentiality, rather than methods by [CONTACT_112385]. 
All subjects will be recruited through a recruitment email to specific nursing lists that Kathleen Zavotsky is 
the administrator over (# PhD-EdD Nursing Council <#[EMAIL_2217]>, 
#EdD/PhD council # DNP Council <#[EMAIL_2218]> and campus specific Research 
Councils# Research Council <#[EMAIL_2219]> ) and study flyers will be available 
in person at staff meetings and other professional nursing forums that include Annual Nursing Science 
Day, Nurse Week Events Competency Training sessions). Recruitment email will be sent up to [ADDRESS_125126] will be involved in 
recruitment to minimize coercion. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_112372].

6.1 Procedures/Evaluations 
After consent has been obtained, the following will take place: 
 Participants will be asked to provide their email or cell phone of choice so we may communicate 
study information, reminders, and surveys via email or text message.  
 
 Participants will then be asked to complete a demographic survey, the Interpersonal Reactivity 
Index (IRI) and the Cultural Assessment Survey (CAS).  
o The demographic survey contains questions about age, race/ethnicity, gender, years of 
nursing experience, NYULH campus, specialty, shift time, and role (clinical or nurse 
leader).  
o CAS measures cultural awareness, sensitivity, knowledge and skills.  
o IRI measures four separate aspects of empathy and its relationships with measures of 
social functioning, self-esteem, emotionality, and sensitivity to others.  
 
 Following completion of the surveys, participants will be asked to sign up for [ADDRESS_125128] 
class will be an in-person class at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) located on 5thAve and 
86th[LOCATION_001], NY. The second class will be virtual via WebEx. Each class will last 60 minutes.  
 
 There will also be an optional independent self-directed reflective exercise with art materials and 
prompts provided by [CONTACT_112387].  
 
 At 7 months (after second class), participants will be asked to complete the IRI and the CAS 
surveys again. Participants will also be asked to complete a short qualitative survey about the 
overall impact of the art immersion program on your work and life.  
 
Museum educators from The MET will be providing the curriculum that will include an art immersion 
program that will select specific works/art in the museum as well as virtually that will help to stimulate self-
reflection and prompt connection to their nursing practice. MET staff will be conducting workshops as part 
of their paid job and will not be engaged in human subjects research as researchers.  
 
7 Adverse Events 
7.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related documents such 
as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])

psychological, economic, or social harm). 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.   
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112373]-serious 
adverse events .  
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.   
7.[ADDRESS_125129] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to study participation should be recorded and 
reported immediately. 
7.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems
For Narrative Reports of Safety Events 
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of 
the initial report includes: 
 Study identifier 
 Study Center 
 Subject number 
 A description of the event 
 Date of onset  Current status 
 Whether study treatment was discontinued 
 The reason why the event is classified as

Researchers are required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than 5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event: 
 Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related 
– Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.  
– Related to the research procedures : An event is related to the research procedures if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be 
caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
– Harmful: either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk 
Other Reportable events:
The following events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, though no later than 5 working days : 
 Complaint of a research subject  when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].
 Protocol deviations or violations (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations 
from the IRB approved protocol) for any of the following situations:  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again 
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm 
 Breach of confidentiality 
 Incarceration of a participant  when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study. 
 New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. (e.g. analysis indicates lower-than-expected response rate or a 
more severe or frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; 
FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market) 
Reporting Process 
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using a Reportable New Information 
submission and will include a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the 
above criteria, follow-up/resolution, and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_65036]’s study file.

9.1 Study Hypotheses
Primary:  Visual arts training by [CONTACT_112389]. 
Secondary: Nurses believe training in the visual arts impacts their clinical practice and whether it can be 
widely applied to pedagogical nursing practice in an academic health system. 
9.2 Sample Size Determination
The target sample size is 60 NYULH nurses. Sample size calculations were performed in G*Power with 
the following parameters 
 Test statistic: Dependent samples t-test 
 Effect size estimation=0.4 
 Type I error probability=0.90 
 Type II error probability=0.05 
9.3 Statistical Methods 
Demographics will be reported with descriptive statistics including means and frequency counts. 
The main objective, to determine whether visual arts training by [CONTACT_112390]’ skill 
in cultural competency and personal reflection, will be assessed with a dependent samples t-test. We will 
compare CAS and IRI at baseline and post-program to find if there is a significant difference in mean 
scores. 
 
The secondary objective, to understand nurse beliefs about the pedagogical value of visual arts education 
to nursing practice, will be explored via qualitative survey (attached as separate document) and 
thematically analyzed.  
 
10 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents 
REDcap will be the primary data collection instrument for the study.

and approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent 
form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented 
participants need to be re-consented. 
MET staff will be conducting workshops as part of their paid job and will not be engaged in human 
subjects’ research as researchers. 
11.3 Informed Consent Process
11.3.1 Consent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants
Participants will be given information describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and 
risks prior to starting the intervention. The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol: 
Key Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form. 
11.3.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation 
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. The informed consent process will begin with 
a concise and focused presentation of the key information using an IRB-approved Key Information Sheet . 
Extensive description of risks and possible benefits of participation will be provided to potential participants. 
If the potential participant is still interested in participating after reading the key information form, they will 
continue to the consent form and select “yes” or “no” to participating in the study. Should potential 
participants have any questions or concerns about the study before consenting, they may contact [CONTACT_978], 
Lita Anglin, or Sub-I, Kathleen Zavotsky by [CONTACT_648]. Phone numbers and emails for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_34511]-I will be 
provided on the REDCap e-consent form. Their participation is voluntary and confidential and neither the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_112376]-I are in supervisory roles for any potential participants and are not responsible for terms of 
employment. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_112391], salary, or performance evaluation will not be adversely affected if they decline to 
participate in this study.  
 
Following a selection of “yes” on the consent, participants will continue to the surveys. A waiver of 
documentation of consent will be applied for as this study is minimal risk and research procedures do not 
involve procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of research.  In addition, this 
waiver would further minimize the risk of a breach of confidentiality for employees. The updated electronic 
consent form in REDCap will be submitted to the IRB for review in Research Navigator via Modification 
before use in the study. Language consistency with the IRB-approved consent materials will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_112392]. 
 
 
11.4 Participant and Data Confidentiality 
Participant emails will be the only identifiers attached to the data. Data will be stored in REDCap, only 
accessible to IRB-approved research staff members. Participant emails will be deleted upon completion 
of the study. Participant data will be kept confidential and not be accessible to anyone outside of the 
study team. No one on the study team is a supervisor of any participants.

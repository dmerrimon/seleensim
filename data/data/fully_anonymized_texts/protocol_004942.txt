complications such as sclero -conjunctival scarring , hypotony, hypotony maculopathy , 
choroidal detachment, conjunctival leak, hyphema, and bleb related complications .8  
Surgical techniques that re -establish the aqueous outflow through the physiological 
pathways without the need for a bleb are gaining acceptance among glaucoma surgeons.
9 Canaloplasty is one such procedure that is intended to restore the natural 
aqueous outflow system through microcatheterization and viscodilation of the entire length of the Schlemm's canal with  a well- documented safety and efficacy profile in 
reducing IOP.
10,11 Trabeculotomy is another such procedure that  relieves the resistance 
to aqueous flow by [CONTACT_833139]’s canal.

4.1 INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The OMNI Surgical System has been 510k cleared by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA) for the following indication for use25: 
The OMNI® Surgical System is indicated for canaloplasty (microcatheterization 
and transluminal viscod ilation of Schlemm's canal) followed by [CONTACT_554345] 
(cutting oftrabecular meshwork) to reduce intraocular pressure in adult patients with primary open -angle glaucoma.  . 
4.2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The OMNITM Surgical System (“OMNI”) is a sterile, single use, manu ally operated 
instrument used by [CONTACT_833140], controlled amounts of viscoelastic 
into the anterior segment of the eye during ophthalmic surgery. It is also indicated to cut trabecular meshwork tissue during trabeculotomy procedures.  
The OMNI is designed to function with commonly used viscoelastic fluids made commercially available by [CONTACT_833141] (AMO), Bausch & Lomb, and Alcon. The OMNI dispenses fluid on the principle of exchanging volumes much like a syringe. The handheld instrument includes a cannula, microcatheter, internal reservoir and plunger tube, and finger wheels. The finger wheels on the handle of the device are used to advance and retract the microcatheter.  In addition, when the device is being used to deliver viscoelastic, retraction of the microcatheter causes the

The microcatheter can be advanced/retracted up to 20 mm per cycle.  The microcath eter can be fully advanced/retracted up to 5 times (i.e. 5 full cycles of 20 mm 
each).  Dispensation of viscoelastic can only occur during the first two 20 -mm cycles.  
The wheels are located on both sides of the handle.  This allows the OMNI device to be used in either eye (OD or OS) and in either hand of the surgeon (left or right), by [CONTACT_833143] 180 degrees along its vertical axis.

A total of 145  subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Assuming a 40 % screen failure rate, 
approximately  [ADDRESS_1156867] will be given a 
choice to voluntarily confirm his or her participation in the study as documented by [CONTACT_269018].  After signing the Informed Consent and the HIP AA 
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) authorization, the subject can then proceed with the screening  visit.  The subject has the right to withdraw from the study 
at any time without consequences, as indicated in the Informed Consent Document.  
 The subject’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any procedure specifically for the study.  Subjects are enrolled upon signing the ICD even if they subsequently fail to meet the eligibility criteria.    
 The principa l investigator(s) must retain the original, signed written Informed Consent 
Document.  A copy of the written Informed Consent Document must be given to the subject.

Sight Sciences   Page 19 of 61 Once the study eye is identified, subjects will undergo the washout procedure described 
in Section 9.5 before  the Baseline  visit.   
 
Note: If a subject does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, he/she may be re -
screened after [ADDRESS_1156869] identification on second screening.  
 
Exam data collected on subjects prior to enrollment as part of the routine clinical 
practice may serve as Screening  data as long as it was collected within 15 days prior to 
the visit.  The only exception s to this are : 
 
• IOP and IOP -lowering medications.  These data must be collected at the 
Screening  visit.  
• Visual field:  Visual Fields conducted per the protocol method (Humphrey [ADDRESS_1156870]) within 90 days of the B aseline visit may serve as the Baseline 
exam.  
9.5 WASHOUT OF HYPOTENSIVE MEDICATIONS  
Subjects who meet all screening eligibility criteria will b e instructed to discontinue their 
ocular hypotensive medication regimen in the study eye only, and to return for a Baseline visit after completing the appropriate washout period. Glaucoma medication 
discontinuation can be staged (for patients on multiple medications) so that the 
pressure increase duration is minimized to the greatest possible extent during the 
washout period. For example, if a patient is on a prostaglandin  (PGA) and a Carbonic 
Anhydrase Inhibitor ( CAI), the PGA could be discontinued [ADDRESS_1156871] fails to remember to not use ocular hypotensive medication for the 
study eye per the required washout period, they can be reinstructed to washout and return for the Baseline or 12 -month washout IOP visit as long as it falls within the 
specified visit window.  
 The minimum wash -out periods are specified in Table 2 below. Note: The maximum 
washout period is [ADDRESS_1156872] should be restarted on

related to cataract extraction or IOL implantation should be exited from the study.  The 
region where the trabeculotomy procedure is performed (e.g. superior hemisphere) 
shall be recorded on the case report forms.  
Surgeons should follow their standard peri- operative medication regimen.  All the 
medications should be administered in the form of ocular drops. Any other means of 
medication administration such as intracameral or intravitreal routes should be avoided.  
9.8 FOLLOW -UP VISITS 
Follow -up visits should be performed according to the schedule provided in Table 1 
(page 17).  All attempts should be made to conduct each follow- up visit within the time 
interval s pecified in  Table 1.  Evaluations conducted outside the prescribed time period 
will be considered protocol deviations.   
9.9 MANAGEMENT OF IOP  AFTER SURGERY  
This protocol recommends that no IOP -lowering medications should be administered to 
subjects after the surgery (0 meds on postop day 1) unless medically warranted. 
Investigators should use their clinical judgement in determining when and why IOP-
lowering medications should be reintroduced and if a subject requires surgical re -
intervention to manage IOP.  
 
Re-introduction of hypotensive medications should follow the guidelines below:  
 • The same medication class(es) as used preoperatively should be re -introdu ced. 
Dependent on preoperative IOP medication use, the reintroduction/addition of IOP medications postoperatively should follow the order below:  
 
1. Prostaglandin Analogues  
2. Alpha Agonists  
3. Beta Blockers  
4. Rho Kinase Inhibitor  
5. Carbonic Anhydrase In hibitors (CAIs)  
 • No more than one ocular hypotensive agent should be added at a single visit or within a 2 -week period.   
 
 
32 180°  trabeculotomy should be attempted in every eye enrolled in the study. There is a possibility that 
180°  trabeculotomy may not be possible in each case.

Sight Sciences   Page 22 of 61 In the event of a steroid response (IOP increase), the usual guidelines requiring a 
reproducible increase in IOP should be followed; however, topi[INVESTIGATOR_833133].  
 If a pressure rise is observed, a paracentesis may be performed as necessary. If a paracentesis is performed and there is no protocol -defined adverse event, the 
paracentesis will be documented in the subject’s medical record, the applicable visit CRF and the Ocular Procedures log. If, however, the paracentesis is performed in 
conjunction with an AE, then the AE is recorded as such, and the paracentesis is also 
recorded on the AE CRF as a treatment for the protocol -defined AE (as well as the other 
CRFs mentioned above).  
 Medications which have been re -started by [CONTACT_833145]’s judgment is that the target intraocular pressure has been reached and the continued use of some or all of the therapy may not be required. Discontinuation of medications after re -introduction is recommended to be in the reverse order of re -
introduction.  The rationale for d iscontinuation will also be documented on the follow-
up form by [CONTACT_093].   
 A record of all ocular hypotensive medications added, discontinued or changed will be documented on the appropriate Case Report Form for each scheduled visit or on a Case Report Form for an Unscheduled Visit, if necessary.  
 Another potential reason for intervention is hypotony.  Intervention should only be considered if the hypotony has caused or is likely to cause sequelae such as a flat chamber. No intervention is indicat ed when the vision is unchanged from screening, 
there is no persistent choroidal detachment, the anterior chamber is not flat with lens corneal touch, or the patient is asymptomatic.  No intervention should be undertaken for hypotony which is not causing, or threatening to cause, a reduction in vision.  
 
Secondary IOP -Lowering Interventions to Control IOP  
 If the subject requires another glaucoma procedure to control their IOP, the subject 
should continue to be followed according to standard of care until the adverse event resolves or [ADDRESS_1156875] be made to determine the reason(s) the subject discontinued the study.  The reason must be recorded in the subject’s file and on the Study Exit  Form.    
 If a subject withdraws from the study  post -baseline but prior to surgery, then that 
subject may be replaced in the study by a newly enrolled subject.

10 ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE S) 
Adverse Events are defined below.  Adverse events that occur in the eye during the trial, 
whether they are considered to be device related or not, must be documented in the 
subject’s records.  Date of the event, its severity, treatment (if any) and the ass essed 
relationship of the event to the study device will be recorded on the Adverse Event Form.  Conditions which exist at the time the subject is enrolled do not need to be recorded as adverse events unless they increase in severity during the study.

10.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
Identification, collection and reporting of adverse event information is the responsibility 
of the principal investigator.  The investigator records the date of the event, its severity,

Protocol [ZIP_CODE] Rev F 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Sight Sciences   Page 26 of 61 treatment (if any) and the assessed relationship of the event to the study device on the 
Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE CRF).   
Any o cular -related serious adverse event  (SAE) should be reported to the study sponsor 
within one working day of learning of the event.  Non -ocular -related SAEs should be 
reported to the study sponsor within two working days of learning of the event.  Email 
the AE CRF to OMNI [EMAIL_15840] .  
Any unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE)  must be reported  to the following 
two entities:  
1. The  study sponsor  – Within one working day of the investigator first learning of 
the event, e -mail  the AE CRF  to OMNI [EMAIL_15840] ; a nd  
2. The reviewing IRB – As soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_1156881] learns of the event, report per the IRB’s instructions .  
The sponsor will conduct an evaluation of unanticipated adverse device effects.  If the sponsor determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, parts of the investigation presenting risks will be terminated.  Termination will occur no later than [ADDRESS_1156882] primary effectiv eness endpoint is the reduction in the unmedicated diurnal IOP 
from baseline to 12 months postoperatively.  The study objective is to show that the mean unmedicated diurnal IOP reduction of the study treatment (i.e.  ab-interno 
transluminal viscoelastic delivery and trabeculotomy  performed with OMNI  system 
performed after uneventful  cataract extraction) is superior to that of the cataract 
extraction alone. Based on recent approved MIGS studies, the mean ± SD unmedicated diurnal IOP reduction at [ADDRESS_1156883] extraction alone is 6.7 mmHg ± 3.6 mmHg (N =118) for Glaukos P170043  and 6.3 mmHg ±  4.0 mmHg (N = 187) for Ivantis 
P160024.  Therefore, the mean ± SD unmedicated diurnal IOP reduction at [ADDRESS_1156884] extraction alone is estimated as 6.5 mmHg ± 3.8 mmHg.  
The corresponding statistical hypotheses are as follows:

Protocol [ZIP_CODE] Rev F 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Sight Sciences   Page 27 of 61 H0: µOMNI ≤ 6.5 mmHg and Ha: µ OMNI > 6.[ADDRESS_1156885] with a one -sided significance level of 0.025 (or two -sided 
0.05), a sample size of 116  eyes at 12 months provides a statistical power of 80% at a 
true µOMNI of 7.5 mmHg.  
Second  P rimary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The second primary effectiveness endpoint is the reduction in the number of IOP -
lowe ring medications from screening to 12 months (before medications washed out if 
applicable) postoperatively.  
The study objective is to show that the mean reduction in number  of IOP -lowering 
medications of the study treatment at [ADDRESS_1156886] 
extraction alone.  Based on P170043 and P160024, the mean ± SD of reduction in 
number of IOP -lowering medications at [ADDRESS_1156887] surgery  alone is 0.9 ± 
0.8 and 1.1 ± 1.1, respectively.  Therefore , the mean ± SD of reduction in the number of 
IOP-lowering medications at [ADDRESS_1156888] surgery alone is estimated as 
1.0 ± 1.0.  A non -inferiority margin of 0.[ADDRESS_1156889] 
alone (1.0) and the mean reduction in number of IOP -lowing medications for the study 
treatment (MOMNI), 1.0 - MOMNI, of < 0.[ADDRESS_1156890] alone in reducing the number of IOP -lowing medications.   
The corresponding statistical hypotheses are as follows:  
H0: M OMNI ≤ 0.75 and Ha: M OMNI > 0.75 (i.e. 1.0 - M OMNI < 0.25).  
Based on a one -sample t -test with a one -sided significance level of 0.025 (or two -sided 
0.05), a sample size of 101  eyes at 12 months provides a statistical power of 80% at a 
true M OMNI of 1.[ADDRESS_1156891] e size of 116 eyes at 12 months is needed.  Considering a drop -out rate of 
about 10%, approximately [ADDRESS_1156892] secondary effectiveness en dpoint is the 12 -month outcome of ≥  20% reduction 
in unmedicated diurnal IOP (med ication washed out if applicable) from baseline .  Based 
on P170043 and P160024, the percent of eyes achieving this outcome for the cataract 
surgery alone is 75.4% (89/118) and  70.1% (131/187).   Therefore, the percent of 
cataract -surgery -alone eyes achieving this secondary effectiveness outcome is 
estimated as 73%.  The corresponding statistical hypotheses are H0: P1 OMNI ≤ 0.73 and 
Ha: P1 OMNI > 0.[ADDRESS_1156893] secondary 
effectiveness endpoint.  
The second secondary effectiveness endpoint is the 12 -month outcome of unmedicated 
diurnal IOP (med ication washed out if applicable) of ≥ 6 mmHg and ≤  [ADDRESS_1156894] surgery alone is 63.6% (75/118) and 47.6% (89/187).   Therefore, the percent of cataract -
surgery -alone eyes achieving this secondary effectiveness outcome is estimated  as 55% 
(approximate average of 63.6% and 47.6%).  The corresponding statistical hypotheses 
are H0: P2
OMNI ≤ 0.55 and Ha: P2 OMNI > 0.55,  where P2 OMNI is the probability of eyes 
achieving the second secondary effectiveness endpoint.  
The formal conclusion of  the secondary effectiveness endpoints will not be determined 
if the primary effectiveness endpoints are not statistically significant.  Meanwhile, the 
conclusion of the second secondary effectiveness endpoint will not be determined if the first secondary effectiveness endpoint is not statistically significant (i.e ., using the step -
down approach for the secondary effectiveness endpoint).  Therefore the significance level is two -sided 0.05 or one -sided 0.025 for both of the secondary effectiveness 
endpoints.  
Based on the binomial distribution with a one -s
 ided significance level of 0.025 (or two -
sided 0.05), a sample size of [ADDRESS_1156895] 80% at a true P1 OMNI of 0.85, and a sample size of [ADDRESS_1156896] 80% at a true P2 OMNI of 0.70.  Therefore, at least [ADDRESS_1156897] 
surgery.  
With a sample size of 1 30 eyes, there is a probability of 95% to observe at least one 
incidence of a safety event with an event rate of about 2. 4%. 
In May of 2019, the study protocol was revised to require at least one ocular 
hypotensive medication at the screening for the study eyes.  Since the study has treated 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ADDRESS_1156898] ocular hypotensive medications at screening, the planned 
sample size of the study is increased to approximately 14 5 eyes.  
11.2 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis population inclu des all subjects  who are enrolled and 
treated, regardless of whether or not they have a protocol deviation.   Due to the 
eligibility revision in May of [ADDRESS_1156899] one ocular hypotensive medication, the modified ITT (mITT) population includes  all ITT except for the treated 
eyes that were not on any  ocular hypotensive medication at the screening visit.  The per -

 PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINT S 
The IOP reduction from baseline to 12 months postoperatively and the reduction in number of IOP -lowering medications from baseline to 12 months will be calculated for 
each eye and summarized descriptively.  The 95% confidence interval of the mean reduction  will be derived based on the t- distribution.  The one -sample t -test will be 
performed for testing the statistical hypotheses described in Section 11.1.1.   It shou ld be 
noted that, for eyes with secondary surgical interventions (SSI) to control IOP or with SSI that can affect the IOP before [ADDRESS_1156902] available observed data before the SSI 
will be used to impute the 12 -month data.   For the analyses based on  the mITT 
population, the following imputation for subjects with missing 12-month data but 
without SSI may be performed:  
• The within -eye worst IOP (collected after 3 months postoperatively or IOP at 
baseline for the subjects with no data after postoperative  3 months) for the 
missing [ADDRESS_1156903] number of IOP lowering medications  (collected 
after 3 months postoperatively or IOP -lowering medication data  at baseline for 
the subjects with no data after postoperative 3 months) for the missing 12 -
month number of IOP -lowering medications.  
• The worst IOP (collected after 3 months postoperatively or IOP at baseline for 
the subjects with no data after postoperative 3 months) during the study for the 
missing [ADDRESS_1156904] number of IOP -lowering medications (collected 
after 3 months postoperatively or IOP -lowering medication data  at baseline for 
the subjects with no data after postoperative 3 months) during the study for the 
missing 12 -month number of IOP -lowering medications.  
• The mean IOP during the study for the missing 12 -month IOP and mean number 
of IOP -lowering medications during the study for the missing 12 -month number 
of IOP -lowering medications.  
• The last -observed -carry -forward approach.  
 SECONDARY  EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINT  
The number and percent of eyes achieving the secondary effectiveness endpoint will be calculated.  The binomial distribution will be used to derive the exact 95% confidence 
interval of the percent and to perform the statistical hypotheses for the secondary  
effectiveness endpoint described in Section 11.1.2.  It should be noted that, for eyes with secondary surgical interventions (SSI) to control IOP or with SSI that  can affect the

medications imputation for missing data described in Section 11.4.1  will used to derive 
the corresponding response of the secondary effectiveness endpoint.  
 COVARIATE ANALY SIS 
The following variables will be examined for their prognostic value to the primary and 
secondary effectiveness endpoints using the PP population with the imputation used for 
the IOP -related SSIs:

• Gender (male and  female)  
• Race (White and non -White)  
• Ethnicity  
• Baseline IOP group (based on observed quartiles)  
• Screening Number of IOP -lowing medications (1, 2, 3 and 4) 
• Study site  
 
For the primary effectiveness endpoint s, one-way ANOVA with one of the factors listed 
above will be used to check the possible covariate effects.  For the secondary effectiveness endpoint, Fisher’s  test will be performed.  A p -value of 0.15 will be used 
for evaluating the possible covariate effects.  
 ADDITIONAL  EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES  
The analyses will be based on the PP population.  
 
• The IOP, change in IOP, percent change in IOP, number of IOP -lowing 
medications, and change in number of IOP -lowing medications will be 
summarized descriptively at each visit along with the 95% confidence i ntervals

e Initiation :  Sight Sciences  and/ or CRO personnel will meet with the 
investigator(s) and clinical study staff when the site is ready to begin enrolling 
subjects i n order to train them  in how to properly select subjects, perform the 
study procedure, and record study data.  This visit will include, but not be limited to a review of the following:  
o Detailed review of the protocol  
o Informed consent procedures  
o Instructions for  the surgical procedure  
o Records and reports  
• Interim Monitoring :  Sight Sciences or CRO personnel will visit the clinical site 
routinely during the study to review charts and to perform source document verification, to ensure proper adherence to the study protocol, and to review 
regulatory documents .  Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultation 
will occur as necessary during the course of the study to ensure the proper progress and documentation of the study findings.  
• S
tudy Closure :  At the conclusion of the trial there will be a study closure visit  
during which several actions, including but not limited to the following, will be  
performed:  
o A final inspection of the study binder

Sight Sciences   Page 45 of 61 20.2 SEVERITY OF GLAUCOMA  
Severity of glaucoma is graded as documented in subjects’ medical charts using the 
coding guidelines shown in  Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3:  AAO/AGS/ICD -[ADDRESS_1156920] be placed at a distance of 4.00 meters (13 feet and 1.5 inches, or 157.5 inches) from cornea to chart surface, when using a [ADDRESS_1156921] be 1.00 (39 and 3/8 inches). A measuring tape or meter stick should always be available to verify the chart distance, even if the examining chair is supposed to be immovable or if reference marks are placed on the floor or walls. (Custodial and other staff have been known to move room furnishings about and clean- off marks from the floor or wall while performing 
their duties, necessitating re -establishing the correct distances for the lane.)  
 The 1-meter distance is measured from the eye of the participant, seated comfortably in 
a chair with his/her back firmly placed against the chair, to the center of the 2nd or 4th 
letter of the 3rd line of the chart. The measuring device can be homemade (e.g.,  a dowel 
rod accurately cut to a length of 1.00 m) or 1 meter ruler may be purchased.  
 
Note:  If it is necessary to refract at the 1 -meter distance, remember to add +0.[ADDRESS_1156922] the +0.[ADDRESS_1156923] identification of each letter.  He/she is not to proceed to the next 
letter until he/she has given a definite response.  
 A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart.  When the subject says he/she c annot read a letter, the subject should be encouraged to guess.  If 
the subject identified two (2) letters (e.g., A or B), the subject should be asked to choose one letter and, if necessary, to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful read ings can be made despi[INVESTIGATOR_537985], the 
examiner should stop the testing for that eye.  However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last letter may be the only one read correctly.  The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted.   
 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ADDRESS_1156924] should be performed consistently (e.g., the same 
lighting conditi ons, viewing distance, etc.) at each visit.  
 
Recording and Scoring Best -Corrected Visual Acuity  
 
Using the Visual Acuity Worksheet, circle each letter the subject identifies correctly, write total correct for each row in the place provided, and compute the  total correct for 
all rows. Do not mark letters read incorrectly or not read at all.  Each letter read correctly is recorded as one.  Only move to the next line if [ADDRESS_1156925] of daily fluctuations in pressure . 
 
Guidelines for performing Go ldmann tonometry are as follows:  
 
1. The subject is told the purpose of the test and is reassured that the measurement is not painful. The subject is instructed to relax, maintain his or her position, and hold his or her eyes open widely.  
2. One drop of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413], such as 0.5% proparacaine or 0.4% benoxinate, is placed in each eye,  and the tip of a moistened fluorescein strip 
is touched to the tear layer on the inner surface of each lower lid.  Alternatively, one drop of a combined anesthetic -fluorescein strip is touched 
to the tear layer on the inner surface of each lower lid.  The  tonometer and 
prism are set in correct position on the slit lamp.  
3. The tension knob is set at [ADDRESS_1156926]'s chin is supported by [CONTACT_833154].  The forehead bar should be well 
above the subject's eyebrows so the frontalis muscle can be used to open the eyes widely.  The subject's collar and tie should be loosened if necessary.  The subject should breathe normally during the test to avoid Valsalva's maneuver.  
7. The palpebral fissure is a little wider if the subject looks up.  However, the 
gaze should be no more than 15 ° above the horizontal to prevent an 
elevation of intraocular pressure that is especially marked in the presence of restrictive neuromuscular diseas e. A fixation light may be placed in front of 
the fellow eye.  The subject should blink his eyes once or twice to spread the fluorescein -stained tear film over the cornea and then should keep his eyes 
open widely.  In some subjects it is necessary for the examiner to hold the eyelids open with the thumb and forefinger of one hand.  Care must be taken not to place any pressure on the globe because this raises intraocular pressure.  
8. The operator sits opposite the subject in position to look through the microsc ope.  The clinician moves the assembly toward the subject.  When 
the black circle near the tip of the prism moves slightly, it indicates contact 
[CONTACT_833155].  
9. Alternatively, the assembly is advanced toward the subject until the limbal 
zone has bluish hue.  The biprism should not touch the lids or lashes because 
this stimulates blinking and squeezing. Touching the lids also thickens the fluorescein rings, which may cause an overestimation of intraocular pressure.  
10. The clinician observes the  applanation through the biprism at low power. A 
monocular view is obtained of the central applanated zone and the surrounding fluorescein stained tear film.  Using the control stick, the observer raises and lowers and centers of the assembly until two equ al 
semicircles are seen in the center of the field of view.  If the two semicircles are not equal in size, intraocular pressure is overestimated.  The clinician turns the tension knob in both directions to ensure that the instrument is in good position. If  the semicircles cannot be made "too small," the instrument 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ADDRESS_1156927]. If the semicircles cannot be made "too large," the 
instrument is too far from the eye.  
11. The fluorescein rings should be approximately 0.[ADDRESS_1156928] should blink two or three times to replenish the fluorescein; additional fluorescein may be added if necessary.  If the fluorescein rings are too wide, the subject should dr y his eyes lightly with a 
tissue, and the front surface of the prism should be dried with lint- free 
material.  An excessively wide fluorescein ring is less of a problem than a very narrow ring but can cause the intraocular pressure to be overestimated.  
12. The fluorescein rings normally undergo a rhythmic movement in response to 
the cardiac cycle. The tension knob is rotated until the inner borders of the fluorescein rings touch each other at the midpoint of their pulsations.  The intraocular pressure is the me an of these 2 readings.  
13. Intraocular pressure is measured in the study eye twice.  If the 2 readings differ by 2 mmHg or less the average is the IOP.  If the 2 readings differ by > [ADDRESS_1156929] instillation of ocular medication if IOP is measured on different days, an attempt should be made to standardize the time.  
 Errors in measurement can arise from a number of factors, including the 
following:  
 
1. Inadequate fluorescein staining of the tear film causes an underestimation of intraocular pressure.  
2. Elevating the eyes more than 15° above the horizontal causes an 
overestimation of intraocular pressure. Widening the lid fissure excessively causes an overestimation of intraocular pressure.  
3. Repeated tonometry reduces intraocular pressure, causing an underestimation of the true l evel. This effect is greatest between the first 
and second readings, but the trend continues through a number of repetitions.  
4. A scarred, irregular cornea distorts the fluorescein rings and makes it difficult 
to estimate intraocular pressure.  
5. The thickness of the cornea affects intraocular pressure readings. If the 
cornea is thick because of edema, intraocular pressure is underestimated. If the cornea is thick because of additional tissue, intraocular pressure is overestimated. The Goldmann tonometer is accu rate after epi[INVESTIGATOR_554341].  
6. If the examiner presses on the globe or if the subject squeezes his eyelids, intraocular pressure is overestimated.

clinical use.  
 
Diurnal IOP  
In order to determine the mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements at

be repeated within two weeks.  
 Visual fields are to be performed with a non -dilated pupil unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the pupil is so miotic that dilation is required (e.g., < 3mm).  If dilation was performed at screening, it should be performed at all subsequent visual field

21 APPENDIX B - DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
I. PREAMBLE  
 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of 
Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
 The Declaration is intended to be rea d as a whole and each of its constituent 
paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant 
paragraphs.  
 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed 
primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are invo lved in 
medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
 II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
 
1. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when provi ding medical care.”  
 
2. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being 
and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of 
this duty.  
 3. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.  
 4. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE] Rev F  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Sight Sciences   Page 56 of 61 and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
 5. Medical res earch is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure 
respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights.  
 6. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, 
this goal can never take precedence over the righ ts and interests of individual 
research subjects.  
7. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the 
life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and 
confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility 
for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or 
other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent.  
 
8. Physicians must consider the ethical,  legal and regulatory norms and standards 
for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate  any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 
9. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the environment.  
 
10. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_11272], training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional.  
 
11. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
 
12. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve 
their patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by [CONTACT_436498], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the heal th of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
 
13. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured.

III. RISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS  
 
• In medical practice and in medical research, most  interventions involve risks 
and burdens.  
 
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the 
importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research 
subjects.  
 
• All medical research involving human subjects must be p receded by [CONTACT_833158].  
 
Measure s to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be 
continuously monitored, assessed and documented by [CONTACT_3021].  
 
• Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can 
be satisfactorily managed.  
 
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is 
conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to 
continue, modify or immediately stop the st udy.  
 IV. VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS  
 
• Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
 All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered 
protection.  
 
• Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is 
responsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -vulnerable group. In addition, this group should 
stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result 
from the research.  
 V. SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS  
 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE] Rev F  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Sight Sciences   Page 58 of 61 • Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally 
accepted scientific principles, be based on a t horough knowledge of the 
scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate 
laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of 
animals used for research must be respected.  
 
• The design and performance of each rese arch study involving human subjects 
must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol.  
 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been address ed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, 
sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for 
subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a  consequence of participation in 
the research study.  
 In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial provisions.  
 
VI. RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES  
 
• The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, 
guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and 
must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but thes e must not be allowed to 
reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, esp ecially information 
about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee 
containing a summary  of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
 
VII. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
• Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and 
the confidentiality of their personal information.  
 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE] Rev F  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Sight Sciences   Page 59 of 61  
VIII. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
• Participation by [CONTACT_269035]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving 
informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely 
agrees.  
 
• In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed 
consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institu tional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other 
relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the 
right to ref use to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate 
at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the informati on. 
 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be  expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be 
formally documented and witnessed.  
 All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed 
about the general outcome and results of the study.  
 
• When seeking informed consent for par ticipation in a research study the 
physician must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a 
dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_30388].  
 
• For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, 
the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized 
representative. These individuals mus t not be included in a research study that 
has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing infor med consent, and 
the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ZIP_CODE] Rev F  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Sight Sciences   Page 60 of 61 • When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed 
consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek t hat assent in addition to the consent of the legally 
authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be respected.  
 
• Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients,  may be done only if the physical or 
mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If n o such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been 
approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
 
• The physician must fully inform  the patient which aspects of their care are 
related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
 
• For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where con sent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
 
IX. USE OF PLACEBO  
 
• The benefits, risks, burdens  and effectiveness of a new intervention must be 
tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
 Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
 Where for comp elling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use 
of any intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an 
intervention  
 
Study of OMNI System in OAG  
Protocol [ADDRESS_1156937] -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
 
• In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants 
who still need an intervention identified as beneficial  in the trial. This 
information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process.  
 XI. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
 
• Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.  
 
• Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of 
research. Researchers have a duty to make p ublicly available the results of 
their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness 
and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines 
for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration shou ld not be accepted for publication.  
 
XII. UNPROVEN INTERVENTIONS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE  
 
In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist,  
or other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it 
offers hope o f saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to 
evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

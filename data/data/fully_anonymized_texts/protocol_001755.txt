RESEARCH SUMMARY  COVER SHEET  
•The goal of this research is to assess safety and efficacy of magnetic seizure therapy
(MST) in the treatment of depression  in the elderly.
•MST will be compared to a well known, standard of care treatment, called
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
•Particip ants will be assigned randomly (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin), to either MST or ECT
treatment arms.
•Both groups, MST or ECT, will receive convulsive therapy; there is no placebo group.
•Participants will have intravenous (IV) line placed on the morning of the tre atment.
Through this line th ey will receive two kinds  of medication s at the beginning of the
treatment. First medication  will make the m fall asleep (for a brief period of time,
lasting a few minutes);  second one will relax their muscles .
•During the treatment, p articipants will remain under the care of two doctors . The first
one is an anesthesiologist  – a doctor who put s the patient to sleep  and monitors
patient’s vital signs and the second one is the treating psychiatrist .
•Participants will be aske d to wear earplugs  because of the brief noise generated during
the treatment, while under anesthesia.
•Treatments are performed 3 times a week: on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
mornings.
•In order to evaluate  study progress,  standard  tests will be given before, after and in -
between treatments.

Purpose of Study  and Overview  
You are eligible to participate in this study because you have severe depression and it 
has been recommended that you receive treatment  for your depression  that uses el ectricity to 
cause a seizure  (convulsive therapy) . You have been invited to participate in a research study 
using a new type of convulsive therapy, called magnetic seizure therapy (MST ), which  will be 
compared to an existing standard of care treatment, ele ctroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Like 
ECT, MST causes a seizure.  Unlike ECT, which uses electricity , MST uses magnetic fields 
that create a small amount of electricity in the brain to trigger the seizure.  MST is 
experimental and is not approved by [CONTACT_153545] (FDA ).  MST has only 
been used  previously  to treat depression in about [ADDRESS_1137597] your current or future treatment at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute or Columbia 
University.

for you depends on your prior  experience with th ese treatments, your psychiatric and medical 
condition  and other considerations that you should discuss with your doctor.  
Procedures  
Clinical and Stud y Evaluation s:  Before starting treatment, you will be asked about 
your past and c urrent physical and mental health.  During the time that you are receiving 
convulsive treatments and during the week after you finish treatment, you will be interviewed 
about changes in your symptoms and side effects. You will be interviewed about your 
depression and side effects two and six months after the last treatment.  
To test the effects of treatment on your thinking and memory, you will receive a set of 
tests before and after each session. This will take about [ADDRESS_1137599] treatment.  
Schedule of testing:   This study is performed in a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  On the first 
testing day, you will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Even  if you are accepted for outpatient 
treatment, you will still need to be admitted to the inpatient unit for the first week of treatment 
and will receive the same study procedures.  You will be interviewed, have a physical exam, 
hearing test, and an interview about your psychiatric condition.  You will also have your blood 
drawn, give a urine sample, and have a chest X -Ray.  If you are taki ng medications to treat 
your depression, these medications will be gradually stopped.  You will be off of these 
medications for at least five days before you start receiving treatments.  Therefore, your actual 
delay to treatment may be as short as [ADDRESS_1137600] ( with magnetic coil p laced at the surface of your head) or right unilateral 
ECT (a standard method of ECT  with two electrodes touching  the scalp ). If you decide to 
participate in the study, you will have a fifty percent chance (or 1 out of 2) of receiving MST. 
You will then re ceive your assigned treatment three times a week. Neither you nor the clinician 
who evaluates the level  of your depression  will know which treatment you are receiving. The 
study assignment is made in advance by a procedure similar to drawing straws.  Treatments 
will continue usually for two to six weeks, depending on your doctor's judgment of how you 
are responding. Your parti cipation in the study will be stopped  after eight treatments  if your 
depression does not improve by [CONTACT_2669] 25% as measured by a  test we use (Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale ). There is no maximum number of treatments. However, if you need 
more than [ADDRESS_1137601] needed to cause a seizure is reached.  At the other sessions, you will be treated at a dosage

Version 07/28/[ADDRESS_1137602] experienced hearing loss, your hearing will be tested again 
periodically until either it returns to the level where it was before treatment or the doctor 
determines that it will not improve any more. At the end of the treatment course, one of the 
study  investigators will provide you with a letter stating that the seizure(s) you experienced 
were produced as part of an experiment.  
Blood tests:  A blood sample will be taken to carry out recommended tests before 
convulsive therapy. Further blood tests wil l be drawn at your second, sixth, and next to last 
session to look at hormonal effects of the treatment.  The total amount of blood taken for all 
research procedures will be less than one cup.  This is about half the amount of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_820815] a blood  bank.  
 Studies  of the nervous system function (Neurophysiology) :  A set of tests will be done 
to examine the effects of the MST and ECT on brain activity.  These tests include 
electroencephalography (referred to as EEG, or looking at “brain waves”) and t ests of your 
brain’s responses to magnetic pulses (referred to as motor cortex excitability studies).  For the 
EEG, your scalp will be cleaned and sensors placed on your head and near your eyes.  The 
sensors are used to measure the brain waves that natural ly occur in your brain, while you lie 
quietly.  The EEG will be measured before treatment, during two of the MST/ECT sessions, 
and during the week following the last treatment.  
The test of your brain’s responses to magnetic pulses will be done before your  first 
session and in the week following your last session.  During this procedure, small sensors will 
be attached to the skin of your hands and/or legs to measure muscle twitching. A technician 
will hold a magnetic coil over your head or on the back of yo ur neck.  This coil will give a 
number of quick magnetic pulses.  Some of these pulses will cause your fingers or foot to 
twitch.  Earplugs will be worn throughout the testing because the stimulator makes a clicking 
noise.  
MST/ECT: At each treatment, you will be under the care of an anesthesiologist, a 
psychiatrist, and a nurse.  To receive each treatment you will be brought to a special room 
containing all the appropriate equipment that is needed for your treatment.  The treatments are 
given in the mornin g, before breakfast.  Because the treatments are done under general anesthesia 
(while you are asleep), you will not be allowed to drink or eat for at least eight hours before each 
treatment. During the treatment, medications will be given to you through a thin plastic tube (an 
“IV line” or catheter) placed in your arm.  You will be given medicine that will quickly put you to 
sleep.  You will be given a second drug that will relax your muscles.  Because you will be asleep, 
you will not feel pain or discomfor t during the procedure.  
To prepare for the treatments, monitoring sensors will be put on your head and other 
parts of your body. This is done to monitor your brain, your heart, and your blood pressure.  
These recordings involve no pain or discomfort. A bl ood pressure cuff will be put on one of 
your legs.  Before starting the MST/ECT procedure, you will be asked to remove any metal or

IRB Protocol # 6427  
Version 07/28/164 magnetized objects (such as keys, jewelry, hair pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], and credit cards).  MST makes a loud 
clicking sound, so you will be gi ven earplugs for your comfort and safety.  
If you are assigned to MST, after you are asleep the MST coil will be placed on your 
head.  MST is given using a magnetic stimulator.  A magnetic stimulator is a device that makes 
a magnetic field.  The magnetic field is made by [CONTACT_820822] a coil of wire.  The 
magnetic field passes through the skull to the brain. The magnetic field creates a small amount 
of electricity in the brain.  That electricity triggers a seizure (convulsion).  
If you are assign ed to ECT, after you are asleep, electrodes used to stimulate the br ain 
will be  placed on your head.  ECT is given using an electrical stimulator, which is a device that 
can pass an electrical current between two stimulating electrodes.  When the current i s passed, a 
seizure is produced in the brain.  
Because you will have received a medication to relax your muscles, body movements 
that would ordinarily happen during a seizure will be much weaker.  The seizure will last for 
about one minute.  Within a few m inutes, the medicine that put you to sleep will wear off and 
you will wake up.  You will be given oxygen to help you breathe.  After waking up, you will be 
taken to a recovery room, where you will be watched for about 45 minutes (the time varies for 
differ ent people) until you are ready to leave the recovery area.  
You will be monitored very closely while the seizure is going on.  There will be sensors 
on your forehead that will allow the psychiatrist to track the progress of the seizure in your 
brain. The psychiatrist and nurse will also monitor your seizure by [CONTACT_57094] a blood pressure 
cuff around one of your ankles.  This cuff decreases the amount of muscle relaxant that can 
reach your foot, so that the psychiatrist and nurse will be able to see your foo t moving even 
though the rest of your body is relaxed. Your motor seizure (seizure visible in your foot) will 
also be timed.  
If MST fails to cause a seizure, you will be allowed to wake up and your treatment 
options will be discussed with you.  At any poi nt in the study, you are free to switch to ECT if 
MST fails to cause a seizure or to improve your depression.  If you do not respond to treatment, 
you will be provided other treatment options that are best for you.  As a clinical inpatient at 
NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_820816].  
Risks and Inconveniences  
Experimental Nature of the Treatment:  MST is experimental and it may have 
unknown side effects.  MST may not help your depression get better and it is possible that your 
depression will get worse; receiving MST may delay your ability to receive effective treatment.  
Delay in treatment of depression may also result in making your symptoms worse.  
Medication Withdrawal:   Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820817] , if any,  may cause your depression to get worse.  There may also be side effects 
from stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820818]. Your medications will be stopped on a schedule that  is best 
for you so that these effects can be minimized.  The length of time of your withdrawal from 
medication will depend on the type of medication you are currently taking.  
Risk due to general anesthesia: Both MST and ECT require general anesthesia. As 
Patient Consent Form  
IRB Protocol # 6427  
Version 07/28/165 with any procedure where you are put to sleep (general anesthesia), there is a remote risk of 
death.  The risk of death  attributable to the management of general anesthesia with  convulsive 
treatment  is estima ted to be one out of 10,[ADDRESS_1137603]:   If you participate as 
an outpatient, there is an increased risk of falling  and thus injuring yourself  after each 
treatment, risk of injury from operating dangerous machinery (such as driving or using the 
stove).  If you eat or drink after midnight, serious risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_820819]. This can lead to pneumonia and other serious medical complications, 
including in rare cases, death.  To reduce these risks, we require that in order to participate as 
an outpatient, you remain under the supervision of another responsible adult who will oversee 
the treatment regimen. We also require that a minimum of [ADDRESS_1137604]:  Although  it is expected that the side effects of MST will be similar or less 
intense than the side effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the risks and benefits are not 
known .  The risks may include mem ory loss, confusion, headache, muscle soreness, nausea, 
and dental pain. It is possible that, if you experience dental pain, it could last beyond when 
your MST treatment ends.  Both ECT and MST put electricity into the brain and cause a 
seizure.  Magnetic fields do not enter into the brain as deeply as the electric fields used in ECT.  
This might mean that the memory side effects from the stimulation of deeper parts of the brain 
may be less with MST than ECT, but this is not known.  In the cases of healthy volunteers who 
had accidental seizures with magnetic stimulation, there have been no signs of any long -term 
side effects.  
The clicking noise made by [CONTACT_820823] a short time.  
Earplugs reduce this risk, so you will be asked to we ar earplugs during MST.  As with all 
antidepressant treatments, including ECT, there is a possible risk of inducing mania.  
ECT:  Like other medical procedures, ECT involves some risks. Serious medical 
complications with ECT are rare.  With introduction of modern anesthesia, bone fractures and 
dislocations are exceedingly rare and none such occurred in the last [ADDRESS_1137605] may go back to several months before you 
Patient Consent Form  
IRB Protocol # 6427  
Version 07/28/[ADDRESS_1137606], it 
is important that you not make important personal or business decisions during treatment or 
immediately following treatment.  This may mean postponing decisions about financial or family 
matters.  After the treatment, you will begin a “conval escence (recovery) period.” This usually 
lasts one to three weeks, but this varies from patient to patient.  During this period you should 
not drive, do business, or other activities for which poor concentration or memory may be a 
problem, until your docto r tells you to do so.  
Neurophysiological Studies  involving EEG:  There are no anticipated risks of the EEG 
procedure.  EEG electrodes will be slotted or made from plastic to reduce electrode heating, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_80669].  
Neurophysiological Studies to determine Motor Threshold:  
The tests of muscle twitching use magnetic pulses given at low frequency (less than one 
per second).  Low frequency magnetic pulses pose no significant health risk.  Electrical current 
is produced i n the brain from magnetic pulses.  This current is well below harmful levels.  The 
most serious known risk of low frequency magnetic stimulation is seizure, although low 
frequency  magnetic stimulation has not been known to cause seizure in properly selecte d 
individuals .  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_820820], there is a chance that you will experience a seizure 
or other medical complication from low frequency magnetic stimulation during this test. If you 
have a seizure, you may have to be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a nd follow -up neurological 
evaluation.  Having had a seizure may adversely affect your medical insurance, your future 
employment, and your ability to drive.  It is not known whether having had one seizure will 
make a person more likely to have future seizur es. 
The most commonly reported side effect of low frequency magnetic stimulation is a 
“muscle -tension” type headache.  About [ADDRESS_1137607] over the counter pain medications

IRB Protocol # 6427  
Version 07/28/167 (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, Toradol (ketorolac tromethamine)).  Ne ck pain may also occur, 
and it is also usually managed easily with the same standard over the counter painkillers.  You 
may also experience some discomfort on your head where the coil is held.  This is due to 
contraction of scalp muscles.  The clicking noi se produced during the stimulation may 
temporarily affect hearing.  The earplugs will reduce this risk.  
Blood tests :  A blood sample will be taken to carry out typi[INVESTIGATOR_820821]. For most people, drawing blood does n ot cause any serious 
problems. However, there is a risk of bleeding, bruising, discomfort, dizziness, infections and 
pain at the needle site.   These side effects usually go away in a few days.  
Clinical Evaluation, Neuropsychological Procedures and Physical Examination:   
There are no known or expected risks to you from the interview about your history.  There are 
no known risks of the physical and neurological examination.  The interviews are time 
consuming and they are about personal matters. It is possible that you will feel upset, tired or 
anxious. If this happens, you can choose not to answer specific questions or ask to have the 
interview stopped at any time.  
Unforeseen risks:  A previously unknown problem could result from your participation 
in this research. There could be an interaction between MST/ECT/anesthesia medication, and 
other medications you take (prescribed or over the counter). It is not possible to estimate the 
chances of such problems or how serious the problems could be.  
Benefit s 
You may or may not benefit from this study. Whether you are assigned to receive ECT 
or MST, your depression may improve, although there is no guarantee that this will happen. 
Information obtained from this study may add to knowledge about safer treatm ents for severe 
depression.

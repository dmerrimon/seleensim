CESSATION OF ENROLLM ENT 
Refer to Appendix D for update on enrollment and changes to follow -up schedules for already 
enrolled patients.   
 
1.1 NAME [CONTACT_481050] E OF THE DEVICE  
The AMPLATZER ™ Cardiac Plug (ACP) is a percutaneous transcatheter device intended to 
prevent thrombus embolization from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in subjects who have 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.  
 
1.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ACP in subjects 
with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation by [CONTACT_480964]- inferior to optimal 
medical therapy (OMT)  with respect to the primary effectiveness endpoint  and superior to OMT 
with respect to primary safety endpoint.  
 The OMT control will include subjects managed with oral anticoagulation therapy  (warfarin or 
dabigatran) with therapy choice determined by [CONTACT_480965] .  
 
1.3 STUDY DESIGN  
The ACP will be clinically evaluated through a prospective, randomized, multicenter, active control study to evaluate safety and effectiveness. The randomization scheme will be 2:1, stratified by [CONTACT_91294] , oral anticoagulant therapy  (OAC) (warfarin or dabigatran) , and 
baseline concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480849]. T wice as many subjects will be randomized to the 
treatment arm ( device arm ) than to the control arm ( OMT ), respectively.  The study will be 
initiated under a feasibility phase to be followed by [CONTACT_480966][INVESTIGATOR_30338].  
 
Feasibility phase- Following randomization, the first 30 subjects to receive the device will 
constitute the feasibility subset.  The 45 day results (reported AEs and TEE) for these initial [ADDRESS_617942] enrollment will be temporarily 
halted while the feasibility subset data are being collected and reviewed by [CONTACT_480967].

The ACP clinical trial will enroll a minimum of 400 and maximum of 3000 subjects at a 
maximum of 80 investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002] and a maximum of  10 sites in Canada.  
The anticipated study duration is approximately  5 years.  Safety and effectiveness data 
collected from the randomized subjects will be used to support a PMA submission.  
 
2. CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
 
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
DISEASE TO BE TREATED  
Atrial fibrillation  (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disorder (Fuster 2006).  
During AF there are multiple simultaneous waves of contraction which spread in a chaotic manner through both atria.  This arrhythmia results in rapid, uncoordinated contractions which decrease the blood pumped through the atria.  
 Atrial fibrillation is classified as valvular, nonvalvular, or lone.  Nonvalvular AF refers to cases without rheumatic mitral valve disease, prosthetic heart valve, or valve repair.  Nonvalvular AF can be further classified according to the AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines as paroxysmal, persistent, and/or permanent.  Paroxysmal AF has been reported in an estimated 25 to 90% of subjects with AF (Kannel 1983, Davidson 1989, Phillips 1990, Gajewski 1981, and Takahashi 1981) although 90% of cases of paroxysmal AF are as ymptomatic and therefore the prevalence may 
not be known (Israel 2004, Page 1994).  Paroxysmal AF terminates spontaneously whereas persistent AF is sustained for a minimum of seven days.  Persistent or paroxysmal AF, if sustained for greater than a year, m ay lead to permanent AF.  
 Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) and Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The loss of mechanical efficiency during AF leads to insufficient  contraction in the left atrium 
(LA) (Ostermayer 2005).  Stagnation of blood flow in the LA leads to hypercoagulability and 
thus increased risk for  thrombus formation in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.  
Approximately 90% of all thrombi in subjects with nonvalvular AF forming in the LA originate in the LAA (Blacksheer 1996).  The thrombus  format ion, in turn, exposes the subject to 
thromboembolic events. Approximately 6% of embolic events result in peripheral embolism as  
opposed to ischemic stroke (Go 2003).   
 Echocardiographic risk factors for LAA thrombus formation include echocardiographic evidence of decreased LAA flow velocity and spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) within the LA 
and LAA (Stollberger 2003 and Miller 1993).  The normal flow pattern of the LAA is the ejection of blood from the appendage following atrial contraction at a velocity greater than 40cm/s

was 2.6 times greater in subjects with LAA flow velocities <20cm/s than those with higher LAA velocities.  
 Ischemic strokes in subjects with A F have been found to cause major deficits as compared to 
ischemic strokes in subjects with carotid disease.   Subjects with AF have also been found to have silent infarcts in the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_480854] a CT scan was performed both initially and then again a t the end of the follow -up period (Ezekowitz 1995).  
 Nonvalvular AF subjects can be further assessed to determine the risk of stroke based on the existence of independent ris k factors.  In a study by [CONTACT_480968] (2001), the CHADS
2\ index was 
found to be the most accurate in predicting the risk of stroke in subjects with AF.  The CHADS 2 
score assigns one point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age greater than 75, and diabetes mellitus, and two points for history of stroke or TIA.  The study found that AF subjects who were not treated with antithrombotics had an increased risk of stroke from 1.5% to 18.2% based on the score of 1 and 6 respectively.  A second study reviewed outcome data (11,526 subjects) in a large primary care se tting and confirmed that 
thromboembolic risk increases progressively with CHADS
[ADDRESS_617947] risk ( CHADS
2 score of zero) and highest risk ( CHADS 2 of ≥5) (Go et al, 2003).  
 STATISTICS  
An estimated 2.[ADDRESS_617948] paroxysmal or persistent AF (Go 2001).  The estimated prevalence of AF is 0.4% to 1% in the general population, increasing with age to 8% in those older than 80 (Vural [ADDRESS_617949] 2000).   
 Atrial fibrillation is responsible for 15% to 20% of ischemic stroke (Crystal 2004).  AF accounts for one fourth of all strokes in the elderly and is responsible for 70,000 strokes per year in the [LOCATION_002]  (AHA stat istics ).  The risk of stroke in subjects with nonvalvular AF is 
approximately 5% per year in subjects under 65 years and it increases to over 8% per year in subjects over 75 (AF Investigators Arch Intern Med 1994).  Based on risk factors and treatment or the lack thereof the risk of stroke can be as high as 18.2% per year in select subjects (Gage 
2001).  
 CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS  
Medical Management for AF  
Treatment for AF includes both pharmacological and/or interventional based on the subject’s type of AF.   Anti-arrhythmic or rate control drugs are commonly used to treat subjects with AF.  
Medical interventions include electrical cardioversion, cardiac catheter ablation, atrial defibrillators, pacemakers, or maze procedure.  Regardless of the type of treatment modality chosen for rate or rhythm control, the need for anticoagulation therapy should still be based on stroke risk and not on whether proper heart rhythm is maintained (Fuster and Ryden 2006).   
 The evidence indicates that both OAC and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480855] (Petersen 1989, SPAF 1991, BAATAF 1990,

(2008), warfarin was found to be superior to ASA and placebo in reducing the risk of both 
stroke and systemic embolism in subjects with nonvalvular AF. Hart et al (2007) reported that adjusted dose warfarin reduces stroke by 64% (six trials) and antiplatelet agents reduce stroke risk by 22% (8 trials).   The study also reported the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was doubled 
with adjusted dose warfarin compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] , although the absolute risk increase was 
small (0.2% per year) and all-cause mortality was substantially reduced (26% [CI, 3% to 43% ]) 
by [CONTACT_441119]- dose warfarin vs. control.  Subjects are often poorly compliant with 
anticoagulation, and anticoagulants are contraindicated in selected subsets of subjects.  
 More recently , new drugs have been developed with less dietary and pharmacological  
interactions and less stringent requirements for frequent INR monitoring . Major trials such as  
RE-LY and ROCKET AF  have demonstrated that dabigatran and rivaroxaban are non- inferior 
to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism.  For example in the RE -LY 
study, the overall annual major bleeding rate with dabigatran was lower than with warfarin (2.71%/3.11% for 110/150 mg dabigatran vs. 3.36% for warfarin) but GI bleeding for both doses of dabigatran was (non- significantly) higher than for warfarin (1.12%/1.51% for 110/150 
mg dabigatran vs. 1.02% for warfarin) (Connolly et al 2009 , Patel et al 2011).   In view of the 
bleeding associated with warfarin and new OAC drugs, especially, patients who are at high risk for stroke as well as f or bleeding may benefit from alternative stroke prevention therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Surgical Closure of the LAA  
Surgical removal/closure of the LAA has been performed in subjects undergoing mitral valve surge ry or the maze procedure.  Garcia- Fernandez et al (2003) completed a retrospective 
analysis of 58 subjects who underwent ligation of the LAA during mitral valve surgery.  The study reported a residual shunt rate of 10% in these subjects.  Residual shunting correlated with an increased risk of late embolism.  However, in a prospective study conducted by [CONTACT_480970] (2007) the rate of thromboembolism post LAA exclusion was not statistically significantly less than subjects treated with warfarin.  
 Percutaneous Closure of LAA  
LAA obliteration is now feasible via a percutaneous approach.  A device to reduce the risk of embolization from LAA thrombi, especially when associated anticoagulation is a relative or absolute contraindication, would be a desired option in such subjects.  Studies comparing investigational percutaneous LAA occlusion techniques with traditional anticoagulation are ongoing.  
 Sievert et al (2002) reported on 15 subjects with chronic AF and a contraindication to warfarin implanted with the PLAATO Device ( manufactured by [CONTACT_92538]3) for LAA occlusion.  Complete 
closure was observed in all subjects and there were no reported complications.  
 Ostermeyer et al (2005) also reported preliminary results with the PLAATO Device.  Successful LAA occlusion was achieved in 108/111 (97.3%) subjec ts. 
 Sick et al (2007)  reported the early results of a small feasibility study performed with the 
WATCHMAN System  (manufactured by [CONTACT_446617]) .  Sixty- six (66) patients were enrolled at centers 
ACP Investigational Plan  Page 11 of 130  Revision 06 Amendment  
CL00921 (H)   September  2014

fibrillation and a CHADS 2 score of one or greater.  Two (2) patients experienced systemic embolic 
events which were a safety endpoint in the study  and 4 patients developed thrombus on the 
device.  
 A multi -center, prospective, randomized study  (PROTECT AF) , comparing the WATCHMAN 
device to long -term warfarin therapy, demonstrating the treatment arm is non- inferior to the 
control arm completed enrollment in June 2008.  The primary endpoint of this study is  to 
characterize the rates of all stroke, systemic embolism and cardiovascular death in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who require treatment for potential thrombus formation and are 
eligible for warfarin therapy.  PROTECT AF demonstrated th at LAA closure is non- inferior to 
warfarin for all-cause stroke and all-cause  mortality, reducing stroke and all-cause death by 32% 
compared to warfarin .  Although the non -inferiority endpoint was met, the results were not 
statistically significant  for sup eriority . 
 
Currently, the PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized EVAluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device In Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trial is enrolling AF patients at risk for stroke to be randomized to either ant icoagulation therapy or implantation of the 
WATCHMAN device.  The primary endpoint is the occurrence of stroke, cardiovascular death and 
systemic embolism. The study plans for enrollment of 475 patients who will be followed for 5 years.  
 Recent experience with the ACP device in Europe includes  204 high risk subjects enrolled in the 
ACP EU Prospective Observational Study . Subjects ’ risk factors  for stroke (mean CHADS
2: 2.6) 
included  hypertension and age > 75 years .  Furthermore, 80 subjects had a previous stroke or 
TIA prior to implantation of the ACP. In 80% of the subjects , percutaneous LAA occlusion was 
indicated by a high bleeding risk  and 3.9% were on active anticoagulation therapy at the time of 
enrollment .  High closure success rates of 99.5% were found immediately after successful 
implantation and at discharge and remained high at six months post implant (98.9%).  
 2.2 RATIONALE  
The rationale for the ACP  clinical investigation is to potentially offer a device that is safe and 
effective in  preventing thrombus from migrating from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in subjects 
who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and is a potential  alternative to long -term anticoagulation 
therapy.  
 2.3 NAME [CONTACT_481051] (ACP) is a transcatheter, self -expanding device constructed 
from a nitinol mesh and polyester patch.  The ACP consists of a lobe and a disc connected by a central waist.  It is available in eight diameter sizes (16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 mm).  
The lobe has stabilizing wires to improve device placement and retention.  The device has threaded screw attachments at each end for connection to the delivery and loading cable.  The device also has radio- opaque markers at each end and at the stabilizing wires. The ACP is 
designed to prevent thrombus embolization from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in subjects who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

 A medical management decision, treatment with warfarin or dabigatran* will be made by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_83106].  The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_480862].  Subjects will be randomized to either the device arm or the control 
arm respectively in a 2:1 ratio.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_91294], oral 
anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or dabigatran), and baseline concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480863].  Randomization into the concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480864] 20% of total study 
enrollment.  
*Dabigatran dos ing (75 mg or 150 mg bid)  should be in accordance with its approved directions for use . 
 
Subjects in both groups will be assigned a subject ID number at the time of consent. Subjects who are randomized to the device arm must follow the pre- procedure care instructions  
(Section 2.11.1). The implant procedure must be performed within fourteen (14) days of 
randomization.  
 Subjects who are randomized to the control arm must continue taking the OMT  that has been 
assigned by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_107990] a pri mary endpoint is met or the study is completed. 
Those subjects on warfarin should maintain  an INR between 2-3 with adjustment of dosage as 
needed. Discontinuation of designated OAC  (warfarin , dabigatran) or addition of other 
anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications is not allowed unless medically necessary .

o Day 5 - procedure day, no Lovenox (or warfarin)  
 
INR Test  
INR must be tested within 24 hours prior to the procedure. An INR should be 
≤1.5 in order to proceed with the device implantation procedure.  
 
b. Bridge regimen for subjects on dabigatran 
 
Discontinue dabigatran  1 to 2 days (CrCl ≥50 mL/min) or 3 to 5 days (CrCl <50 
mL/min) before invasive or surgical procedures  (see dabigatran prescribing 
information by [CONTACT_4657] ). 
 
 
2.11.2 PROCEDURE (RANDOMIZED TO DEVICE ARM)  
• Procedure must be performed within 14 days from the date of 
randomization. 
• Procedure will be performed under TEE and angiographic guidance. 
• On an angiogram assessment, if a subject has an LAA landing  zone  
measured with a width of less than 12.6mm (at its widest point) or greater 
than 28.5mm at its widest point, the subject will not proceed with device implantation. These subjects will be considered intent to treat . 
• On an angiogram assessment, if a subject has insufficient space (minimum 10 mm) distal to the LAA orifice to accommodate insertion of the dilator and sheath, the subject will not proceed with device placement. 
These subjects will be considered as intent to treat . 
• Refer to the Instructions for Use for the recommended device size, 
delivery sheath selection, and ACP implantation procedure.

Investigators are responsible for promptly reporting all adverse events to AGA Medical by [CONTACT_480983].  All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_117186]; Adverse Event Follow -up CRF(s) must be 
completed.

possible, but in no event later than ten (10) working days after the investigator first learns of the effect (21 CFR 812.150 (a) (1)).  
 
2.15 HYPOTHES IS AND STATISTICAL A NALYSIS  
The ACP will be clinically evaluated for safety and effectiveness in subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic strokes, and peripheral thromboembolism through 
a two arm, randomized, multi -center,  controlled clinical trial.  Subjects will be randomized to 
either the device arm or the control arm.  The randomization ratio of device subjects to control subjects will be 2:1, that is, twice as many subjects will receive the device than receive warfarin  therapy. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_91294], oral anticoagulant 
therapy (warfarin or dabigatran), and baseline concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480863].  The ACP clinical 
trial will have two groups of  subjects.  The first 30 device subjects (plus any subjects with 
implant attempts) will constitute the feasibility group and all subjects (including the feasibility

all randomized subjects.   
 
2.15.[ADDRESS_617981] 30 subjects who receive the ACP device (plus any subjects with device implant attempts), will compose the feasibility subset .  The primary aim of this subset is to 
assess the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) in the first [ADDRESS_617982] 30 device subjects will be 
submitted to the FDA.  Enrollment will halt while the 30 day safety data are collected, analyzed, and submitted to FDA for review, although follow -up will continue among the 
device and control subjects already enrolled in the trial.  The DSMB and/or CEC will also review this data prior to submission.  
 The date of the first attempted implant procedure will determine the subjects that qualify for this group.  Since it may be difficult to determine which subject had the 30th ACP 
implant procedure, any subject with the same initial procedure date as another subject 
in this group will be reported among the feasibility group.  This may increase the 
feasibility sample size beyond 30 subjects.  In addition, subjects with an attempted, but 
not implanted device will be analyzed in this group but will not count towards the limit of 30; this may also increase the sample size beyond [ADDRESS_617983] in the study, randomized to either the device arm 
or the control arm (subjects treated with warfarin and dabigatran) in either the feasibility 
or pi[INVESTIGATOR_480873]. 
 
2.15.3 Study Design (REFER TO APPENDIX D)  
The study is intended to determine the difference in efficacy and safety between the device arm and control arm (subjects treated with OMT).  
 The ACP clinical trial is an adaptive design with interim sample size analyses that use 
current data and project the necessary sample size and follow -up time based upon 
observed efficacy and safety event rates in the device and control subjects.  
 Three primary endpoints and hypotheses are being evaluated in the ACP clinical trial  
 1. An efficacy endpoint which compares the 2- year event rates of ischemic stroke and 
peripheral thromboembolism.  This is a non-inferiority analysis  where the device 
will be deemed efficacious if the risk  ratio is < 1.75 or the risk difference in two 
years event rates is < 2.87.  
2.  A long -term safety endpoint which compares long -term composite rates of all -
cause mortality and major bleed.  This is a superiority analysis  where the device 
will be deemed safe if the safety event rate in the device arm is proven superior to the safety event rate in the control arm  (OMT ). 
3. An acute safety (short -term) endpoint which compares the rate of device or 
procedure related serious adverse events against a performance goal ( PG). If this

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . rate is less than 5%, the device is considered to have met the acute safety 
endpoint.  
 The primary efficacy and primary long -term safety hypotheses are included in the 
adaptive design.  The study will accrue subjects until there is high predictive probability that the sample size is sufficient to meet the efficacy and long term safety endpoints or until it is evident that in spi[INVESTIGATOR_480874]-term safety endpoints.  
 The an alysis for the primary acute safety endpoint will be performed on the entire 
sample size as determined by [CONTACT_480984].  
 The ACP clinical trial is powered to concurrently prove the non- inferiority efficacy 
endpoint, along with the acute and long-term safety endpoints.  The precise follow -up 
time may vary in this adaptive design.  
Interim sample size analyses will be performed when [ADDRESS_617984] not been met. For all subjects, assessment of primary endpoints begins at the time of randomization.  Type I error is controlled for multiple sample size selection analyses and for multiple potential analyses at the end of accrual.  
 The statistical model is described in detail in subsequent sections.  But at each interim analysis, two predictive probabilities are calculated:  
 
a. The predictive probability of meeting the non- inferiority criteria for efficacy and the 
superiority criteria for long -term safety is calculated if subject accrual is stopped at 
the current sample size and enrolled subjects are continued to be followed for an additional two years.   If this joint predictive probability exceeds the predictive 
success stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239], S
n, in Table [ADDRESS_617985] possible final analysis may be perfor med in 6 months with subsequent analyses possible at 12, 18, and 24

exposure.  As demonstrated in the operating characteristics (2.15.5), longer trials are expected.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adaptive D esign 
The efficacy and long -term safety en dpoints are modeled separately, but their combined 
probability of success is incorporated throughout the adaptive design.  Statistical 
models for each are described separately in the following sections.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Primary Effectiveness Endpoint and Hypothesis  
The primary effectiveness endpoint  for the ACP study is the two -year annualized rate of 
ischemic stroke and peripheral thromboembolism.  The rate will be calculated in each treatment arm using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_480876] (non- constant hazard rate) and 
assessing the number of primary endpoint events divided by [CONTACT_480985] -
years of follow -up within each timeframe.  The 2- year event rate is then found by [CONTACT_480986].  For subjects who have already 
experienced an endpoint, additional endpoints or follow -up time will not be factored into

tracked for efficacy events.  
 
Separate estimates will be performed for the posterior probability distributions for the two-year event rate in the subjects randomized to the device arm and for the two- year 
event rate for subjects randomized to the control arm.  Once these estimates are obtained, the posterior probability distributions for both the risk ratio (device rate / control rate) and risk difference (device rate minus control rate) will be calculated.  
 Non-inferiority criterion will be considered met if either the hazard ratio of device to 
control rate is significantly less than 1.75, or  if the risk difference is less than 2. 87 
percentage points.   
 
Let π
DEVICE  be the primary effectiveness endpoint rate in the device arm, while πCONTROL  
is the corresponding rate in the control arm. Specifically, the following null and 
alternative hypotheses will be tested:  
 
H0: πDEVICE  / πCONTROL  > 1.75 
Ha: πDEVICE  / πCONTROL  < 1.75 
 
where πDEVICE  equals the two- year event rate in the device arm and πCONTROL  equals the 
two-year efficacy event rate in the control arm. The null hypothesis will be rejected and 
non-inferiority to OMT  will be concluded if the upper bound of the two- sided 97.6% 
Bayesian confidence interval for the ratio between the device rate and control rate is 
less than 1.75.   This is equivalent to testing whether the posterior probability, Pr( πDEVICE  
/ πCONTROL  > 1.75) > 0.988.  
 
 For the Risk Difference, the following hypotheses will be tested.  
 
H
0: πDEVICE - πCONTROL  > 2.87% 
Ha: πDEVICE  - πCONTROL  < 2.87%     
 The null hypothesis will be rejected and non- inferiority to OMT  will be concluded if the 
upper bound of the two- sided 97.6% Bayesian confidence interval for the difference 
between the two- year device rate and two- year control rate is l ess than 2. 87%. This is 
equivalent to testing whether the posterior probability, Pr( π
DEVICE  / πCONTROL  > 1.75) > 
0.988.  
 97.6% confidence intervals are used so that the Type I error for the composite 
hypothesis test is not above a one- sided 2.5%.  
 With this combination of allowable risk ratio (1.75) and risk difference (2. 87%) the Type I 
error rate is highest at π
CONTROL  = 3.82% and πDEVICE  = 6.69 -- the point where πDEVICE  /

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . πCONTROL = 1.75 and πDEVICE  - πCONTROL = 2.87%.  The type I error rate for this  scenario is 
shown in Table 5. 
 
If the device endpoint rate is shown to be successful for non- inferiority to control, it will 
then be tested for superiority.  In that event, the following null and alternative hypotheses will be tested:  
 
H
0: πDEVICE - πCONTROL  > 0 
Ha: πDEVICE - πCONTROL  < 0 
 While the above hypotheses are stated as a subtraction of rates, it is equivalent to testing whether the ratio of the rates is lower than 1.0.  
 The following describes the Bayesian adaptive design for the primary efficacy endpoint.  This design was created by [CONTACT_480987], ( Austin , [LOCATION_007]) using the specific model 
assumptions for this trial.  
 The two -year event rates are calculated using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_480877] -up. 
 The control arm uses a 7- pi[INVESTIGATOR_480878] 8- pi[INVESTIGATOR_480879]:  
 Time intervals for the control arm:  
• Day 0 - Day 6  
• Day 7 - Day 30 
• Day31- Day 60 
• Day 61- 6 months  
• 6 months -12 months  
• 12 months -18 months  
• 18 months -24 months  
 Time intervals for the device arm:  
• Day 0 (randomization) to Day before Procedure Day (the procedure must occur by 14- days after randomization)  
• Procedure Day to Procedure Day + 6 days  
• Procedure Day + 7 days to Day 30 
• Day 31- Day 60  
• Day 61- 6 months  
• 6 months -12 months  
• 12 months -18 months

events observed are counted (e.g. an event that occurs at 2 years + [ADDRESS_617988] the composite 2- year event rate by [CONTACT_332889] 18- 24 month interval ).  
 The segments comprising the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480880] 30 days between the two treatment arms.  The benefit of this model is that it separately estimates: 
• the risk from randomization to procedure (procedure day varies by [CONTACT_1130], may range from 0 to 14),  
• risk on the day of procedure and immediately afterward (a 7- day period 
for all subjects) and  
• the risk in remainder of the first month (segment varies by [CONTACT_1130], may range from 9 to 23 days)  
 The segments in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480881] 30 -days:  30- 60 days, 61 days -6 months, then 6- month intervals thereafter.

 For estimating the two- year event rates the exponential distribution and the at -risk time

assumed that the procedure takes place on day 10 following randomization.

A sensitivity analysis will also calculate the posterior distributions for 2- year event rates 
based upon the observed average day of procedure and compare it to the a priori  
assumption of Day 10 (assuming it takes on an average 10 days for procedure to 
occur).  The fixed value of day 10 is important for the algorithm used at each interim analysis of the adaptive design.

during EXP j subject -days of follow -up in group j, the posterior distribution becomes:

The model is parameterized in terms of subject -days.  This prior has mean 0.[ADDRESS_617989] -year (365 × a ÷ b = 0.016) and has the equivalent of just one subject -day of 
follow -up. Therefore the prior is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_480883].  
 
Once posterior distributions are obtained for each segment, one can calculate the

Pr(πD - πC < 0.0287 |  EVC, EXP C, EV D, EXP D) > 0.988, then the null hypothesis will be 
rejected and the trial will conclude that the relative risk is less than 1.75 and/or risk difference is less than 2. 87%.   
 As long as the trial does not stop for futility, up to four predefined analyses will be performed. The first analysis will occur [ADDRESS_617990] is enrolled and randomized.  A 98.8% posterior probability will be used, this is equivalent to a two- sided equitailed 97.6% CI.  This is to conserve Type I error at 
2.5% -- Type I error can be inflated in three ways in the efficacy part of the trial: 
because the risk ratio or risk difference may be used to demonstrate non- inferiority, 
because multiple same size looks are made, and because 4 possible final analysis between 6 and 24 may be conducted.

the non- inferiority definition is not met by [CONTACT_39780] [ADDRESS_617991] is randomized, (c) the non-inferiority definition is met in one of the 
four analyses described above. Only circumstance (c) results in an efficacy success.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Interim A nalyses 
The interim sample size analyses within the adaptive design will be used to 
determine sample size.  At each interim analysis predictive probabilities of trial success are calculated based upon the current sample size and enrolling to the maximum sample size.  
 
Once [ADDRESS_617992] -years of follow up, EXP G,j, in interval j, for group G = C (control) or D 
(device) for each segment.  Using the informative prior  
 
 λG,j~Γ(a=0.5,b=[ZIP_CODE].25)  
 the current posterior probability distribution for each event rate is calculated  
 
 λG,j|EVG,j,EXPG,j~Γ(a=0.5+EVG,j,b=[ZIP_CODE].25 +EXPG,j) 
 The mildly informative prior has the equivalent of one- half a subject’s worth of 
information with a mean of 0.[ADDRESS_617993] year within each segment 
(365 × 0.5 ÷ [ZIP_CODE].25  =0.[ADDRESS_617994] -year).  These priors are used 
only to help select the sample size – they are not used for the final analysis.  
Again the prior is in patient -days of exposure, but we transform these to 2- year 
event rates in the analysis.  
 
Subjects who have experienced an endpoint event provide complete data. 
Subjects who have not experienced an event inform the posterior distribution through their exposure time. But whether and when such a subject will experience an event remains uncertain, and therefore it has a probability 
distribution. Based on the posterior distributio ns of the 
λG,j at each analysis one 
can find the predictive distributions of the number of events (and their timing) for 
all subjects currently in the trial (by [CONTACT_2939]) if they continue to be tracked.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in whole or in part without the 
express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . This probability is calculated by [CONTACT_480989] λG,j from their respective 
posterior distribution and using a sect of logical statements constructing if and 
when each subject would experience an event within the remaining trial duration.  
Then each s imulation for each ‘completed trial’ can total the number of observed 
events, EV* G (EVG will have been truly observed and the rest imputed) and total 
exposure EXP* G.  Then using this set of pi[INVESTIGATOR_480884], the posterior 
distribution for the 2- year event rate πG, is calculated for each group.  This is 
used to track whether Pr( πD/πC  < 1.75) > 0.988 and/or Pr(πD – πC < 2.87%)  > 
0.988.  This process is repeated [ADDRESS_617995] of integrating 
over the uncertainty present in the current distribution of πj . The proportion of 
simulations in which Pr(πD/πC  < 1.75) > 0.988 and/or Pr( πD – πC < 2.87%) > 0.988 
is the predictiv e probability of demonstrating non- inferiority for efficacy.   
 
Because there may be little long -term follow -up at the early interim analyses it is 
assumed that λC,5=λC,6=λC,7 and λD,5=λD,6=λD,[ADDRESS_617996] sample size.  The final analysis uses the model where each segment has its own distribution.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Primary Safety E ndpoints  and Hypotheses 
The primary safety endpoint  for the ACP study has two components : acute 
safety and long -term safety.  
 a. Acute safety consists of procedure related serious adverse events that qualify as one of the following:  
 
• procedure- related death (i.e., death occurring during the implantation 
procedure).  
• pericardial effusion requiring treatment.  
• device embolization.  
• access site -related bleeding requiring transfusion ≥ 2 units.  
• damage to other cardiac or major non- cardiac cardiovascular 
structures  
 
The acute analysis does not inform the adaptive design in that its probability of success does not affect the adaptive sample size algorithm.  
 
In the acute safety analysis, the rate of device or procedure related serious adverse events from the time of randomization until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480885] a  performance goal (PG)  of 5.0% c hosen 
from the literature.  
 
Let π
DEVICE  be this pre- discharge event rate in the device arm.  
Specifically, the following null and alternative hypotheses will be tested:  
 
ACP Investigational Plan  Page 39 of 130  Revision 06 Amendment  
CL00921 (H)   September  2014  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . H0: πDEVICE  ≥ (PG = 5.0%)   
Ha: πDEVICE  < (PG = 5.0%)  
 
The null hypothesis will be rejected and the performance goal  will be 
considered met if the upper bound of the one- sided confidence interval for 
the device rate is less than 5.0%.  
 
b. Long -term safety events can occur in either the device arm or the control 
arm and consist of the following:  
 1. All-cause death; or 
2. Major bleeding defined as:  
a. Symptomatic intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage; or subdural, subarachnoid, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], or ocular hemorrhage; or  
b. Major non- cerebral bleed- defined as transfusion requi ring ≥ 
2units, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480886]: procedure -related pericardial effusions requiring 
treatment will not be counted as a major non- cerebral bleed  
 Subjects who experience a non- fatal efficacy event are still followed and included 
in the safety analysis.  
 The long -term safety analysis is a two- arm analysis that compares the safety 
events defined above between the device and the control arm.  For both the  
device arm  and the control arm, the events will be evaluated from the time of 
randomization until two years.  This analysis will test for superiority of the device arm versus the control arm.  
 
Let γ
DEVICE  be the long- term safety endpoint rate in the device arm, while γCONTROL  
is the corresponding rate in the control arm. Specifically, the following null and 
alternative hypotheses will be tested:  
 
H0: γDEVICE  / γCONTROL  > 1.0 
Ha: γDEVICE  / γCONTROL  < 1.0     
 The null hypothesis will be rejected and superiority to warfarin therapy will be concluded if the upper bound of the two- sided 98.4% confidence interval for the 
ratio between the device rate and control rate is less than 1.0.  
 To test this, the number of e vents, EVS
G and amount of exposure EXPS G are 
tracked within each group.  Vague gamma priors are employed for the safety event rates in each group G=C for control or D for device.

that have mean 0.[ADDRESS_617997] -year (365 × a ÷ b = 0.086) with the 
equivalent of one subject -day of follow -up.  The posterior distributions become  
 
γG  | EVS  G, EXPS  G ~  Γ(0.0002356 + EVS  G + , 1 + EXPS  G) 
 
Each final analysis calculates the posteriors for the device (G=D) and control 
(G=C) groups and the posterior distribution for the risk ratio γD / γC. If the 
equitailed 9 8.4% confidence interval is less than 1.0, then the long -term safety 
rate is proven superior to control.  This is the equivalent of Pr( γD / γC < 1.0) > 
0.992. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Long-term Safety Interim A nalyses 
Similar to the primary efficacy endpoint, an interim analysis is performed to determine the long-term safety. This analysis will be performed after [ADDRESS_617998] -years of follow up, EXPS G, in each group G = C (control) or D 
(device) for each segment.  Using the informative prior  
 
 γG~Γ(a=0.5,b=2122.093)  
 the current posterior probability distribution for each event rate is calculated  
 
 γG|EVSG,EXPG~Γ(a=0.5+EVSG,b=2122.093 +EXPSG) 
 The mildly informative prior has the equivalent of one- half a subjects worth of 
information with a mean of 0.[ADDRESS_617999] year (365 × 0.5 ÷ 
2122.093=0.[ADDRESS_618000] -year).  These priors assist in selecting the 
sample size and are not used for the final analysis.  
 
Subjects who have experienced a long -term safety endpoint event provide 
complete data. Subjects who have not experienced such event inform the posterior distribution through their exposure time. But whether and when such a subject will experience an event remains uncertain, and therefore it has a 
probability distribution. Based on the posterior distributions of the 
γG at each 
analysis the predictive distributions of the number of safety events (and their 
timing) can be determined. This determination can be made for all subjects currently in the trial (by [CONTACT_2939]) if they continue to be tracked.  
 
This probability is calculated by [CONTACT_480990] γG from its respective posterior 
distribution at the current interim analysis, then times to safety events are

may be censored as time left in trial is accounted for). Using this full dataset imagining the subjects are tracked for an additional time period, one can 
calculate the total num ber of events EVS*
G and exposure time EXPS* G in each 
group.  Once this is obtained, a final analysis is perf ormed using the methods 
described in the previous section and calculate the Pr( γD/γC < 1.0).  If this value is 
greater than  0.992 it predicts a win on the long -term safety endpoint.  Repeating 
this process 1000 times at each interim analysis estimates the predictive 
probability of demonstrating long -term safety superiority.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Predictive Probability C alculations  
 
The predictive probabilities of meeting the non- inferiority efficacy goal and 
superiority safety goal are calculated at each interim analysis as described in sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  Likewise the joint predictive probability of achieving the efficacy and safety goals are calculated assuming accrual stops at the current sample size and if it continues to the maximum sample size.  
 
Pn,n is the predictive probability of demonstrating non- inferiority (via the risk ratio 
OR the risk difference) for efficacy AND superiority for long -term safety if the 
study stops accruing subjects and wait for [ADDRESS_618001]  maximum, and then tracking all subjects another 2- years, , the predictive 
probability Pn,3000 of demonstrating non -inferiority (via the risk ratio OR the risk 
difference) for efficacy AND superiority for long -term safety can be calculated.  
 
If P n,n is large, then there is a high probability t hat stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480887] a final analysis that demonstrates sufficient efficacy and long -term safety.   If P
n,n > Sn (as shown in 
Table 1 ) then the DSMB and/or CEC is informed that the algorithm indicates that 
accrual should stop.  
 
If P n,3000 < Fn, then there is a small chance of trial success even if the study runs 
to its maximum sample size and again the DSMB/CEC will be informed that the algorithm indicates that the trial should stop for futility. The subjects will be informed of this circumstance and enrollment will end.  Enrolled subjects will be 
followed for a total of additional two years.   
 
If F n < Pn,3000 and Pn,n > Sn, the enrolling of subjects continues. Another sample 
size re -estimation will be performed once another 50 subjects are enrolled.  
Sample size analyses continue every 50 subjects until Pn,n > Sn, or Pn,3000 < Fn, or 
the maximum number of subjects, 3000, is reached.

performed every [ADDRESS_618002] patient is enrolled.  
 
2.15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  (REFER TO APPENDIX D)  
Three comparisons for secondary endpoints will be made between the OMT 
control group and the device group at the end of the trial. The secondary endpoints of rate of TIA and asymptomatic intr acerebral or intraventricular 
hemorrhage will be considered for labeling . Therefore a Type I error rate of 
0.05/2 =.025 for each of these two endpoint analysis will be used.  
 
• Rate of Transient Ischemic Attacks - The rate of TIAs will be compared 
between the device arm and control arm and tested for significance.  The null 
and alternative hypotheses for this comparison are given below:  
 
           H
0:  τDEVICE  = τCONTROL  
                HA:  τDEVICE  ≠ τCONTROL  
 
where τDEVICE  is the rate of TIAs in the device arm per [ADDRESS_618003] years.  This estimate is made from combining results found in meta-analyses by [CONTACT_480991] (2008) and Reynolds (2004).  The expected rate in the device arm is not known, but expected to be lower since TIAs are correlated with stroke.  
• Asymptomatic intr acerebral or intraventricu lar hemorrhage - The rate of 
asymptomatic intr acerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage will be summarized 
for differences between the device and control arms   
 
           H
0:  φDEVICE  = φCONTROL  
                HA:  φDEVICE  ≠ φCONTROL  
 
where φDEVICE  is the rate of hemorrhage in the device arm per [ADDRESS_618004] with a Type I error of 0.025.   However superiority will only be claimed if 
the observed rate of hemorrhage  in the device arm is less than the control rate.   
The hemorrhage events are expected to be Poisson distributed. However, unlike 
the primary effectiveness endpoint it will be tested for superiority rather than non-
inferiority.

• Atrial fibrillation status - The rate of atrial fibrillation status, defined as 
subjects who progress from paroxysmal to persistent AF, or subjects who 
progress from persistent to permanent AF, will be summarized for differences between the device and control arms.  The rates for each group will be summarized, and the difference between the two expressed as an estimate with a corresponding two sided 95% confidence interval. This endpoint will not be considered for labeling purposes.  
 While the above endpoints will compare the two treatment arms, the following endpoints will only be assessed in the device arm.  They will be summarized as estimated rates with corresponding two sided 95% confidence intervals.  No formal hypotheses will be performed for these tests.  
 
• Device or Procedure Related Adverse Events - The rate of the following 
device or procedure related adverse event components will be summarized.  However confidence intervals will only be summarized for the composite rate, that is, for the percentage of subjects who experience any one of these events.  
 
• Device embolization  
• Myocardial perforation (hemopericardium) or any pericardial effusion requiring drainage 
• Endocarditis  
• Thrombus on device  
 
• In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480852]:  Successful implantation of the ACP with 
no in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480888]  
 • “Day 45” clinical success:  In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480852], closure of LAA 
documented at Day 45 TEE, no ischemic stroke or peripheral 
thromboembolism, and discontinuation of warfarin or dabigatran  
 
• Long-term clinical success:  In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480852], closure of 
LAA documented at Day 45 TEE, no ischemic stroke or peripheral 
thromboembolism, and sustained discontinuation of warfarin  or dabigatran 
(without temporary re- administration  of warfarin or dabigatran) at last 
available follow -up.  Subjects who continue or restart  warfarin  or dabigatran 
due to medical necessity (e.g. for DVT treatment) rather than LAA closure 
status will not b e considered device failures for the purpose of this analysis.  
 
• Technical Success and Complete Closure - The secondary endpoints of 
technical success, and complete closure will only be evaluated in the device arm and will each be summarized as a point estimate with a corresponding

2.15.5 Derivation of the operating characteristics  for both device and  control 
 arms 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Effectiveness  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Primary Effectiveness - Control 
The Bayesian simulation models for the current study design require two-year rate estimates for effectiveness analysis and one- year rates for 
safety.  
 The two -year rate for the control effectiveness endpoint of ischemic 
stroke, and peripheral thromboembolism was derived from a literature review. There were three primary sources (Table 2) used for determining 
this rate.  
 The first source was the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480889] (NEJM 2009). This study compared the primary outcom e of 
stroke and systemic embolization in subjects  randomized between 
warfarin and either 110 mg or 150 mg of dabigatran. Connolly, 2009 reported the following endpoints among 12,098 subjects (randomized to warfarin or 150mg dabigatran).  
 Primary Efficacy – (n=6022 warfarin) = 2.55% (two years)  
Primary Efficacy – (n=6076 dabigatran) = 2.12% (two years)  
 The second source was the ARISTOTLE trial (Granger et al, NEJM 2011), which reported the following endpoint component rates among 9081 control subjects (randomized to warfarin).  
 Primary Efficacy – (n=9081 warfarin) = 2.27% (two years)  
 The third source was the ROCKET AF trial (Patel et al, NEJM 2011), which reported the following endpoint component rates among 7133 control subjects (randomized to warfarin).  
 Primary Efficacy – (n=7133 warfarin) = 3.81% (two years)

ψIn the ROCKET AF trial, primary efficacy endpoints in the Intent -to-treat cohort were reported only in a 
composite form. “Safety Population” effectiveness data reported in document #EDMS -ERI-
24510755:2.0 Advisory Committee Briefing Document was used to determine the proportion of the 
overall rate represented by [CONTACT_480993] (ischemic/unknown stroke = 71%; hemorrhagic 
stroke=20%; and systemic embolization = 9%). These proportions were applied to the “Intent -to-treat 
population” overall rate (2.42%) to estimate the rate of each component.  
ɸRates listed in table 2  are one year rates

randomized and received a device  
  Ischemic stroke – 1.0 event (six months)  
 Peripheral thromboembolism – 0.0 events (six months)  
 In this phase, one event out of 30 (1/30, 3.3%) occurred over six months of follow up.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in whole or in part without the 
express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . The second source was derived from subjects enrolled in the ACP 
Registry (ACPR) (Park et al), which reported the following endpoint component rates among 197 subjects.  
  Ischemic stroke – 2.0 events (six months)  
 Peripheral thromboembolism – 0.0  (six months)  
 The calculated rate in the ACPR is (2/197) 1.0%.  
 The weighted average of these two trials is 1.32% endpoint events per six months.  To estimate a two- year rate from these six-month endpoints, 
Kaplan- Meier curves were analyzed from the PROTECT AF study 
(SSED). This analysis showed an increase of 124% from six months to two years for the primary effectiveness endpoint. Employing this percent change over time corresponds to an estimated  two-year rate of 2.96%. For 
non-inferiority assumptions 2.95% will be used to match the control 
primary effectiveness estimated rate  from above . 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Safety  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1    Procedural (Acute) Safety -  This analysis compares the 
rate of procedure related serious adverse events (SAE) as listed below, that occur in the device arm  from the time of randomization until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480890] a  performance goal (PG)  chosen from the literature.  The 
endpoint will be considered met if the 96% credible interval  for the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480891]. 
• procedure- related death (i.e., death occurring during the 
implantation procedure).  
• pericardial effusion requiring treatment.  
• device embolization.  
• access site -related bleeding requiring transfusion ≥ 2 units.  
• damage to other cardiac or major non- cardiac cardiovascular 
struc tures  
 
A literature search was conducted in order to establish a PG. The search 
criteria included catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. This criterion was chosen because catheter ablation utilizes transseptal puncture to access the left atrium which is the common technique used to access the left atrial appendage and implant the ACP device. The search included electrophysiologic (EP) studies and summaries of safety and effectiveness (SSED).  
 In all, 29 sources (27 published articles and two SSEDs) were examined 
for reported complications of procedure related SAE (as listed above). Serious Adverse Events of procedure- related death (i.e., death occurring

transfusion ≥ [ADDRESS_618006] ‘pericardial effusion requiring treatment’ and ‘Damage to other cardiac or 
major non- cardiac cardiovascular structures’ the following criteria were 
used:  
• Pericardial effusion requiring treatment included pericardial effusions 
that required pericardiocentesis and cardiac tamponade . Also 
included within this category are pericardial effusions that were medically treated, or where treatment was not specified.  Please note 
this category does not include effusions that were spontaneously resolved.  
• Damage to other cardiac or major non- cardiac cardiovascular 
structures included serious complications requiring more than conservative medical attention such as pleural effusion, pneumo- or 
hemothorax, lung injury , pulmonary edema, valve damage, vascular injury including arteriovenous fistulae requiring surgical intervention, aortic dissection, ,aortic root puncture and coronary sinus perforation.  
 The average weighted complication rate derived from literature Meta-
analysis  is provided in Table 3.

 Therefore a performance goal of 5% is being established, against which the acute safety profile of the ACP device will be compared. A performance goal of 5% provides confidence that it adequately 
represents a threshold between event rates observed in literature and is clinically relevant. The ACP trial will meet its acute safety success if the two-sided 95% credible interval lies entirely below this PG.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Long-Term Safety  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Long-term Safety – Control

endpoint determination.  
In sum:  
Safety event rates from the OAC literature listed the following one- year 
event rates:  
 
 RE-LY treatment arm (N=6076, dabigatran) = 6.75%  
 RE-LY control arm (N=6022, warfarin) = 7.49%  
 ARISTOTLE control arm (N=9081, warfarin) = 7.03%  
 ROCKET AF control arm (N= 7133, warfarin) = 8.37%  
 
The weighted average of these three trials is 7.17% (assuming a 50% adoption rate of dabigatran) endpoint events per year.  
 The distribution of dabigatran and warfarin use will be monitored during 
the course of the trial. If a significant deviation from the expected adoption rate is observed,  its potential impact will be assessed and appropriate 
adjustments to base rates and sample size calculations may be re- visited 
and/or re- modeled as appropriate.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Long-term Safety – Device 
The one -year rate for the device safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_480892]-cause mortality  was also derived from published experience to-
date with the ACP  device. 
 
 Safety endpoints from the feasibility phase were:  
 1/30 (3.3%) (six months)  
  Safety endpoints from the ACP Registry (ACPR) were:  
 10/197 (5.1%) (six months)  
 The weighted average of these two trials is 4.85% endpoint events per six months. To estimate a one- year rate from these six -month endpoints, 
Kaplan- Meier curves were analyzed from the PROTECT AF study 
(SSED). This analysis showed an increase of 6.2% from six months to one year for the primary safety endpoint. Employing this percent change over time corresponds to a one- year rate of 5.15%, the primary rate used for 
the calculations of the device safety endpoint.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Operating C haracteristics, Power, and Type I E rror 
For the Bayesian adaptive design the power will be calculated using simulations. Besides design features described above, three other factors contribute to the study’s power: the true unknown event rate, the unknown 
accrual rate, and the lost -to-follow -up rate observed in study subjects. The 
accrual rate can be controlled to some extent by [CONTACT_480994] 49 of 130  Revision 06 Amendment

inclusion criteria.  
 To find operating characteristics, 1000 trials  are simulated from each of 10 
different scenarios.  To simulate trials the following assumptions are made about the data- generating process.  These are necessary to estimate 
operating characteristics but will not be used in the analysis of the actual trial. 
 
 Times to efficacy events have an exponential distribution within each time period in both the device and control arms with the specified rate  
 Times to safety events have an exponential distribution in both the device and control arms with the specified event rate  
 There is 5% yearly lost -to-follow -up.   
 Accrual is constant 25 subjects per month. (While accrual is not 
expected to be constant during the ACP trial, it is expected to be lower 
earlier and then stabilize after all sites have begun enrollment.  If this is the case, then early subjects will have greater follow -up and the power 
calculations below will be underestimates.)  
 Operating characteristics have been calculated for a variety of accrual rates, efficacy event rates and safety event rates.  
 Tables 4a and 4b illustrate the 10 scenarios used. Each row shows one 
parameter used to generate trial data used in the simulations.  
 Scenarios 1- 4 in Table 4a represent Scenarios in the null space where 
Type I error should be 2.5% or less.  Scenario [ADDRESS_618007].  Scenario 4 shows the Type I error rate for the expected control event rate for efficacy.  The six scenarios in Table 4b illustrate cases where the ACP device is non-
inferior for efficacy and superior for safety.

  The second line in each scenario shows the same success probabilities if the analysis is repeated using an as -treated analysis that censors subjects  randomized to the device who 
crossover and use warfarin 45 days or more after their procedure.  Simulations verify that 
adequate power is maintained to interpret the primary effectiveness endpoint. For a detailed calculation please refer to the second line (AT = As Treated) under each scenario in Table 5. 
Here we assume 9% of subjects crossover imme diately, 12.5% are censored at 45- days, then  
5% are censored per year.  
  
Scenarios 1- 4 and show that Type I errors rate are all ≤2.5% (in bold).  In these situations trials 
stop early for futility 88 – 100% of the time.  The same “Power” column shows power s for the 
safe and efficacious scenarios.  For example Scenario 5, the expected scenario, has 91% 
power.  For other safe (superior) and efficacious (non- inferior) scenarios the trial offers ≥89% 
power.  
 In this expected scenario (5) the average sample size is 1880 subjects  and the trial stops early 
for predicted success 88% of the time.  The average trial size in the null cases is 906- 1919.  
 While the trial’s sample size may range from 400 to 3000 subjects, the average trial size, 
which varies by [CONTACT_89665], ranges from 906 to 2350 subjects  for the scenarios shown here.

o Rate of Transient Ischemic Attacks  
o Asympt omatic intr acerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage  
 
All of the above endpoints will contain inferential findings of either an acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis (for primary endpoints), a p- value for the difference 
between treatments (for secondary endpoints tested in both treatment arms). Endpoints 
not listed above will not be summarized in product labeling.  
  2.15.7 Primary Analysis  (REFER TO APPENDIX D)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intent-to-Treat Analyses
 
Subjects are considered enrolled in the ACP clinical trial after informed consent and HIPAA authorization form or any other applicable permission form required by [CONTACT_480996].  All primary 
endpoint analyses will be based on the “intent -to-treat” principle.  Specifically, 
subjects will be considered part of the intent -to-treat analysis population as long 
as they are randomized into the study, with no adjustment made for whether

randomization.    
 2.15.8 Secondary Analyses (REFER TO APPENDIX D)  
 
In addition to the intent -to-treat analysis, secondary analyses will be performed 
on the three following analysis populations  (two per protocol analyses and one 
as-treated) : 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Per Protocol Analysis 
a. This analysis does not count subjects who did not follow the protocol.   
 
 This cohort is defined as all subjects who:  
• Receive the device (for subjects in the device arm) or were randomized to receive the device but did not receive the device due to a procedural adverse event or adverse event related to the pre-procedural termination 
of warfarin or dabigatran, such as ischemic stroke or thrombus observed in the left atrium/atrial appendage at or prior to the implant procedure.  
• As directed by [CONTACT_760], discontinue OMT(for subjects in the device arm) given the absence of flow or a minimal flow of ≤3mm into the LAA, 
as demonstrated by [CONTACT_424522], or continue OMT due to more than minimal flow present on TEE.  
• Are started on and comply with warfarin or dabigatran use (device and control  arms).  
• Achieve and maintain a therapeutic INR (subjects in device and control  
arms who are on warfarin therapy).  Have at least monthly monitoring 
with at least 70% of visits made and 60% time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0).  
 
Subjects  (device and control arms)  who s witch  to an alternative 
anticoagulant approved for the treatment of atrial fibrillation other than 
warfarin or dabigatran will be excluded from this analysis . 
 b. Assessment of Proof of C oncept: This analysis will be conducted to assess 
outcomes in subjects who receive the ACP device and follow the protocol -
mandated post implant medication regimen compared to subjects treated appropriately with warfarin or dabigatran. This analysis does not count subjects who are randomized to device but do not receive a device, device subjects with LAA closure who fail to stop warfarin or dabigatran at day 45, and all subjects) who deviate from therapeutic warfarin administration and monitoring (For device subjects this is from day of procedure to day [ADDRESS_618012]).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in whole or in part without the 
express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . This cohort is defined as : 
 
• Receive the device (for subjects in the device arm).  
• As directed by [CONTACT_760], discontinue warfarin or dabigatran (for 
subjects in the device arm) given the absence of flow or a minimal flow of ≤3mm into the LAA, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_424522].  
• Are started on and comply with warfarin or dabigatran use (device and control arms).  
• Achieve and maintain a therapeutic INR (f or subjects on warfarin in 
device and control arms).  At least monthly monitoring with at least 70% 
of visits made and 60% time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0- 3.0). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] As Treated Analysis 
Device subjects unable to discontinue OMT therapy may bias the intent to treat 
analysis toward success on the efficacy endpoint due to a sizable number of subjects in each group receiving similar treatment (success may be more difficult to achieve, however, on the safety superiority endpoint).  In order to address this possibi lity, an “as treated” analysis will be performed that will restrict analysis of 
device subjects to subjects who generally experience long -term success.  This 
analysis will compare subjects in the control arm, where applicable, against subjects in the device arm  which includes:  
 
• Received the device, discontinue OMT at six months and subsequently continue to remain off of OMT  (analyzed as device)  
• Subjects randomized to the control arm and continue a  protocol OMT  
(analyzed as control)  
• Subjects who are randomized to the device arm, never receive a device and continue a protocol OMT  (analyzed as control)  
 This analysis will not necessarily disqualify subjects who violate one of the above criteria but instead will censor subjects at the earliest time point  where they no 
longer comply with the above criteria.  The primary efficacy and safety analyses will be redone using these populations and checked for level of agreement with the intent to treat population.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analyses General Consideratio ns 
Other deviations that justify exclusion may be discovered as the trial progresses.  These deviations will also disqualify subjects from the secondary analyses and will be discussed explicitly in the study’s statistical analysis plan.  
 Subjects who are n on-compliant or lost to follow -up after the procedure or after 
there is absence of flow or a minimal flow of ≤3mm into the LAA, as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_424522],  will not be entirely excluded from the secondary analyses. Rather, information obtained before the poin t of non -compliance will be

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . preserved in the analyses, with subsequent information excluded.  In all 
likelihood, however, subjects who are lost to follow -up will have no subsequent 
information to exclude.  
 The intent -to-treat and secondary analyses will be compared for level of 
agreement. It is expected that the two subject populations will be similar; however, any substantial differences between the two will be analyzed appropriately to elucidate the cause of these differences.  
 
2.15.9 Other Analyses (REFER TO APPENDIX D)  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analysis 
Separate analyses will be conducted for the device v ersus  warfarin and device 
vs. dabigatran arms.  Because subjects are stratified at or before randomization 
subjects  randomized to device will have a label for whether they would have 
been prescribed warfarin or dabigatran had they been randomized to OMT.  The primary efficacy and safety analyses will be performed in both groups.  Parameter estimates for the risk differ ence and risk ratios for efficacy and safety 
and 95% confidence intervals will be provided. No formal statistical test will be performed since the trial is not powered to meet the objectives in each subgroup.  
 Furthermore the subgroup analysis will be repeated in the further sub- divided 
groups of subjects  receiving just warfarin, just dabigatran, warfarin plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
and dabigatran plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  Additional subgroup analysis will be repeated for 
baseline aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480863].  
 This subgroup analysis serves a sensitivity analysis to better understand the subject  populations in which the ACP devices offers the best or most robust 
benefit.  
 Gender analysis will also be performed to provide the results of the primary endpoints and inferential secondary endpoints for male/female subgroups.  
 An additional analysis of the major safety and effectiveness outcomes measured 
as a function of CHADS(2) -VASC  score will be performed.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events C ategorization  
Adverse Events will be categorized as serious adverse event (SAE),  adverse 
event, or observation, as well as whether each SAE is device and/or procedure related, with separate tables reporting the same.  In each table, SAE and adverse events will be summarized between the two treatment arms and compared for significant differences.  
 
In addition, data for each subject in the trial who experienced a neurologic or embolic event, a bleeding event, or device associated thrombus will be

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . summarized.  This will detail warfarin use, the last recorded INR, dabigatran 
use, and  antiplatelet medication use at the time of the event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Residual Flow in LAA  
Data on all subjects in whom there is absence of flow or a minimal flow of ≤3mm 
into the LAA, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_480997] 45 days will be summarized.  Since this criterion is only attained in the device arm, this analysis will only be performed on the subjects in the device arm, and will not involve comparisons between the two treatment arms. Additionally, data on subjects in the device arm with flow of less than or equal to 3mm who did not discontinue warfarin or dabigatran will be 
summarized.  This will include the reasons the subjects did not discontinue warfarin  or dabigatran.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Primary Effectiveness Component A nalysis 
Although the primary effectiveness endpoint for the study is the combined rate of ischemic stroke, and peripheral thromboembolism, each component rate will be analyzed separately for differences between the treatment arms.  P -values will 
be calculated for each rate.  However, since the study is not powered to examine 
the component differences, it is possible that overall study success may occur without significant differences among the component rates. In  addition, these 
component rates will be summarized at separate time points.  Each will be summarized at 45 days, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months and annually.  In addition to the primary endpoint analysis, the composite endpoint of ischemic stroke and thromboembolism will be summarized at 45 days, 6 months, 1 y ear, 18 months, 
and annually.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Poolability Analysis  
Poolability of results across sites will be analyzed to determine if differences exist among the primary safety endpoints and to determine if potential predictive covariates differ.  For this poolability analysis, all centers will be compared for site differences with no centers combined in the analysis.  Fisher’s exact test will be used to test for comparability in terms of the primary endpoints and in terms of variables such as gender, medical history, and risk factors.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Center E ffect 
All of the primary and secondary analyses described above, as well as any description of baseline covariates, will be broken down by [CONTACT_480998].  
 Other analysis, such as the random effect model, may be performed to assess the possible site effect on the primary endpoints.  
  [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Demographics  
Summary statistics will be generated for all relevant demographic, medical history, and risk factor variables, and will consist of numbers and percentages of 
ACP Investigational Plan  Page 61 of 130  Revision 06 Amendment  
CL00921 (H)   September  2014  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in whole or in part without the 
express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . responses in each category for discrete measures, and of means, standard 
deviations, number of observations, minimums, maximums, and 95% confidence intervals, as appropriate, for continuous measures.  In addition, adverse ev ent 
types will be summarized across treatment arms and analyzed for treatment differences for adjudicated events.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] CHADS
2 Score Distribution  
Since the ACP trial is a randomized clinical trial, there is not expected to be a difference in baseline (at the time of enrollment) CHADS score between the two treatment arms.  However, the scores will be compared and tested for a significant treatment effect.  If such an effect is found, an adjustment involving stratification will be made to the primary endpoint analysis.  No adjustment will be made for CHADS
[ADDRESS_618013] that the trial is attempting to measure.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Time within therapeutic range (TTR) for INR for subjects 
assigned to warfarin  
TTR will be calculated using the method employed in the ACTIVE W trial (Circulation, 2008).  Specifically, for each subject the total number of days of TTR will be calculated and  divided by [CONTACT_480999].  Since the recording of INR after achieving therapeutic range will generally occur monthly, linear interpolation will be used to determine the number of TTR days in cases where one observation is within range while the preceding or subsequent observation is out of range.  
 
• The ACTIVE W trial excluded certain follow -up days from this TTR 
calculation.  These exclusions will also be followed in the ACP trial.  The 
trial’s calculation of TTR will not use follow -up data points which include:  
 
• Within the first seven days after warfarin is started or re- started  
• After permanent discontinuation of warfarin  
• After five days from temporary discontinuation of warfarin  
 Analys es will also be performed within the device and control arms to determine 
the percentage of time the subjects in each group were on warfarin and the percentage of time subjects were on anti -platelet medications.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Effect of Learning C urve 
An analysis will also be made to assess the “learning curve” among physicians who implant the ACP device.  It is hypothesized that the rate of serious adverse events and technical success may be a function of an operator’s experience with the ACP procedure.  In order to assess this, each operator’s procedures will be categorized in groups of five according to the order in which the procedures occurred.  These groups will be compared against each other in order to compare the rate of device related and procedure related adverse events.  In 
ACP Investigational Plan  Page 62 of 130  Revision 06 Amendment  
CL00921 (H)   September  2014  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in whole or in part without the 
express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . addition to this physician specific comparison, the groups will be pooled among 
all physicians in order to examine a global association of these rates with procedure order.  Procedures may be categorized into larger groups,  or other 
longitudinal analyses may be performed, if suggested by [CONTACT_26739].  
 The analysis of primary endpoint events over time could potentially be sensitive to the overall length of follow -up among subjects, and therefore dependent on the 
number of subjects at each level of follow -up.  However, this is not expected to 
have a major impact on the analysis of the ACP Clinical Trial.  
 There are four main reasons for this.   First of all, the primary endpoint (events 
per [ADDRESS_618014] years) is already normalized for total follow -up, and thus the 
major contributor of follow -up time to the number of endpoint events would be 
eliminated.  In addition, enrollment into the trial is not based on an index event or any other event after which endpoint events are i mmediatel y likely to 
occur.  Also, there is no evidence of substantial increase or decrease in the 
endpoint component rates over time in nonvalvular AF subjects on warfarin.   Finally, since the trial is randomized, any departures from homogeneity 
over time would likely be distributed across the two treatment arms.  
 Although the follow -up times are not expected to differ between the two arms, 
they will be compared for serious departures.  If such departures are found, supplementary analyses will  be performed to exami ne their impact on the 
analysis of the primary endpoint.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Missing Data  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ischemic stroke or peripheral thromboembolism. Subjects  are tracked continually, with data used to calculate and compare 2- year 
event rates in both treatment arms . The 2- year event rates are based upon a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_480893]- constant event rates over the 
course of the study.  
 The primary safety endpoint is long -term composite rates of all -cause mortality 
and major blee d. Rates are compared in a manner similar to the efficacy 
endpoint comparison. Both primary analyses are intent -to-treat analyses where 
subjects  are considered a part of the group to which they were randomized. 
Subject  data is considered a part of the efficacy analysis until  
(a) They experience their first efficacy event,  
(b) They die,  
(c) They become lost -to-follow -up, or  
(d) The study ends.  
 
All subjects  are tracked until the study ends rather than being followed for a fixed 
maximum time period (e.g. 2 years). Subjects  meeting criteria (a) are treated as 
experiencing an event. Subjects  first reaching (b), (c), or (d) are considered 
censored.  
ACP Investigational Plan  Page 63 of 130  Revision 06 Amendment  
CL00921 (H)   September  2014  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC .  
Likewise subjects  contribute data to the safety analysis until  
(a) They experience a safety event (including death),  
(b) They become lost -to-follow -up, or  
(c) The study ends  
 
Subjects  reaching (b) or (c) before experiencing an event are considered 
censored. Subjects  who experience a non- fatal event contributing toward the 
efficacy endpoint are still followed for safety and vice versa. The operating 
characteristics in the original design document and those shown below assume a 5% dropout rate per year in both groups.  
 The primary efficacy and safety analysis assume that all censored subjects  
contribute data until their time of last visit. It is assumed that all censoring is non-informative censoring. If so, the parameter estimates for each group are unbiased. Such an analysis is also assumed during each interim analysis used to 
select the sample size. At the conclus ion of the trial, a variety of sensitivity 
analyses will be performed in case censoring is not non- informative. There is a 
concern that subjects who are lost -to- follow -up may not be non- informatively 
censored.  
 First, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480894] -to-
follow - up rates by [CONTACT_481000]. This will include illustrating the censoring 
pattern by [CONTACT_481001]- Meier curves of time- to-lost-to-follow by [CONTACT_19313]. The 
primary analysis will also be repeated using Bayesian multiple imputation. Using a technique similar to that used at each interim analysis for subjects  being 
tracked, posterior distributions for the event rates will be used to draw event times for all lost -to-follow -up subjects  and to calculate the predictive probability of 
success had the lost -to-follow -up subjects  been tracked until the study’s end. By 
[CONTACT_481002] 10,[ADDRESS_618015] an overall association with the study endpoint. The results of these models will compare the coefficient and 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of the treatment group variable, as well as explore any interactions between baseline covariates and treatment effect. The primary analysis can also be repeated assuming subjects have an event instead of being lost -to-follow -up. 
This is an extreme situation analysis in which assumes that being lost -to-follow -
up is a likely indicator of experiencing an event. Each of these sensitivity analys es will be performed for both the efficacy analysis and the safety analysis, 
in the intent to treat study populations. Sensitivity analyses may be performed for 
other analyses as deemed appropriate.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Worst–case analysis  
Throughout the duration of the ACP clinical trial all efforts will be made to minimize any expected lost to follow -up. For the worst case scenario analysis, we 
will consider subjects in the device group as having events at the time they are declared lost -to-follow -up and subjects in the control group as having their follow -
up end with no event at the time they are declared lost -to-follow -up. 
This analysis will be performed once for the efficacy analysis and once for the safety analysis.  
 For the efficacy analysis, a worst case scenario dataset will be created. This dataset will consist of:  
• Observations which are unchanged for subjects not lost to follow -up or lost 
to follow -up in the control group.  
• Observations which are modified, for subjects lost to follow -up in the 
device group, to events experienced at the time of discontinuation  
 
For the purposes of  the sensitivity analysis, “Lost to follow -up” is defined as any 
subject who discontinues before the trial’s conclusion without an endpoint event, regardless of the reason given for discontinuation.  
 This dataset will then be used with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480896]. Using this dataset, posterior distributions for each group’s 2-year event rate, their ratio, and their difference will be calculated. The primary set of tests will be performed according to protocol.  
 Lost-to-follow -up subjects will be analyzed in an analogous manner in the safety 
analysis. Lost -to-follow- up device group subjects will be considered to have had 
a safety event at the time they were lost. Lost -to-follow -up control group subjects 
will be considered not to have had an event but have their exposure ending at 
the time they are lost to follow -up. Data from all other subjects (subjects that are 
not lost to follow -up) will remain unchanged, with the safety analysis will be 
performed as described in the protocol.  
Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275] - Furthermore we will perform a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_480897].  
 The sufficient statistics for the safety analysis are the total number events (Ev) and the total exposure (Expos) in each group. The primary test for safety is  
 
 
which is equivalent to testing whether the two- sided 9 8.4% credible interval for 
the hazard ratio is entirely less than 1.0.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC .  
The primary analysis will be performed considering lost -to-follow -up subjects as  
censored. For the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275], the exposure times in both groups will be considered fixed.  The number of events in each group can possibly range 
from a minimum of Ev
T and Ev C (the observed number of safety events in the 
treatment and control groups, respectively, assuming lost -to-follow -up subjects 
are censored without events) to Ev T+M T and Ev C+M C (the observed number of 
safety events plus the number of subjects lost-to-follow -up in each group which 
combined with the fixed exposure times assumes  that all lost -to-follow -up 
subjects  had events at the exact time they were considered lost -to-follow- up). 
 We will repeat the safety analysis for every pair of events {Ev
T, Ev T+1, … 
EvT+M T} × {Ev C, Ev C+1, …, Ev C+M C}. We will show a plot that illustrates which 
pairs lead to successful safety claims, Pr( γT / γC < 1.0) ≥ 0.992 shown with green 
dots, and which do not shown with red dots, thus producing a boundary of trials that meet the predetermined safety criteria and those that do not.  
 We will perform a similar analysis for the primary efficacy analysis. This is slightly complicated because the statistical model uses a pi[INVESTIGATOR_480898]. Therefore all events are not exchangeable – they can have slightly different 
effects depending in which segment of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480899].  
 We observe number of events and total exposure time within each treatment group (g) x time period (T) then use these to calculate posterior distributions for each time segment’s event rates, λ
g,T. Then we combine these posterior 
distributions to calculate the posterior distribution for the probability of an event by 2 years for the treatment group  
 
 
and control groups  
 
 
 
Finally we use the posterior distributions for λT and λC to calculate the risk ratio 
and risk difference. If Pr( λD/λC < 1.75) > 0.988 and/or Pr( λD-λC < 2.87%) > 0.[ADDRESS_618016] -to-

follow -up in the final se gment has an event has negligible effect on the final 
posterior probability of non- inferiority. Therefore it is unlikely that assuming an 
event occurs in one segment vs. another will be the difference in meeting or 
failing to meeting the efficacy success c riteria.  
 Nevertheless, we will explore all possibilities. Assuming we observe Ev
T and Ev C 
efficacy events in the treatment and control groups, respectively, and M T and M C 
subjects  are lost -to-follow -up, we will perform the analysis for every pair of 
possible efficacy events: {Ev T, Ev T+1, … Ev T+M T} × {Ev C, Ev C+1, …, Ev C+M C}. 
 Here, however, an event may occur in any one of [ADDRESS_618017] -to-follow -up subjects  will perform the analysis as if the event 
occurred in the 30- 60 day period, and then repeat it assuming it occurred in the 
12-18 day period. Instead of the plot showing a simple green or red for 
successfully meeting the efficacy endpoint v s. failing to meet the efficacy 
endpoint, we will show the proportion of imputed trials (out of 3 possible here) that result in trials demonstrating non- inferiori ty according to the prespecified 
rule. According to our exploration it is unlikely that the placement of a missing event will determine whether or not the success definition is met. The number of event, far mor e than their location, is the determinant.  
 Therefore the final analysis will be presented as a grid showing all possible study outcomes from Ev
T to Ev T+M T treatment events vs. Ev C to Ev C+M C control 
events.  Most points are likely to show simply green (for all possible combinations 
of those event counts meeting the non- inferiority criterion) or red (for all possible 
combinations of those event counts failing to meet the non- inferiority criterion). 
But some po ints may show a proportion indicating the probability that 
combination of treatment and control events results in a successful trial in the rare event that the timing of the assumed events determines success vs. failure.  
 
Version 9.0 or higher of the SAS  statistical software package or R 2.14 or other 
widely accepted statistical software will be used to provide all non- Bayesian 
statistical analyses.

3.1 RISK: BENEFIT ASSESSMENT OF THE DEVICE ARM 
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_618041], drugs, products (latex), or anesthesia; adverse events related to vascular access; and/or adverse events related to catheter manipulation.  Other adverse events associated with cardiac catheterizati ons 
may include, but are not limited to the following; arrhythmia, brachial plexus injury, cardiac arrest, cardiac tamponade, fever, infection, kidney damage, myocardial ischemia/infarction, pericardial effusion, and death. Refer to Section 2.13.[ADDRESS_618042] Risks  
The risks associated with ACP are similar to other implantable cardiac occlusion devices.   Some of the potential risks include but are not limited to those listed below:  
 
• Device Embolization  
Device embolization may occur if an improper device size is used or the device is incorrectly seated. If the device embolizes prior to release, it can be partially pulled inside the delivery catheter for repositioning.  If the device embolizes after release, it should be removed as soon as possible; surgery may be necessary.  
 
• Bacterial Endocarditis  
The ACP is a foreign body which will be permanently implanted and therefore 
subjects are at risk of bacterial endocarditis.  Bacterial endocarditis may contribute to heart failure, arrhythmias, damage to the heart muscle and blood clots. If left untreated, bacterial endocarditis can lead to death.  
 
• Device Thrombus  
Thrombus formation on the device could potentially result in subsequent embolization, infectious endocarditis, arrhythmias, stroke/TIA, or death.  
 
• Pericardial Effusion  
ACP may perforate the visceral pericardium and lead to accumulation of fluid 
in the pericardial cavity which may result in cardiac tamponade.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in whole or in part without the 
express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . • Cardiac Tamponade  
If pericardial effusion becomes sufficiently large, cardiac contractility maybe 
compromised leading to low cardiac output and possibly cardiogenic shock or death.  
 
• Allergic device reaction 
 Idiosyncratic reaction to the device implanted.  
 
• Nickel sensitization  
 Alteration of the responsiveness of the body to nickel  
 
• Carcinogenicity  
Potential carcinogenicity risk. The ACP device consists of a nickel -titanium  
alloy.  In  vitro testing has demonstrated that that nickel is released from this 
device for a minimum of [ADDRESS_618043] also been 
associated with carcinogenicity (ability to cause cancer) in animal models. In humans, carcinogenicity has been demonstrated only through an inhalation route (breathing nickel in), which will not occur with this procedure. 
 
3.1.3 Potential Benefits  
The primary potential benefit is that the subjects may not need to be on long -term 
warfarin or dabigatran therapy and thus will not be exposed to its associated 
complications.  In addition, the ACP will be implanted via transcatheter approach.  Subjects who receive the device may also decrease the associated risk of thromboembolism.  
 
3.2 RISK: BENEFIT ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTROL ARM  
3.2.[ADDRESS_618044] of warfarin is skin necrosis.  
  Warfarin is associated with a 2.2% increased risk of major fatal or nonfatal bleeding, and 7.7% increase in minor hemorrhagic complications per year (Gullov 1994).

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC .  
3.2.2 Risks Associated With Dabigatran  
 
Dabigatran increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and sometimes fatal bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti -platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) ). 
 Dabigatran’s anticoagulant activity and half -life are increased in subjects with renal 
impairment.  
 A specific reversal agent for dabigatran is not available.  
 
3.2.3 Risks of Concomitant Use of OACs and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480915]/or di sease type to be 
treated. Current professional society guidelines for use of concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480916] / antiplatelet therapy for subjects likely to be treated under this clinical protocol are summarized in the table below.

aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], the dose intensity must be carefully monitored. For further information refer to the package insert for warfarin (Coumadin
® product insert, Bristol -Myers Squibb, 
293US11PBS01503).  
 Based on available published literature, i.e. RE-LY trial (Connolly et al 2009),  the 
concomitant use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480927] 1.07% but may also be associated with increased risk I bleeding. This included 20- 30% of patients taking concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480928]. There may also be an associated risk of increased bleeding. Among patients receiving concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480929] -LY, an increased risk of 
major bleeding was observed (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.55– 2.00), which was similar for 
dabigatran 110 mg, 150 mg or warfarin (Dans 2011).  Therefore, similar caution is recommen ded for treating physicians considering co- administration of dabigatran with 
other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.   
 
3.2.4 Potential Benefit  
 The potential benefit is that the information obtained from this study may change future treatment of subjects with nonvalvular AF.  
3.3 MINIMIZING THE RISKS  
 To minimize potential clinical risks to subjects participating in this  clinical trial:

Informed Consent Template  
AMPLATZER ™ Cardiac Plug (ACP) Clinical Study  
 
 
Patient Consent Form authorizing participation in a clinical research trial with assignment to either treatment with the device under clinical investigation, or warfarin or dabigatran (current standard of care) in patients with non- valvular atrial fibrillation.  
 Participant’s Name:            
 [CONTACT_1782]:     
 You are being asked to read this form so that you understand the nature of this clinical study and how you might take part in it.  Signing this form will show that you understand and that you agree to take part in this clinical study. Written informed consent is required before you can take part in this clinical research study.  
 
Why am I being asked to read this form?  
You are being asked to take part in this study because your doctor has told you that you have or have had an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF).  Normally electrical signals from the upper chambers of the heart (atria) travel through to the lower cham bers of the heart 
(ventricles) and cause them to beat in a very regular way.  During AF, the electrical signals in your heart are abnormal, and cause the upper chambers of the heart (atria) to beat too fast and irregularly.  
 This irregular beating of the heart leads to slowing of the blood in the upper chambers.  In the left upper chamber there is a small pouch called the left atrial appendage (LAA).  Slowing of blood, especially in the LAA, may cause blood clots to form.  The clots may move from the LAA an d travel to the brain, causing a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a 
mini- stroke.  These blood clots may also travel to other parts of the body and block blood 
vessels. This clinical research study is designed to evaluate a new device the AMPLATZER 
Cardiac Plug (ACP) to close your LAA which may decrease the chance of a new blood clot forming and moving from the LAA.  
 Your doctor has given you this form to tell you about this research study and to ask whether you are willing to participate in this study. If given, your consent to join this study will be documented by [CONTACT_481018]. Your participation is voluntary. You will also be able to ask questions before you agr ee to be in this 
study.  
 
Why is this study being done?  
The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug. This will be done by [CONTACT_481019].  Warfarin (Coumadin
®) and dabigatran (Pradaxa®) are

common medications given to people who have AF.  
 
Who is the study Sponsor? 
AGA Medical LLC, a U.S. medical device company is the Sponsor of this study and will be 
providing financial support for this clinical study . The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-
investigator(s) in this study are also healthcare providers.  They are interested in the 
knowledge to be gained from this study and in your well -being.  The health care facility and 
investigators will receive financial support for conducting the research.   
 
What is the study device?  
The AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug (ACP) is a self -expanding  device which is made from a nitinol 
(nickel- titanium alloy) mesh and which has a lobe and a disc connected by a central waist. The 
device is designed to prevent blood clots from moving out of the left atrial appendage (LAA).   
The lobe has small stabilizin g wires that help keep the device in place.  The device has fabric 
sewn into the disc and the lobe. This polyester material is the same as that used in other heart devices and by [CONTACT_481020]. The fabric helps stop the flow of blood into the LAA. The device has screw attachments at each end so it can be placed in the heart. The study device sizes range from 16 mm to 30 mm. This device is investigational which means it has not been approved by [CONTACT_481021].

About how many participants will be in the study?  
The study will include up a minimum of [ADDRESS_618050] as part of the study?  
If you decide to participate, you will have medical tests to see if you qualify to be part of the study. During your participation in the study, you may have more medical tests and/or procedures.  Some tests may be done more than once.  
 
Study-Specified Tests/Procedures  
 
Baseline Testing  
You will have the following tests once you sign this form and agree to be in this study. These are common tests for someone w ith atrial fibrillation and might be performed even if you do not 
join this study. You should be aware that some of the tests performed may need to be repeated. You will have a physical exam and be asked questions about your medical and medication history.  
 Blood tests will be  performed to test for abnormal clotting factors and some additional 
standardized blood tests.  A needle will be placed in a vein in your arm or hand and about 10-
12 ml (approximately 2- 3 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn. Some of this blood testing will be 
sent to an outside lab for testing.  If your study doctor indicates you should be taking warfarin, you will need to undergo regular blood tests called the International Normalized Ratio (INR). This will occur at the time of starting this study and then every month (four weeks) to make

 Computed Tomography (CT) Scan is a type of x -ray that provides detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_480934].  For this study, a CT of your head will only be done if you are not able to have a MRI of your head per formed due to medical conditions.  
 Pregnancy test  for all women of childbearing potential will require a urine and/or blood 
sample.  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant throughout the duration of the study should not enter the study.  If you suspect that you have become pregnant during the study, please inform the study coordinator or doctor immediately.  
 Transesophageal echocardiogram  (TEE) is a type of echocardiogram (also called an echo), 
which is an ultrasound test that allows your doctor to look at the chambers of your heart using sound waves.  You will receive medicine that will make you sleep (sedation). During this test, a 
small imaging probe is placed into your mouth and down your esophagus (your swallowing tube) in order to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_480935] a video screen.  Your throat may be a little sore for about one week after the test.

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . Randomization 
If after baseline testing and exams you meet all study requirements, you will be randomly 
assigned to one of two different study groups (the device group  or the medicine group). 
Randomization is the process by [CONTACT_481022] a group (like pulling numbers out of a hat). In this study, you have twice as much chance of being assigned to the device arm as you do to the medicine group.   Once you have signed this form and been 
assigned to a group, you will be officially enrolled in this study. You may not switch groups once assigned so you should be comfortable with the decision to go into either group if you want to participate in this stu dy.  
 
Medicine Group  
If you are randomly assigned to the medicine group, you will continue to take either warfarin or dabigatran also called an oral anticoagulant (medicine used to “thin” your blood). Your doctor will decide the type and amount of medicine that is the best for you.  If you take warfarin, blood 
samples (approximately 2- 3 teaspoons or a finger prick) will be taken at a minimum of every 
month (four weeks) to make sure the right dose of medicine is being given to you.  It is important to follow  your doctor’s instructions while taking blood thinning drugs.  You will not 
have the ACP device implanted in your heart if you are assigned to the medicine group.  In addition, your doctor may also have you take low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 mg/day) with warfarin or 
dabigatran. Carefully follow your doctor’s instructions on these medications. Immediately inform your study doctor any changes in the blood thinning medications you are taking.  
 
Device Group 
If you are randomly assigned to the device group, within 14 days of your randomization, the 
ACP device will be implanted (placed) in your heart to close your LAA. The ACP device will permanently remain in your heart.  
 
Pre-Procedure Medication Change  
If you are assigned to the device group and taking warfarin, you will stop taking warfarin four days before the implant procedure. Your doctor will have you start a new medicine called Lovenox (enoxaparin) two days before the procedure. Lovenox is another type of blood thinning medicine you will take by [CONTACT_481023] (injections). On the day of procedure, you will stop taking Lovenox. This change in medicine is required so that your blood is not too thin during the implant. You will have a blood test within 24 hours prior to the implant. If your blood is too thin, your implant procedure may need to be re- scheduled. Your doctor will provide you 
with more details about this process.  
 Example:  Day 5 is day of procedure:  
• Day 1 – stop warfarin  
• Day 2 – no medications (Lovenox or warfarin)  
• Day 3 – begin Lovenox  
• Day 4 – continue  Lovenox  
• Day 5 - procedure day, no Lovenox (or warfarin)

your implant.  Your doctor will provide you with more details about this process  
  
Implant Procedure  
The implant procedure will occur in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, or “cath lab”.  Conscious sedation (medicine that will make you relaxed and sleepy yet awake) or general anesthesia (medicine that will make you sleep) will be used.  This is a non- surgical procedure 
done using an angiogram  in which a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin and up 
into your heart.  An angiogram is a test using x -rays where a liquid (contrast) is injected into a 
blood vessel which allows your doctor to view pi[INVESTIGATOR_480936]. A catheter is a sterile, flexible, hollow tube that is put into a blood vessel to let fluids go into or out of your body, or to deliver devices to your heart.  After the procedure, you may have some minor pain in the groin area where the catheter was inserted.  
 To help your doctor evaluate your LAA during the procedure, you will also have a transesophagael echocardiogram (TEE).  If a blood clot is found in your heart, your doctor will not proceed with device placement.  If no blood clot is found in your heart, then your doctor will take measurements of your LAA.  The doctor will make a small puncture through the septum, muscular tissue that separates the two sides of the upper heart, in order to gain entry into the upper left heart chamber. An appropriate size ACP device will be passed through the catheter and placed in your LAA.  After your doctor is satisfied with the position of the device and catheter are removed. The procedure will take about 1- 2 hours.  The devic e will remain in your 
heart. Over time, the tissue in your body will cover and grow around the device to further secure (hold) the device in place. If your doctor is unable to place a device you will still come in for follow -up visits for the remainder of the trial.   
 
After the Procedure  
After the procedure but before you are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], you will undergo a follow -
up visit which will include a physical exam, ECG, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A TTE is another type of echocardiogram that uses high- pi[INVESTIGATOR_480937] a transducer (hand- held plastic instrument which looks like a microphone) which is 
placed on different areas of your chest. The transducer pi[INVESTIGATOR_480938] t he different parts of your heart and turns them into moving pi[INVESTIGATOR_480939] a video screen. A TTE is done to verify the position of the device in your heart and to check for any potential complications after the implant. You will  be asked to 
continue to take warfarin or dabigatran after the implant.  
 If you are taking warfarin, you will have INR blood tests to ensure that you are taking the correct amount of medicine. In addition to warfarin, you may also take Lovenox for a short time 
until your INR is in the correct range.  If you are taking dabigatran, follow your doctor’s orders on when to start taking the medicine after you leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 To prevent certain bacterial infections, you may need to take an antibiotic medication during the first 6 months following the placement of the device, especially if you are planning to undergo

for certain procedures.  
 
If you need to have a MRI scan after the implant, it is safe to do under certain conditions. Let your doctor or the technician know that you have an implanted device and show your patient identification card (device ID card).  Also, your ACP device will not set off alarms when going through airport security.  
 
Health Economic Sub- study  
The Sponsor is also conducting a health economic sub- study.  This sub- study will evaluate the 
costs and benefits of treatment. This information is being collected so the Sponsor can understand the cost  effects of the treatment in the ACP study.  During the health economic

The neurological interview which takes place at each visit contains a series of eight short questions about whether you have had any symptoms of a stroke or TIA.  Additional testing may be performed by [CONTACT_481025].   
 If your doctor suspects you may have had a new stroke or TIA, you will have two neurologic assessments (NIHSS and Modified Rankin) and a MRI or CT of your head. The MRI or CT scan must be performed within [ADDRESS_618052] symptoms of a stroke or TIA, you should call 911 or be seen 
immediately by a doctor. Symptoms of stroke or TIA may be one or more of the following:  
 
• Sudden numbness or weakness on the face, arm, leg, especially on one side of the body  
• Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding  
• Sudden trouble se eing in one or both eyes  
• Sudden trouble waking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordinator  
• Sudden, severe headache with no known cause 
 
Let your study doctor know about any symptoms as soon as possible after you are evaluated or receive treatment or are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179881]. Do not wait until your next scheduled 
visit to let the study team know what happened.  Call your study doctor or have a family member do so if you go to the emergency room, are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], or have any procedures at a differen t medical center from where you see your study doctor.  Make sure to inform all heath 
care professionals who treat you outside of the study that you are participating in a medical device trial.  
 
As part of the research study, you will be periodically asked to complete a questionnaire on 
your general well -being (quality of life). This information allows the Sponsor to gather data 
which may impact future health care policy and health insurance coverage of new medical devices.  
 If your study doctor has prescribed warfarin, this study requires that at all times you are taking warfarin; you must have your INR tested every month (4 weeks) until the study is completed or until you are taken off warfarin. This includes in you are taking warfarin in the medicine group or are taking warfarin in the device group. These INR tests are to make sure that your INR is stable and that the warfarin dose you are taking is correct.

express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . For people in the device group and who receive a device, you will  have some additional 
echocardiograms or echoes.  These are being done for a number of different reasons.  
 
1)  Your doctor will use this test to determine that the device is in the correct position, to 
see whether or not there are any clots on the device,  and to look for any changes in 
your heart after the implant.  
 
2)  If your LAA is closed or partially closed (just a little blood flow is seen moving into or out 
of the left atrial appendage) you will be able to stop taking warfarin or dabigatran  
 
3)  Once  your left atrial appendage is closed and depending on the visit, you may have a 
transthoracic echo (chest echo) instead of a transesophageal echo (swallowing tube echo).  
 
The flow chart below shows the requirements for the type of echo you will receive if you are 
randomly assigned to the device group.  The flow chart describes echo assessments starting at 
the 45 day follow -up visit through the remainder of the study and indicates whether or not you 
may be able to discontinue warfarin or dabigatran during the study.

diarrhea. If you are taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480944], there is an 
increased risk of bleeding. Taking blood thinning medications can cause harm to an embryo, fetus or nursing infant. There may be other risks related to medicine used to thin the blood that 
are unknown at this time.  
 
What other risks and discomforts might there be?  
Risks involving nickel : 
• This device is made up of a nickel -titanium alloy (mixture of metals), which is generally 
considered safe.  However, lab testing shows that nickel is released from the implanted device for at least [ADDRESS_618055] an allergic reaction to this device, especially those subjects with a history of reacting to metals such as jewelry, buttons, snaps,  belt buckles, etc.  Some allergic reactions can be 
serious; you should notify your doctor immediately if you have difficulty breathing or inflammation (reddening) of your face or throat.  
• Some subjects may also develop an allergy to nickel if this device is implanted.  
• Some forms of nickel have been associated with carcinogenicity (ability to cause cancer) in animal models.  In humans, carcinogenicity has been demonstrated only through inhalation (breathing in nickel dust), which will not occur with this procedure.  
 
If during the implant procedure (or post -implant) the device were to move out of position, the 
device may need to be removed by a catheterization procedure or surgically (open heart surgery). Cardiac surgery following device placement may be more difficult with additional 
risks.   
 There are also risks involved in the TEE.  The most common risk of having a TEE is a sore throat; other possible risks include bleeding, breathing or heart problems, gagging, vomiting, pain when swallowing, dental injury, and damage or tear to your esophagus.  
 You may experience some brief and /or minor discomfort associated with drawing blood.  For example, you may experience pain or bruising associated with the needle from the blood draw.   Fainting and local infection can also occur although this is rare.  
 There is a risk of exposure to radiation during the x -ray procedures performed during the 
implant procedure (device subjects only). This risk is no different than any other standard cath lab procedure  
 There may be other risks that are unknown at this time.  There may be unknown risks to an 
embryo, fetus or nursing infant if you become pregnant during this study.  
 
What are the possible benefits of being in the study?  
There may be no direct benefit to you for participating in this study. The information obtained 
from your participation may change the future treatment of people with atrial fibrillation.

(ALL views to be provided in the following sequence):   
 
I. TEE Scanning Protocol  (abbreviations listed at end of protocol)  
The following TEE protocol  is recommended to ensure uniformity across clinical study sites. 
TEE studies are to be performed at baseline, during the procedure, at the 45 day and 6 month 
follow -up visits. The TEE study should image the Left Atrium (LA) and Left Atrial Appendage 
(LAA)  in multiple planes (i.e., 0° - ~110°). The purpose of the TEE is to obtain information 
regarding: a) LA/LAA thrombus; b) LAA ostium measurements; c) length distal to the LAA ostium; d) Flow into the LAA and e) to assess for procedural complications, such as device migration, pericardial effusion, etc.  
 II. Adjustment of the ultrasound instrument:  
a. Adjust transmission power (gain) to minimize/eliminate “blooming” of specular reflectors.  
b. Adjust the time gain compensation in such way that the image exhibits uniform 
brightness.  
c. Adjust the color Doppler gain below the point where random color noise appears.  
d. Set pulse repetition frequency with Nyquist velocity for CFD at ~35- 45 cm/sec.  
e. Use a velocity variance map with a “medium” color filter; set color tissue pr iority at a 
level that avoids overlay of color signals onto tissue structures.  
f. Perform TEE at [ADDRESS_618062] sweeps to ensure full coverage of LA/LAA.  
h. Record 3- 5 consecutive beats for all cine- loop images; record at least 3- 5 consecutive 
beats for all Doppler velocity tracings – record these as still frames (provide 2- 3 still 
frames) at 100mm/s sweep speed.  
i. Ensure that the ECG is recorded for all cine- loops a nd still- frame images.  
 
III. TEE imaging study to be obtained in the following views:  
a. The 5- chamber view (Omniplane 0°) with the aortic valve in the center of the screen and 
the LA in the right upper corner.  
• Standard 2D imaging 
• Zoom mode of LA and LAA; place color flow Doppler (CFD) around device to 
document communication between LA and LAA.   (Post procedure only)  
• Zoom mode of LA and LAA; align Pulse Wave (PW) Doppler sample volume to record LAA -LA blood flow.   The PW sample should be placed 0.5 to 1 cm from the 
ostium into the LAA.  
• 2D imaging of LV at mid -papi[INVESTIGATOR_455921] (short axis) , from gastric view.   
b. The high LA/LAA view (Omniplane ~60°)  
Optional views (these may be difficult to obtain in some subjects):  
• Zoom mode of LA and LAA; place CFD around device to document communication

• LA/LAA views; align PW Doppler sample volume to record LAA -LA blood flow.   The 
PW sample should be placed 0.[ADDRESS_618063] (Omniplane ~80- 110°) with LA/LAA in field of view.  
• Zoom mode of LA and LAA; place CFD around device to document communication 
between LA and LAA.  (Post procedure only)  
• Zoom image of LA -LAA; align PW Doppler sample volume to record LAA blood flow.   
The PW sample should be placed 0.[ADDRESS_618064] names should be displayed in the submitted studies.  
 
b. Two-dimensional imaging to be performed in harmonic mode; the ECG tracing should 
be displayed on all images (still frames and cine- loops), clearly showing P wave/QRS 
morphology during the echocardiographic study. Avoid recording extrasystolic (PVC) 
beats . 
 
c. For all spectral Doppler velocities, please use a display speed of 100 mm/sec, and optimize the velocity profile by [CONTACT_481044].  
 
d. Clinical sites should retain a digital copy of the echocardiographic study in DICOM and 
the study should be analyzed locally. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory WILL NOT return submitted studies. An echocardiographic analysis WILL NOT be provided 
by [CONTACT_481045]. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory Report will only be used for the purposes of the ACP study and NOT for diagnosis and/or clinical management of subjects enrolled in the ACP study.  
 
V. Variables to be recorded by [CONTACT_80935]  
a. Thrombus in the LA and/or LAA  
b. LAA ostium measurements  
c. Length distal to the LAA ostium  
d. Spontaneous Echo Contrast (SEC) in the LA  
e. Thrombus in the RA and/or RAA  
f. Spontaneous Echo Contrast (SEC) in the RA  
g. LAA- LA communication/flow (see E below)  
h. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF )

2.15.3 Study Design 
 
The study as designed was intended to determine the difference in efficacy and safety between the device and control arm (subjects treated with OMT).  
 There were three primary endpoints and hypotheses intended to be evaluated in the ACP clinical trial; these will no longer be analyzed as specified in the original trial protocol, rather, will be summarized as below:   
  1. From:  An efficacy endpoint which compares the 2- year event rates of 
ischemic stroke and peripheral thromboembolism.  This is a non- inferiority 
analysis where the device will be deemed efficacious if the risk ratio is < 1.75 or the risk difference in two years event rates is < 2.87.  
 To:  This objective will not be analyzed as specified above.  A summary of 
ischemic  strokes and peripheral thromboembolism reported through 2 years  of 
follow -up wi ll be provided using descriptive statistics .   
 2. From:  A long -term safety endpoint which compares long -term composite rates 
of all -cause mortality and major bleed.  This is a superiority analysis where the

superior to the safety event rate in the control arm (OMT).  
 To:  This objective will not be analyzed as specified above.  A summary of all-
cause mortality and major bleeds reported through 2 years of follow -up will be 
provided using descriptive statistics.    
 3. From: An acute safety (short -term) endpoint which compares the rate of device 
or procedure related serious adverse events against a performance goal (PG). If this rate is less than 5%, the device is considered to have met the acute safety endpoint.  
 To:  This objective will not be analyzed as specified.  A summary of the device or 
procedure related serious adverse events reported through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480958].   
 2.15.4 A nalysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 From:  Three comparisons for secondary endpoints will be made between OMT control group and the device group at the end of the trial.  Secondary endpoints include: rate of transient ischemic attacks, asymptomatic int racerebral or 
intraventricular hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation status, device or procedure related adverse events, in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480852], Day 45 clinical success, long -
term clinical success, technical success and complete closure.  To:  The following s econdary endpoints will not be analyzed: rate of transient 
ischemic attacks, asymptomatic int racerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage, 
atrial fibrillation status, device or procedure related adverse events, in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480959], Day 45 clinical success, long -term clinical success, technical 
success and complete closure.  2.15.6 Endpoints and Labeling  
 From:  The following primary and secondary endpoints will be included in product labeling for the ACP device.   
• Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
• Primary Safety Endpoint  
• Secondary Endpoints  
 
To:  The endpoints will no longer be analyzed and hence no labeling claims are 
intended to be made.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
© 2012 –AGA Medical LLC: All rights reserved.  No portion of this work may be reproduced in 
whole or in part without the express written permission of AGA Medical LLC . From:  Intent -to-treat analysis - Subjects are considered enrolled in the ACP 
clinical trial after informed consent and HIPAA authorization form or any other 
applicable permission form required by [CONTACT_480996].  All primary endpoint analyses will be based on the “intent -to-
treat” principle.  Specifically, subjects will be considered part of the intent -to-treat 
analysis population as long as they are randomized into the study, with no adjustment made for whether the device was implanted, compliance with treatment, or events occurring after randomization.  
 To: All device subjects will be summarized in a final report.  Descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize the analysis of all primary endpoints.  
 2.15.8 Secondary Analysis 
 From:  In addition to the intent -to-treat analysis, secondary analyses will be 
performed on the three following analysis populations (two per protocol analyses and one as -treated) . 
 To: The per -protocol analysis and the as treated analysis will not be performed.  
 2.15.9 Other Analyses  From:  The following other analyses were planned:  Subgroup analysis, Adverse 
Events Categorization, Residual Flow in LAA, Primary Effectiveness Component Analysis, Poolability Analysis, Center Effect, Anal ysis of Demographics, CHADS
2 
Score Distribution, Time within therapeutic range (TTR) for INR subjects assigned 
to warfarin, Effect of Learning Curve, Handling of Missing Data, and Worst -case 
analysis.  
 To:  The other analyses will not be performed due to the limited sample size and 
because control subjects will be discontinued ( exited) from the tr ial. 
 2.16.[ADDRESS_618071] AND CLINICAL EVENTS 
COMMITTEE  
 From:  Both an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) will be utilized to regularly review study progress with regard to safety. The CEC will be blinded to subject’s treatment assignment. Members of these boards cannot be investigators on the ACP Clinical Trial.  
Board membership includes: cardiologists, neurologists, and biostatisticians.  The primary responsibilities of the DSMB and CEC include:  
• Review and refine adverse event definitions as necessary during the conduct of the clinical investigation

occur over the course of the clinical investigation  
• Review and validate the subject sample (i.e., review inclusion/exclusion deviations and other protocol deviations)  
• Provide oversight for issues affecting general subject welfare  
• Recommend premature study termination  
 
 To: The Data Safety M onitoring Board (DSMB) will continue to r eview and 
adjudicate all adverse events  and oversee safety  of the trial .  As blinding is no 
longer necessary to prevent bias, the Clinical Events Committee will no longer 
review events, and their responsibilities will be absorbed by [CONTACT_4318] . 
 2.16.5 B LOOD WORK CORE LAB 
 From:  An independent core lab will be utilized to perform baseline hematology 
and coagulation tests (as described in section 2.9).  Members of the Blood Work 
Core Lab will have no affiliation with the ACP Clinical Trial.  
 To: This independent core lab will be closed as all of the baseline coagulation 
samples have been analyzed.  
 2.29 ECONOMIC AND QUALITY OF LIFE SUB -STUDY 
 From:
  In conjunction with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_480902], the costs and 
benefits of treatment will b e evaluated through an economic and quality of life 
analysis .  Medical resource use, cost and health- related quality of life within the 
trial period will be compared between treatment groups.  If ACP therapy is found to be effective, its long term cost- effectiveness analysis will be assessed.  The 
economic and qual ity of life analysis will be fully integrated into the clinical trial, 
with a common informed consent form and collection of subject reported resource use in the case report form. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480960] 2 
years and until the study is completed.  
 To:  The health economic sub- study will be stopped.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480961].  No additional  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480962] .

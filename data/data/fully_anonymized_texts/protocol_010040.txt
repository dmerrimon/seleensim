4. The Background and Benefit -risk Assessment sections (Sections 1.2 and 1.3, 
respectively)  have been  updated to reflect  the study conditions, to reflect  changes  made to 
protocol, and to provide better clarity.  
5. The number of patients  anticipated  to be enrolled  has been updated to approximately 
6 to 10 patients  instead  of 8 to 10 patients  reflecting  more realistic  recruitment  estimates.  
6. The duration of patient  participation  has been  updated throughout the protocol from 
approximately 1.5 days to up to 2 days for total outpatient participation, and from 
approximately 4.5 to 5 days for inpatient stay for consistency and clarity.  
7. The Discussion of Study Design (Section 3.3) Section has been updated to include the details  that patient’s  history of fever  and any perceived  improvement of symptoms will 
be captured as part of their medical history. A corresponding Medical History section (Section 7.6.1) has been added with detailed guidance to ensure proper collection of 
medical history.  
8. The Discontinuation of Study Treatment section (Section 4.4.2) and the Follow -up of 
Patients Prematurely Discontinued from the Study Treatment Regimen or Withdrawn 
from Study section (Section 4.4.5) have been updated so that other than safety 
assessments,  a PK sample  may also be collected  at the discretion  of the Investigator, as it 
would be good to have a PK sample to assess PK/tolerability relationship if the subject withdraws due to an adverse event postdose.  
9. The Prohibited Medications section (Section 6.2) has been updated to specify that acetaminophen  for pain relief  may be taken  without prior consent from  the Investigator. 
10. The Study Assessments and Procedures section (Section 7) has been updated to remove the statement  that the detailed  procedure to be followed  for assessments,  which  involves 
patients’ activity or measurements based on physical activities, will be described in the study manual.  
11. In the Vital Signs, Physical  Examination,  and Other  Safety  Evaluations section  
(Section  7.3) and the Benefit -risk Assessment  section  (Section  1.3), the position for blood 
pressure and other vital sign measurements has been updated from supi[INVESTIGATOR_231285].  
12. The Changes in Myoclonus as Assessed  by [CONTACT_42623] (EMG)  and Accelerometer 
Data section (Section 7.5.2) has been updated to reflect the presence of an EMG and 
accelerometer manual.  
13. In the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale section (Section 7.5.4), an additional assessment of the non-dominant arm has been  added  to the standard  Unified  Myoclonus Rating  Scale 
Section 5 to obtain a more complete data set.  
14. The Measure of Ataxic Dysarthria: Speech and Vocal Tests section (Section 7.5.5) has 
been  updated to include the details  that the patient’s  native language, including country of 
origin (eg, English – [LOCATION_003]) will be captured as part of patient’s demographics. The 
Demographic Data section (Section 7.6) has been updated accordingly to reflect the 
change and to provide clarity.

15. The pharmacodynamic (PD)  population in the Analysis Populations section  (Section  8.2) 
has been updated to include all patients in the Safety Population with an evaluable 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_278914] 1 PD parameter. 
The postbaseline measurement can now be any PD parameter instead of paired -pulse 
TMS measurement only.  
16. The baseline definition  in the General  Considerations section  (Section  8.3) has been 
updated to allow  the use of the average across  Visits  2 and 4 as baseline if review  of 
blinded data indicates a stability of the measurement on days when patients do not 
receive treatment.  
17. A Study Design/Study Schema (Figure 1) has been  updated to provide greater  clarity.  
18. In the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 4), the predose pharmacokinetic (PK) 
sampling timing at Visits 3 and 5 has been revised as follows because there is no 
scientific  rationale  why predose PK sampling  needs  to be collected  1 hour predose 
±10 minutes  as previously specified.  
• For Visit  3: predose PK can be any time in the morning of dosing as long as it is 
predose. 
• For Visit  5: predose PK can be any time after [ADDRESS_278915] Visit  3 dosing and 
prior to Visit 5 dosing.  
19. In the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 4), the allowable  time window to collect 
non-predose PK sample has been specified (ie, the time window only applies to PK  
sampling  timepoints  other than predose) and updated from  [ADDRESS_278916]  time the PK  sample was drawn 
documented. 
20. In the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 4), the time to take off the EMG and 
accelerometer device on Visit 4 has been corrected from 13:00 to 14:00 (ie, 1 hour 
longer), as the planned analysis  of the EMG  and accelerometer  data requires  a longer data 
capture and comparable time windows (now with the same time window as Visit 6).  
21. In the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 4), the time to insert a cannula has been 
updated from 8:00 on Visit 3 to “on admission” prior to Visit 3 based on local procedure. 
The local procedure is to insert the cannula on admission, which allows for any required 
rescue medications  to be administered  in an expedited  fashion. A footnote has been  added 
to provide clarity.  
Minor changes:  
1. The synopsis has been  updat
ed according  to the changes  in the protocol body, as 
applicable.  
2. The amendment/version number and date have been  updated throughout the protocol. 
3. Typographical errors  and formatting  errors  have been  corrected,  as necessary.

Methodology/study  design:  
This is a Phase 1b study to investigate the safety,  tolerability,  PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
effects on biomarkers of AUT00201 in patients with MEAK. Approximately 6 to 10 patients, 
aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with MEAK, based on documented genetic evidence of the presence of the KCNC1 variant will participate in the study.  
The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled treatment  in which  patients  will be 
administered a single dose of 100 mg AUT00201 and matching placebo in a crossover design. There is an initial outpatient screening and procedure orientation which can be spread over  
2 days, followed by a 5- day inpatient stay at a clinical  research  unit. 
After screening/orientation (Visit 1) and baseline assessments (Visit 2), patients will be administered a single dose of [ADDRESS_278923] -in-human (FIH) study. At Visit 5, 
patients will be administered the crossover treatment. At Visit 6, patients will be discharged 
from  the unit. Safety  and tolerability  assessments will be conducted throughout. PD parameters 
will also be assessed.  
Follow-up will be conducted over the phone 14 days ±2 days after discharge (Visit  7). 
Safety,  tolerability,  PK, and biomarker  assessments will be conducted throughout the study as 
detailed in the Schedule of Assessments. Figure 1 provides a study schema.

Statistical  methods:  
All statistical analysis will conform to the relevant International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) requirements,  including but not limited  to those set out in ICH documents E3 and E9. 
Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.2 or later will be used for the analysis.  
A detailed  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be finalized  prior to database lock and data 
unblinding. The SAP will document all analyses procedures.  
Sample  Size Determination  
MEAK is an ultra -rare disorder. The global prevalence is estimated at <1 in 1 000 000 
(ORPHA:  435438). There are only 10 patients  known to the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_231290]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231291]1 -related  disorders in North  America.  
It is hoped that approximately  6 to 10 patients  can be recruited.  
Therefore, a formal power analysis to estimate a desired sample size is not useful. Primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of AUT00201. Nonetheless, a sample size of 8 provides an 80% power to detect  an effect  size of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_278934] at a one-sided 
alpha level of 0.1 (as will be used for the primary outcome measure, the composite response 
score).  
General  Considerations for Data  Analyses  
Standard summary statistics for continuous baseline and outcome variables are: N, mean, standard  deviation (SD),  median,  quartiles,  minimum,  maximum,  and 95% confidence intervals 
at baseline and each timepoint at which the measures are obtained. In addition, the same 
descriptive statistics will be obtained for change from baseline in each treatment period for  
each timepoint at which the measures are obtained. The standard summary statistics for categorical baseline and outcome variables are: count and proportion (expressed as a percentage). Geometric mean and coefficient of variation will also be presented for PK concentrations and the PK parameters.  
The minimum and maximum  values  will be presented  to the same number of decimal  places  as 
the raw data collected on the  electronic case report form  (or to 3 significant figures  for derived 
parameters). The mean, median, and percentiles (eg, Q1 and Q3) will be presented to one additional decimal place. The SD and standard error will be presented to [ADDRESS_278935] measurement  obtained before  IP administration. 
However, if review of blinded data indicates a stability of the measurement on days when

 1. INTRODUCTION  
AUT00201 is a small molecule developed as a potent and selective modulator of human 
voltage- gated  potassium (K+) ion channels  (Kv): Kv3.1 and Kv3.2. The K v3 family  includes  
4 members:  Kv3.1, Kv3.2, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4. Kv3 channels are activated  by [CONTACT_231336][INVESTIGATOR_231296] - [ADDRESS_278944]-spi[INVESTIGATOR_28884], parvalbumin-positive (PV+)  interneurons in corticolimbic  circuits,  including motor 
and sensorimotor cortex.  They  are the critical  component to enable the accurate,  high-frequency 
firing of these interneurons which give rise to gamma frequency oscillations that underlie attention, sensory processing, and cognition. Genetic deletion of K
v3.1, K v3.2, and K v3.[ADDRESS_278945] been linked 
recently to a spectrum of epi[INVESTIGATOR_231297]. A recurrent pathogenic 
variant of KCNC1 (c.959G>A; p.Arg320His) results in a form of progressive myoclonic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (PME) called MEAK (myoclonus epi[INVESTIGATOR_231298] K+ channel mutation).13 
The loss of K v3.1 channel function is suggested to lead to reduced cortical inhibition, which 
gives rise to motor and sensorimotor cortex hyperexcitability.14 This hyperexcitability underlies 
the susceptibility to rhythmic myoclonic activity in MEAK and similar hyperexcitability caused 
by [CONTACT_231337]3 channel  function in cerebellar  neurons is likely  to give rise to the progressive 
ataxia observed in these patients.  
MEAK  is an ultra-rare disorder. Based  on a mutational model, which  takes  into account  both the 
local sequence context of the mutation site and regional factors, Muona et al estimated the 
incidence to be 1 in 5,700,000 conceptions.13 Given a birth number of 3,605,201 in 2020 in the 
US, in 2 years only 1 to 2 people are born in the US with this mutation. Consistently, there are currently 10 patients known to the registry at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231299].  
MEAK is a severe and debilitating condition. On a background of usually normal development, the first symptom in the majority of patients is myoclonus (sometimes reported as tremor), 
mostly action -induced, at the ages of 6 to 14 years. Progressive ataxia develops in parallel but is 
usually overshadowed by [CONTACT_231338]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_231300] -clonic seizures are infrequent in all patients. During adolescence myoclonus generally 
becomes very severe, limiting ambulation, and requiring a walking aid or wheelchair by [CONTACT_231339]. There is notable preservation of cognition in the context of severe motor disability.

[ADDRESS_278946] potential to improve symptoms. Such  a characterization  may 
also support the use of these biomarkers in future studies in other indications in which dysfunction of PV+ interneurons has been implicated. These biomarkers will include  
paired -pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe motor cortex excitability and 
measures of auditory and visual information processing that have been associated with dysfunction of PV+ interneurons that express K
v3 channels. We predict that we will observe 
evidence for reduced cortical inhibition in the MEAK patients and subtle but consistent 
abnormalities  in early  auditory and visual  information processing. Previous studies have shown 
reduced cortical inhibition in other forms of myoclonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], such as Unverricht -Lundborg 
syndrome.17,18,19 On this basis, there would be a reasonable rationale to explore the therapeutic 
potential of AUT00201 in these other epi[INVESTIGATOR_31630].  
Prior to the development of AUT00201, the sponsor has conducted clinical studies with 2 other 
Kv3 modulators (AUT00063; IND 122711), and AUT00206 (EudraCT numbers: 2015-002364- 
16, 2016-000216-14, 2016-002704-63, 2021-003211-26), the latter  of which  is being progressed 
for certain neuropsychiatric indications, such as Fragile X Syndrome. This study plans to enroll 
patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with MEAK (see Section 4.1 ). The safety and 
tolerability  of AUT00201 at exposures exceeding those proposed to be used in the current study 
has been established in a first -in-human (FIH) study in healthy volunteers (see Section 3.5 ). 
1.2. Background 
Pathogenic variants in the KCNC1 gene, which encodes the K v3.[ADDRESS_278947] uncovered in a study 
evaluating whole exome sequencing in 2 unrelated cohorts of patients with PME of unknown etiology. From these 2 cohorts, 16 cases (13 unrelated) were identified with a KCNC1 
c.959G>A; p.Arg320His mutation.
13 The expression of K v3.1 is mainly limited to the central 
nervous system (CNS) and a specific subset of gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic 
inhibitory interneurons known as PV+ fast -spi[INVESTIGATOR_231301], which are critical components 
of cortical  circuits,  including motor and sensorimotor cortex.  Kv3.[ADDRESS_278948] not been applied. Small molecule positive modulators that

[ADDRESS_278949] the 
potential to be used in treatment of KCNC1- related disorders, including MEAK. Nonclinical 
studies in cellular systems and transgenic mice expressing MEAK mutant K v3.1 channels 
support this potential.  
Twenty patients with the recurrent KCNC1 c.959G>A; p.Arg320His mutation were described in 
the original study.  14 Of these, 14 were sporadic (unrelated) cases, 4 were from 1 family, and 2 
were a mother- child  pair).  The patients  were 17 to 63 years  of age when  they were studied. Onset 
of neurologic symptoms was at a median of 9.5 years (range 3 to 15 years). In the majority, the first symptom was myoclonus (brief jerks). Three patients presented with ataxia (with or without 
myoclonus) and 3 presented with generalized tonic -clonic seizures between the ages of 9 and 14 
years without prior myoclonus. All of these patients were described as having progressively severe and frequent (daily) myoclonus which was action- induced and often resulted in falls, 
ataxia primary factor limiting ambulation. About half of the patients became wheelchair - 
dependent, with severe myoclonus noted as the predominant reason. Myoclonus is also reported 
as being so severe as to interfere with daily activities such as being able to eat independently and 
over half of the 20 patients needed assistance with all functions of daily living, reported as fully 
or mostly dependent.  
A diurnal pattern was noted – myoclonus was worse in the morning. Other exacerbating factors 
included stress,  anxiety, startle,  or menses.  Generalized  tonic-clonic seizures  were rare, occurring 
most often during teenage years. At the time of the report, all of the patients were being treated with [ADDRESS_278950] include short interval cortical 
inhibition (SICI) and long interval cortical inhibition (LICI).  
Reduced  inhibitory control in MEAK  is consistent with the high expression of K v3.1 channels  on 
PV+ GABA interneurons where they enable these neurons to fire rapi[INVESTIGATOR_231302].  [ADDRESS_278951] demonstrated that normal functioning of PV+ interneurons is critical

 for the generation  of highly synchronized gamma  oscillations  which  are important for enhancing 
signal transmission in the neocortex by [CONTACT_231340].  23 
Dysfunction of PV+ interneurons is associated with reduced phase synchrony of evoked gamma 
oscillations  associated  with increased  power of resting  state gamma  oscillations.  26 This has been 
observed in other indications where PV+ interneuron dysfunction has been implicated; for example, studies in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) knock- out mice and patients 
with Fragile X Syndrome show identical electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, strongly suggesting that desynchronized but increased resting state gamma oscillations represent a 
translational biomarker of PV+ interneuron dysfunction.
[ADDRESS_278953] not been  investigated  in patients  with MEAK. 
Their evaluation will complement the assessment of auditory functioning and provide a 
comprehensive characterization of potential biomarker abnormalities associated with reduced K
v3.1 channel function.  
The study will investigate safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) outcomes of a K
v3.1/K v3.2 modulator, AUT00201 in MEAK patients following a single dose of AUT00201. It 
will investigate  biomarkers of cortical  excitability,  and PV+ interneuron function in patients  with 
MEAK. Exploration of measures of speech, central auditory, and visual function will also be included where this is feasible without overburdening the patients.  
The study will aim to validate  and extend  the use of biomarkers of PV+ interneuron dysfunction 
and cortical  hyperexcitability,  respectively,  in the MEAK  population. Cortical  excitability  using 
TMS has already been explored in patients with other forms of PME.  
27,30 It is expected that 
patients with MEAK will demonstrate EEG abnormalities mentioned earlier, as well as the 
paired -pulse TMS abnormalities observed in other PMEs. In addition, subtle abnormalities in 
auditory and visual information processing and perception may be observed. If indeed these abnormalities can be demonstrated and prove to be susceptible to treatment with AUT00201, 
then they could be used in the future to identify patients with PME and possibly other 
neuropsychiatric disorders in which PV+ interneuron dysfunction and cortical hyperexcitability 
play a prominent role or have been implicated.

[ADDRESS_278954] was AUT00063, which  was evaluated  in 1 Phase  1a and 3 Phase  2a studies. 
The second was AUT00206, which was evaluated in 2 Phase 1a and 2 Phase 1b studies. The 
nonclinical and Phase 1 clinical safety of AUT00201 appears similar to both AUT00063 and 
AUT00206 at the same stage of development. No deaths or suspected unexpected serious 
adverse events (SAEs) have occurred following administration of any of these compounds.  
The prior FIH study with AUT00201 (AUT011201) established the safety and tolerability of the drug in healthy volunteers for single oral doses of up to 320 mg once daily and 200 mg twice 
daily (BID), and repeat doses of up to 100 mg BID for 14 days. All reported adverse events 
(AEs)  were mild to moderate and there was no notable relationship  between  AUT00201 dose and 
the frequency or severity of reported AEs compared to placebo. There were no deaths or SAEs reported in patients. No adverse cardiac signals were observed in the completed Phase [ADDRESS_278955] 
MEAK patients’ primary symptoms of action -induced myoclonus and ataxia. There is no 
treatment  for action -induced myoclonus. Clonazepam  is the only drug approved by [CONTACT_231341], but these are not the key disabling symptoms of these patients. In addition, clonazepam is associated with 
significant side effects such as sedation and dependence. The efficacy of AUT00201 in humans 
with MEAK has not been evaluated to date. It is anticipated that continued exposure to 
AUT00201 will act on K
v3.1 channels on specific populations of neurons in the cortex and 
cerebellum, restoring their ability to sustain rapid firing required for normal function. It is 
postulated that this will reverse the reduced cortical inhibition and will in turn normalize motor 
and sensorimotor cortical  hyperexcitability. This hyperexcitability  underlies the susceptibility  to 
rhythmic myoclonic activity in MEAK; thus AUT00201 may be an effective treatment for myoclonus. Furthermore, improved function of cerebellar neurons with AUT00201 treatment 
may reduce symptoms of ataxia. Thus, AUT00201 has the potential to provide therapeutic

 assessments will be scheduled  to be conducted at around the anticipated  time to reach  maximum 
(peak) plasma concentration (t max) and therefore the patients will be under direct supervision 
during this time.  
For safety  reporting purposes, all SAEs  will be considered  unexpected.

expected AEs of AUT00201 may be found in the IB.

Figure 1: Study  Design  
 
3.2. Replacement  Patients  
It is not possible to replace patients  in this study given the rarity  of MEAK  and the known patient 
population. However, if any technical issues or important protocol deviations occur during a 
patient’s participation that are likely to make the primary, secondary, or exploratory endpoint 
data unevaluable or impact their validity, the patient may be invited back to participate in the 
study again, if the sponsor and Investigator are in agreement.  
If a patient is invited back to participate a second time, they will be given a new screening number and treated  as a new patient,  including consideration  for inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
There will therefore  be a minimum of [ADDRESS_278962] particpation, with the 
exception of safety and PK data, will not be included in the statistical analysis. All data will be 
listed, with clear indictaion if a patient is a repeat participant.  
There are no safety concerns for rechallenging the patients. Participants in the FIH study received  up to 4 single doses separated  by 10- day washout periods; they received  escalating 
doses, the highest of which was 160 mg to 200 mg BID (400 mg total dose).  
There is no impact  on the data integrity  by [CONTACT_231345].  The assessments have been 
selected for the crossover design of the study and no learning effect is expected.  
3.3. Discussion  of Study  Design  
The study will be double -blind to avoid bias in the collection and evaluation of data during its 
conduct. The Investigator and sponsor will remain blinded to the treatment randomization code 
until after the database has been  locked.  Placebo  has been  chosen  as the control to assess whether 
any observed effects are treatment -related or simply reflect the study conditions. A crossover 
design is used to increase the power of the study and reduce the influence of confounding 
covariates since each patient serves as its own control.  
It is reported that patients have noted transient improvement in gait and myoclonus with high fever.  
[ADDRESS_278963] shift in activation of 
wild-type K V3.1 subunit–containing channels,  which  would counter the loss of function observed 
for mutant channels. Therefore, it is postulated that improvements following a relatively short

 assessments. The PK of AUT00201 is expected to be similar in healthy volunteers and MEAK 
patients.  AUT00201 is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP)  enzymes  and is metabolized 
by [CONTACT_231346] (predominantly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and possibly CYP2C19), 
therefore the likelihood of a significant PK interaction with any of the expected anticonvulsant 
concomitant medications that the MEAK patient will be taking is considered low.  
Based upon the clinical experience already available on AUT00201, patients will be monitored within  the clinical  inpatient unit for the duration of dosing, and the expected  duration of exposure 
to the IP the sponsor considers a single dose of [ADDRESS_278965] of drug in pregnant women is not known, AUT00201 will be discontinued in the patients who may conceive or are tested positive for pregnancy during the study. From safety 
perspective,  study treatment  will be discontinued per criteria  listed  in Section  4.4.2 . Further, the

 4. SELECTION  OF STUDY POPULATION  
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment  and enrollment criteria,  also known as 
protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.  
There  are only 10 patients  known to the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_231304]’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]. It is hoped approximately  [ADDRESS_278967]  satisfy  all the following criteria  at Screening  Visit  (Visit  1) unless otherwise stated:  
1. Male  or female patients  aged 18  years  or older at  the time of consenting 
2. Diagnosed with MEAK,  based  on documented genetic evidence of the presence of the 
KCNC1 (c.959G>A; p.Arg320His) variant  
3. If taking anticonvulsants, must  be on a stable  anticonvulsant regimen  for at least [ADDRESS_278968]  be willing  to perform  study assessments and comply with the study protocol

 Contraceptive requirements:  Men 
Male  patients  must  not plan to father  a child  or donate sperm,  during the study and for [ADDRESS_278972] sex without using a condom, during the study and for 90 days after 
their follow -up visit, if their partner is a woman of childbearing potential. They do not need to 
use any contraception if: they had a vasectomy and surgical success has been confirmed by 
[CONTACT_231347], or their partner is not of childbearing potential. Partners who are not of 
childbearing potential are defined  as: men;  postmenopausal women  (no menstrual  periods for at 
least 365 days); or women who have no uterus, ovaries, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134].  
During the study, patients  must  not have sex with a woman  who is pregnant or breastfeeding, 
without using a condom.  
Contraceptive requirements:  Women  
Women  of childbearing potential must  use a highly effective method of contraception  with 
low-user dependency during the study. They  must  have been  using that method for at least 
28 days before  Visit  1 and continue to use it for 180 days (6 months) after their last dose of study 
medication. Highly effective methods of contraception include:  
• intrauterine  device 
• intrauterine  hormone- releasing  system  
• established  use of oral, injected,  or implanted  hormonal methods of contraception  
• bilateral  tubal occlusion 
• vasectomized  partner  (with  surgical  success  confirmed  by [CONTACT_231348]).  
A woman  is considered  to be of non-childbearing potential if she meets  one of the following 
criteria:  
• is postmenopausal (the last menstrual  period was at least 365 days ago, and follicle - 
stimulating hormone at Screening confirms postmenopausal status)  
• has no uterus, ovaries, or  fallopia n tubes.  
Patients who practice true abstinence or who only have same -sex relationships need not use 
contraception, provided it is in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle (Note: periodic 
abstinence [eg, calendar,  ovulation, symptothermal,  and postovulation methods] and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception). Should any such patient stop practicing true abstinence, they must use contraception as described above.  
4.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Patients  will be excluded  from  the study if they satisfy  any of the following criteria  at Screening 
Visit (Visit 1) unless otherwise stated:

4.3. Lifestyle  Restrictions  
AUT00201 is predominately metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and CYP2C9. Accordingly, the 
consumption of dietary  supplements (eg, St. John’s wort),  foods, and forms  of fruit juice  (eg, 
Seville oranges, grapefruit juice) that may affect the expression or function of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9  will not be allowed  beginning [ADDRESS_278976] inpatient will be discussed with the patients at Screening.

[ADDRESS_278977]  2023  Page  34 of 73  
 4.4. Discontinuation Criteria  
4.4.1.  Screen  Failures  
Screen  failures  are defined  as patients  who consent to participate  in the clinical  study but are not 
subsequently entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any 
SAEs with concomitant medication details.  
When 1 or more correctable inclusion or exclusion criteria are found at Screening, after appropriate management,  the patient  can be rescreened  at the discretion  of the Investigator and if 
approved by [CONTACT_231349].  
4.4.2.  Discontinuation of Study  Treatment  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or legal guardian’s request (if applicable), or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for 
safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons. If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of 
future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a 
withdrawal of consent. Additionally, patients may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. A patient that 
withdraws  from  the study may be asked  to stay in the clinic  for a further day in order to complete 
safety assessments such as ECG, vital signs, and safety laboratory tests. These assessments will be at the discretion of the Investigator in order to ensure safety can be reviewed prior to the 
patient’s discharge. A PK sample may also be collected at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 4) for potential data to be collected at the time 
of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need  to be completed.  
Additional reasons  for discontinuation can include, but are not limited  to: 
• Administration  of treatments  not allowed  in the protocol  
• AE 
• Lack  of efficacy  
• Pregnancy  
• Sponsor determination  
• Investigator’s decision 
• Death.  
4.4.3.  Lost  to Follow- up 
A patient  will be considered  lost to follow-up if he/she repeatedly  fails to return  for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].  

Protocol  
 Study:  000000233834  CONFIDENTIAL  
Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_278978]  be taken  if a patient  fails to return  to the clinic  for a required  study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_231350], counsel the patient or legal guardian on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned  visit schedule,  and ascertain  whether  or not the patient  wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee 
must  make every  effort  to regain  contact  [CONTACT_231351] (if applicable) 
(where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_231352]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient  or legal  guardian  (if applicable)  continue to be unreachable,  he/she 
will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to 
follow -up. 
4.4.4.  Replacement  Procedures  
Patients who withdraw from the study or who are withdrawn by [CONTACT_231353]. However, if a patient discontinues the study for technical issues or 
important protocol deviations that are likely to make the primary, secondary, or exploratory 
endpoint data unevaluable or impact  their validity,  the patient  may be invited  back  to participate 
in the study again, if the sponsor and Investigator are in agreement.  
If a patient is invited back to participate a second time, they will be treated as a new patient, including consideration for inclusion and exclusion criteria. There will therefore be a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_278979] particpation, with the exception of safety and PK 
data,  will not be included in the statistical analysis.  All data will be listed,  with clear  indictaion  if 
a patient is a repeat participant.  
There are no safety concerns for rechallenging the patients. Participants in the FIH study 
received  up to 4 single doses separated  by 10- day washout periods; they received  escalating 
doses, the highest of which was 160 mg to 200 mg BID (400 mg total dose).  
There is no impact  on the data integrity  by [CONTACT_231345].  The assessments have been 
selected for the crossover design of the study and no learning effect is expected.  
4.4.5.  Follow- up of Patients  Prematurely  Discontinued  from  the Study  Treatment 
Regimen or Withdrawn from Study  
Due to the continued scientific  importance of patient data even  if study treatment  is discontinued 
early, patients who withdraw from the study may be asked to stay in the clinic for a further day 
in order to complete safety assessments such as ECG, vital signs, and safety laboratory tests.  
These assessments will be at the discretion of the Investigator in order to ensure safety can be reviewed  prior to the patient’s  discharge.  A PK sample  may also be collected  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator. Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 4) for potential data to be

 collected  at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that 
need to be completed. Patients who are no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231306]. Laboratory assessment will be done at on- site visits.  
All treatment- related (S)AEs that are ongoing at the time of discontinuation, or that develop 
before the protocol- specified  follow-up visit,  will be followed for 30 days, or until resolution or 
stabilization.  
4.5. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_231307] a safety review meeting, including the Investigator, sponsor, and medical  monitor will be convened if any of the following criteria  are 
met: 
• If 2 or more patients  experience a similar  severe (Grade  3) AE or SAE 
• A life-threatening  or fatal (Grade  4 or 5) SAE in any patient.  
4.6. Study  Termination  
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any 
reason  at the sole discretion  of the sponsor. The study site will be closed  upon study completion. 
The study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed. Reasons for study termination may 
include, but are not limited to:  
• AEs unknown to date (ie, not previously reported  in any similar  investigational study drug 
trial with respect to their nature, severity, and/or duration)  
• Increased frequency and/or severity and/or duration of known, anticipated, or previously 
reported AEs (this may also apply to AEs defined as baseline signs and symptoms)  
• Medical  or ethical  reasons  affecting  the continued performance of the study  
• Difficulties  in the recruitment  of patients  
• Cancellation  of drug development.  
The Investigator may initiate  study site closure at any time,  provided there  is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_231354], but are not limited to:  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  or local  health  authorities,  the sponsor's procedures, or 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment  of participants  by [CONTACT_737].

5.2. Preparation,  Storage, Handling,  and Accountability  
The study drug will be supplied by [CONTACT_456] (or designee), along with the batch/lot numbers 
and Certificates  of Analysis.  The study treatment  will be provided in opaque white,  high-density 
polyethylene bottles with child- resistant closures. The recommended storage conditions, and 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695] (wherever required), will be stated on the product label . 
The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained  during transit  for all study treatments  received  and any discrepancies  are reported  and 
resolved before use of the study treatment.  

Protocol  
 Study:  000000233834  CONFIDENTIAL  
Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_278984] be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored 
(manual  or automated)  area in accordance with the labeled  storage conditions with access  limited 
to the Investigator and authorized site staff.  
Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer  study treatment  while  patient is inpatient.  The Investigator, institution, 
or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final 
disposition records).  
Further guidance and information  for the final disposition  of unused study treatment  are provided 
in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3. Method  of Treatment  Assignment  
Patients will be assigned a unique code number (randomization number) at Visit 3. The patient 
number will encode the patient’s assignment either to study treatment or to placebo arm of the 
study, according to the randomization schedule generated prior to the study by  [CONTACT_231355],  labeled  with his/her unique patient 
number, and traceable to the batch number of the medication.  
5.4. Blinding  
The study will be a double -blind, crossover, placebo- controlled, where the patients will receive 
blinded single doses of AUT00201 or matching  placebo  treatment  that is identical  in appearance 
and similar in taste and smell.  
The specific blinded treatment to be taken by a patient will be assigned using randomization 
schedule. The study treatment will be dispensed per the randomization schedule by [CONTACT_231356].  Active  and placebo  treatments  will be labeled  such that it is not possible to distinguish 
between them. Unblinding should occur only in the event of medical emergency, given the 
knowledge of the study drug is essential for clinical management or welfare of the patient. In the 
event of emergency unblinding by [CONTACT_737], the sponsor must be informed as soon as 
possible. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF), as applicable. Once the study is  
complete, all envelopes (sealed and opened) must be inventoried and returned to the sponsor.  
5.5. Treatment  Compliance  
Records  shall  be maintained  of the delivery  of the study treatment  to the study site, the inventory 
at the study site, the use for each patient, and the return to the sponsor or destruction.  
These  records  shall  include dates,  quantities,  expi[INVESTIGATOR_31637],  and the unique code numbers assigned 
to the study treatment and study patients.  
The Investigator shall  be responsible for ensuring that the records  adequately  document that the 
patients were provided the doses specified in the protocol and that all study treatment received

 6. CONCOMITANT  THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_231308]  
6.1. Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication  or vaccine (including over-the- counter  or prescription  medicines,  vitamins, 
and/or herbal  supplements) that the patient  is receiving  at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded in the eCRF along with:  
• reason  for use 
• dates  of administration  including start and end dates  
• dosage information  including dose and frequency.  
Patients must be instructed not to take any new medications or change their current regimen, 
including over -the-counter products, without first consulting with the Investigator. The medical 
monitor should be contact[CONTACT_31182]. 
Medications that are necessary for the patient’s safety and well -being are permitted at the 
discretion of the Investigator. It is not recommended that patients are withdrawn from any of their currently  prescribed  medications  for the study. Data on all concomitant drugs administered, 
doses and duration of concomitant use, and the specific timing of administration relative to the administration of AUT00201 or placebo will be captured in the source documents and eCRF 
throughout the study.  
6.2. Prohibited  Medications  
Patients  will refrain  from  use of any new prescription or nonprescription medications/products 
during the study until the follow -up unless the Investigator (or designee) has given their prior 
consent (with the sole exception for acetaminophen for pain relief).  
The use of any other investigational agents  is not allowed  during the study.

 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing  are summarized  in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 4). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed, with the exception of mitigating immediate 
safety concerns, if immediate safety concerns are identified, these should be discussed with the 
sponsor immediately  upon occurrence or awareness  to determine  if the patient  should continue or 
discontinue the study. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Assessments, is essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential patients meet  all eligibility  criteria.  The Investigator will maintain  a screening  log to record  details  of all 
patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure  
(Section 4.4.1), as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical 
management  (eg, blood count) and obtained before  signing the informed  consent form  (ICF)  may 
be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified 
criteria and was performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Assessments.  
With the sponsor’s approval, additional blood sampling timepoints may be introduced, and 
changes  to timepoints  may be made if there  is a scientific  reason  to believe that the additional 
blood sampling might improve the quality of the data (for example, the scenario, where an important effect of the IP is being observed, but no measurements are scheduled for that 
timepoint), or if extra procedures are needed in the interest of the patients’ safety.  
Overall, the maximum amount of blood collected from each patient over the duration of the study, including any extra assessments that may be required  (for the reasons  stated  above), will 
not exceed the blood volume collection limitations established by [CONTACT_15686]. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.  
A prescreening telephone questionnaire, approved by [CONTACT_1201], will be developed to  collect basic 
information  on the patients  before patients  visit the site (eg, has their current  medication  regimen 
been stable for last 90 days?). This will help to reduce the risk of screen failure and also patient burden of travelling to the site.  
A pre-study ICF may be used to obtain basic  patient identifiers  so that patient  travel  may be 
scheduled prior to the Screening Visit.  
The study- related questionnaires are required to be filled by [CONTACT_231357]. Alternatively, where the patient is unable to complete due to physical disabilities,  caregiver  can assist  these  patients  to complete  the questionnaires by 
[CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_231309].  
7.1. Safety  and Tolerability  Assessments  
7.1.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse event  definitions and assignment of severity  and causality  are detailed  in Appendix 1 . 

Protocol  
 Study:  000000233834  CONFIDENTIAL  
Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_278988]  2023  Page  42 of 73  
 Adverse events,  based  on clinical  signs and symptoms  and laboratory measurements,  will be 
monitored throughout the study, and will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until 
follow- up (end of study) visit.  
Adverse events will be elicited from the patient (or when appropriate, the patient’s legally authorized  representative)  by [CONTACT_135698] a nonleading question such as “How  are 
you feeling today?” or “Have you had any health concerns since your last visit?” Patients will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs 
that are serious,  considered  related  to the study treatment or the study, or that caused  the patient 
to discontinue the study drug (see Section 4.4.2 ). 
7.1.2.  Reporting  Serious  Adverse Events  
All SAEs,  occurring after the signing of the I
 CF until end of study and regardless  of study drug 
relationship , must be entered into the clinical database and the Investigator or delegate must 
report the SAE(s) to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of obtaining knowledge of the event. The SAE should be reported by [CONTACT_231358], provided in the 
Investigator/delegate site file. The completed, signed, and dated paper SAE Form must, within 
24 hours, be scanned  and emailed  to: . The study site should notify t
 he 
site monitor via phone or email about the submission of the SAE report.  
The SAE  Form  will collect  data surrounding the event  (eg, the nature of the symptom[s], time of 
onset in relation to initiation of therapy, duration, intensity, and whether or not therapy was interrupted or discontinued). The Investigator’s assessment of the probable cause of the event 
will also be included.  In addition, relevant medical history, concomitant medications,  laboratory 
and diagnostic tests reports, and procedures as well as all pertinent medical information related to the event will also be collected.  
 Patient  Safety  Solutions (PSS)  will forward  SAE  queries  requesting incomplete  or 
missing  information  directly  to the Investigator. It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to be 
diligent in providing this information back to  PSS as soon as it is available.  
The site will follow their institutional requirements for submission of SAEs to their IRB. Additional reporting requirements  are noted in the Safety  Management  Plan,  if applicable.  
Follow- up of Adverse Events/Serious  Adverse Events  
Adverse events/SAEs  will be followed up to 30 days or until resolution or stabilization  of the 
event, completion of the patient’s participation, or study termination, or the Investigator or designee and sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, whichever occurs first.  
Assessments should be made each day (or more frequently, if necessary)  of any changes  in the 
severity, the relationship to the study drug intervention required to treat it, and the outcome.  

Protocol  
 Study:  000000233834  CONFIDENTIAL  
Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_278989] will be performed  at Visit 2 
(at time of admission). A patient who tests positive at any time should be immediately 
discontinued from the study. Appropriate contraceptive measures must be adhered to for the 
duration of the study and 180 days (6 months) after their last dose of study medication.  
Although not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the Investigator or their designee to report any pregnancy in a patient  or the patient’s  sexual  partner  that occurs  during the study. All 
patients who become pregnant must immediately discontinue the study drug and be withdrawn from the study. The patient will be followed to completion/termination of the pregnancy. This 
information is important for both drug safety and public health concerns. If a patient or the 
patient’s sexual partner is found to be pregnant after the study treatment was administered, the 
Investigator should report this to the  and sponsor immediately and document the 
pregnancy on the Pregnancy Form in the eCRF.  
The Investigator must  make every  effort  to follow the patient  or the patient’s  sexual  partner  until 
completion of pregnancy. If the events during the pregnancy and/or outcome of pregnancy (ie, 
complications regarding mother/fetus) meet the criteria for classification of an SAE, the 
Investigator must follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.  
7.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Laboratory tests during the study will be performed by a local laboratory. Blood and urine 
samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations at the timepoints indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 4).  Clinical laboratory evaluations are listed  in Appendix 2.  
Urine will be tested for drugs of abuse according to the laboratory’s standard operating procedure (SOP). Tests will include amphetamines, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cannabis, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Patients known to abuse drugs or those who test positive at Visit 1 may be 
excluded from the study based on Investigator’s judgment. Additional clinical laboratory 
evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the 
ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety 
evaluations is required.  
An Investigator (or designee)  will perform a clinical assessment  of all clinical  laboratory data. 
Abnormal/out of range clinically significant laboratory findings (based on Investigator’s judgment) will be recorded as AEs and will be flagged for out of reference ranges per site 
standards. 
7.3. Vital  Signs,  Physical Examination, and Other  Safety  Evaluations  
Sitting and standing blood pressure (BP), sitting pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature will be assessed at the timepoints indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 4).  Unscheduled measurement  of vital signs may also be performed  at other times  if 
judged to be clinically  appropriate or if the ongoing review  of the data suggests a more detailed

[ADDRESS_278990] 5 minutes before BP and pulse rate measurements.  
A full physical examination  will be performed  at Visits  1 and 2 and a brief  or targeted  physical 
examination will be performed at Visits 4 and 6 (approximately 24 hours after each IP 
administration) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 4).  
7.3.1.  Height  and Weight 
Height and weight will be obtained at the timepoints  specified  in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 4).  If height cannot be reliably  obtained, the measure  length of forearm  (ulna) from 
the point of the elbow (olecranon  process)  and the midpoint of the prominent bone of the wrist 
(styloid process) will be used to predict height. This procedure will be described in the study manual.  
7.3.2.  Electrocardiogram  
The 12- lead ECGs  will be obtained at the timepoints  specified  in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 4).  
7.3.3.  Columbia -Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  
The C -SSRS will be administered at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 4). The C -SSRS is a clinician -rated instrument that captures the occurrence, severity, 
and frequency of suicidal ideation and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if suicidal 
ideation and/or behavior occurred. During study, the C -SSRS interview format will be 
administered by [CONTACT_43065]. The C -SSRS will monitor for any changes in suicide ideation 
and/or behavior in patients participating in this trial of a centrally -acting drug. Patients that 
exhibit suicide ideations and/or behaviors as assessed by C -SSRS or otherwise clinically should 
be referred for immediate evaluation and treatment per investigational site procedures. The 
screening  C-SSRS will be used at Visit 1, and the since  last visit C- SSRS will be used at all other 
timepoints.  
7.4. Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  
A blood sample  for the determination  of AUT00201 plasma  concentrations will be collected  at 
the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 4).  
A central laboratory will measure the plasma concentrations of AUT00201. Derivation of PK 
parameters will be performed at the end of study. Actual times will be used to derive PK 
parameters. Missing data will not be imputed. For calculation of all PK parameters, and for 
individual concentration- time plots, plasma concentrations below the limit of quantification of 
the assay  (BLQ)  will be treated  as follows: values  that occur  before t
max will be taken  as zero;  all 
other values will be taken as missing. For calculation of plasma concentration summary 
statistics, BLQ values will be taken as zero, unless they fall between 2 quantifiable 
concentrations, in which case they will be treated as missing.

7.5. Biomarker Assessments  
7.5.1.  Cortical  Inhibition as Assessed  with  Paired -Pulse  TMS  EMG  
• SICI 
• LICI  
Paired -pulse TMS allows measurement of cortical inhibitory circuit functions. In paired-pulse 
TMS protocols, 2 consecutive pulses are delivered to the hand motor region at a fixed 
interstimulus interval (ISI) such that the motor -evoked potential, captured by [CONTACT_231359], resultant from the second (test) stimulus is modulated by [CONTACT_231360] (conditioning) stimulus. Depending on stimulus intensity and the ISI, paired- pulse TMS can reveal the 
magnitude of regional inhibitory signaling strength. A tracking  threshold approach  will be used 
to assess intracortical  inhibition  as it has been  shown  to have better  reliability  than the classical 
approach.  
SICI  will be elicited  with a conditioning stimulus  (CS)  and interstimulus  interval  of 1, 2.5, and 
3 ms; LICI will be elicited with a CS that precedes the test stimulus by [ADDRESS_278993]  “ambient” GABAergic,  that is inhibitory tone, SICI  at [ADDRESS_278994]  duration and timings  of the paired -pulse TMS  assessments will be described  in a study 
manual. The initial assessment will be timed to coincide with the anticipated t max, between  
2 to 4 hours postdose, and will be conducted at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 at corresponding times. A 
second  assessment  will be conducted approximately 6 hours postdose, at Visits  3 and 5. TMS  is a 
noninvasive procedure. The risks associated with paired- pulse TMS are very low.32 
7.5.2.  Changes in Myoclonus as Assessed  by [CONTACT_231361] (eg

the pattern of a single myoclonus discharge, the rhythmicity of consecutive myoclonus

[ADDRESS_278995] of 
brief  (duration of around  100 ms) myoclonic potentials that may occur synchronously in agonist 
and antagonist muscles. During muscle contraction, it occurs as a brief (duration 50 to 100 ms) suppression of muscle activity.
33 This is referred to as ‘positive myoclonus’. However, patients 
can also experience short periods of loss of muscle tone. This is referred to as a ‘negative myoclonus’. 
The successful  development of wearable sensors has enabled  continuous objective measurement 
of physiological signals, movement, and physical activity during daily activities in patients 
suffering  from  both positive and negative myoclonus. The specific method used in this study has 
been validated in patients with progressive myoclonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_231310] 1 (EPM1, Unverricht – 
Lundborg disease; caused by a mutation in the CSTB gene).
33 
Patients will wear the wireless device(s) whilst inpatient; the exact number, placement of the devices, timing, and duration will be described in the EMG and accelerometer manual but it is 
anticipated  that 1 sensor  will be worn  on each arm from  Visit 2 through Visit  6. The devices  will 
remain on the patient for the duration of the inpatient portion of the study, except when they are charged  each evening; patients  will be able to complete  all daily  activities  and the devices  can be 
removed during showering. The long- term data capture will enable evaluation of the fluctuation 
of myoclonus over the day.  
The patients will also wear the devices whilst completing the UMRS Sections 4 and 5 assessments and UMRS Section 4: D and E action- induced myoclonus/arm movement 
assessments (see Section  7.5.3).  The EMG  and accelerometer  recordings are noninvasive and are 
not associated with any risks.  
7.5.3.  Action -induced  Myoclonus  
The patients’  predominant symptom is an action -induced myoclonus (“positive myoclonus”). To 
ensure assessment of this symptom over the duration of the study, the patients will need to be active at regular intervals. At specified timepoints, as per the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 4) and the study manual, the patient will be asked to complete a set of movements of 
their arms in accordance with the UMRS action myoclonus Section 4: Parts D and E. The study staff will provide instructions to the patients. The time and duration of the test will be noted.  
These  assessments will also be videoed for centralized  clinical  assessment.  
7.5.4.  Unified  Myoclonus Rating  Scale 
The UMRS  is a quantitative  73-item clinical  rating  instrument developed to evaluate myoclonus 
and response, of patients with myoclonus, to antimyoclonic therapy.  
The scale consists of 8 sections .
34 
• Section  1 – patient  questionnaire completed  by [CONTACT_102]  (help  to document the answer 
may be provided by [CONTACT_84452]) (11 items)  
• Section  2 – myoclonus at rest (frequency  and am plitude, 16 items)  

Protocol  
 Study:  000000233834  CONFIDENTIAL  
Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_278996]  2023  Page  48 of 73  
 • Section  3 – assesses stimulus  sensitivity  of myoclonus (17 items)  
• Section  4 – severity  of myoclonus with action  (frequency and amplitude,  20 items)  
• Section  5 – assess performance on functional tests (5 items)  
• Section  6 – physician rating  of patient’s  global disability  (1 item)  
• Section  7 – presence of negative myoclonus (1 item)  
• Section  8 – severity  of negative myoclonus (1 item).  
Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, except for section 3 (where stimulus sensitivity is either 
present  [score  1] or absent  [score  0]), section  7 (negative myoclonus present  [score  1] or absent 
[score 0]), and section 8 (scores: 0 to 3).  
Total  scores  for sections  1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the UMRS  are calculated  by [CONTACT_231362]. The 
maximum scores for these sections are 44, 17, 28, 4, 1, and 3, respectively. Sections 2 and 4 include ratings of frequency and amplitude of myoclonic jerks affecting each body region. The 
scores of these sections are calculated by [CONTACT_231363]. The maximum score for sections 2 and 4 are 128 and 160, respectively.  
In this study, only the UMRS  Sections  4 and 5 will be evaluated  at Visit 2 (baseline)  and Visits  [ADDRESS_278997] and standardized assessment to complete with the EMG and 
accelerometer device recoding myoclonus and allow for characterizing data to be collected in 
anticipation of repeat dose studies in this population.  
The UMRS will be conducted while the patients are wearing the EMG - accelerometer device. 
This provides a structured  set of activities  that will produce action -induced myoclonus and ataxia 
that can be measured clinically via UMRS scoring and objectively using the EMG and accelerometer data. The UMRS assessment will be videoed by [CONTACT_3665], as per the 
videography instructions provided in the original paper by [CONTACT_231364]. The videos will not be 
blurred to obscure patients’ faces as this will compromise the ability for centralized/independent 
rating of the videoed assessment.  
7.5.5.  Measure of Ataxic Dysarthria: Speech  and Vocal Tests 
Speech analysis has been clinically and technically validated to assess motor, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and 
cognitive symptomatology as
sociated  with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, 
speech analysis can pi[INVESTIGATOR_231311] – a common sign in patients with MEAK 
who show ataxic dysarthria due to cerebellar  dysfunction and characterized  by [CONTACT_231365] (also referred to as cerebellar ‘scanning’ speech).  

Protocol

Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_278998]  2023  Page  49 of 73  
 A battery of speech tests will be utilized to assess patients’ speech and derive specific measures 
of dysarthria. These tests will include: Sentence Reading (2 minutes), Diadochokinetic Rate (DDK)  (<1 minute),  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_231312]  (1 minute),  and Sustained  Phonation (<1 minute). A full 
description of the assessments will be included in the manual. These assessments are not associated with any risks.  
Speech  tests will be conducted at Visit  2 (baseline)  and Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6. The patient’s  native 
language, including country of origin (eg, English – [LOCATION_003]), will be captured as part of patient’s 
demographics.  
7.5.6.  Measures  of Early  Visual  Processing  
The measures  of early  visual processing will include tests of binocular rivalry  (10 minutes)  and 
internal  noise estimation  (15 minutes).  The performance of these  tasks is assumed  to depend on 
proper inhibitory interneuron functioning in visual cortex.  
Measures of visual processing will be conducted on Visit 2 (baseline) and Visits [ADDRESS_278999] at any time if it is not tolerated.  
7.5.7.  Measures  of Auditory  Processing:  Audiology Tests 
Otoacoustic Emissions  
The OAEs are recordable sounds generated by [CONTACT_231366].  OAEs  assess the functioning of the medial  olivocochlear (MOC)  efferent  system  and 
bilateral connections between the [ADDRESS_279000] the periphery from acoustic trauma.  
When  OAEs  are recorded,  no response from  the patient is required  and they will sit quietly  while 
tones are played to their ears. The OAEs will be collected for each ear .35 There are no known 
risks for OAEs and the process is well tolerated.  
The OAEs will  be assessed  on Visit 2 (baseline)  and Visits  3 and 5. 
Words- in-Noise  (WIN)  Test Performance 
The WIN test was developed as an instrument to quantify the ability of listeners to recognize 
monosyllabic words in background noise36 It provides a quantified measurement of auditory 
processing by [CONTACT_231367] a measure of the ability 
of cortical circuits to separate relevant from irrelevant information. There is evidence that 
inhibitory interneurons play a critical part in this function.

Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_279001]  that 
they hear back to the trained study staff. The outcome measure is the SNR at which 50% of 
words can be correctly identified as calculated using the Spearman -Kärber equation.  
In a previous study, treatment  with a related  compound (AUT00206) led to an improved ability 
of patients  with schizophrenia to perform  this task;  that is, they were  able to recognize  words at 
more difficult listening levels (ie, lower SNRs).  
The WIN  test will be assessed  during Visit 2 (baseline)  and Visits  [ADDRESS_279002] provided convincing evidence that dysfunction of 
PV interneurons affects both resting state as well as stimulus induced and evoked gamma 
oscillations  (power and phase synchrony) with an increase of power of resting  state gamma  but a 
decrease of power in the stimulus induced and evoked gamma oscillations and reduced phase synchrony. 
It is expected that patients with MEAK will show such changes, ie, increased power in resting 
state gamma  but deficits  in evoked and induced gamma  frequency  during the presentation  of the 
chirp stimulus in both power and phase synchrony. Treatment with AUT00201 is expected to normalize such abnormalities.  
EEG  recordings are noninvasive and are not associated  with any risks.  
A resting  state EEG  recoding will be conducted on Visit 2 (baseline)  and Visits  3 and 5. 
7.5.9.  Clinician  and Patient  Impressions of Treatment  
The clinician and the patient will be asked (separately) if they believe they received active or 
placebo  treatment  at Visits  4 and 6 (24 hours ±2 hours after each dose) and if they perceived  any 
change in their condition.  
7.6. Demographic Data  
The following demographic data will be collected:  year of birth  and age (in years)  at baseline, 
gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index, dominant arm, whether they have a vagal nerve stimulator, whether they follow a ketogenic diet, native language (specified by 
[CONTACT_231368]  [eg, English  – [LOCATION_003]]),  and for females  only, start date of last menstrual  cycle 
and normal cycle length (in days).

 7.6.1.  Medical  History  
The patient’s relevant medical history will be collected. The patient will be asked specifically 
regarding their history of seizures, headaches/migraines, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_222267]. They will 
also be asked  regarding their history of fever  and if they/their  caregiver  had any impression  of an 
improvement of MEAK symptoms during the fever.  
7.6.2.  Patient -reported  Outcome  Measurement  - Ataxia  
The patient -reported  outcome measurement  (PROM)  of ataxia is a valid  and reliable  measure of 
motor ataxia, quality of life, and mental health .36 It is a 70 -item questionnaire completed on a  
5-point Likert  scale.  It will be evaluated  on Visit 1 (Screening).  
7.6.3.  Patient  Top 3 Concerns  
Patients  will be asked  at Visit  1 (Screening)  to give their top 3 concerns  regarding their condition 
and functioning in their daily  life. They  will be then asked  to score  the severity  of the concern  on 
a 7-point Likert scale.

 8. SAMPLE SIZE  AND DATA ANALYSES  
All statistical analysis will conform to the relevant International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) requirements,  including but not limited  to those  set out in ICH documents E3 and E9. 
Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.2 or later will be used for the analysis.  
A detailed  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be finalized  prior to database lock and data 
unblinding. The SAP will document all analyses procedures.  
8.1. Sample  Size Determination  
MEAK  is an ultra-rare disorder. This study will aim to include all adult patients  with MEAK 
known to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9814]- investigator(s). It is hoped that approximately  
6 to 10 patients  can be  recruited.  
Therefore, a formal power analysis to estimate a desired sample size is not useful. Primary 
endpoint is safety and tolerability of AUT00201. Nonetheless, a sample size of 8 provides an 
80% power to detect  an effect  size of approximately  0.[ADDRESS_279005] at a one-sided 
alpha level of 0.1 (as will be used for the primary outcome measure, the composite response score).  
8.2. Analysis Populations  
The following analysis  populations will be included for this study: 
Safety  Population: All patients  who received  at least 1 dose of IP. 
Pharmacokinetic Concentration  Population : All patients  who received  at least [ADDRESS_279006] 1 quantifiable PK concentration at any scheduled PK timepoint.  
Pharmacokinetic  Parameter Population : All patients  in the PK Concentration Population for 
whom PK parameters can be derived. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
Pharmacodynamic Population: All patients  in the Safety  Population who have an evaluable 
baseline and at least [ADDRESS_279007] 1 PD parameter.  
In all populations, patients  will be analyzed  according  to treatment  actually  received  during the 
specific treatment period (before and after the crossover) regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized.  
8.3. General  Considerations  
Standard summary statistics for continuous baseline and outcome variables are: N, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum, and 95% confidence 
intervals  (CIs) at baseline and each timepoint  at which  the measures  are obtained. In addition, the 
same descriptive statistics will be obtained for change from baseline for each timepoint at which the measures are obtained. The standard summary statistics for categorical baseline and outcome

 variables  are: count and proportion (expressed  as percentage).  Geometric  mean  and coefficient  of 
variation will also be presented for PK concentrations and the PK parameters.  
The minimum and maximum values will be presented to the same number of decimal places as 
the raw data collected on the eCRF (or to 3 significant figures for derived parameters). The 
mean,  median,  and percentiles  (eg, Q1 and Q3) will be presented  to one additional decimal  place. 
The SD and standard error will be presented to [ADDRESS_279009] measurement  obtained before IP administration. 
However, if review of blinded data indicates a stability of the measurement on days when patients do not receive treatment, baseline may also be defined as the average across Visits 2 
and 4. This will be described in the SAP.  
All summaries  will be presented  by [CONTACT_231369].  Summary  tables 
and figures will be supported by [CONTACT_231370].  
8.4. Disposition  of Patients  
The disposition of all patients  in the safety  population will be summarized  including: number of 
patients randomized, number completing the study and by [CONTACT_3148], and number discontinued from the study.  
8.5. Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics  will be presented  overall  using descriptive 
statistics for continuous and categorical data.  
8.6. Medical  History  and Prior/Concomitant Medication  
Medical  history records  will be summarized  overall  using descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_231371] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Prior or concomitant medications  will be summarized  separately  using descriptive statistics  for 
continuous and categorical data.  
8.7. Safety  Analysis 
Summaries  and listings  of safety  data will use the safety  population.  
8.7.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA)  current  at the time of database lock. All AEs will be listed.  The number of 
patients with at least 1 TEAE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_231372].

 For each of the following, the number of patients  with AEs will be summarized  by [CONTACT_231373]:  
• TEAEs  by [CONTACT_1198] 
• Drug -related  TEAEs  by [CONTACT_1198]. 
Patients  with one or more TEAE will be counted only once,  at the maximum causality,  for each 
SOC and PT. AEs with missing severity and/or causality will be treated as severe and possibly 
related, respectively. Adverse events leading to withdrawal, deaths, and SAEs will be listed 
separately (fatal events will be listed separately from nonfatal events).  
8.7.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Data from hematology and clinical biochemistry will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Any 
laboratory value outside the reference interval  for that variable will be flagged  per Site’s  standard 
process.  
8.7.3.  Other Safety  Measures  
Vital signs at each planned assessment,  and change in vital signs from  baseline at each planned 
postbaseline assessment, will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Vital signs of potential clinical importance will be listed separately.  
ECG  variables  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_3148].  Changes from  Screening  will be summarized

variation and the 95% CI of the arithmetic mean. For log- transformed variables, all of the above 
plus the geometric mean, its 95% CI, and the SD of the log- transformed variables will be 
provided. 
Plasma  concentrations and PK parameters  will be listed  and summarized,  by [CONTACT_3148],  using 
descriptive statistics. Individual and mean (±SD) plasma concentration -time profiles will be

Plasma  concentrations for AEDs  for which  assays are commercially  available at the sponsor’s 
chosen bioanalytical laboratory will be listed only.  
8.10. Exploratory Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all exploratory measures. If indicated, exploratory 
outcome measures will be evaluated using paired t -tests, repeated measures analysis of 
covariance and McNemar tests, or an alternative test for non -binary categorical data, if 
applicable,  for change from  baseline of continuous and categorical  (ie, nominal data).  Details 
will be provided in the SAP.  
A response matrix  will be used to assess the overall  effect  of AUT00201 on signs and symptoms 
of MEAK. A response matrix will guard against ‘cherry pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875]’ of results but ensure the detection of a clinically meaningful signal. Details will be provided in a separate SAP.

 10. APPENDICES  
Appendix  1 – Adverse Event  Definitions 
Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical  occurrence associated  with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. This includes the following:  
• Any clinically  significant worsening of a pre-existing  condition.  
• Note:  Emergence of a new pathogen associated  with a clinical  event  during therapy  at a 
site other than the initial site of infection will be considered to be an AE.  
• Any recurrence of a pre-existing  condition. 
• An AE occurring from  overdose of a sponsor study drug whether  accidental  or intentional 
(ie, a dose higher than that prescribed by a health care professional for clinical reasons).  
• An AE occurring from  abuse of a sponsor  study drug (ie, use for nonclinical reasons). 
• An AE that has been  associated  with the discontinuation of the use of a sponsor study 
drug. 
Note:  A procedure is not an AE,  but the  reason  for a procedure may be  an AE. 
A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition (including a condition being treated) that is 
diagnosed before the patient  signs the informed consent form  (ICF) and diagnosed prior to or at 
the latest  during screening  procedure. These  medical  occurrences  should be documented as part 
of the patient’s medical history.  
The questions concerning whether  the condition existed  before the start of the active phase of the 
study and whether it has increased in severity and/or frequency will be used to determine 
whether an event is a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE). An AE is considered to be 
treatment -emergent if (1) it is not present when the active phase of the study begins and is not a 
chronic condition that is part of the patient’s  medical  history, or (2) it is present  at the start of the 
active phase of the study or as part of the patient’s medical history, but the severity or frequency increases during the active phase. The active phase of the study begins at the time of the first 
dose of the study drug. The active phase of the study ends at the follow -up visit.  
Reporting  of Adverse Events  
At each visit,  the
 Investigator, or delegate,  will determine whether  or not any AEs have occurred. 
Nonleading questions such as “How are you feeling today?” or “Have you had any health concerns since your last visit?” should be used to elicit the patient to report any possible AEs.  
Independently from  the time of the next visit,  the patient  can revisit the Investigator in case of an 
AE. If any AEs have occurred, they will be recorded in the AE section of the electronic case 
report form (eCRF) and in the patient’s source documents. If known, the diagnosis should be 
recorded, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms.

Sponsor  Reference:  AUT022201  
[ADDRESS_279020]  2023  Page  60 of 73  
 Adverse event  reporting begins from  the time of informed  consent and ends at follow-up (end of 
study) visit.  
Assessment  of Severity  
The Investigator will be asked  to provide an assessment  of the severity  of the AE using the 
following categories:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical  or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate;  minimal,  local,  or noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting  age- 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231320];  disabling; limiting  self-care 
activities of daily living  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening  consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death  related  to AE. 
Relationship  to Study  Treatment  
The Investigator will make a determination  of the relationship  of the AE to the study drug using 
a four -category system according to the following guidelines:  
• Not related : when  the AE is definitely  caused  by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical  state,  or the study 
procedure/conditions. 
• Unlikely  Related : when  the temporal  association  between  the AE and the drug is such 
that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE.  
• Possibly  Related : when  the AE follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from  the time of 
drug administration but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or the 
study procedures/conditions.  
• Related : when  the AE follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from  administration  of the 
drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause - 
effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced.  
Action  Taken  for Adverse Events  
T
he Investigator or designee will record  the action  taken  for the AE in the eCRF.  Actions taken 
will include:  
• Patient  withdrawn : The medication  schedule was modified  through termination  of the 
prescribed regimen of medication and the patient was withdrawn from the study.  
• No action taken.

 Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All (Serious)AEs  that are ongoing at the time of discontinuation, or that develop prior  to the final 
Follow- up Telephone Call, will be followed for [ADDRESS_279022] (IP) (ie, where a causal 
relationship  between  an IP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility)  related  to any dose 
should be considered adverse drug reactions.  
For marketed medicinal products, a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and 
which  occurs  at doses normally  used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy  of diseases  or 
for modification of physiological function, is to be considered an adverse drug reaction.  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which  is not consistent with the applicable product information  (eg, Investigator’s Brochure [IB] 
for an unapproved IP).  
Serious  Adverse Events  
An SAE  is any AE occurring at any dose that meets  1 or more  of the following criteria:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  (see below)  
• Requires  patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231321]  (see below)  
• Results  in a persistent  or significant disability  or incapacity  (see below)  
• Results  in a congenital anomaly  or birth defect  
• Results  in an important medical  event  (see below). 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231322], based  on appropriate medical  judgment, 
they may jeopardize  the patient  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed  above. Examples  of such events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A life-threatening adverse event is any AE that places the patient at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it
 occurred. A life -threatening event does not include an event that might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death  as it actually  occurred.  For example,  drug-induced hepatitis  that resolved  without evidence 
of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening, even though drug- induced hepatitis 
of a more severe nature can be fatal. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231323].

[ADDRESS_279023]  2023  Page  62 of 73  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for considering an AE to be 
serious.  In the absence of an AE, the participating  Investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81889]. This is the case in the following situations:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760]. Day or night survey visits  for biopsy or surgery required  by [CONTACT_231378].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure followed by [CONTACT_5243]  (eg, stent  removal  after surgery).  This should be recorded  in the study 
file. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231324].  
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231325] a pre-existing  condition that 
has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (eg, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a total knee replacement due to a pre- existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened 
during the study).  
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions (ie, the AE resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage,  or disruption in the patient’s  bodily function/structure, physical activities,  or quality of 
life). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in those situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or  
result  in death,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  disability,  or incapacity.  These  include events  that may jeopardize 
the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the 
definition of serious. Such events should usually be considered as serious.

Investigator Documentation Responsibilities  
All individual, patient- specific study data will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11- compliant 
electronic data capture (EDC) system on an eCRF  in a timely fashion.  All data generated from 
external sources (eg, central laboratory of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics) and 
transmitted  to the sponsor or designee electronically  will be integrated  with the patient’s  eCRF 
data in accordance with the Data Management Plan.  
An eCRF  must  be completed  for each patient  who signs an ICF and undergoes any pre-screening 
or screening procedures, according to the eCRF completion instructions. The sponsor, or CRO, will review the supporting source documentation against the data entered into the eCRFs to 
verify the accuracy of the electronic data. The Investigator will ensure that corrections are made 
to the eCRFs and that data queries are resolved in a timely fashion by [CONTACT_5984].  
The Investigator will sign and date the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature 
[CONTACT_42540]. These  signatures will indicate  that the Investigator reviewed  and approved the data on 
the eCRF, the data queries, and the site notifications.

Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_989979] places on the face to show signs of aging, in the 
form of lateral canthal lines or Crow’s Feet. Genetic differences and environmental toxins, 
predominantly ultraviolet light exposure and cigarette smoking,  may alter the rate of this 
normal aging process2. 
 
Over the past two decades, there has been increasing demand for aesthetic procedures 
to reverse the effects of aging, particularly in the facial area, and treatment of Crow's F eet 
is among the most frequent of corrective treatment requests. A number of tec hniques 
have been developed to meet the increasing demand for aesthetic procedures to reverse 
the signs of aging . The se include:  incisional and excisional  surgery, various resurfacing 
procedures, and the use of temporary or semi -permanent , injectable derma l fillers such 
as allogeneic or xenogeneic collagen, hyaluronic acid, and autologous fat cells. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l 
agents, such as r etinoic acids, glycolic acids  and lactic acids, are other common methods 
to minimize Crow’s Feet  and other facial wrinkles.   
 
Injection  of botulinum  toxin type A (BoNT A) is now one of the most common  aesthetic 
procedures performed  and there is a considerable body of medical literature 
demonstrating its safety  and efficacy in aesthetic indications3. On a molecular level, 
botulinum  toxin p revents the release of preformed mediators, such as acetylcholine, from 
motor nerve endings leading to a flaccid paralysis.  
 
BoNTA  is an effective treatment for Crow’s Feet  and is associated with high subject 
satisfaction . However, the treatment requires multiple injections  into a well innervated, 
sensitive area that is prone to bleeding and bruising and close to delicate organs  such as 
the eyes  and lachrymal glands . In addition, misplacement of injection can lead to 
unwanted effects in non -target  areas. Therefore, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_177490], avoiding the discomforts and potential side effects of 
injections, would be highly desirable.    
 
Several studies have been conducted assessing the dose -response of th e topi[INVESTIGATOR_177491], ET-014, in the treatment of Crow’s Feet. The product was well 
tolerated . This current clinical trial seeks to expand on the existing work.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
In a previous study ET -01 was applied at doses of up to 1 ,150 U after skin pre -
conditioning with microneedle arrays of the type AdminStamp. The purpose of this 
Phase  2 study is to repeat the prior study using a different device for skin pre -conditioning, 
i.e. a Dermaroller.   
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Design  
The study will be a n out-patient, prospectively randomized, double -blind, vehicle -
controlled, two-armed, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], sequential ascending dose  group , multi -center  
clinical trial. Each cohort will be fully enrolled and complete the Week  4 visit to allow for 
a safety review before initiating enrollment of the next dose group.  
3.2 Treatment Groups / Sample Size  
The following dose groups and sample sizes are planned:   
 
Dose Group   Vehicle  690 U  1,100 U  ∑ Total  
Cohort 1  N = 12 24   
Cohort 2  N = 12  24  
Total  N= 24 24 24 72 
 
The treatment area  will be preconditioned with  a Dermaroller  MC 905 , 0.5 mm. ET-01 will 
be applied immediately after pre -conditioning.  
3.3 Efficacy Parameters  and Timing  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Crow’s Feet Wrinkle Scale (CFW), which is a 
published validated, photo -numeric guide that grades severity of lateral canthal lines into 
one of the five categories of 0=none, 1=mi nimal , 2=mild, 3= moderate, and 4=severe. ( see 
Appendix  A for details). Using the same scale, assessments will be made by [CONTACT_17588], t he 
investigator (IGA) and the subjects (SSA). Assessments are ma de “static” to avoid recall 
bias.  
 
The IGA  and SSA  are recorded separately for the right and left canthal areas , both “at 
rest” and “on contraction” . The IGA and SSA will be recorded at each visit.   
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 8 of 42 
 
 Confidential    3.4 Safety Parameters and Timing  
Safety will be assessed dur ing the study by [CONTACT_177508], review of 
concomitant treatments and laboratory data. Clinical adverse event reporting will be 
conducted at each visit.  
 
All laboratory measurements will be performed by a central laboratory using appropriate 
and validated methods. Values will be reported to the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Laboratory reference range values will be described in the laboratory manual. 
Investigators will assess all out of range values as being clinically significant or not.  
3.4.1  Vital  signs  
Weight, height (Screening visit only) temperature, resting pulse , blood pressure, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. Vital signs will be recorded at every visit . 
3.4.2  Muscle Weakness or Paralysis  
Participants will be monitored for potential signs of botulinum  induced muscle weakness 
or paralysis. Subjects will be evaluated for Signs of Botulinum Toxin Spread ( muscle 
weakness  - ocular and the extremities) or difficulty swallowing or breathing (crani al nerve 
assessment, Appendix  B). 
 
The neurologic assessments are made at Baseline, Week 1, 2 , and Week 4.  
3.4.3  Hematology  
Non-fasting clinical hematology e valuations are:  
hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, with a differential, 
and a platelet count.  
 
Non-fasting clinical hematology evaluations will be performed at Week 0 (Baseline) , 
Week  4, and Week  26/End of Study . 
3.4.[ADDRESS_989980] non-fasting chemistry panel will be performed which will include the following 
parameters:  
glucose, uric acid, calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, chloride, alkaline 
phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, 
bicarbonate, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase , total protein, 
albumin.

 Confidential    4 MEDICATION  AND DOSING  
4.1 Dose Rationale  
Finding evidence of a safe and effective dose is the purpose of this study. In previous 
clinical stud ies doses of up to 2,000 U were applied under occlusion and were well 
tolerate d. In study LCL -206 which employed microneedle skin preconditioning , doses of 
up to 1,150  U were applied safely. In this study, a different microneedle device is used 
for skin pre -conditioning. In case this may lead to somewhat better relative bio -availability, 
this study , LCL-208, will start at 690 U or 5/[ADDRESS_989982] and diluents will be provided in kits containing 3 mL dropper bottles that contain 
either ET-01 or Vehicle.  
 
The following dose groups and sample sizes are planned:  
 
Dose Group   Vehicle  690 U  1,100 U  ∑ Total  
Cohort 1  N = 12 24   
Cohort 2  N = 12  24  
Total  N= [ADDRESS_989983]’s canthal areas. 
The site will be instructed to make sure no syringes or needles are present in the 
treatment room b efore study medication is brought into the room.  
 
The treatment area is the periorbital region in the distribution of the muscles responsible 
for the Crow’s Feet wrinkles. The muscle being treated to reduce the Crow’s Feet wrinkle 
– the orbicularis oculi  – is illustrated Figure 1.

In general, the treatment region begins on the bony rim of the orbit, extending laterally to 
approximately one centimeter from t he exterior edge of the hairline, 1 - 1.5 cm above and 
1.5 – 2 cm below a horizontal line emanating from the lateral canthus to the hairline. This 
area of application is illustrated by [CONTACT_177510][INVESTIGATOR_50615]:

Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_989984]’s treatment. In no  case, however, should ET-01 ever be 
applied within the area circumscribed by [CONTACT_177511].  
 
The clinical investigator will wipe the periorbital region with an alcohol wipe and then dry 
thoroughly with a cotton swab. The treatment area will be pre -conditioned by [CONTACT_725322] , applying approximately 2-3 pounds of pressure, to the skin. The 
location of the area of pre -conditioning are illustrated by [CONTACT_725323] 2. 
There will be ten (10) rolls made along the bony rim of the orbital cavity  in an up -and-
down motion . After each roll of the Dermaroller, the Dermaroller will be lifted off the skin. 
The first roll will start at the area of the skin corresponding to the superior aspect of the 
outlined white box and then rolled downward. The second roll will start at the area of the 
skin corresponding to the inferior aspect of the outlined whi te box - slightly offset from the 
first roll - and then rolled upward. Thereafter, each roll will start at the area of the skin 
corresponding to the superior aspect of the outlined white box, followed by a roll that will 
start at the area of the skin corre sponding to the inferior aspect of the outlined white box.  
 
Immediately thereafter, u sing a gloved finger, the investigator will massage [ADDRESS_989985] will be positioned on an examination table or fully 
reclined examination chair such that his/her temple will slightly slant backwards and to 
the side, directing any run -off away from the eyes and into the hairline. The subject will 
be instructed to close his/her eyes which will then be covered with eye covers, e.g., IPL -
Aid™ Disposable Eye Shields, and an absorbent paper or cloth.  
 
There are [ADDRESS_989986] Article are

visits due to safety reasons or at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor. All 
unscheduled visits will describe the reason for the visit in the  electronic  Case Report 
Form. Some of the procedures that may be completed at an Unscheduled Study Vis it are 
as follows:  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 23 of 42 
 
 Confidential    • Review of adverse events and concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• Collection of  blood samples for laboratory safety testing  
• Urine pregnancy testing  
 
[ADDRESS_990004]  will participate for up to 26 weeks. There will be a (Qualifying) Baseline V isit 
on Week  0 and seven  in-office visits at Week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 , and 26. 
7.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177500] a sequential, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_42970], dose -escalation trial. 
Enrollment will be halted after each cohort until a safety review has been completed.  
 
• Enrollment will be halted in the event that one serious adverse event  (SAE) , 
considered to be probably or d efinitely related to the administration of study 
medication, is observed.  
 
• Enrollment will be halted in the event that one AE is observed considered to be 
indicative of distant spread of study medication or unintended exposure to other 
beings.  
 
• The Sponso r may stop the study in its entirety or discontinue individual study 
centers at its discretion for any reason or, e.g. if it is observed that the protocol or 
sound clinical practices are not being followed, or for any other reasons.  
 
The study protocol cal ls for only one single application of study medication at Baseline 
(Week 0). Since there is no continuous treatment, no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_725320] #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_990005] s will be queried with regards to concomitant medication at all study visits.  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Adverse event reporting will be handled in accordance with the IRB requirements and the 
requirements of other regulatory authorities that may apply, e.g. the Food and Drug 
Administration.  
 
Adverse Events reporting will be solicited by [CONTACT_105] -leading "How Do Y ou Feel" questions. 
Subtle symptoms of local or systemic spread of toxin effect would be unlikely to be 
recognized by [CONTACT_177517]. Therefore, study participants will be 
asked if they experienced weakness, lethargy, or difficulty sw allowing or breathing. In 
addition, information derived from change in concomitant medications, laboratory 
analyses, and clinical observations will be evaluated for possible indications for side 
effects. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses o r reactions to concurrent 
medications will also be recorded. The Investigator must monitor the condition of the 
subject throughout the study from the time of obtaining informed consent until the final 
study visit.  
 
Any adverse event, including both observ ed and volunteered problems, complaints, and 
symptoms, will be recorded on the Adverse Event page s of the electronic Case Report 
Form. When an adverse event occurs, the following information and assessments should 
be recorded in the adverse event section o f the eCRF:  
 
• The signs, symptoms or diagnosis or the event,  
• The date and time of onset of the event using the 24 -hour clock where midnight is 
00:00 and noon is 12:00. Onset is the date when the first sign or symptoms were first 
noted.  
• Date of recovery/ resolution  
• The adverse event severity/ intensity using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.2  
• The relationship of the event to the study drug as outlined in Section 8.1.1   
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 25 of 42 
 
 Confidential    • Any other actions required  such as therapy, medication, treatment or diagnostic 
procedure  
• Seriousness of the event using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.3  
• Outcome (recovered, recovered with sequelae, not yet recovered, death)  
 
Follow -up of a subject should be conducted until resolution of the adverse event or until 
the medical condition is stable. The investigator is responsibl e for the appropriate medical 
management of all adverse events.  
 
Adverse events will be analyzed and reported after unblinding of the treatment code within 
the clinical study report. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_177518] [ADDRESS_990006] that occurs during use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the 
drug; this includes accidental injuries, reasons  for any change in medication (drug and/or 
dose), and reasons for surgical procedures. It is to be noted that procedures are not 
adverse events. Abnormal laboratory values or clinically significant changes in laboratory 
values are not adverse events, but t he underlying reasons are. Regardless of the severity 
or relationship to the investigational drug, all adverse events occurring during the study 
period must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is one that has not been previousl y observed, or one that 
is of a specificity or severity not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure.  
8.1.1  Relationship to Study Drug  
The following definitions to assess the causal relationship between an adverse event 
and the study drug should be use d:  
 
Not Related : The event is clearly related to other factors such as a subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications.  
 
Possibly Related :  The event has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug 
administration and follows a known response pattern to the study 
drug. However, a potential alternate etiology may be responsible for 
the event.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 26 of 42 
 
 Confidential     
Related :  The event follows a clear -cut temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration and follows a known response patt ern to the 
study drug and either occurs immediately following study drug 
administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on 
repeat exposure.  
8.1.2  Adverse Event Severity  
Mild: A mild adverse event is one that the symptoms are barely 
noticeable to a subject. It does not influence performance or prevent 
a subject from carrying on with normal life activities.  
 
Moderate :  A moderate adverse event is one that the symptoms make the 
subject uncomfortable and causes some impairment to normal life 
activitie s. Treatment for symptom(s) may be required.  
 
Severe :  A severe adverse event is one that the symptoms cause severe 
discomfort to the subject and severely limits the subject’s normal 
daily activities. Treatment for symptom(s) is given.  
 
Note that “serious ” and “severe ” are not synonymous. A serious 
adverse event must fulfill the requirements listed in the definition 
below, see section 8.1.3 . 
 
When intensity change s or occurs more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event will be listed. If the intensity category changes over a number of 
days, then these mini -events or changes will be recorded separately (i.e., having distinct 
onset days).  
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is an event that is:  
• fatal / results in death  
• life-threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• requires or prolongs subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109]  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Life Threatening  is defined as an event in which a subject is at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it was more severe.  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 27 of 42 
 
 Confidential    Death : The death of an enrolled subject is not an event, but an outcome. It is the event 
that resulted in a fatal outcome that must be reported.  
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
 
ANY SER IOUS ADVERSE EVENT, INCLUDING DEATH DUE TO ANY CAUSE, WHICH 
OCCURS DURING THIS INVESTIGATION, WHETHER OR NOT RELATED TO THE 
STUDY MEDICATION, MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY (DURING NORMAL 
BUSINESS HOURS, 9 AM TO 5 PM, ET) TO THE SPONSOR/MEDICAL MONITOR.  
 
Any serious adverse event should be reported to Eirion Therapeutics  by [CONTACT_18623] 
e-mail within [ADDRESS_990007]  be sent to Eirion Therapeutics . The original 
SAE report form should be maintained in the Regulatory Binder. It is the Sponsor’s 
responsibility to fulfill reporting obligations to the FDA . 
 
Report s of serious adverse events should be made by [CONTACT_183434]:  
 
Eirion Therapeutics  Clinical Development Department:  [PHONE_3833]  
or [PHONE_3834]  
Serious adverse events associated with the use of the study medication will be reported 
to appropriate regulator y agencies, investigators, and the IRB by [CONTACT_1034].  
8.1.4  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others are:  
• Any serious event (including on -site and off -site adverse events, injuries, side 
effects, deaths or other problems) which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_177502], involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly related to the 
research procedures.  
• Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that 
involves risk or has the potential to recur.  
• Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.  
• Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subjec t or others.  
• Any other serious and possibly related event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_177503].  
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_990008] at or after the Week  4 Visit will be permitted to remain in the study.  
 
Medically accepted methods of birth control are surgical sterilization (tubal sterilization or 
hysterectomy), vaginal ring contraceptive, patch contraceptive, injectable contraceptive, 
implantable contraceptive, Intrauterine Device (IUD), diaphragm, condom , or spermicidal 
gel or foam. Oral contraceptives (prescribed birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) are also acceptable 
provided this method has been used for at least [ADDRESS_990009] Population(s) for Analysis  
9.1.[ADDRESS_990010] (LOCF) procedure will be used for each pos t-
baseline visit with missing data. The exception to this procedure will be the treatment of 
missing data only on one side of the face, as discussed below. Subjects who are lost to 
follow -up and who do not have at least one post -baseline visit will not be included in the 
analysis.  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 29 of 42 
 
 Confidential    An additional analysis may be performed in the per protocol population. Subjects will be 
considered “per protocol” if they complete the final visit  evaluation without a major  
protocol violation. No data imputations will be made f or this analysis.  
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1  Study Population  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, 
gender, race, height and weight) and background characteristics for all randomized 
subjects by [CONTACT_1570]. Past/c oexistent medical history information for all 
randomized subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing. Baseline assessments of 
LCL severity will also be presented as background characteristics of the population and 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Categorical measures 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. Continuous measures will be 
summarized with means, standard deviations and ranges (min and max).  
 
Descriptive statistics wi ll be used to summarize study medication compliance and 
exposure for all randomized subjects. Prior and concomitant medication information for 
all enrolled subjects will be presented in a by -subject listing.  
9.2.2  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The IGA and SSA scores  (Crow’s Feet Wrinkle scale) are evaluations performed by [CONTACT_177519], respectively, measured both at rest and on contraction. For 
analysis purposes they will be averaged between left and right sides prior to analysis. In 
the event one  side has missing data for a visit, the result from the side with non -missing 
data will be used instead of an average value. These scores will be treated as continuous 
measures for calculating means and performing ANOVA analyses, and they will be used 
as d escribed below to derive binary indicators of treatment success, which will be 
analyzed as dichotomous measures.  
 
Efficacy analyses will be  based on the assessments  from the treatment area s, i.e. the 
lateral canthal area only. Alpha will be set at 0.05 usi ng two -tailed tests. The Crow’s Feet 
Wrinkle scale  is an ordinal categorical scale  ranging from 0 to 4. As described above, left - 
and right -side values will be averaged, and the averaged values will be used for analysis.  
 
The Investigator’s Global A ssessment (IGA) is the primary efficacy parameter , and the 
evaluation of each active drug group  vs. vehicle will be the primary comparison s. A 
comparison between the two active drug groups will also be performed , along with a 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-[ADDRESS_990011] ive drug groups pooled vs vehicle . Results will be 
summarized for each treatment group and at each visit using frequency distributions.  
 
For the primary efficacy analysis , "IGA on contraction" (IGA -C) data will be analyzed at 
each visit  to evaluate the pr oportion of patients achieving treatment success  (responder) . 
For this analysis, a respon se will be defined as a reduction from baseline in IGA -C by [CONTACT_12697] [ADDRESS_990012] -baseline visit to evaluate the proportion of 
patients achieving a composite treatment success, defined as a response on both  the 
IGA-C and SSA -C scales. The analysis model s for the primary efficacy analysis will be 
used.  
 
Treatment success based on the SSA alone will also be analyzed using the above 
definition and analysis model s. 
 
In addition, mean c hange from Baseline IGA will be analyzed using a n analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA ) model.  The first model contrast s will be separate  evaluation s of the  
effect of each active group vs. vehicle.  Additional contrast s will be performed  comparing 
pooled active treatment groups vs. vehicle  and comparing the two active treatment 
groups . Contrasts will be made within the ANOVA model using LSMeans and the 
appropria te pooled error term, with no alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons. An 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline average IGA score as the 
covariate will be used if it yields greater sensitivity than the ANOVA model.  
 
A similar model will be  used to analyze mean change from baseline SSA.  
 
Primary and secondary analyses will also be performed based on IGA and SSA 
evaluations made at rest.  
 
Study #: ET-01-LCL-208 September  06, 201 8 Page 31 of 42 
 
 Confidential    9.2.4  Safety Analysis  
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events. Other 
safety data (e.g., vital signs and special tests) will be summarized as appropriate.  
Adverse events will be coded using a current MedDRA dictionary and summarized by 
[CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects having a ny 
adverse event, having an adverse event in each body system (System Organ Class), and 
having each coded individual adverse event. Other adverse event information collected 
(e.g., severity/intensity or relationship to study medication) will be listed as a ppropriate.  
Data from other tests will be listed, notable values will be flagged, and any other 
information collected will be listed as appropriate. No inferential statistical tests are 
planned for safety data but may be performed on an ad -hoc basis to hig hlight any 
comparisons that may warrant further consideration.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_990013] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTATION  
Data reflecting subject experience with the drug under investiga tion will be recorded on 
appropriate source documents  and in the eCRF . The investigator understands that the 
office and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725321] a properly  authorized employee of the Sponsor 
or the Department of Health and Human Services, under the supervision of the

verify the accuracy and completeness of the eCRF s, assure compliance with protocol 
requirements, applicable FDA regulations, IRB and ICH -GCP Guidelines, confirm that 
investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled, and resolve any inconsistencies in the stu dy 
records. The sponsor may stop the study if it is observed that the protocol or sound clinical 
practices are not being followed.  
 
[ADDRESS_990015] comply with all the requirements set forth in 21 CFR 
§ 56. The IRB is responsible for the initial approval, any amendments, advertiseme nts, 
and continuing review of the proposed clinical study. The IRB will review any written 
materials given to the subject and the Informed Consent Forms. The investigator must 
retain a copy of the approval letter that contains the study number, protocol ti tle and 
identification of all documents approved. A copy of the letter must be sent to the sponsor 
prior to drug shipment to the investigator.  
 
The investigator agrees to promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to human subjec ts or others.  
 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the 
principles of the "Declaration of Helsinki" and with the laws and regulations of the 
participating countries, whichever affords the greater protection to t he individual. It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to obtain informed consent in written form (according to 
local legal requirements) from each subject participating in this study. All subject s will be 
informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards and confidentiality 
of data. Candidates will also be told that they are free to refuse participation or withdraw 
from the study at any time. A consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_177520]/ she is exposed to any study -related procedure, including screening tests for

Appendix  A: Crow’s Feet Wrinkle Scale 1 
 
The Crow’s Feet Wrinkle Scale (CFW) is a photonumeric  guide that grades severity of 
lateral canthal lines according to one of the following five descriptions.  
 
Score  Grade  Description  At Rest  At Smile  
0 Absent  No visible wrinkles  
  
1 Minimal  Very fine wrinkles (that are 
barely visible)  
  
2 Mild Fine wrinkles (that are shallow)  
  
3 Moderate  Moderate wrinkles (that are 
moderately deep)  
  
4 Severe  Severe wrinkles (that are 
severely deep)

 Confidential    Investigators and subjects will use the same scale. As a photo guide, the guidance 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_177506] 11” x 17” laminated poster cards.  
 
 
Instructions for use:  
 
 
For Investigators:  
 
• “At Rest”: Ask the subject to make an expressionless face and indicate with a 
check mark the description that best describes his/her appearance.  
• “On Contraction”: Ask the subject to make a maximally exaggerated smile and 
indicate with a check mark the description that best describes his/her 
appearance.  
 
For Subjects:  
 
• Place the subject in front of a mirror or provide a hand -held mirror  in a well-lit 
room  
• Provide subject with the photo guide  
• “At Rest”: Ask the subject to make an expressionless face and state the grade 
that best describes his/her appearance. Record in the eCRF.  
• “On Contraction”: Ask the subject to make a maximally exagger ated smile and 
using the provided scale state the grade that best describes his/her appearance. 
Record in the eCRF.

 Confidential    Appendix  B: Signs of Botulinum Toxin Spread  
 
 
 
1. Ask the subject to follow the examiner’s finger with hi s or her eyes without moving 
his or her head. At eye level, the examiner should move his or her finger to the 
right of the subject’s head and then to the left. Repeat this horizontal motion at the 
level of the subject’s forehead and chin. Note whether ther e is any abnormality in 
the form of any inability of the subject’s eyes to follow the finger.  
 
2. Ask the subject to raise his/her eyelids. Observe any indication for “droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”.  
 
3. Ask the subject to swallow and note any difficulty doing so.  
 
4. Ask the subject to partially flex his or her arms at the elbow, with fist at shoulder 
level. Ask the subject to attempt to fully flex his or her arms against the resistance 
of the examiner pull ing on the subject’s forearms. Note whether there is an 
abnormality in the form of any muscular weakness.  
 
5. Ask the subject to squat down and stand up again. Watch for any abnormalities or 
signs of weakness.

 Confidential    Appendix  C: Procedure for Color Photography  
 
 
Equipment:  Digital Camera , Log Book ,  Subject -Specific Index Card  
 
Procedure:  In these clinical photographs, for the duration of the study, the only variable 
allowed to change is the skin condition itself. Therefore, anythin g 
extraneous to the condition (jewelry, makeup, clothing, furniture, walls, etc.) 
is to be eliminated from the fields to be photographed, from baseline through 
the final photographs. The necessity of good photos should be stressed to 
the subject s to ensure  their cooperation. Camera, lighting, framing, and 
exposure must be held consistent.  In the end, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_94141] 
a time -lapse movie.  
 
Ask the subject  to stand against a light background, away from any window 
or other source of external light. The subject  should hold a white index card  
with his/her  identification number and initials. The photographer should 
stand about [ADDRESS_990020]  and set the camera for minimum 
zoom  and take 5 photographs : 1 full  frontal face photo,  and one 45 ° view of 
each of the right and left periorbital region, both, “at rest” and “on 
contraction” .  
 
For the “at rest” pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] s, ask the subject to have a relaxed, expressionless 
composure . In the frontal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], the subject should hold an index card with 
subject ID , date  and initials . The ID card is not required for the 45 ° views. 
For the “on contraction ” pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], ask the subject to produce a smile that is 
maximally exaggerated by [CONTACT_661516] t o make the biggest smile 
possible.  An attempt should be made to consistently produce the same 
degree of smile in all photograph s. This can be guided by [CONTACT_177523].  
 
Maintain a Log Book that includes the following information:  
• Protocol Number  
• Investigator Name  
• Subject  Initials  
• Subject  ID Number  
• Visit week  
• Date of Visit  
• Photographer’s Initials

 Confidential    Appendix  D: Irritation Scoring  
 
 
For the irritation assessment, the following scale will be utilized : 
 
Numeric Grades:  
0 = no evidence of irritation  
1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible  
2 = definite erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal papular 
response  
3 = erythema and papules  
4 = definite edema  
5 = erythema, edema, and papules  
6 = vesicular eruption  
7 = strong reactio n spreading beyond test site  
 
All clinically significant skin responses observed with the test products or any score of 3 
or higher will be reported as an adverse event.

Abstract: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated wit h significant morbidity and mortality. 
Galantamine is a medication used in the treatment of dementia. Preclinical studies have shown 
that galantamine addresses several mechanisms proposed to contribute to worse clinical 
outcomes after SAH. We propose a pil ot safety and tolerability study examining the use of 
galantamine to improve outcomes after acute SAH. We hypothesize that galantamine started 
within 36 hours and continued for 90 days will be well tolerated and safe. Our second 
hypothesis is that galantam ine treatment will be associated with a decrease in central and 
systemic inflammation after  SAH.  
 
Aim 1: To investigate the safety and tolerability of galantamine in SAH patients when given 36 
hours after admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212127] 90 days.  
 
Aim 2: To develop an evidence -based hypothesis for efficacy of galantamine on the 90 day 
mRS.  
 
Aim 3: To investigate the effect of galantamine treatment on CSF and serum levels of 
inflammatory cytokines after SAH.  
 
Methods: This is pi[INVESTIGATOR_99633] -blind placebo -controlled randomized trial to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of galantamine after SAH. [ADDRESS_254351] been enrolled befo re proceeding to the second phase of the study. CSF

and 90 days will be assessed by [CONTACT_212150], Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 
EuroQOL.  
 
Conclusion : This is a study to investigate the safety and tolerability of galantamine therapy for 
the treatment of SAH. In addition we will gain insights into prelimina ry estimates of efficacy and 
possible mechanisms of action.  
 
Background Information  
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is caused by a rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. SAH 
represents 5 -10% of strokes and is a significant public health problem. Mortality is high ( up to 
40%) and morbidity is significant as patients are often young and are left with cognitive and 
functional deficits.1,[ADDRESS_254352] stage of injury 
occurs within 72 hours and has been coined early brain injury.3  The second stage of injury 
occurs between 4 -14 days after rupture and is characterized by [CONTACT_212151] (C VSP) 
and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). CVSP and DCI are complications that lead to morbidity 
and mortality after SAH.[ADDRESS_254353] shown that 
galantamine can reduce inflammation af ter brain injury and offers neuroprotective effects.9 
Thus, galantamine has the potential to reduce SAH -triggered inflammation and improve 
outcomes. There are several potential mechanisms of action for the efficacy of galantamine to 
improve  outcomes  after SAH:  1) Systemic  inflammation  2) Central  inflammation  3) Improvement 
in cognition.  
 
1) Vagus nerve, nicotinic α7 receptors and systemic inflammation : The r ecently described 
cholinergic  anti-inflammatory  pathway  (CAP)  highlights  the robust  connection  between  the brain 
and components of the immune system through the autonomic nervous systems [Figure  1]. 
Studies have demonstrated that direct stimulation of the vagus nerve (the main efferent arm of 
the parasympathetic nervous system) decreases serum levels of pro -inflammatory molecules 
including IL -1ß, TNFα and HMGB -1. Specifically, the α7 receptors present in the celiac ganglion 
and splenic macrophages are impor tant components of the CAP pathway.10,11[Figure 1] After  
Figure 1. Model for the cholinergic anti -inflammatory 
pathway. 1) Activation of the efferent component of the 
vagus nerve releases acetylcholine (ACh) within the celiac 
ganglion.  ACh acts on α7 receptors to enhance splenic 
nerve activity. 2) Splenic nerve terminals release 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE) within the spleen. NE ac ts on splenic T 
lymphocytes causing them to release ACh. 3) ACh activates 
α7 receptors present on splenic macrophages. 4) Activation 
of α7 receptors results in decreased pro -inflammatory

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 05/11/[ADDRESS_254354]. Pramod Dash’s laboratory has shown that stimulation of the α7 receptors 
after experimental brain injury decreases both systemic and central inflammation, reduces 
blood -brain barrier permeability, and offers neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury (Figure 
2). Another laboratory has shown similar results in an ani mal model of SAH.13 
 
 
2) α7 receptors and central inflammation : Unregulated cerebral inflamm ation is associated with 
early and delayed brain injury with high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the CSF (including 
IL-1β, IL -6, IL-8 and TNFα) being associated with poor outcome.14–[ADDRESS_254355] PNU -282987 decreases circulating cytokine, HMGB -1 
levels, and reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells. A) The plasma levels of IL -1ß were found to be significantly 
decreased at [ADDRESS_254356] PNU -282987 (3 
mg/kg i.p.; α7agonist) compared to vehicle -treated injured animals (n=5/time point/group). B) Compared to the levels 
detected in vehicle -treated injured animals, rats treated with PNU -[ADDRESS_254357] -injury (n=3/group). C) Representative image of a composite western blot showing HMGB -1 
immunoreactivity in the plasma of a sham, injur ed animals treated with vehicle (V), and injured animals treated with 
PNU -282987 (P). Images were taken from 3 separate western blots and combined for presentation. Sham samples were 
run on each membrane and used as a common comparator. D) Quantification o f the 30kDa HMGB1 band revealed that 
post -injury administration of PNU -282987 significantly reduced (group main effect by [CONTACT_1192] -way ANOVA) circulating 
HMGB1 levels (n=5/time point/group).

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 05/11/2018   3) Nicotinic receptors and cognitive outcome : Cognitive deficit after SAH is a significant cause of 
morbidity and is associated with an inability to function independently and return to work.[ADDRESS_254358] shown that cognitive dysfunction during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (defined by [CONTACT_212152] (mMoCA)) is associated with worse long term function al outcomes 
as measured by [CONTACT_212153] (mRS). Preliminary analysis of 102 SAH patients in 
our prospective database showed that 1 point decrease on the mMoCA score was associated 
with a 1.3 times the odds of having a poor outcome (mRS >3) at 6  months when controlled for 
other clinical variables. Patients with cognitive deficit (defined by a mMoCA score of less than 9) 
were at a 7.[ADDRESS_254359] that early cognitive dysfunction is a target to improve long -term 
functional outcomes. Galantamine’s ability to improve cognitive function in patients with 
dementia is well established and the mechanism is thought to be from activati on of the central 
nicotinic receptors.8 The same mechanism may improve early cognitive function after SAH and 
lead to improvement of functional outcomes.  
 
Galantamine in Neurologic Disease: Galantamine is FDA approved for the treatment of 
cognitive dysfunc tion after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand 
of human nicotinic α7 receptors in the brain. It is also a competitive and reversible 
cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body. It modulates nicotinic receptors by [CONTACT_212154].[ADDRESS_254360] shown that galantamine treatment in range of 16mg to 24mg daily improves 
cognitive performance.8,27–29 Galantamine has been shown to be well tolerated and improve 
cognitive and functional outcomes in patients with vascular dementia and AD with 
cerebrovascular disease. 30–[ADDRESS_254361] used galantamine in the chronic setting to improved cognitive functioning  
in traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke.34 
Galantamine was studied in patients after traumatic brain injury in the chronic 
setting to improve cognitive functioning. In an uncontrolled observational study 111 patients 
were given one of three different types of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. 30 patients received 
galantamine. The endpoints examined was a subjective feeling of improvement which was 
reported by 60% of those receiving galantamine.34 
 
A cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, has been used in the small study in SAH 
patients. In this study, rivastigmine was used in the chronic stages (at least 9 months after SAH) 
in patients with persistent cognitive deficits after SAH. They found an improvement in cognitive

any other α7 receptor agonist) as a treatment to reduce brain injury in the acute and suba cute 
stages after SAH.  
 
Pharmacokinetics: Previous studies of galantamine have shown bioavailability from oral 
administration to be 80 -100%, with a peak concentration at [ADDRESS_254363] demonstrated clinical effects.37 Although an 
intravenous formulation might provide easier administration in the acute setting, only an oral 
formulation is available.

be examined with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Ev ents (CTCAE) Version 4.0. 
When an adverse event occurs determination of causality will be examined. All serious adverse 
events meeting Grade 4 criteria will be communicated to the DSMB. All serious adverse events 
which are unexpected and related will be re ported to the DSMB within 7 calendar days of the 
determination  by [CONTACT_756],  email  or fax. All other  SAEs  will be collected  and submitted  with the 
report to the  DSMB.  
 
Randomization  
Eligible patients will be approached as early as possible after presentation to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Once consented, randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_212158]. We plan to randomize using permuted blocks of 2 to 4. The Hunt and Hess Score  
(HH) is a score based on the neurologic examination the strongest predictor of mortality after 
SAH. Patients who present with a HH 4 or 5 are at a much higher risk of dying compared to 
patients who present with a HH1, HH 2 or 3. To account for this we wil l be stratified based on 
admission HH (HH2 and 3 versus HH4) to assure that groups are balanced with respect to 
clinical severity.[ADDRESS_254370] droppi[INVESTIGATOR_212133], the physician discontinuing the medication because of

evaluate tolerability for this dose population.  
 
 
Potential Adverse Effects  
Cardiovascular : Bradycardia and AV block. 2 -3% of patients receiving [ADDRESS_254372] of care.  
Gastrointestinal : Increased gastric acid secretion. This may be associated with a higher risk for 
gastric ulcers. We ro utinely use histamine blockers or proton pump inhibitors in all our SAH 
patients to protect against gastric ulcer.

Demographic information including disease severity on presentation as measured by [CONTACT_212159], the occurrence of vasospasm on screening angiogram (performed as standard of 
care) between day [ADDRESS_254374] will be administered to women of child 
bearing potential. Adverse events will be captured at clinic visits (Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90) 
along with causality assessment.  
 
Outcome measures and statistical analysis  
The primary outcome is tolerability (including death) related to galantamine as 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_4318]. The primary efficacy outcome will be mRS at [ADDRESS_254375], the usual clinical presentation for 
patients with SAH is headache, nausea and vomiting. In a retrospective examination of 141 
patients admitted with SAH we found 80% of patients re ceived anti -emetic medications with a 
median dose requirement of 4 doses (IQR 2 -9). 
The upper 75% quartile of [ADDRESS_254376] will remain 
on the tolerable dose until the end of the 90 day period.  
 
Serum and CSF biom arker analysis  
 
Rationale: Increased inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes after SAH. Our 
preliminary studies examining subjects from our prospectively collected database show that 
peripheral inflammation is associated with poor clinical out come. When examining serum from 
87 subjects collected within 48 hours after SAH, we found that inflammatory cytokines IL -6, 
MCP -1(otherwise known as CCL -2) and TNFα were all significantly elevated in subjects with 
SAH who progressed to have poor functional  outcomes. In multivariable regression analysis IL - 
6 and MCP -1 were independent predictors of outcome after controlling for known confounders  
UT Houston Protocol Template  
Adapted from NIH protocol template and ICH Guidelines  IRB NUMPBaEgRe:1H4SoCf-2M3S-16-0228  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 05/11/[ADDRESS_254377] 
been associated with poor outcome in patients after SAH.38 Studying the effects of galantamine 
on these cytokines will give an indication whether galantamine has an influence on inflammation 
after SAH.  
 
In addition to traditional statistical comparisons network analysis techniques can be used to 
examine the associ ation between multiple variables. The complex nature of cytokine reactions 
lends itself to this type of analysis. Preliminary studies in our laboratory using an array of 9 
cytokines showed differential activation of cytokine networks after SAH between subj ects with 
good and poor outcomes as defined by [CONTACT_212160]. Specifically we found that 
patients with poor clinical outcomes had a higher number of significant associations compared 
to those with good outcomes (18 vs 11) suggesting uncontrolled act ivation of the inflammatory 
cascade. Additionally, there was an increase in correlation strengths in all common significant 
associations in patients with poor outcomes. For instance, in patients with poor discharge 
outcomes, the IL -6- MCP1β correlation was  78% more compared to patients with good 
outcomes.  
 
 
Methods and analysis: Serum and CSF samples will be collected at 8 different predetermined 
time points. A sample will be collected within 24 hours of admission, (before medication is 
administered), as a baseline to compare changes in cytokines over time. Samples will be 
collected between 24 -48 hours (after medication is administered), then between [ADDRESS_254378]’s baseline 
cytokine levels (before medication) and measure changes in cytokine levels over time.  
Differences in changes of cytokine at separate time points between the two groups 
(galantamine and controls) will be compared.  
 
Pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficients will be computed between all pairs of cytokines and 
a network will be constructed. Networks will be made for subjects who received galantamine 
and those who received placebo. Networks will be examined for qualita tive differences. In 
addition  we will examine  for significant  differences  in the number  of associations  and differences 
in strength of associations between those who receive galantamine and controls. A student’s t - 
test and Mann -Whitney U test will be used  to test for significant differences in correlation 
strengths between the  networks.  
 
Appropriate measures will be used to control for Type -1 errors common in multiple 
comparisons. The Benjamani -Hochberg (BH) method with a critical value of 0.[ADDRESS_254379] p -values to control false discovery rate (FDR). To account for repeated me asures over 
time in cytokine levels per subject mixed effects modeling will be used.[ADDRESS_254380] relationship between cytokine levels and galantamine

Plasma for biomarker analysis : Blood will be withdrawn from existing lines or by [CONTACT_212161][INVESTIGATOR_147523] K 2EDTA 6ml (plasma) Vacutainers per time point (36 ml). The 
samples will be placed on ice and will be centrifuged at 1,459 X g for 10min at 4oC. The 
supernatant solution will be removed and centrifuged at 1,459 X g for 10min at 4oC to generate 
platelet -poor plasma. Plasma will be divided into aliquots and frozen at -80°C until needed. For 
those subjects providing consent, any residual sample and buffy coat will be frozen at -80°C for 
future study.  
 
CSF for biomarker analysis : Patients with a ventriculostomy d rain will have 1 -5 ml of CSF 
sampled from the receptacle at each of 5 time points. The receptacle will be emptied into the 
collection bag (the volume will be noted in the nursing notes) to start with an empty receptacle, 
several drops of CSF will then be a llowed to drip into the chamber. The drain will be re - 
clamped; the chamber port will be cleaned with chlorhexidine as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212137] a sterile syringe. CSF will be centrifuged (4°C, 1,459 
X g for 10  minutes) and portioned into aliquots and frozen at -80oC; any residual sample will be 
frozen at -80°C for future study. The CSF pellet should be covered in a 10% DMSO solution

adverse e vents of interest, and serious adverse events (SAEs), both anticipated and 
unanticipated. An Adverse Event is any undesirable and unintended, although not necessarily 
unexpected, event occurring in human subjects as a result of (a) the interventions and 
interactions used in the research; or (b) the collection of identifiable private information under 
the research. A Serious adverse event is an adverse event that led to death, or to serious 
deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in death, was life -threatening, required 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged), resulted in disability or permanent damage, congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, or 
other serious events (Important Medical Events). NOTE: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a 
preexisting condition, or a procedure required, without serious deterioration in health, is not 
considered a serious adverse event. An unanticipated adverse effect is defined as any serious 
adverse effect on hea lth or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or

nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or app lication (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a medication that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Once a SAE occurs then an adjudication process will occur to deter mine if it was possibly 
related to the study medication. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_212138], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_212139] a consensus 
of whether the SAE was possibly and prob ably related to the study medication.  
SAE’s that are determined to be unexpected and related will be submitted to the DSMB within 7 
calendar days of the determination by [CONTACT_756], email or fax; written reports will be submitted 
no later than 15 calendar d ays of the determination.  
 
Adverse events will be graded according to the USDHHS Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events V4.0 (USDHHS, Table 2) and summarized according to body system. Primary 
focus for analysis will be on tolerability of galantamine and 3 -month mortality rat e. For the 
purpose of safety monitoring, adverse events Grade 4 or higher will be classified as important 
AEs.  
Safety/ Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_212140], it is likely to be safe in 
the SAH population as well. I n our prospective SAH database, we have a 10% mortality rate in 
patients. This is a much lower mortality rate compared to other published rates (30 -40%) mainly 
because we will exclude patients who are likely to die imminently.1 We will use a Bayesian 
appro ach of probably of harm to stop the study. Using a previous estimate of death in our 
patient population of 10% in both arms and a neutral prior with a 95% CI of 0.22 -3.0. Using 
10,000 simulated trials the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_212141]’s an 80% probability of increased death in the drug group. The chart below is the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94859]. Depending on the number of subjects randomized

Statistics  
 
Interi m analysis:  
 
Interim analysis will be performed after 30 patients are randomized. (15 in each arm). 
Intolerability  will be defined  as the need  to decrease  dose  of medication  because  of side effects, 
mainly nausea and vomiting. At this time if the galantami ne arm has more than 30% 
intolerability in the first month, defined by [CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_212144], 
decreasing dose to 4mg every 12 hours because of intolerability or difference in SAEs, 
compared to the placebo arm, in the second phase of the study we will decrease the starting 
dose  to 4 mg every  12 hours  and attempt  to increase  after 7 days  to 8 mg every  12 hours.

The primary efficacy endpoint will be the mRS used as an ordinal variable (5 and 6 will be 
grouped). Analysis will be stratified based on HH grade. All results will be reported as Relative 
Risks with 95 CI. The estimates of relative risk found in this study will be used for future meta - 
analysis or planning for the next phase clinical trial. In the larger study, utilizing a Bayesian 
approach, the posterior estimate and 95% CrI could be utilized as prior estimates for the larger 
confirmatory trial. Secondary o utcomes including the mMoCA performed between 14 -21 days or 
within 2 days of discharge, MoCA scores at 30, 60 and 90 days, and the EQ5D at 30, 60 and 90 
days will be also be reported similarly.

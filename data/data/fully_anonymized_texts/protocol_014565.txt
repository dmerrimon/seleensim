 DEFINITIONS  
Close Call (a.k.a. “Near-Miss”): Instances in which a user has difficulty or makes a use error 
that could result in harm, but the user takes an action to “recover” and prevents the harm 
from occurring (FDA Guidance 2016). 
Critical Task: A user task which , if performed incorrectly or n ot performed at all, would or 
could cause serious harm to the patient, user, or instrument, w here harm is defined to include 
compromised medical care. Objective Data: Data collected  through direct observation.

6.3 SUBMITTING A BREATH SAMPLE (SPECIFIC STEPS ) 
Submitting a breath sample involves the following steps. Instructions can be accessed in 
multiple locations including the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280457]’s display screen,  the Quick Start Guide, on 
the packaging or also in the User Manual that will be available  online.  
1. User presses any button to turn on the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53644]. 
2. User presses and holds the cente r button on the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_742372]. 
3. User takes a deep breath in and holds their breath for 10 secon ds. 
4. After about 10 seconds, the devi ce beeps 3 times, the user then  will exhale slowly 
until the sensor vibrates at 12 seconds. 
5. The user’s CO level will display on the sensor’s screen. 
A properly submitted breath sampl e is defined as one that initi ates after the third beep 
prompt and is of at least 6 sec onds duration.  Breath sensor ha rdware and firmware is 
capable of detecting when a breath sample submission starts and  stops. 
The CO Log screen in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53643] B reath Sensor provides the CO (p pm) value for properly 
submitted breath samples and provides a descriptive error messa ge for improperly 
submitted breath samples (i.e. “Error: breath sample too late”) .  
The computation of concentration of  CO (ppm) is performed withi n the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_742373] (CO ppm concentration, time and da te) are stored in the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_742374].   
6.4 CO  LOG 
The CO Log can be accessed from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53644]’s displ ay screen and shows the 
most recent exhaled breath CO value in ppm at the top of the sc reen.  The user can view 
previous values by [CONTACT_742404] w ithin the log (Figure 2).   
Values are color coded and can be interpreted by [CONTACT_53739] 
(Figure 3).

asked to read instructions or us e any of the forms of training available except during the 
knowledge questions covered in the User Documentation Assessment – see Section 11.4. 
Study personnel will refrain fro m answering questions on how to  use the study device during 
the study.  
Once the study participant has completed the self-training on t he Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53644], they 
will be asked if they feel ready to proceed with submitting a b reath sample.  If a participant 
indicates they do not feel ready, they will be asked to do what they would normally do at 
home to prepare to use the product and to let the test administrator know when they are ready to submit another sample. 
When the participant indicates readiness to provide a breath sa mple, he/she will be instructed 
to proceed to provide one breath sample using the study device. After providing this breath 
sample, the subject will be asked to interpret his/her breath s ample result followed by 
[CONTACT_742406]. 
The subjective questions will address the subject’s feedback on  how giving a breath sample 
went for them. At which point, the  participant will be asked to  change the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. An 
optional breath sample may be requested by [CONTACT_742407]/her breath sample result.   
Upon completion of these breath sample(s), participants will be  asked for subjective 
feedback, if they experienced difficulty, concerns, or moments of hesitation while using the 
product, and if they have safety  concerns regarding the product  or its labeling. Next, they will 
be assessed for their newly lear ned knowledge of the device (focused on if CO is “good or 
bad for you”) and their ability to find and understand informat ion in the product labeling. 
This is followed by [CONTACT_742408].

the following assessments for task success: 
 Successful: User is able to complete the task safely and effect ively. If the user does 
not complete the task on first tr y but self-corrects to complet e the task without 
moderator direction or assistance, the task completion may be c onsidered 
Successful. 
 Difficulty: User is able to complete the task safely and effect ively, but has 
significant hesitation or challe nges while completing the task.  If the user does not 
complete the task on first try but self-corrects to complete th e task without 
moderator direction or assistance, the task completion may be c onsidered 
Difficulty. 
 Close Call: User is able to complete the task safely and effect ively, but performs it 
in a way that presents the potential for user harm (i.e. near-m iss). 
 Unsuccessful (Use Error): User is unable to independently compl ete the task or 
does not complete the task safely and effectively. Includes ins tances in which users 
are unable to complete the task and as a result require study moderator assistance. 
Instances in which the user sel f-corrects without requiring mod erator assistance do 
not qualify as unsuccessful.

At any time, the moderator may remind the participant of the sc enario of the testing and 
the frame of mind they should str ive for. A possible reminder m ay be “Continue to do 
your best…as a friendly reminder imagine that you are home, tha t we are not here, and 
that you just bought this product from the store.” Any instance  of study moderator

usability validation testing will be documented and assessed fo r risk acceptability as 
defined in the Use FMEA.  
In the case that a hazard-relate d use scenario is concluded to have an acceptable risk profile per 
the Use FMEA, its associated test case is considered to “pass.”  In the case that a hazard-related 
use scenario is concluded to have an unacceptable risk profile per the Use FMEA, its associated 
test case is considered to “fail.” In the case of a failed test  case, further risk mitigation and 
usability evaluation would be re quired. In the case that furthe r risk mitigation is not possible, a 
risk-benefit analysis  would be documented.   
 
Since there are no critical task s associated with this product,  there is no pre-identified task-
specific acceptance criteria related to this study; no use erro rs were identified that could lead to 
serious harm. Overall, user perf ormance on each task will be monitored for unforeseen use errors 
that could lead to serious harm.

Following the user documentation assessment, the participants w ill be subjected to rating 
scale questions to rate the ease of use of the device, the clar ity of the user documentation 
and their ability to understand a nd interpret the test results.   
11.6 METHODS FOR CAPTURING USE ERRORS  
During each study session, observer(s), and moderator(s) will o bserve for difficulties, use 
errors and close calls that coul d inform modifications to the P ivot Breath Sensor Use 
FMEA. The study moderator will also ask probing questions, at t he end of the session, to 
reveal close calls that were not conveyed through observation. All use errors and 
difficulties will be followed with questions to identify how an d why the participant 
believes they occurred. New, unforeseen use-related hazards wil l be assessed for risk 
acceptability and added to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_742386].  The study team will include subjective assessments by [CONTACT_742410]-
related issues that could potentially result in harm to the use r.  
Users will perform tasks independently and in a natural manner,  without guidance, 
coaching, praise, or critique from the test facilitator or moderator. Users will not be 
allowed a “second chance” to perform a task correctly after a f ailure. That is, if an 
irreversible safety or efficacy issue is observed in which a us er would not normally have a 
“second chance” to resolve the issue, then any subsequent attem pts to complete the task 
will serve as input only for continuous usability improvement purposes. In instances in which an irreversible safety or efficacy issue is not observed and the user would normally 
have additional chances to resol ve this issue, any subsequent a ttempts by [CONTACT_742411] (i.e. successful, difficulty, unsuccessf ul, close call, did not perfo rm) to the task. 
The study team will ensure participant feedback is documented t hroughout the session, as 
well as any protocol deviations. Prior to the end of the test session, the study team will review all data sheets for comp leteness and pursue additional information or clarification 
as needed. The study team will then inform participants when th e test session is complete. 
The study team will scan the data sheets and save them to a sec ure study file. All members 
of the study team will be familiar with the device operation to  be qualified to administer 
the test and assess participant performance with the device. The study team will write the summary report.

at the end of the day with access limited to necessary study pe rsonnel. Study data will be 
kept in a secure database by [CONTACT_093]. This database wi ll be accessible only by 
[CONTACT_53744]. The d atabase will not contain person al identifying information; 

Carrot Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  32all subject data in the database will be associated with study identification numbers. The 
data will be kept for [ADDRESS_1014771] cases 
that are provided to the user.   
Objective data will include:  
 Participant answers to use scenarios and user documentation ass essment test case 
questions assessing user comprehension. 
 Study team assessment by [CONTACT_742414], based on pre-determined acceptance criteria 
(see sections 11.1 and 11.4). 
Subjective data will include: 
 Participant feedback on ease of  use, understandability, and pos sible improvements. 
 Study team feedback on any issues with participant comprehensio n or ability to 
complete user tasks. 
In the case that a problem or a use error is observed, the stud y moderator will probe 
for root cause and record the participant’s assessment of safet y and risk acceptability. 
This subjective input of risk acceptability will inform the final assessment and conclusion of risk acceptability made by [CONTACT_742415]. 
Both observational data and subjective input will facilitate id entification and 
understanding of the root causes of use errors or difficulties that occur. 
As needed, photo and video record ings may be implemented during  the study to 
facilitate post-study analysis of user-feedback, use errors, an d close calls. 
More than one study observer may record data using the data she ets. As a result, data 
may differ between note-takers. A fter the session is complete, the observer(s) and 
moderator(s) will meet to discuss any difficulties, use errors,  or close calls. Data will 
be compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a spreadsheet, and study team may re-assess rati ngs based on further 
analysis, video review, or disc ussion (e.g. a “Difficulty” may be re-assessed as a 
“Close Call” after the data sheets are complete). Hand-written data will not require 
amendment based on the re-assessment. In any instances where ra tings are modified, a 
comment will be made in the cell in the spreadsheet or a log wi ll be otherwise 
recorded to indicate that each change was agreed upon by [CONTACT_630504].

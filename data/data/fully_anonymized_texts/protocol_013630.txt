1 Introduction  
Data will be  analyzed by  [CONTACT_777393] 9 of the study protocol 
which is available in Appendix 16.1.1 of the CSR . Important information is given in the 
following sections and details are provided, as applicable,  in Appendix 16.1.9 of the CSR . 
This document  covers statistical and analytical plans for CAIN457A2323 ( ALLURE ) study 
with reference to the study protocol and the project standard analysis plans ( AIN457A Master 
Analysis Plan ). 
1.1 Study design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -cont rolled, parallel -group trial in 
approximately 210 subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque- type psoriasis.  
Randomization : Eligible s ubjects  will be randomized using a 1:1:1  ratio into one of the three 
treatment groups below. Randomization will not be stratified.  
• Secukinumab 300 mg  (2mL PFS): will receive one 2 mL secukinumab 300 mg plus two 
1 mL matching  secukinumab placebo s.c. injections once weekly for four weeks (at 
Randomization, Weeks 1, 2 and 3), followed by [CONTACT_777394] y four weeks, starting at Week 
4 up to Week 48. Subjects will receive three placebo injections at Weeks 13, 14 and 15. 
• Secukinumab 300 mg (2 x1mL PFS ): will receive two  1 mL secukinumab 150 mg plus 
one 2 mL matching secukinumab placebo s.c. injections once weekly for four weeks (at 
Randomization, Weeks 1, 2 and 3), followed by [CONTACT_777395], starting at Week 4 up to Week 48. Subjects will receive three placebo injections at Weeks 13, 14 and 15. 
• Placebo : will receive secukinumab placebo (two 1 mL and one 2 mL s.c. injections ) once 
weekly for four weeks (at Randomization, Weeks 1, 2 and 3), followed by [CONTACT_777395], starting at Week 4 up to Week 12 (pre-dose). 
Prior to receiving the Week 12 dose, all subjects from the placebo group will be assigned  
to the following treatment groups based on their PASI 90 response status as Week 12. 
• PASI 90 non- responders : will receive either one 2 mL 300 mg secukinumab s.c. plus 
two 1 mL matching placebo OR  two 1  mL 150 mg secukinumab s.c. injections plus 
one 2 mL matching placebo, according  to the pre- assignment at the Randomization 
visit using 1:1 ratio, at Weeks 12, 13, 14, 15 and then every four weeks starting at 
Week 16 up to Week 48; 
• PASI 90 responders : will continue on placebo (one 2 mL plus two 1 mL s.c. 
injections) and will receive their placebo injections at Weeks 12, 13, 14, 15 and then every four weeks starting at Week 16 up to Week 48. 
 
Of note: For PASI 90 non- respo nders in placebo group , pre -assigned treatment group s at 
Randomization visit  will be used instead of re -randomization at Week 12, therefore eligible 
subjects will be randomized using pre -assigned 2:2:1:1 ratio into one of the four treatment 
groups at Randomization visit (similar to 1:1:1 for all subjects at Randomization visit with 1:1 
for PASI 90 non-responders in placebo group at Week 12). 
• Secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS)  
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 8

• Secukinumab 300 mg (2x1mL PFS)  
• Placebo - Secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS)  
• Placebo - Secukinumab 300 mg (2x1mL PFS)  
 
The following study periods will be considered for analysis: 
• Screening  period  (before Randomization)  
• Treatment period 1 (Randomization to Week 12 pre-dose), including follow- up period  
(F4 and F8 visits) for prematurely discontinued subjects before Week 12 completion.  
• Treatment period 2 (Week 12 dose  to Week 52), including follow- up period (F4 and 
F8 visits) for prematurely discontinued subjects before Week 52 completion. 
• Entire treatment period  (Randomization to Week 52, last dose at Week 48), including 
follow-up period (F4 and F8 visits) for prematurely discontinued subjects. 
Of note: data from follow -up period (i.e., treatment free follow -up period after EOT visit, which 
includes F4 and F8 visit s) for prematurely discontinued subjects  will be included in the analysis 
of treatment period.

2.1.1  General d efinition s  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study treatment 
The following study drugs will be used: 
• Investigational treatment  
o Secukinumab 300 mg, 2 mL liquid formulation  in a pre- filled syringe  
• Control treatment 
o Secukinumab 150 mg, 1 mL liquid formulation  in a pre- filled syringe  
o Secukinumab placebo, 2 mL liquid formulation in a pre- filled syringe  
o Secukinumab placebo, 1 mL liquid formulation in a pre- filled syringe  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Day [ADDRESS_1067681] day of administration of randomized study treatment (first dose) is defined as Study Day 1 or Day 1 .  
All other study days will be labeled relative to Day 1. For event dates on or after Day 1, study day for a part icular event date is calculated as [Date of event] – [Date of first dose]+1, i.e., Day 
2, Day 3, etc., will be one day, two days, etc., after Day 1, respectively. For the dates before Day 1, study day for an event date is calculated as [Date of event] – [Date of first dose], i.e., 
Day -1, Day -2, etc., will be one day, two days, etc., before Day 1, respectively. Duration of an event will be calculated as (Event end date – Event start date + 1).  
The descriptor “ Day 0 ” will not be used. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening, baseline an d post -baseline definitions  
Screening  refers to any procedures (e.g. , checking inclusion and exclusion criteria) performed 
prior to the date of first dose of study treatment  (for safety analysis) or prior to the randomization 
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 11  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
date (for efficacy analysis) . Per protocol, subject informed consent must be  obtained prior to 
performing any study related activity . The date of signing informed consent is the start date of 
screening period. Any assessment obtained during the screening period will be labeled  
screenin g assessment . Assessments made on Day [ADDRESS_1067682] assessment (including unscheduled visits) obtained 
(on or) before the randomization  (day) . All assessments obtained after randomization  (day)  are 
considered as post- baseline unless otherwise specified.  
For safety  analyses, b aseline is the last assessment (including unscheduled visits) obtained (on 
or) before the first dose  (day)  of study treatment. A ll assessments obtained after the first dose 
(day) of study treatment  are considered as post -baseline unless otherwise specified.  
In general , a baseline value refers to the last measurement made prior to administration of the 
first dose of study treatment. However, for PROs , LAB assessments  and ECG if no pre -
treatment value exists, value s obtained after first dose  of treatment  can be used as b aseline only 
if it was collected on the same day as first dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Day of last dose of randomized study treatment  
The date of last dose will be collected via the CRF.  
Duration of exposure is defined in Section 2.4.1. On-treatment  is defined as assessments within last dose plus 84 days. 
2.2 Analysis sets  
The following analysis sets will be used for the data analysis.  Randomized set:  The randomized set will be  defined as all subjects who were randomized  at 
baseline visit. Unless otherw ise specified, mis -randomized subjects will be excluded from the 
randomized set. Misrandomized subjects are subjects who are screen -failures, but have been randomized by [CONTACT_279889], however have not been treated. If previously 
mis-randomized subjects were re- screened and successfully randomized, they will be included 
in the randomized set according to the treatment assigned in the last randomization.  Full analysis set (FAS) : The FAS will be comprised of  all subjects from the randomized set to 
whom study treatment has been assigned. Following the intent -to-treat principle, subjects will 
be analyzed according to the treatment  assigned to at randomization. If the actual randomization 
stratum is different to  the assigned stratum in IRT, the actual stratum will be used in analyses .  
Of note, subjects excluded from the randomized set will be excluded from the FAS. Safety set : The safety set includes all subjects who took at least one dose of study treatment  
during the treatment period. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received .  
The treatment received will be set to the treatment randomized. But if a subject has  received the 
wrong treatment during the entire study, the treatment received will be set to this wrong 
treatment.

No summaries for entire treatment period will be provided. 
The following common background and demographic variables w ill be analyzed:  
Continuous variables: 
o Age (which is derived from year of birth and the Informed consent date, 
assuming date is July 1st since only year of birth is collected ) 
o Height  
o Weight 
o Body mass index (BMI) 
Categorical variables: 
o Age categories (<65 years, 65 years and older, 75 years and older) 
o Sex 
o Race  
o Ethnicity  
o Smoking status at baseline  
Psoriasis specific baseline characteristics  and history of disease will be summarized  as well: 
baseline PASI, baseline PASI (≤20, >20), baseline total BSA, baseline IGA mod 2011 score  (at 
least mild, moder ate, severe) , severit y of psoriasis (CHMP guidelines , mild (total BSA <10% 
and PASI < 10), moderate ((PASI ≥10 or total BSA≥10%) and PASI ≤20 and total BSA ≤20%), severe (total BSA >20% or PASI > 20)) , psoriatic arthritis (yes, no) , time since diagnosis of 
psoriasis, time since diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis , previous exposure to biolo gic systemic 
psoriasis therapy, previous exposure to systemic psoriasis therapy, previous exposure to non-biolo gic systemic psoriasis therapy, previous failure  to biolo gic systemic psoriasis therapy, 
previous failure to systemic psoriasis therapy, previous failure to non-biolo gic systemic 
psoriasis therapy  (including phototherapy and photo- chemotherapy)  
Body M ass Index  (BMI) will be calculated using the following formula: 
BMI = (body weight in kilograms) / (height in meters)
[ADDRESS_1067684] value prior to randomization is used . If there is no 
weight recorded prior to taking of study treatment , BMI will be missing.  
Of note: subject’s height will not be remapped according to the analysis visit window. 
Time since diagnosis of psoriasis (PsO) and time since diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) will 
be calculated using the following formula: 
Time since diagnosis = (inform consent date –first diagnosis date + 1)/365.[ADDRESS_1067685] diagnosis date of PsO or PsA will be imputed according to the imputation rules in Section 5.1. 
Unless otherwise specified, summary statistics  will be presented for continuous variables for 
each treatment group and for all subjects  (total) in the randomized set. The number and 
percentage of subjects in each category will be presented for categorical variables for each 
treatment group and all subjects (total)  in the randomized set. 
Any condition entered on the relevant  medical history / current medical conditions  CRF 
(including family  history) will be c oded using the MedDRA dictionary. They  will be 
summarized by S ystem Organ C lass (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) of the MedDRA dictionary.  
Summaries for cardiovascular medical history will be summarized  by [CONTACT_10611].  
Smoking history will be summarized by [CONTACT_64240]. 
Unless otherwise specified, analyses will be based on the randomized set . 
2.3.1  Patient disposition 
The number of subjects screened will be presented. In addition, the reasons for screen failures will be provided. The number and percentage of subj ects in the randomized set who completed 
study periods and who discontinued the study prematurely (including the reason for 
discontinuation) will be presented for each treatment group and all subjects.  
For each protocol deviation, the number and percentage of subjects for whom the  deviation 
applies  will be tabulated.  
2.4 Treatments (study treatment, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
compliance) 
2.4.1  Study treatment / compliance  
The analysis of study treatment data will be based on the safety set.  
The number of secukinumab  2mL syringes , 1mL secukinumab syringe , secukinumab placebo  
injections will be summarized by [CONTACT_777396] . 
The duration of exposure to study treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. In addi tion, 
the number of subjects with exposure of at least certain time thresholds will be displayed. The 
following categories will be presented : “any exposure”, “≥1 week”, “≥2 week” , “≥3 week”, “≥4 
weeks”, “≥8 week”, “≥ 12 weeks”, “≥ 16 weeks”, “≥ 28 weeks”,  “≥40 weeks” and “≥ 52 weeks”.

subjects  who discontinue d or have their last visit earlier than [ADDRESS_1067687] study visit in the follow- up period or in the corresponding 
treatment period.  
Duration of exposure (days) = min ( last study visit (including follow -up) date, last dose date 
+84) – first dose date +1  
Duration of exposure (years) = duration of exposure (days) / 365.25 
Duration of exposure ([ADDRESS_1067688]  years) = duration of exposure (years) / 100  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit window 
Visit-windows  will be used for the data that is summarized by [CONTACT_765]; they are based on the study 
evaluation schedule and comprise a set of days around the nominal visit day. For any assessment, 
there are the protocol defined scheduled visits around which visit windows were created to 
cover the complete range of days within the study. The visit windows are shown in Table 2-1. 
In this table, the days are counted since the first dose of study treatment (  Day 1 ) for safety 
assessments, and the days are counted since the date of randomization for efficacy assessments. These visit windows apply to measurements taken at every vi sit.  
When visit windows are used, all visits will be re-aligned, i.e., they will be mapped into one of the visit windows. E.g., if the Week [ADDRESS_1067689] may fall in a particular visit window (either scheduled or unscheduled). Statistical approaches to handle 
multiple assessments in a given visit window are specified below. 
For parameters which are not collected at every visit (e.g., DLQI), visit windows will be 
combined. For example, if a parameter is measured at Week 12 and Week 28 only, Week 12 visit window will extend from Day 2 to Day 99 (combining Week 1 to Week 12 visit windows), and Week 28 will be extend from Day 100 to Day 239. 
Assessments from treatment period 2 will not be considered for treatment period 1, and 
treatment period 1 visits will not be mapped into treatment per iod 2. 
Of note: for subjects who prematurely discontinued, efficacy measurements taken in follow -up 
period will be remapped to  treatment periods.

* Baseline measurement before the first drug administration for safety assessments and before the randomization 
for efficacy assessments.  
Of note: subject’s height will not be remapped according to the analysis visit window. 
The analysis visit will be used for listing of visit and period for safety data. If a visit falls after 
the last visit window (after Day  421) it is not assigned an analysis visit and will be listed under 
label “After Week 52”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiple assessments within visit windows  
When there are multiple assessments  in a particular visit window, the following rules are applied 
to select one value “representing” the subject in summary statistics in a visit window (See Table 
2-2). 
For baseline assessment definition see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. For post -baseline visit windows the 
following applies (unless otherwise specified): 
• for quantitative variables , the closest  to the actual visit is chosen (if two assessments have 
the same distance, th en the earlier one will be chosen);  
• for qualitative variables , the worst  record is selected. It is noted that in the analyses 
performed, worst  case is always well defined  (e.g., for urine protein values “+” and “++”, 
the worst case  is defined as “++”),  
• in case qualitative variables are based on quantitative variables, e.g. PASI 90  response, the 
visit will be assigned to the quantitative variable, and this visit will be used for the derived 
qualitative variable.

Baseline  All data  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Post-baseline efficacy  All data  except for PRO , e.g., 
PASI, IGA  The measurement closest to the target 
day will be used. In the event two 
measurements are taken equally apart 
(e.g., 1 day before target date and 1 day 
after), the earlier one will be used. 
If two measurement s are taken on the 
same day then select the first one using 
eCRF visit number.  
If two measurement s have been taken on 
the same day and same visit then select 
the worst.  
Post-baseline efficacy  PRO data The measurement closest to the target day will be used. In the event two measurements are taken equally apart (e.g., 1 day before target date and 1 day after), the earlier one will be used.  
If two measurement s have been taken on 
the same day, select the worst.  
If two measurement s have the same 
value, select the first one using eCRF visit 
number.  
Post-baseline safety  Summary visit information 
(e.g. laboratory  values , vital 
signs , etc.)  The (non- missing) measurement closest 
to the target day will be used. In the event 
two measurements are taken equally 
apart (e.g., 1 day before target date and 1 
day after ), the earlier  one will be used. 
If two measurements are taken on the 
same day  then select the first one (using 
the time) . 
If two measurements are taken on the same date/time then use the first eCRF 
visit number (assuming this is the planned 
visit). If two  measurements are taken on 
the same date/time/eCRF visit number  
then take the average value of these two 
results . 
Post-baseline safety  Notable abnormalities (e.g. vitals signs) and CTCAE grades for laboratory  values  The most extreme measurement in the window will be used. Note this means a subject  can have a notably high and 
notably low measurement within a n 
analysis period.

2.5 Analysis of the primary objective 
2.5.1  Primary endpoint  
The co -primary endpoints are PASI  75 response and IGA 0 or 1 response at Week 12. The 
analysis of the primary variables will be based on the FAS. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of PASI and related variables  
The investigator or trained qualified designee will complete the PASI assessments. Whenever 
possible, the same evaluator should perform this assessment at all visits.  
The total BSA affected by [CONTACT_109010]- type psoriasis will be  estimated from the percentages of areas 
affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs  (see below for PASI assessment) . 
The following calculations will be  done: e ach reported percentage will be multiplied by [CONTACT_777399] (head = 0.1, trunk = 0.3, upper limbs = 0.2, lower 
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 19  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
limbs = 0.4) . The resulting 4 percentages will be added up to estimate the total BSA affected 
by [CONTACT_109010]-type psoriasis. The PASI scoring sy stem is further described in  Table 2-4. 
A PASI score  (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978, Weisman et al 2003, Gottlieb et al 2005)  will 
be derived as indicated in Table 2-4. The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed 
separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration), and scaling (desquamation) . 
The average degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score 
of 0-4. The area covered by [CONTACT_109042] a perc entage of the total 
area of that particular body region . Further practical details help the assessment: 
1. The neck is assessed as part of the head.  
2. The axillae and groin are assessed as part of the trunk.  
3. The buttocks are assessed as part of the lower limbs.  
4. When scoring the severity of erythema, scales should not be removed. 
Because the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the body surface area, respectively, the PASI score will be  
calcu lated using the formula: 
PASI = 0.1 (E
h + I h + D h)Ah + 0.2 (E u + I u + D u)Au + 0.3 (E t + I t + D t)At + 0.4  (El + I l + D l)Al, 
where E, I, D, and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectively, and h, 
u, t, and l  denote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, respectively  (see Table 
2-4). 
PASI scores can range from a lower value of 0, corresponding to no signs of psoriasis, up to a 
theoretic maximum of 72.0. 
The investigator is  responsible for collecting the components or scoring signs and total regional 
area for all visits. Total PASI and total BSA calculations  will be done by [CONTACT_777400]; The total PASI and BSA scores will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_777401] (see below).

compared to baseline are defined as PASI 50  responders 
• PASI 75  response : subject s achieving ≥ 75% improvement (reduct ion) in PASI score 
compared to baseline are defined as PASI 75  responders 
• PASI 90  response : subject s achieving ≥ 90% impr ovement (reduction) in PASI score 
compared to baseline are defined as PASI 90  responders 
• PASI 100 response  / remission : complete clear ing of psoriasis  (PASI=0)

1.2 Definition of IGA mod 2011 score and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response  
The IGA mod 2011 rating scale for overall psoriatic disease ( shown in Table 2-5) has been 
developed based on a previous version of the scale used in secukinumab phase II studies , and 
has been updated in collaboration with health author ities (in particular the FDA ). The 
explanations/descriptions of the points on the scale have been improved to ensure appropriate 
differentiation between the points. It is recommended that the same evaluator conducts the 
assessments throughout the study whenever possible. 
The IGA mod [ADDRESS_1067692]’s disease 
state at the time of the assessments, and does not attempt a comparison with any of the subject’s previous disease states, whether at baseli ne or at a previous visit. 
Table 2-[ADDRESS_1067693] clear  Normal to pi[INVESTIGATOR_108997]; no thickening; no to minimal 
focal scaling.  
2 Mild Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22767]; just detectable to mild thickening; 
predominantly fine scaling.  
3 Moderate  Dull bright red, clearly distinguishable erythema; clearly 
distinguishable to moderate thickening; moderate scaling.  
4 Severe  Bright to deep dark red coloration; severe thickening with hard 
edges; severe / coarse scaling covering almost all or all lesions.  
Note:  Involvement of nails is not part of the assessment.  
Subjects require  an IGA mod [ADDRESS_1067694] 2 points on the IGA mod 2011 scale 
compared to baseline.

2.5.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The statistical hypotheses are that secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) is not superior to placebo  
in the proportion of subjects with PASI 75 response and IGA 0 or 1 response at Week 12. 
Let p j denote the proportion of PASI  75 responders at Week 12 for treatment group j and r j 
denote the proportion of IGA  0 or 1 responders at Week 12 for treatment group j ;  
j=0, 1, where  
• 0 corresponds to placebo , 
• 1 corresponds to secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) . 
The following hypotheses will be tested : 
    H: H 1∪H2 versus H A: H A1∩HA2 
H1: p1 – p 0 ≤ 0 versus H A1: p1 – p 0 > 0, 
    H2: r1 – r 0 ≤ 0 versus H A2: r1 – r 0 > 0 
In other words: H: secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) is not superior  to placebo  with respect to either PASI  75 
response at Week  12 or IGA 0 or 1 response at Week 12 or both 
H
1: secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) is not superior  to placebo  with respect to PASI  75 
response at Week  12 
H2: secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) is not superior  to placebo  with respect to IGA 0 or 1  
response at Week  12 
The primary analysis method f or PASI 75 and IGA 0 or 1 response at Week 12 will be evaluated  
using logistic regression model with  treatment group, baseline body weight and baseline PASI 
score as explanatory  variables (see Section  5 Appendix ). Odds ratios will be computed for 

[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page [ADDRESS_1067695] logistic regression wi ll be performed. In case of response rates of 
0% or 100% in one of the treatment groups, for analyses with multiple imputation, confidence 
intervals for risk difference and p -values from the t -test for the risk difference comparing to 0 
will be provided; for analyses with non- responder imputation, Fisher ’s exact test will be 
performed and confidence intervals for risk difference will be provided. 
The hypotheses H1 and H2 will both be tested at α  level = 2.5% (one -sided) and significant 
results will only be achieved if both hypotheses are rejected (i.e., if only one hypothesis is rejected and the other hypothesis is not rejected, superiority of secukinumab 300 mg 2mL PFS cannot be demonstrated ). 
The primary analysis set will be the FAS.  
Summary statistics and figures will be provided as described in Section 5.4.2. Details in 
sensitivity analysis are provided in Section 2.5.4. 
2.5.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Response variables based on PASI score and IGA mod 2011 categories  will be imputed with 
multiple imputation (MI)  as primary imputation method for the missing values.  
Multiple imputation (MI) is a simulation based approach where missing values are replaced by 
[CONTACT_777402] n draws from the conditional distribution of missing data given the observed 
data and covariates, creating multiple completed data sets. These completed data sets can then be analyzed using standard methods. Within this analysis the PASI score or IGA mod 2011 categories will be imputed and response variables will be derived based on the imputed scores. In the multiple imputation analysis the response status will be imputed based on the individual treatment arm information.  
(Modified) Non-responder imputation will be used as a sensitivity method: Missing values with 
respect to response variables based on PASI score and IGA 2011 categories will be imputed with non- response regardless to the reason for missing data (e.g. premature study 
discontinuation, missed visit, administrative issues), exceptions will apply to the following:  
• If a subject dropped out of the study prior to last scheduled visit and being responder 
consecutively  at least for two preceding visits  before drop -off, the subje ct will be 
imputed as responder for all the later visits till last scheduled visit.  
• If a subject who was responder at visit x -1 and visit x +[ADDRESS_1067696] will be imputed as responder for visit x  as long as the distance  between 
the scheduled visits x -1 and x  is 4 weeks or less, and the distance between the scheduled 
visits x and x+1 is 4 weeks or less. Otherwise missing data will be imputed with non -
response. 
Summary tables for PASI scores and IGA mod 2011 categories will be imputed using MI. The mean for PASI score and the number (%) for IGA mod 2011 categories as well as their 95% confidence intervals will be given. In addition, PASI scores and IGA mod 2011 categories based on LOCF imputation will be provided in summary tables and listings.  
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 24  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
 
Note: Only PASI and IGA mod 2011 based response variables are imputed with multiple 
imputation or non-response, other response variables (e.g. D LQI 0 or 1 achievement ) will be 
imputed with LOCF.  
2.5.4  Supportive analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed as follows : 
(A)  Co-primary endpoints ( PASI  75 and IGA 0 or 1 response at Week 12) and key secondary 
endpoints will be evaluated using the  logistic regression as described  in primary  analysis 
method with non-responder imputations instead of multiple  imputation for missing values.  
2.6 Analysis of the key secondary objective  
2.6.1  Key secondary endpoint  
The key secondary endpoints of this study are planned as follow: 
• PASI 90 response at Week 12 
• PASI 100 response at Week 12  
The null hypotheses for secondary objectives are as follows: 
o H3: secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) is not superior to placebo  with respect to PASI 
90 response at Week 12  
o H4: secukinumab 300 mg (2mL PFS) is not superior to placebo  with respect to PASI 
100 response a t Week 12  
o H5: secukinumab 300 mg (2x1mL PFS) is not superior to placebo  with respect to PASI 
100 response at Week 12  
2.6.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The following hypotheses will be tested sequentially and are included in the hierarchical testing 
strategy and type -I-error will be set such that a family -wise type -I-error of α = 2.5% (one -sided) 
is kept . The graphical approach of ( Bretz et al. 2009) for sequentially rejective testing 
procedures is used to illustrate the testing strategy: 
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 25  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
Figure 1-1 Testing strategy  
 
The secondary efficacy variables involved in the above testing strategy will be analyzed  
analogously to the primary endpoints. i.e., logistic regression model with treatment group, 
baseline bodyweight, and baseline PASI score as explanatory  variables . Odds ratios will be 
computed for comparisons of secukinumab regimen versus placebo  utilizing  the logistic 
regression model fitted.  
The testing sequence will continue to H 3 at α (one- sided) only if both H [ADDRESS_1067697] been 
rejected at α (one- sided). Similarly, the testing sequence will continue to H 4 at α (one-sided) 
only if H 3 testing has been rejected. In case, H4 has been rejected at α  (one- sided), the 
corresponding alpha ( α) will be passed to the next hypotheses corresponding H 5.

crude rate will be derive d using the score method including continuity correction ( Newcombe 
1998) as described in Section  5.4.5. In addition, exposure time- adjusted incidence rates will be 
provided for the treatment period including all data (see Section 5.4.6).  
Adverse events  will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and 
percentage of subjects having at least one AE, having an AE in each primary system organ class 
and having each individual AE (preferred term). Summaries will also be presented for AEs by [CONTACT_777407] . If a particular AE ‘severity’ is missing, this 
variable will be listed as missing and treated as missing in summaries.  If a subject  reported more 
than one adverse event with the same preferred term, the adverse event with the greatest severity will be presented . If a subject  reported more than one adverse event within the same primary 
system organ class, the subject  will be counted only once with the greatest severity at the system 
organ class level, where applicable.  
Adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_777408] 
(SMQ or CMQ/NMQ).  The MedDRA version used for reporting the adverse events  will be 
described in a footnote. 
The most common adverse events reported ( ≥ z % in any group for each preferred term in the 
table  by [CONTACT_777409] ≥ z % in any group for each groupi[INVESTIGATOR_777384]) will be presented in 
descending frequency according to its incidence in secukinumab group starting from the most 
common event. Here threshold value z is set to 2 (%) but it may be updated following re view 
of the dry run outputs. 
A graphical  display of the crude rates or exposure adjusted incidence rates  within system organ 
classes will be  presented as follows: For all AEs regardless of severity and seriousness, the 
point estimate within system organ cl asses will be presented graphically with system organ 
class on the y -axis. This figure will consist of two  panels: i) point estimate of AEs, ii) point 
estimate of serious AEs. For the exposure adjusted incidences a linear -scale will be used on the 
x-axes.  
Separate summaries will be provided for death s, serious adverse event s, other significant 
adverse events leading to discontinuation and adverse events leading to dose adjustment  or 
interruption. Algorithms for date imputations will be provided in S ection [ADDRESS_1067699] regarding signal detection or routine analysis are defined

in the Program Case Retrieval Sheet  
 
Crude rate of important identified and potential risks from Case Retrieval Sheet will be provided 
for all (non -serious and serious) cases and for all serious cases. Exposure -time adjusted rates 
will be provided for treatment period including all data  for all (non -serious and serious) cases  
and for all serious cases . In addition, listings will be provided for the related AE risks. 
Risk measures and confidence intervals will be derived according to Section 5. 
The version of the Case Retrieval Sheet used for the analyses will be described in a footnote. 
This includes MedDRA version and [COMPANY_001] MedDRA Query  (NMQ) dictionary date.  
Important note: For the evaluation of risks primary and secondary system organ classes of the 
MedDRA dictionary will be considered. 
For the legal requirements of ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT, two required tables  on adverse 
events which are not serious adverse events with an incidence greater than 2% and on serious 
adverse events and SAE suspected to be related to study treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_777410] n. 
If for a same patient, several consecutive AEs (irrespective of study treatment causality, seriousness and severity) occurred with the same SOC and PT:  
• a single occurrence will be counted if there is  ≤ 1 day gap between the end date of the preceding AE  and the start date of the consecutive AE 
• more than one occurrence will be counted if there is > [ADDRESS_1067700] one SAE / SAE suspected to  be related to study 
treatment / non SAE has to be checked in a block e.g., among AE ’s in a ≤ [ADDRESS_1067701] one SAE is occurring, then one occurrence is calculated for that SAE.  
The number of deaths resulting from SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment and SAEs irrespective of study treatment relationship will be provided by [CONTACT_3592]. 
2.8.2  Deaths  
Separate summary and listing will be provided for deaths. 2.8.3  Laboratory data  
The summary of laboratory evaluations will be presented for two  groups of laboratory tests 
(hematology and serum chemistry ).  
Descriptive summary statistics for the change from baseline to each study visit will be presented 
by [CONTACT_109058]. Change from baseline will only be summarized for subjects with both baseline and post baseline values and will be calculated as: 
change from baseline = post baseline value – baseline value  
Only “on-treatment ” laboratory data will be summar ized (i.e. assessments within last dose plus 
84 days). All laboratory data will be listed with “on -treatment” flag displayed. If two 

[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 30  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
measurements are taken on the same date/time/CRF visit then use the average of two 
assessments. 
For laboratory test values below Lower Level of Quantification (LLQ) or above Upper Level 
of Quantification (ULQ) will be imputed as LLQ or ULQ value, respectively. The numerical part of the reported result will be treated as the actual LLQ or ULQ . These laboratory values 
will be displayed in listings using the standard unit with  the reported sign (“<” or “>”).” For 
example, the actual lab result  is “<5” and LLQ = 10, it will be reported  for the numerical part 
as 5 and listed as “<5”, LLQ will be imputed as 5. 
In addition, shift tables may be provided as required at ad -hoc basis  for all parameters to 
compare a subject’s baseline laboratory evaluation relative to the most extreme laboratory test 
value within a treatment period . For the shift tables, the normal laboratory ranges will be used 
to evaluate whether a particular laboratory test value is  normal, low, or high (including category 
“high and low”). These summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_109058].  
Subjects with abnormal laboratory values will be listed and values outside the normal ranges will be flagged . 
The following laboratory parameters will be analyzed with respect to numerical Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event s (CTCAE) grades, given in Table 2-8: hemoglobin, 
platelets , white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, total bilirubin (TBL), 
gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT ), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a spartate 
aminotransferase (AST), a lkaline phosphatase ( ALP) . 
The number and percentage of subjects with CTCAE grade newly occurring or worsening after 
baseline will be presented . These summaries will be split into hematology and chemistry.

Exposure time adjusted incidence for subjects with newly occurring  neutropenia of CTCAE 
grade >=2 will be summarized and listed in the listing. The number and percentage of subjects with newly occurring liver enzyme abnormalities will 
also be summarized based on the event criteria given in Table 2-9.

Note: elevated ALP may suggest obstruction as a consequence of gall bladder or 
bile duct disease; ALP may also be increased in malignancy. FDA therefore terms 
Hy’s Law cases as indicators of pure hepat ocellular injury . This does not mean 
that cases of A LT or AST  >3xULN & TBL >2xULN & ALP ≥2xULN may not result 
in severe DILI.  
ALT or AST >3xULN & TBL >2xULN & ALP <2xULN  ( Potential Hy’s Law ) or 
reported Hy’s Law case  
Note: “Hy’s Law case” is a lower level term in MedDRA (10070546) and may be 
reported as AE.  
For a combined criterion to be fulfilled, all conditions have to be fulfilled on the same visit. The 
criteria are not mutually exclusive, e.g., a subject with ALT = 6.42xULN is counted for ALT >3x ULN and ALT>5xULN.  
Individual subject data listings will be provided for subjects with newly occurring  or worsening 
abnormal laboratory data. Data of subjects with n ewly occurring liver enzyme abnormalities  
will be listed in an additional listing.  
Fasting laboratory tests including fasting plasma glucose and fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_777385]. No analysis will be done for these measurements.  
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page [ADDRESS_1067729] dipstick measurements for specific gravity, protein, glucose, pH, blood, 
urine blood (non- hemolyzed), urine blood (hemolyzed), bilirubin, ketones, WBC will be done 
at screening . No analysis will be done for these measurements.  
2.8.4  Other safety data 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ECG and cardiac imaging data  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed at scre ening to assess  the eligibility of subjects. No 
analysis will be done for ECG measurements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital signs  
Analysis in vital sign measurement using descriptive summary statistics for the change from baseline for each post -baseline visit will be performed  by v ital sign and treatment group. 
Change from baseline will only be summarized for subjects with both baseline and post -baseline 
values and will be calculated as:  
change from baseline = post -baseline value – baseline value  
Only “on- treatment” vital signs  will be summarized (i.e. assessments within last dose plus 84 
days). All vital signs  will be listed with “on- treatment ” flag displayed. 
The number and percentage of subjects with newly occurring notable vital signs abnormalities 
will be presented. Criteria for notable vital sign abnormalities  are provided in Table 2-10 below.  
A listing of subjects with newly occurring notably abnormal vital signs will be provided.

Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)  >=90 mmHg or <60 mmHg  
Pulse (bpm)  > 100 bpm or <[ADDRESS_1067730] deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), median and quartiles, the geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation (CV) and n(log) will be presented. The formula for deriving the geometric mean and CV (%) is as fol lowing:  
• CV (%) = (SD/mean)*100,  
• geometric mean=exp( (sum of log transformed data) / number of non-missing data points after log transformation),  
• geometric CV = sqrt( exp( variance of log -transformed data) -1)*100.

Secukinumab serum concentration in the AIN457 300mg (2mL PFS) group will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_17838] s locations at previous 3 visits (i.e., though only, abdomen only, and 
though and abdomen) at Weeks [ADDRESS_1067731] secukinumab dose , reason excluding from ana lysis will be listed by 
[CONTACT_19016]. Placebo subjects will also be listed.   
Values below lower limit of quantification/below detection limit will be imputed by 0.  
The analysis visit will refer to the visit as per the CRF.   Pharmacokinetic parameter s will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (AIN457 300mg 2mL PFS 
and AIN457 300 mg 2×1mL PFS). Descriptive summary statistics for Cmax and AUC 84-112d 
include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD, and CV (arithmetic and geometric), median, 
minimum and maximum. Tmax in days will be summarized as median, minimum and maximum. In addition, pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed by [CONTACT_19016].  
The log -transformed parameters Cmax and AUC 84-112d will be analyzed by a linear model, 
with treatment group (AIN457 300mg 2mL PFS and AIN457 300 mg 2×1mL PFS) as a fixed factor and body weight at baseline as covariate. For each of Cmax and AUC84-112d, the mean estimate and 90% confidence interval for the PK parameter ratio of “AIN457 300mg 2mL PFS” vs “AIN457 300 mg 2×1mL PFS” will be reported to represent the relative bioavailability for comparison.The log -transformed AUC84 -112d at Week 12 in the AIN457 300mg (2mL PFS) 
group will be analyzed by a linear model, with injection location, laterality and body weight at baseline. The mean estimate and 90% confidence interval for the ratio of thigh vs abdomen and 
that of left vs right will be reported.  
In addition, a linear model with previous injections location s and body weight at baseline will 
be fitted for the log -transformed AUC84- 112d at Week 12 in the AIN457 300mg (2mL PFS) 
group. The mean estimate and 90% confidence interval for the ratio of “thigh only” vs 
“abdomen only”, and that of “thigh and abdomen” vs  “abdomen only”  will be reported. For 
Week 12, the previous injections locations at randomization, Weeks 1, 2, 3, [ADDRESS_1067732] performs the 
six critical steps as per the IFU ( i.e. P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14) . Number and percentage of

H1: successful pre -filled syringe  use rate ≥  90%  
Missing values with respect to the self -assessment checklist and possible hazard assessment 
checklist will not be imputed while summarizing the answers of each question with frequencies.  
Subjects with one or more of the critical steps missing will be  considered as unsuccessful 
(imputation with non- response) with regard to the self -injection success. Subjects who 
discontinued or who missed a visit and have the full self -injection checklist missing will not be 
evaluated with regard to the self -injection  success at the corresponding visit.  
Visit windows will not be applied to self -injection assessment and possible hazard assessment. 
The analysis visit will refer to the visit as per the CRF.

Dermatology Life Quality Index  
The DLQI measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological disorders that are 
greater than 18 years of age and had been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The DLQI is a simple, validated, self -
administered 10- item questionnaire. The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., 
symptoms and feeling, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, treatment) . For the DLQI, each question will be answered with the following response: “not at 
all”, “a little” , “a lot”, or “very much”. “ Not relevant” is also a valid response . Seven scores 
will be derived from the DLQI: the total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.  

[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 35

For each of the seven scores , the percentage change from basel ine will be derived. Summary 
statistics will be provided for absolute values as well as for the percentage change by [CONTACT_10663].  
In addition, summary statistics will be provided for number of subjects achieving DLQI 0 or 1. Treatment groups will be compared by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test.

elf-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ)  
All SIAQ analyses will be based on the Safety Set.  
Summary statistics for the absolute values of the domain scores at Randomization (baseline) 
will be provided by [CONTACT_777412] -module and the POST -module. 
The number and percentage of subjects in each of the 5 categories (likert scale) for each item will be presented by [CONTACT_777413].  
Item and domain scores from the PRE module taken before the first self -injection at 
Randomization (baseline) will be compared with the corresponding item and domain scores (feeling about injections, self -confidence domains, and overall satisfaction of self -injection item) 
from the POST modules. Change in domain scores from PRE module will be summarized by [CONTACT_777413]. 
Domain scores will be calculated only if 50% or more items of the domain are completed. 
Missing items will not be imputed. Subjects who discontinued or who missed a visit and have the SIAQ questionnaire not completed will not be considered in the analyses at the corresponding visit. 
Of note: only SIAQ scores for those with self -injection checked in e CRF DAR  page are 
included in the analyses.

3 Sample size calculation  
A response rate of 8% for PASI  75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response in the placebo 
group is expected, whereas a  response rate of 62% for PASI 75 response and 55% for IGA mod 
2011 0 or 1 is the anticipated response in the secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL pre -filled syringe 
group. 
Placebo -response rates between 3% and 7% have been reported in Papp et al 2005, Menter et 
al 2008, Leonardi et al 2008, and Papp et al 2008.

3.1 Primary endpoint (co-primary endpoint)  
With respect to the co -primary endpoint (PASI  75 response and IGA  mod 2011 0 or 1 response 
at Week  12), the type -I-error will be 2.5% one -sided for comparison. With 70 subjects per group 
and assuming a response rate of 10% for PASI  75 response and IGA  mod 2011 0 or  1 response 
in the placebo group, the power to show a response rate of 62% for PASI 75 response and 55% 
for IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response in the secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL pre -filled group based on 
Fisher’s exact test (nQuery Advisor 6.01, two group Fisher’s -exact test of equal proportions) is 
above 99% for PASI 75 response and IGA  mod 2011 0 or 1 response. 
3.1.1  Secondary endpoints  
A power of 90% to show a response rate of 30% for PASI 100 in the secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL 
pre-filled group and 8% in the placebo group based on Fisher’s exact test results in a sample 
size of 70 subjects per group. Same power can be achieved if we apply the same assumption of PASI 100 response rate for secukinumab 300 mg 1 mL pre- filled group. 
A power of above 99% to show a response rate of 46% for PASI 90 in the secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL pre -filled group and 8% in the placebo group based on Fisher’s exact test results in a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_1067735] been removed: 
• The maximum change (maximum decrease and maximum increase) from baseline

5.1 Imputation rules 
5.1.1  Study drug  
Any partial dates will be imputed as follows: 
We take the earlier day of  
• The last day in the month and  
• The calculated end day of the corresponding epoch 

[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 38  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
5.1.2  AE date imputation 
Impute AE end  date: 
1. If the AE end date ‘ month ’ is missing, the imputed end date should be set to the earliest of 
the (min (last visit date, last dose date + 84 days) , 31DECYYYY, date of death).  
2. If the AE end date ‘ day’ is missing, the imputed end date should be set to the earliest of the 
(min (las t visit date, last dose date + 84 days), last day of the month, date of death).  
3. If AE ‘ year’ is missing or AE is ongoing, the end date will not be imputed.  
 
Impute AE start date :  
Before imputing AE start date, find the AE start reference date.  
1. If the (imputed) AE end date is complete and the (imputed) AE end date < treatment start 
date then AE start reference date = min(informed consent date, earliest visit date).  
2. Else AE start reference date = treatment start date  
 
1. If the AE start date ‘y ear’ value is missing, the date uncertainty is too high to impute a 
rational date. Therefore, if the AE year value is missing, the imputed AE start date is set to 
NULL.  
2. If the AE start date ‘ year’ value is less than the treatment start date year value,  the AE 
started before treatment. Therefore:  
a. If AE ‘month’ is missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the mid -year point 
(01JulYYYY).  
b. Else if AE ‘month’ is not missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the mid -month 
point (15MONYYYY).  
3. If the AE start date year value is greater than the treatment start date year value, the AE 
started after treatment. Therefore:  
a. If the AE month is missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the year start point (01JanYYYY).  
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 39  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
b. Else if the AE mont h is not missing, the imputed AE start date is set to the later of 
(month start point (01MONYYYY), AE start reference date + 1 day).  
4. If the AE start date year value is equal to the treatment start date year value:  
a. And the AE month is missing the im puted AE start date is set to the AE reference 
start date + 1 day.  
b. Else if the AE month is less than the treatment start month, the imputed AE start 
date is set to the mid -month point (15MONYYYY).  
c. Else if the AE month is equal to the treatment star t date month or greater than the 
treatment start date month, the imputed AE start date is set to the later of (month start point (01MONYYYY), AE start reference date + 1 day).  
If complete (imputed) AE end date is available and the imputed AE start date is  greater than 
the (imputed) AE end date, then imputed AE start date should be set to the (imputed) AE end date.  
5.1.3  Concomitant medication date imputation  
Impute CM  end date:  
1. If CM end day is missing and CM month/year are non- missing then impute CM day as the 
minimum of treatment end date and the last day of the month.  
2. If CM end day/month are missing and CM year is non- missing then impute CM day as the 
minimum of treatme nt end date and the end of the year (31DECYYYY).  
3. If imputed CM end date is less than the CM start date, use the CM start date as the imputed 
CM end date.  
Impute CM  start  date:  
1. If the CM start date year value is missing, the imputed CM start date is set to one day prior 
to treatment start date.  
2. If the CM start date year value is less than the treatment start date year value, the CM started before treatment. Therefore:  
a. If the CM month is missing, the imputed CM start date is set to the mid -year point 
(01JulYYYY).  
b. Else if the CM month is not missing, the imputed CM start date is set to the mid -
month point (15MONYYYY).  
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 40  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
3. If the CM start date year value is greater than the treatment start date year value, the CM 
started after treatment. The refore:  
a. If the CM month is missing, the imputed CM start date is set to the year start point (01JanYYYY).

5.1.5  Other imputations  
Only PASI and IGA mod 2011 based response variables are imputed with multiple imputation 
or non-response, other response variables (e.g. D LQI 0 or 1 achievement ) will be imputed with 
LOCF.  
For DLQI ,  missing values will be replaced by [CONTACT_317875]. Baseline values will not 
be carried forward . If no pre -treatment value exists, value s obtained after first dose  of treatment  
can be used as baseline only if it was collected on the same day as first dose.  In addition, m issing 
baseline (PROs) values will be replaced by [CONTACT_777411]- missing baseline values 
stratified by [CONTACT_551] ( <65 years, 65 years and older) and sex , for continuous scale or 
categorical/ordinal scale, respectively.  
For laboratory test values below Lower Level of Quantification (LLQ) or above Upper Level 
of Quantification (ULQ) will be imputed as LLQ or ULQ value, respectively. The numerical 
part of the reported result will be tre ated as the actual LLQ or ULQ . These laboratory values 
will be displayed in listings using the standard unit with  the reported sign (“<” or “>”).”  
5.2 AEs coding/grading 
Adverse events will also be coded according to MedDRA  dictionary , using a narrow search. 
The MedDRA version used for reporting the adverse events  will be described in a footnote.

For PASI score, DLQI total scores,  summary statistics will be derived for absolute and 
percentage changes from baseline.

For response variables (e.g. for IGA mod 2011 0 or 1, PASI 75, PASI 50, PASI 90 and PASI 
100 response) the placebo  adjusted response rates  (risk difference) including 95% confidence 
interval will be derived  by [CONTACT_765]. 
Figures will be provided for PASI 75 response (upper left) PASI 90 response (upper right), 
PASI 100 response (lower left) and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (lower right) at Week 12 as 
dot plots displaying treatments on the x -axis and point estimates including 95% confidence 
intervals on the y- axis.  
For time courses of response variables, the point estimate at each time point including 95% confidence interval will be plotted. 
5.4.3  Logisti c regression  
Binary outcome variables, including PASI 50 / 75 / 90 / 100 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 
1 response, will be evaluated using a logistic regression model with  treatment  regimen,  baseline 
body weight and baseline PASI score. Odds ratios will be  computed for comparisons of 
secukinumab dose regimen  versus placebo  utilizing the logistic regression model fitted.   
If response rates are 0% or 100% in one of the treatment groups odds ratio estimate and p-values 
will not be displayed in outputs, but “-” will be shown. 
The odds ratio will be calculated such that an odds ratio > 1 is favorable for secukinumab. Using 
PROC GENMOD to calculate the confidence interval  for the odds ratios  assumes asymptotic 
normality of the Wald estimate for the regression coefficient . The 95% confidence interval  for 
the regression parameter of the active treatment effect relative to control(s) will be calculated 
using an exponential transform ation to create the confidence interval for the odds ratio. p q− =1

( ), 1 for 1 , 1= = <p U p
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 43  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
All p -values reported on linear hypotheses about regression coefficients will be based on the 
Wald tests from Type III analyses.  In the SAS procedure PROC GENMOD, a Type III analysis 
will be performed by [CONTACT_777414]: TYPE3, DIST=BIN, and LINK=LOGIT. 
Logistic regression will be applied to response variables at each visit.  
If logistic regression model does not converge, the following steps will be performed:  
1. Run the PROC GENMOD procedure with EXACT statement;  
2. If convergence not reached, remove the covariates from the model one by [CONTACT_777415]; start with continuous covariates (i.e., baseline bodyweig ht by 
[CONTACT_777416], and then baseline PASI  score), followed by [CONTACT_777417] (i.e., weight stratum);  
3. If convergence not reached, perform Fisher’s exact test.  
It should be noted that this model might not converge if response rates are too low. 
5.4.4  Multiple imputations for response variables  
Primary and secondary endpoints  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_777418] m issing 
values.  In addition, logistic regression analysis for PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100 and 
IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response by [CONTACT_777419]. 
In the multiple imputation s analysis the response status will be imputed based on the individual 
treatment arm information.  
Multiple imputation (MI) is a simulation based approach where missing values are replaced by 
[CONTACT_777420], creating multiple completed data sets. These completed data sets can then be analyzed using standard methods. Rubin (1987)  presented rules how to combine the multiple 
sets of estimates to produce overall estimates and confidence intervals that ad equately 
incorporate missing data uncertainty .  
Missing values for the ‘change from baseline PASI score’ and ‘IGA mod 2011 score’ will be 
imputed simultaneously based on an underlying joint normal distribution and using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The change from baseline in PASI score appears to follow closer to a normal distribution than the actual PASI score. Assuming normality for the 
‘IGA mod 2011 score’ is motivated by [CONTACT_773552] (1997) , where it was shown that the 
multivariate normal approximation for the imputation of incomplete categorical and binary data is robust.  
The imputations will be done separately for each treatment group including baseline weight, 
failure to at least one previous biologic (yes/no), and number of previous system ic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_777389].  
Summary statistics for PASI  50, PASI  75, PASI  90, PASI  100, and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1  
response by [CONTACT_777421]. 
The number of imputations will be set to  100, the seed for the random function will be set to 
4572323 for this study . To generate the multiple imputed data sets, the SAS procedure MI can 
be used as follows: 
[COMPANY_001]  For business use only  Page 44  
SAP  CAIN457A23 23 
 
The input data set <pasi_iga> should have one record per subject with baseline PASI score and

Programming notes: 
• The SAS procedure MIANALYZE expects a variable called “_IMPUTATION_ which 
is generated by [CONTACT_777422]. It might be needed to set the SAS option “VALIDVARNAME=UPCASE” temporarily in the program before the MI call, this option should be reset after the MIANALYZE call to VALIDVARNAME=V6.  
• In case there are no missing s in one treatment group, the MI procedure does not 
impute any values. In this case the corresponding data need to be imputed manually outside PROC MI and added to the dataset <impdata>.  
 
The imputed data are saved in data set <impdata>. The outcomes of interest, i.e. the PASI  
50/75/90/100 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response will be calculated, e.g. as follows: 
 
DATA <impdata2>;  
 SET <impdata>;  
IF <change from baseline PASI week primary endpoint>/<baseline PASI>=0.75  THEN <PASI 75 response> =1;  
ELSE <PASI 75  response>=0;

IF <baseline IGA> >=3 THEN DO;  
      IF <IGA week primary endpoint> < 1.5 THEN <IGA 0/1 response> =1;  
 ELSE IF <IGA week primary endpoint> >=1.5 THEN <IGA 0/1 response> =0;  
 ELSE PUT "E" "RROR:" stysid1a=;  
END; 
ELSE IF <baseline IGA>=2 THEN DO;  
      IF <IGA week primary endpoint> < 0.5 THEN <IGA 0/1 response> =1;  
 ELSE IF <IGA week primary endpoint> >=0.5 THEN <IGA 0/1 response> =0; 
 ELSE PUT "E" "RROR:" stysid1a=;  
END; 
ELSE <IGA 0/1 response> =0;  
RUN; 
 
The treatment differences for each imputed data set will then be evaluated by [CONTACT_777423] [IP_ADDRESS]. This analysis will be done by

_IMPUTATION_ for the comparison to the placebo  treatment group. The model should be 
estimating response probability = 1 by [CONTACT_777425]. Using the ESTIMATE  
option in the GENMOD procedure and the ODS OUTPUT data s et “Estimates ” provides the 
estimate for the odds ratio and confidence intervals .

the corresponding standard error in the variable STDERR. Measurements can be obtained from “Estimates ” dataset by [CONTACT_777426].

RUN;  
 
The estimates and standard errors based on the 100 imputed data are then combined by [CONTACT_777427]’s rules for multiple imputed data sets, see Little  and Rubin (2002) .  
Programming notes:  
• The variables ESTIMATE and STDERR in the input data set for the MIANALYZE 
procedure may not be missing. Records with missing values need to be deleted and the variable _IMPUTATION_ needs to be renumbered and regenerated since for each by -
group the procedure expects consecutive numbers starting at 1. 
• The ESTIMATE and STDERR in terms of odds ratios from logistic regressions will be transformed to follow a normal distribution before MIANALYZE procedure . They will 
be transformed back to Odds Ratio to get the corrected ESTIMATE and corresponding 
CIs.   
The SAS procedure MIANALYZE will be applied as follows:

With z as (1-α/2)-quantile of the standard normal distribution (SAS: z=PROBIT(1 -alpha/2), n

Note: if p = 0 then L = 0 and if p = 1 then U = 1. 
If appropriate, an exact 100*(1- α)% confidence interval ( Clopper- Pearson 1934) will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_777428]. 
However, the confidence interval derived via the score method including continuity correction 
will be the default in safety analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relative risk and 100*(1- α)% confidence interval  
For an investigational drug group with n 1 subjects at risk, independent from the control group 
(e.g., placebo or comparator) with n 0 subjects at risk , of whom x 1 and x 0 experience a certain 
event with probability π 1 and π 0 respectively, the relative risk is estimated as p 1/p0 with p 1=x1/n1 
and p 0=x0/n0. 
An asymptotic 100*(1- α)% confidence interval on the relative risk will be based on the back-
transformed large sample confidence limits on the log -transformed relative risk estimate which 
are obtained by [CONTACT_777429] -method and Slutzky’s theorem ( Lachin 2000). The SAS 
procedure PROC FREQ with option RELRISK in the TABLES statement will be used to provide the asymptotic 100*(1- α)% confidence interval on the relative risk. The estimate is not 
computed if either x
[ADDRESS_1067739] confidence interval will be obtained as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. If the relative risk is not well 
approximated by [CONTACT_777430] s ratio but asymptotic normality is questionable, STATXACT will be 
used.

For an investigational drug group with n 1 subjects at risk, independent from the control group 
(e.g., placebo or comparator) with n 0 subjects at risk , of whom x 1 and x 0 experience a certain 
event, the risk difference is estimated as p 1-p0 with p 1= x 1/n1 and p 0=x0/n0.  
Exact unconditional confidence limits for the risk difference  will be obtained with SAS 
procedure PROC FREQ and option RISKDIFF in the TABLES statement, specifying t he 
RISKDIFF option also in the EXACT statement.  5.4.6  Exposure adjusted incidence rate and related risk estimates  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exposure adjusted incidence rate and 100*(1- α)% confidence interval  
It will be assumed that for each of n subjects in a clinical trial the time t
j (j=1,...,n) to the first 
occurrence of a certain treatment emergent event is observed, or if the event was not 
experienced, the (censored) time to the end of the observation period or last dose plus [ADDRESS_1067740] occurrences of an event will be modeled to follow 
approximately a Poisson process with constant intensity θ. The rate parameter θ will be 
estimated as λ=D/T, where ∑

1and D is the number of subjects  with at least one event. 
Conditionally on T, an exact 100*(1- α)% confidence interval for a Poisson variable with 
parameter θT and observed value D can be obtained based on (Garwood, 1936), from which an 
exact 100*(1- α)% confidence interval for D/T will be  derived as follows (Sahai, 1993; Ulm, 
1990): 
Lower confidence limit    for D>0, 0 otherwise,

Primary usability assessment: 
• Assessment of successful self -administration by [CONTACT_777432] 1. Successful self -
injection is achieved when the subject performs all required steps effectively and safely to 
deliver the correct dose from the device at the correct injection site. The sequence of user steps (as  per IFU) that are minimally required are P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14 ( Table 5-2), 
these 6 critical steps will be used to define successful administration. The general passing usability goal for ‘successful use’ task completion will be defined as ≥ 90% pas s rate

The DLQI is a 10 -item general dermatology disability index designed to assess Health -related 
quality of life in adult subjects with skin diseases (e.g. psoriasis). The measure is self -
administered and includes six domains of symptoms and feelings , daily activities,  leisure, work 
and school, personal relationships and treatment. 
The scoring of each question is as follows: 
• Very much  : Scored 3  
• A lot : Scored 2  
• A little: Scored 1  
• Not at all: Scored 0  
• Not relevant : Scored 0  
• Question unanswered: Scored 0 
• Question 7: "prevented work or studying" : Scored 3  
The DLQI total score will be calculated by [CONTACT_37303] a 
maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more Quality of Life is impaired .  
Meaning of DLQI Scores : 
• 0-1= no effect at all on subject's life  
• 2-5= small effect on subject's life  
• 6-10= moderate effect on subject's life  
• 11-20= very large effect on subject's life  
• 21-30= extremely large effect on subject's life

The DLQI will be analyzed under six headings as follow s: 
• Symptoms and feelings : questions 1 and 2, s core maximum 6  
• Daily activities : questions 3 and 4, s core maximum 6  
• Leisure : questions 5 and 6, s core maximum 6  
• Work and school : question 7, s core maximum 3  
• Personal relationships : questions 8 and 9: s core maximum 6  
• Treatment : question 10, s core maximum 3  
Interpretation of incorrectly completed questionnaires: 
There is a very high success rate of accurate completion of the DLQI . However, sometimes 
subjects do make mistakes.  
1. If one question is left unanswered this is scored 0. 
2. If two or more questions are left unanswered the questionnaire will not be scored. 
3. If question 7 is answered 'yes' this will be scored 3. If question 7 will be answered 'no' or 
'not relevant' but then either 'a lot' or 'a little' is tick ed this will then be scored [ADDRESS_1067747] score will 
be recorded.  
5. If there is a response between two tick boxes, the lower of the two score options will be 
recorded.  
6. If one item is missing from a two - item subscale that subscale will not be scored.  
Handling of missing values: 
• If there is only one missing score per visit, it will be imputed with 0, and then the subscale 
including this item and the total score are derive d accordingly.  
• If there are two or more missing scores per visit, LOCF will be applied to the individual question scores, subscale scores, and total score, separately (i.e. LOCF is NOT applied to the 10 individual question scores for further derivation of the 6 subscale scores and 1 total score).  
Of note, in situations where subjects responded to more questions than what was expected or required, the “most severe” answer was entered into the WriteResult (vendor for PRO data) database. In most cases the Self -Evident Corrections (SECs) were defined correctly, however, 
the SEC regarding question 7A/7B was not designed to select the “most severe” answer. This was confirmed with [COMPANY_001] HEOR and communicated to the AIN team.

5.7.3  Self-injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ)  
The Self -Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) is a questionnaire to measure overall 
subject experience with subcutaneous self -injection, and to investigate its psychometric 
properties. The SIAQ is composed of two modules: the PRE -module and the POST -module. 
The PRE -module, which is completed at Randomization before the first self -injection (baseline), 
includes 7 items grouped into three domains: feelings about injections, self -confidence and 
satisfaction with self -injection. The POST-module, which is completed following the two self-
injections, includes several items addressing five principal domains: feelings about injections, 
self-confidence, injection -site reactions, ease of use, satisfaction plus a sing le item assessing 
self-image. Subjects will rate each item of the SIAQ on a 5 -point semantic Likert -type scale 
ranging from 1 (worst experience) to 5 (best experience). Item score will be transformed to obtain a score ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience). The domain score will then be calculated as the mean of the item scores included in the domain.  
Respondent rates each item of the PRE SIAQ and items 1- [ADDRESS_1067748]’s worst experience and 
a score of [ADDRESS_1067749]’s best experience.  
The scoring of domains is performed in 2 steps: 
1. The raw item scores ranging from 1 to 5 are transformed into scores ranging from 0 (worst 
experience) to 10 (best experience).  
2. The transformed scores for items contributing to a domain are then averaged into a domain score ( Table 5 -5).

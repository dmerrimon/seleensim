Revised 8/31/2020The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75027].
For research conducted outside MSSM and its affiliates under the supervision of the Sinai 
investigator:
N/A – each site has its own PI.
(a) Site-specific regulations, laws or customs affecting research.
(b) Local scientific and ethical review structure.
2.Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research: (the aim here is to 
assess if the research is likely to be successful and thus justify the efforts and risks taken by [CONTACT_12912]):
Explain the feasibility of meeting the recruitment goals of this project, and 
demonstrate (e.g., based on retrospective data) a potential for recruiting the 
required number of suitable subjects within the agreed recruitment period.  (For 
example, how many potential subjects do you have access to? What percentage of 
those potential subjects do you need to recruit? If this has been reviewed by a 
committee for recruitment feasibility [e.g. PR&MC], please indicate so.)
It will be feasible to meet our recruitment goals of 400 participants.  During 2014, 
there were ~2,500 unique adult asthmatics that had outpatient visits to the primary 
care and pulmonary practices. In our prior MSH-based cohort studies, 
approximately 30% were overweight and 30% obese. 
For research involving considerable data extraction or mining describe who will 
be providing those services.
Mount Sinai Data Warehouse (MSDW) will provide lists of potential eligible 
participants as well as daily report for any participants enrolled in our study 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75028].
For research conducted outside MSSM and its research affiliates, describe the 
facilities used for conducting the research. 
At the University of Colorado, The Asthma Clinical Research Center is located on 
the 6th Floor of the UCH, Anschutz Outpatient Pavilion Building, it has 
Approximately 5000 sq. ft. of clinical areas with eight patient exam rooms, which 
are equipped with exam tables, BP cuffs, otoscopes, spi[INVESTIGATOR_75029], 2-Niox VEROs, 
and a negative pressure filter ventilated room for methacholine challenges. The 
Clinical Center sees over 2,000 patients with obesity and asthma per year.  The

Revised 8/31/2020with patient recruitment and consent. Administrative support staff are available to 
support research activities. Standard office supplies and capabilities, including 
confidential fax machine, mail, and photocopying are available. In addition, the 
research coordinators have dedicated [ADDRESS_81549]. Grasemann’s lab is located on the 9th floor of SickKids new research facility, 
the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning (PGCRL). Completed in 2013, 
the PGCRL is the largest high-rise research facility in Canada and houses more 
than 2,000 research staff; consolidating scientists and core facilities under one roof. 
The state-of-the-art laboratory and learning space allow for interaction and 
interconnectivity among the various disciplines, enhancing the opportunities for 
long-term collaboration and hence promoting and fostering SickKids’ strengths in 
multidisciplinary inquiry.  For the purpose of this project [CONTACT_75072] will 
extensively use the services of the Analytical Facility for Bioactive Molecules: this 
fee-for-service core facility (2000 sq. ft) is fully equipped for metabolomic and 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_75030]-of-art mass spectrometry (MS/MS, MALDI-TOF, 
IRMS, GC/MS), liquid chromatography (HPLC), and ELISA-based multiplexing 
assays
Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are 
adequately informed about the protocol, the investigational product(s), and their 
trial-related duties and functions. If research is being carried out in a clinical 
setting explain how the clinical staff will be informed of the trial and their 
involvement, e.g. medication administration.  If nursing or other services have 
reviewed and approved this project please upload the documentation. 
All study staff will be required to undergo all institutional-specific regulatory 
trainings prior to beginning the project and will also be required to update this 
training annually.  During data collection and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731], the PIs and research 
teams will meet biweekly to discuss all aspects of study administration and data 
collection.

We will request a list of potentially eligible participants from MSDW of patients 
from the outpatient primary care and pulmonary clinics at MSHS.  
Describe how potential subjects will be approached, the involvement of the treating 
clinicians, use of letter, emails, calls, or similar, opt-out provisions, etc. Describe 
materials that will be used to recruit subjects. Include copi[INVESTIGATOR_75031]. For advertisements, submit the final copy of printed 
advertisements. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, provide the final 
audio/video file. You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior to tapi[INVESTIGATOR_75032]-approval but final audio/video recording has to receive IRB approval 
before use.
There will be no “cold-contact” of patients.  The RAs will obtain permission from 
physicians to contact [CONTACT_75054].  The RAs will contact [CONTACT_75055]-person interview. At time of scheduling, RAs will mail or 
email the consent document to the scheduled patient.  The RA will then follow up 
with the scheduled individual to review the consent over the phone and ask 
questions about asthma history. The patient should have an interview scheduled 
within four weeks of the phone consent.  Data will be recorded in the patient 
record. If the patient does not come in for the study visit or for rescheduled visits, 
the data collected over the phone will be destroyed. RAs will try to reschedule 
patient interviews up to [ADDRESS_81550] a distribution of participants 
well-balanced by [CONTACT_75056] (early vs. late). We will 
recruit both obese and non-obese subjects. Obesity is defined as having a body 
mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. However, we will monitor these 
parameters during recruitment and conduct purposeful sampling if unbalances are 
identified. 
Acute Care Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: We will also interview participants (<30 minutes) and collect 
blood samples within [ADDRESS_81551] asthma exacerbations 
resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75033]. There is a limit of one 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75034] a 12 month period. The purpose is to determine 
whether L-arginine/ADMA ratios and arginase levels fall disproportionately among 
obese patients with late onset asthma during exacerbations. We will determine

Revised 8/31/2020Data will be transmitted from other sites to Mount Sinai via the secure Mount 
Sinai-hosted OneDrive, a secure, HIPAA-compliant shared drive.  This will be 
used to transmit de-identified accelerometer and spi[INVESTIGATOR_44049]. University of 
Colorado research staff will also have access to Mount Sinai’s REDCap, where 
they will input deidentified survey data.
How will data be stored? Provide data standards where known.
To preserve patient confidentiality, study subjects will be assigned code numbers. Using 
these codes, none of the collection forms will contain the names or medical record 
number of the patients or other personal identifiers. There will be a master list at each 
institution matching the names of the patients to the code numbers. The list will be 
safely stored in secure network drives. Paper-based consent and HIPAA documents will 
be stored in locked cabinets within locked offices, separate from the master lists. All 
electronic data will be stored on mainframe servers, and terminals and Tablet PCs will 
be password protected and maintained in locked offices. 
Database protection: Patient information will only be accessible to the PI, project 
manager, and research coordinators associated with the research. Data collected on 
Tablet personal computers (PC) will be uploaded on a daily basis to mainframe servers 
supported by [CONTACT_75057]. These data 
will lack personal identifiers other than a study identification code.  Following the 
upload, the data on the Tablet PCs will be deleted.  Encrypted data from the other sites 
will be transferred electronically to Mount Sinai on a weekly basis. The transferred data 
will be free of personal data that qualifies as PHI.  All data received at the data 
coordinating center (Mount Sinai) will be entered into a computerized database and 
stored in encrypted files on a mainframe server that is backed up nightly by [CONTACT_75058][INVESTIGATOR_75038].
How long will data be stored?
Data will be stored for 7 years following the completion of data analysis.
What are the SOPs that govern data sharing?
No data will be shared outside of the investigators and study team named on this 
protocol.
If this project is not funded by [CONTACT_75059] a Certificate of Confidentiality be 
obtained? If not, why not?

specimens or data have been stored as part of the research study, they too can be 
destroyed without the participant's consent.
Describe any procedures for orderly termination. 
Study participants have the option withdraw from further participation at any time. 
Voluntary withdrawal will in no way affect the quality of patient care that is provided 
to them within the Mount Sinai Health System. However, any data and/or biological 
samples that have already been collected will be retained unless the participant 
requesting in writing that his/her data and/or biological samples be destroyed. If a 
subject asks for complete withdrawal from the study, he/she must do so by [CONTACT_75060] [INVESTIGATOR_75040].
Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, 
including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection.
If participant withdraws from the study, they must do so in writing as specified in the 
consent.  The research team will not contact [CONTACT_75061].  
The participant will be asked if he/she will allow the study team to keep data and 
specimens that have already been collected.  If the participant refuses, the data 
recorded in REDCap will be destroyed and the samples collected will be destroyed.
4. Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury: 
Explain how clinically important incidental results will be handled. Examples include an 
abnormal lab finding or a survey answer indicating possible danger to self or others.

Describe the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might 
need as a result of any anticipated adverse events that may be known to be associated 
with the Human Research.  
In order to further safeguard the mental health of the study participants: (1) Any 
participant who becomes discomforted or distressed will be given the opportunity to 
speak with a clinical psychologist, social worker or qualified medical professional 
immediately; (2) we will track the occurrence of these events and after two incident 
reports are filed for a participant, they will be flagged for a consultation with a 
counselor (clinical psychologist, social worker or qualified medical professional)

6. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects: 
[Note: This section is soliciting different information than the confidentiality information 
solicited in section #5f. Answers will vary widely based on the complexity of the research 
design, the sensitivity of the subject matter and the populations being recruited.] 
Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’ privacy interests, particularly 
a person’s desire to control how, where and with whom, they interact and 
communicate, especially on issues that prospective research participants may deem 
sensitive or private.  Consider privacy interests that may arise from the time 
participants are identified for recruitment until they complete study participation.  
Consider privacy interests that may arise in communications with the study subjects 
(e.g. phone messages, mail, etc), including through long-term follow-up.
To protect the privacy interests of subjects, all communications with study subjects will 
be via face-to-face visit, telephone or email. Phone messages left will not refer to the 
study in which they are enrolled but only the site where they were enrolled. For 
example, the study team would leave a message such as, "This is XXXX calling from 
Mount Sinai." Patients will be asked whether they prefer phone contact [CONTACT_75062]-up.
Describe what steps you will take to make the subjects feel at ease with the research 
situation in terms of the questions being asked and the procedures being performed. 
“At ease” does not refer to physical discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subject 
might experience in response to questions, examinations, and procedures.

Revised 8/31/2020During the consent process and prior to every study visit, participants will be informed 
that some of the questions asked during the study visit may make them feel 
uncomfortable.  The study team will emphasize that each part of the study is voluntary 
and they are free to skip any part that causes them discomfort.  
Describe why it is acceptable and appropriate for members of the research team to 
approach the prospective participant about the research.
This project has been deemed of important scientific merit. Members of the research 
team have all completed ethical research training as well as extensive training in the 
protocols of this project. Measures are put into place to take the utmost care in 
contact[CONTACT_75063].
7. Economic Impact on Subjects:
Describe any foreseeable costs that subjects may incur through participation in the 
research (exclude billing for procedures that are part of clinical care e.g. copayments 
for studies that involve an overlap of clinical care & research).  
The study will have no foreseeable economic impact on participants.

Revised 8/31/2020Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process
If the Human Research involves a request for a waiver or alteration of the consent 
process, review the “CHECKLIST HRP-410 Criteria for Waiver or Alteration of the 
Consent Process” and make sure your submission provides adequate information for the 
IRB to assess the criteria for approval.  It is highly recommended that you provide 
additional information here to address each of the criteria for approval (e.g. 
impracticability).  
N/A
Examples of when a waiver or alteration of the consent process may be applicable:
Research that does not obtain consent from subjects 
Research that omits some information that is required in the consent template
Research that involves deception 
Research that involves obtaining private information about third parties who 
have not provided consent
Research that requests a waiver of the consent process for planned emergency 
research.  Please review the “CHECKLIST HRP-506 Criteria for Waiver of the 
Consent Process for Planned Emergency Research” to ensure you have provided 
sufficient information for the IRB to make these determinations.
10. Process to Document Consent in Writing:
a)If consent will be obtained at a distance using the written consent form as the official 
version, please provide details of how the subjects will receive a copy of the consent form, 
how the consent form will be reviewed with the subject, and how signature [CONTACT_75070]. 
In addition to consenting participants in person, we will also consent participants over the 
phone.  For any subject being consented via phone we will follow the following procedure:
1. Send the approved phone consent authorization to the prospective research subject 
for review.
2. Arrange for a conversation between the participant and an authorized member of 
the research team to allow for full discussion of the combined 
consent/authorization. If verbal consent is obtained, collect identifiable data as 
applicable.
3. If there is an adult witness on the phone at the time of the initial verbal consent, the 
documents will not be returned.

document will be requested to be returned via regular mail, fax, or email. If after 
two weeks, the signed document is not returned the data will be stripped of all 
identifiers and links such that the de-identified data are permanently anonymized.
b)If using any sort of e-Consent on any device, including iOPEN, provide access to the 
PPHS  to allow us to review the built consent. e-Consent is defined as consent designed to 
be obtained with minimal human interaction, generally using specialized software.

c)If you want a waiver of written documentation, please review the “CHECKLIST HRP-
411” to ensure that your protocol has sufficiently addressed these additional regulatory 
criteria for approval, including protocol specific information to support the 
determinations. You will also need to request a waiver of HIPAA authorization. Unless you 
are eligible for a complete waiver of consent, your consent form or script should still 
contain the needed elements of consent as laid out in our consent template.

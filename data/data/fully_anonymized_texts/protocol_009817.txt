endoscopic subscore ≥2). Approximately two -thirds (~160) of the patients randomized to study 
treatment must have been exposed to at least 1 previous biologic therapy (received treatment 
with 1 or more agents such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists, vedolizumab, or 
experimental UC biologic therapy), and approximately one -third (~80) of the patients will be 
naive to biologic therapy.  
Screening Period :  Patients will be evaluated for stud y eligibility ≤28 days before the baseline 
visit. 
At the baseline visit, patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be randomized equally to 1 of 
4 induction treatment arms (LY3074828 50 mg, LY3074828 200 mg, LY3074828 600 mg, and 
Placebo).  
Inducti on Dosing Period (Induction Period) :  A 12 -week induction period is designed to establish 
the efficacy and safety of LY3074828 administered intravenous (IV) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. 
Patients will be stratified across the treatment arms on the basis of previou s exposure to biologic 
therapy for treatment of UC. Patients who discontinue the study for any reason before the end of 
the induction period will complete the early study discontinuation follow -up visit.  
Maintenance Dosing Period (Maintenance Period) :  The  maintenance period is designed to 
explore the safety and durability of clinical responses and remissions to treatment with 200 -mg 
LY3074828 administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 12 weeks 
(Q12W). Patients defined as having clinical responses at Week [ADDRESS_965940] received LY3074828 in the induction period will be re -
randomized to 1 of 2 LY3074828 maintenance treatment arms (200 mg SC Q4W or 200 SC mg 
Q12W); these patients will be stratified according to their Week -12 remission status. Any 
responding patients in the placebo arm will remain on placebo.  
After Week 52, subjects who experience worsening of UC (partial Mayo score of 7 or more) may 
receive rescue treatment with LY3074828 200 mg SC Q4W.  
Extension Period - Induction :  Patients who complete the study induction period (through Visit 7) 
but do not have a clinical response may choose to participate in the study extension period 
following consultation with, and at the discretion of, the investigator.  
During the extension period induction, all patients are planned to receive 1000 mg LY3074828 
IV administered at Extension Weeks 0, 4, and 8 (the dose level and/or frequency of dosing may

 be reduced based on review of Study AMAC trial data). Patients should  complete all assessments 
according to the extension period schedule of events and should remain on permitted UC 
concomitant medication according to Section 9.9 of the protocol.  
Extension Period - Maintenance : Patients who have a clinical response (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) at 
Extension Visit [ADDRESS_965941] the o pportunity to participate in an OLE (Open Label Extension) study 
(this is Country specific).   The duration of the maintenance period and extension maintenance 
period will be extended to provide for up to an additional 52 weeks of therapy so that subjects 
can continue to receive study drug until the OLE Study becomes available.   Once an OLE study 
becomes available, subjects will be asked to consider participation in the OLE or be discontinued 
from AMAC.   Patients will continue to be followed for safety and c linical benefit during this 
additional year of therapy and in addition the sponsor conducts quarterly trial level safety 
reviews (TLSRs) during the study.  No TFLs or further analyses are planned for the addendum.

5.2. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 240 patients will be randomized to 1 of 4 double -blind treatment regimens to 
evaluate the primary endpoint. Patients will be randomized to placebo, 50 mg LY3074828 
Therapeutic Drug M onitoring (TDM), 200 mg LY3074828 TDM, or the 600 mg LY3074828 
fixed-dose treatment group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (60 patients per arm). The randomized patients will 
be comprised of approximately one -third biologic -naive patients (~20 per arm) and 
approximately  two thirds patients who have been exposed previously to at least 1 biologic agent 
(~40 per arm).  
Assuming LY3074828 and placebo clinical remission rates of 30% and 7.5% respectively (a 
difference of 22.5%) and given [ADDRESS_965942] 89% power via chi -square test with a two -
sided 0.05 significance level.   
5.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment  
Patients who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized to treat ment at the baseline visit. 
Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random sequence 
using an interactive web -response system (IWRS), and then the site will be responsible for 
administering the treatment to the patients.  
Patients will be randomized into the Induction Dosing Period at a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four 
treatment groups, each given as one IV injection:  
 600 mg LY3074828 IV Q4W: A dose of 600 mg given as an IV infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 
and 8.  
 200 mg LY3074828 IV TDM  Q4W: A dose of 200 mg TDM given as an IV infusion at 
Weeks 0, 4, and 8. Dose adjustments may occur at Week 4 and 8.  
 50 mg LY3074828 IV TDM Q4W: A dose of 50 mg TDM given as an IV infusion at 
Weeks 0, 4, and 8. Dose adjustments may occur at Week 4 and 8.  
 Placebo: A dose of placebo saline given as IV injections at Weeks 0, 4, and 8.  
Patients who have clinical responses to LY3074828 (as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS]) at the end of 
the Induction Dosing Period will be re -randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance LY307482 8 treatment 
arms in the Maintenance Dosing period. This randomization will be stratified according to the 
patient’s Week 12 remission status.  
 200 mg SC LY3074828 Q4W: A dose of 200 mg given as a SC injection at 4 week 
intervals starting at week 12.  
 200 mg  SC LY3074828 Q12W: A dose of [ADDRESS_965943] clinical responses to placebo (as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS]) at the end of the 
Induction Dosing Period will continue to receive plac ebo via SC injection in the Maintenance 
Dosing period. Placebo responders will not be re -randomized.  
Patients who do not have clinical responses to LY3074828 (as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS]) at the 
end of the Induction Dosing Period will have the option to  continue on to the Extension Period - 
Induction portion of the trial. Patients entering the Extension Period - Induction portion of the 
trial will not be re -randomized but will receive  [ADDRESS_965944] clinical responses to LY3074828 (as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS]) at the end of 
the Extension Period - Induction will continue to the Extension Period - Maintenance portion of 
the trial. Patients entering the Extension Period - Maintenance portion of the trial will not be re -
randomized but will receive  200 mg LY3074828 given as a subcutaneous (SC) injection at 4 
week intervals starting at extension week 12.

 6. A Priori Statistical Methods  
6.1. General Considerations  
Eli Lilly and Co. will be respons ible for conducting the statistical analysis and for the generation, 
validation and final production of the Efficacy and Health Outcomes tables, figures and listings 
(TFLs) proposed in this document. Robarts Clinical Trials, a clinical research organizatio n, will 
be responsible for conducting the statistical analysis and for the generation, validation and final 
production of all other tables, figures and listings (TFLs) proposed in this document.  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the pro tocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol and the justification for making the change will be described 
in the clinical study report. Addi tional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as 
deemed appropriate.  
Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. The minimum and maximum will be reporte d 
to the same number of decimal places as the raw data recorded in the database. The mean and 
median will be reported to one more decimal place than the raw data recorded in the database. 
The SD will be reported to two more decimal places than the raw data  recorded in the database. 
In general, the maximum number of decimal places reported shall be four for any summary 
statistic.  
Categorical data will be summarized in terms of the number of patients providing data at the 
relevant time point (n), frequency co unts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to one 
decimal place. Percentages will be calculated using n (the number of observations with non -
missing values) as the denominator.  
Change from baseline will be calculated as the visit value of interest  minus the baseline value. If 
all baseline values are missing for a particular variable, then the change from baseline and 
percent change (or percent improvement) from baseline will not be calculated.  
All confidence intervals (CIs) and statistical tests wi ll be two -sided unless otherwise specified. P -
values which are greater than or equal to 0.001, and less than or equal to 0.999, will be presented 
to three decimal places. All other p -values which are less than 0.001 will be presented as 
‘<0.001 ’, while p -values greater than 0.999 will be presented as ‘>0.999 ’. CIs will be presented 
to one more decimal place than the raw data.  
Age, sex and race will be reported on all by -patient listings unless otherwise specified. Sex will 
be abbreviated as follows: female (F) and male (M). Race will be abbreviated as follows: 
American Indian or Alaska Native (AI), Asian (AS), Black or African American (BL), Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH), White (WH) and Multiple (MU).  
There are five study periods defined in section 7.1 of the protocol:

number of decimal places will be listed as specified. The decimal points will be aligned in the 
data listings. For the tables and listings in the appendices, “Page x of X” will appear on each 
page.  
By-patient list ing will be generated for each SDTM dataset. If necessary, separate listing for 
derived variables (that are derived from the SDTM datasets) will be generated. Wherever 
applicable, listings will include the period of the study during which the event or meas urement 
occurred.  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population. All safety analyses 
will be conducted on the Safety Population. These populations are defined in section 6.2.  
 Patients will be analyzed according to the treatme nt to which they were assigned regardless of 
any errors of dosing.  
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a [ADDRESS_965947] study drug injection at Week 0 (Visit 2). 
However, placebo patients who enter the Extension Perio d will have their baseline reset. Their 
new baseline will be defined as the last non -missing assessment on or prior to the date of first 
injection of study treatment at Week EW0 (Extension Visit 1).  
Unless otherwise specified, variables will be analyzed i n the original scale on which they are 
measured. However, if it is deemed more statistically appropriate, a transformation, such as to 
the logarithmic scale, may be applied before analysis. The parametric approach will be employed 
by [CONTACT_710353] l analysis except when nonparametric analysis, such as by a rank -based 
method, is assessed to be more fitting.  
The primary analysis of categorical (binary) efficacy and health outcome variables will use a 
logistic regression analysis with treatment, geogra phic region, and prior biologic experience 
(prior biologic experience vs prior biologic naïve), and visit (when appropriate) in the model. 
The odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CIs and p -value, as well as the treatment differences 
(where appropriate) and t he corresponding 95% CIs, will be reported. Secondary analysis will be 
conducted using an exact Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test that stratifies by (i.e., controls for) 
previous biologic use. A Fisher’s exact test may be utilized if necessary.  
The primary anal yses for all continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be based on 
the MMRM analysis method. The MMRM analyses will be conducted using a restricted 
maximum likelihood (REML) -based repeated measures approach. When MMRM is used, the 
model will in clude treatment, visit, geographic region, prior biologic experience (prior biologic

 experience vs prior biologic naïve), treatment -by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, 
fixed covariates of baseline value and baseline value -by-visit interaction.  The covariance 
structure to model the within -patient errors will be unstructured. If the unstructured covariance 
matrix results in a lack of convergence, the heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance structure, 
followed by [CONTACT_710354], followed by [CONTACT_710355]. The first structure to yield convergence will be used for 
inference. The Newton -Raphson with ridging optimization technique will be used to aid with 
convergence. The Kenward -Roger app roximation will be used to estimate the denominator 
degrees of freedom and adjust standard errors. Type III tests for the LS means will be used for 
the statistical comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported. Treatment group comparisons with 
placebo at We ek 12 (Visit 7) and all other appropriate time points will be tested.  
Secondary treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy variables at Week 12 and 52 will be 
made using ANCOVA with treatment, geographic region, prior biologic experience (prior 
biologic  experience vs prior biologic naïve), and baseline value in the model. Type III sums of 
squares for the least -squares (LS) means will be used for the statistical comparison; the 95% 
confidence interval will also be reported.  
Not all displays  and analyses  described in this SAP will necessarily be included in the CSR.  Not 
all displays will necessarily be created as a “static” display.  Some displays may be incorporated 
as interactive display tools instead of or in addition to a static display.  Any display d escribed in 
this SAP and not provided in CSR would be available upon request.    
6.2. Analysis Populations  
The patient populations to be analyzed for this study are defined in the table presented below:  
Table 2  Analysis Populations  
Popu lation  Definition  
Screening  All patients who signed informed consent and participated in the 
screening period (Visit 1). This population will be used for the 
presentation of patient disposition.  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
Population  Efficacy and health outcome analyses will be conducted on the 
intent -to-treat population (ITT). The ITT population is defined as all 
randomized patients, even if the patient does not take the assigned 
treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise does 
not fo llow the protocol. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment to which they were assigned.  
 
Safety Population  Safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Population, defined 
as all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to 
which they were assigned.

 Induction Responders  A subset of the ITT population and will include those patients who 
are re -randomized to one of the two maintenance dosing period LY 
arms.  
All enrolled in 
Extension Period  A subset of the ITT population and will include only the patients 
who participated in the Extension Period.  
 
Analyses of the maintenance dosing period and the extension periods will be based on the 
corresponding enrolled population as described in the table above.  
The Schedule of Events outlined in the protocol (attachment 1) specifies the allowable windows 
for assessments. A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis may be conducted to investigate 
the exclusion of pati ents /assessments deemed to be major deviations from the protocol.  
A Per -Protocol population may be evaluated in this study and patients to be excluded from that 
population will be identified through protocol deviations. All protocol exemptions and violati ons 
will be listed as described in section 9.10 of the protocol.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software Version 9.2 (or a higher version).  
Visualizations tools such as  Spotfire may also be used for dynamic displays.  
6.3. Adjustments for C ovariates  
The randomization at the beginning of the Induction Period is stratified by [CONTACT_710356]: previous exposure to biologic therapy for treatment of UC, biologic naïve to biologic 
therapy for treatment of UC. Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy and health outcome 
analyses will include the stratification factors in the model.  
The re -randomization at the beginning of the Maintenance Period of patients who took 
LY3074828 during the Induction Period and were responders at Week 12 (Visit 7) is stratified by 
[CONTACT_56421] 12 level of clinical response: Clinical Remission or Clinical Response. Unless 
otherwise specified, all efficacy and health outcomes analyses using the Maintenance Dosing 
Period Primary population will include the re -randomizat ion factor of Week 12 level of response 
in the model.  
Unless otherwise specified, analyses will be performed utilizing the methodology and covariates 
described in section 6.1.  
6.4. Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
Details of the handling of dropouts or miss ing data are presented in the following sections.  
Details of the procedure for handling missing data for the IBDQ are provided in Appendix B.  
Details of handling missing partial end dates for prior medications for important programmable 
deviations are provided in section 6.16 Protocol Violations.

 6.4.1.  Non-Responder Imputation (NRI)  
The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with clinical remission at 12 weeks. For this 
and other categorical efficacy endpoints (for example, clinical remission (week 52), clinical 
response (week 12, 52), and endoscopic remission (week 12, 52)), non -responder imputation 
(NRI) will be used for missing clinical assessment values. Specifically, all patients who 
discontinue from the study at any time prior to week [ADDRESS_965948]  
An LOCF analysis will be performed on PGI -I. 
This is both a sen sitivity analysis, and an analysis for regulatory agencies that prefer this 
approach. This approach is identical to the mBOCF approach, with one exception: for patients  
discontinuing investigational product due to an AE, the last non -missing post -baseline  
observation before discontinuation will be carried forward to the corresponding endpoint for  
evaluation. Randomized patients without at least one post -baseline observation will not be  
included for evaluation.  
6.4.3.  Modified Baseline Observation Carried Forward  
An mBOCF analysis will be performed on key continuous efficacy and the PGI -S and the IBDQ . 
This is both a sensitivity analysis, and an analysis for regulatory agencies that prefer this 
approach. For patients discontinuing investigational product due to an A E, the baseline 
observation will be carried forward to the corresponding primary endpoint for evaluation. For 
patients discontinuing investigational product for any other reason, the last non -missing post -
baseline observation before discontinuation will be  carried forward to the corresponding primary 
endpoint for evaluation. Randomized patients without at least one post -baseline observation will 
not be included for evaluation with the exception of patients discontinuing study treatment due to 
an AE.  
6.4.4.  Missin g Data Imputation for Adverse Event, Concomitant 
Medication Dates, and Laboratory Values  
If a medication date or AE date is completely or partially missing, the following imputation rules 
should be utilized in the analysis unless otherwise stated:  
 For the start date:  
o If year, month, and day are missing then use the earlier of the patient's first visit 
date or the consent date.  
o If either month or month and day are missing then use January 1.  
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page [ADDRESS_965949] day of the month.  
 For the start time:  
o Impute as 23:59.  
 For the end date:  
o If year, month, and day are missing then use the patient's last visit date.  
o If either month or month and day are missing then use December 31.  
o If only day is missing then use the last day of the month.  
o The imp uted date will not be beyond the patient’s last visit date.  
If there is any doubt for the start and end date/times for AEs, the event will be flagged as 
treatment -emergent. For medications, the medication will be flagged as concomitant.  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized based on the available data at each time point and no 
imputation is proposed in this document.  
6.5. Multicenter Studies  
This study will be conducted by [CONTACT_710357]. 
Randomization to tre atment groups will not be stratified by [CONTACT_1606]. However, the countries will 
be categorized into geographic regions:  
 Geographic Region Subgroups: North America, Asia (Japan) and Rest of World (incl. 
EU, Australia, and NZ)  
Unless otherwise specified, the st atistical analysis models will adjust for geographic region. For 
analysis of primary endpoints, the presence of a treatment -by-geographic region interaction will 
be tested at a .10% significance level. Treatment group comparisons for the primary outcomes 
will be presented separately for each geographic region. Where there is evidence of an 
interaction (p -value < .0.10), graphical inspection of descriptive statistics will be used to assess 
whether the interaction is quantitative (i.e., the treatment effect i s consistent in direction but not 
size of effect) or qualitative (the treatment is beneficial for some but not other regions). In 
addition, further investigations through additions of baseline covariates of statistical models will 
be performed in an attemp t to explain the interaction in terms of patient characteristics.  
6.6. Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
The primary endpoint will be tested by [CONTACT_710358], as described in section 6.1.  
A graphical multiple testing procedure  [1][2] for the primary objective will be implemented to 
control the family -wise type I error rate at a 2 -sided α level of 0.05.   In this particular 
application, the α levels for the p -values associated with each comparison are computed at each 
step depending on the outcomes of the preceding significance tests. The graphical approach is a 
closed testing procedure; hence, it strongly controls the family -wise error rate (Alosh et al. 2014 
[2]).

 There are 3 comparisons to be tested:  
 Comparison 1 – Proportion of 600 mg patients achieving Clinical Remission at 12 
weeks compared with placebo  
 Comparison 2 – Proportion of 200 mg TDM patients achieving Clinical Remission 
at 12 weeks compared with placebo  
 Comparison 3 – Proportion of [ADDRESS_965950] be tested at 2 -sided α = 0.05.   If successful, the test for Comparison 2 
will be performed at 2 -sided α = 0.[ADDRESS_965951] for Comparison 3 will be performed 
at 2-sided α = 0.05. If at any point a comparison fails to meet the significance threshold, the test 
will stop.

 6.7. Patient Disposition  
All patients who discontinue from the study will be identified, and the extent of their 
participation in the study will be reported. If known, a reason for their discontinuation will be 
given.  
Counts and percentages of patients entered and patients failing screening before randomization 
will be summarized overall, and counts and percentages of patients randomized, discontinued, 
and completed will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The reasons for discontinuation from 
treatment and from the study will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Summaries of patient disposition will be based on all patients screened in the study. The number 
of patients in each of the analysis populations will be displayed. The reasons for discontinuation 
will be summarized. A listing of patients excluded from any population, if any, will be provided 
along with the reason for the exclusion.  
6.8. Patient Characteristics  
The patient’s y ear of birth, sex, weight, height, smoking habits, previous biologic treatment, and 
other demographic characteristics are collected at the screening visit. Age and body mass index 
will be calculated.  
Only the year of birth is collected at screening. For t he purpose of age calculation, the month and 
day of birth will be imputed as July 01, of the year of birth. Age is the computed as follows;  
                             Age= (Informed Consent Date –Date of Birth +1)/365.25.  
Demographic and baseline charac teristics (including age, gender, race and ethnicity) will be 
summarized for each treatment group.  
Certain characteristics, that are collected at baseline or after baseline but not summarized in the 
demographic summary, will be reported as a listing.  
No inferential analysis for the comparability of baseline covariates across treatment groups will 
be performed.  
6.9. Treatment Compliance  
Adequate study drug compliance is defined in Section 9.10 of the protocol.  
Study treatment administration and compliance will be listed for all entered patients. The number 
and percentage of patients treatment compliant by [CONTACT_5875] (that is, at each injection time point) will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_710359].  
No patient will be excluded from the ITT populati on as a consequence of significant 
noncompliance.  
A listing of the treatment -noncompliant patients will be presented by [CONTACT_2939].  
6.10.  Concomitant Therapy  
For the purposes of subgroup identification, medications will be classified into anatomical 
therapeu tic chemical (ATC) drug classes using the latest version of the World Health 
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 27 
LY3074828  
SAP Final v 3.0 
 Organization (WHO) drug dictionary. Summaries of Concomitant and Prior medication will 
utilize WHO drug preferred names.  
Medication start and stop dates will be compared to the d ate of first dose of treatment in each 
treatment period to allow medications to be classified as Concomitant for each treatment period. 
Concomitant medication use that starts and stops during the baseline/screening period will be 
included in summaries of t he induction period.   
Prior medications are those medications that start and stop prior to the date Informed Consent 
(IC). Concomitant medications are those medications that start after the IC date. Concomitant 
medications are assigned to the treatment per iod in which they are actually ongoing. For 
example, if a patient is receiving concomitant medication during the Induction Dosing Period but 
has a stop date during the Induction Dosing Period, the same medication would not be listed as a 
concomitant medica tion during the latter periods unless patient has a new start date.  
6.11.  Efficacy Analyses  
6.11.1.  Primary Outcome and Methodology  
Rate of clinical remission at Week [ADDRESS_965952] the hypothesis that treatment with LY3074828 is 
superior to placebo in inducing clinical remission at Week 12 in patients with moderate to severe 
ulcerative colitis (UC)  
Clinical remission is defined as achieving a rectal bleeding Mayo subscore of 0, stool frequency 
Mayo subscore of 0 or 1 (with 1 point decrease from baseline) and Mayo endoscopic subscore of 
0 or 1.  
The rates of clinical remission and non -remission will be summarized by [CONTACT_710360], previous biologic use (yes/no). See section 6.[ADDRESS_965953] the differences between each active trea tment arm and placebo.  
Ninety five percent confidence interval for the difference in proportions (LY arm – placebo) for 
each pairwise comparison will be obtained. If the lower limit of the 95% confidence limit is 
greater than zero, then that arm will be co nsidered to be superior to placebo.  
A multiple testing procedure will be utilized for the primary outcome and is detailed in section 
6.6.

6.11.3.  Additional analysis of the clinical  remission rate at Week 12 
will also be performed as per the methodology described in 
section 6.1. Analyses of the Secondary Efficacy Outcomes  
In the analysis of secondary efficacy outcomes, no adjustments for multiple testing will be 
performed unless othe rwise specified.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Outcomes for the Induction Dosing Period  
There are two secondary efficacy outcomes for the induction dosing period:  
1) The proportion of patients with clinical response at Week 12.  
2)  The proportion of patients with end oscopic remission at Week 12.  
The clinical response is defined as achieving at Week 12  a decrease in the 9 -point Mayo 
subscores (comprising the subscores of rectal bleeding, stool frequency and the endoscopic 
findings) inclusive of >= 2 points and >=35% f rom baseline with either a decrease of rectal 
bleeding subscore of >=1 or rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.  
Endoscopic remission is defined as achieving a Mayo endoscopic score of 0 at Week 12.

6.11.5.  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
There are three exploratory efficacy endpoints:  
1. To assess the change from baseline in Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity 
(UCEIS) [4] (completed by [CONTACT_710351]) scores at Weeks 12 and 52.  
2. To assess the change from baseline in the partial Mayo score (PGA  + Stool Frequency + 
Rectal Bleeding) at various times during induction and maintenance.  
3. To explore the effect of additional (unblinded) dosing on clinical response in patients who 
do not meet responder criteria at Week 12.  
Summary tables for the change fr om baseline in UCEIS score at weeks 12 and 52 will be 
presented by [CONTACT_6660]. The mean and 95% CIs will be presented. The change from 
baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_710361].  
Summary tables for the partial Mayo score at assessed t ime points and the change from the 
baseline assessments will be presented by [CONTACT_6660]. The change from baseline will be 
presented by [CONTACT_710361]. Subscores will also be summarized separately.  
Summary tables of clinical response, c linical remission and endoscopic remission for the patients 
who were originally randomized to LY3074828 and entered the Extension Period will be 
generated. Clinical efficacy findings at assessed time points and the change from the baseline 
assessments will  be presented by [CONTACT_710362].  
In addition to the protocol defined endpoints, additional sensitivity analyses may be performed if 
deemed appropriate. Additional analyses include:

accompanying decrease in Rectal Bleeding Score of >=1 point OR an Rectal 
Bleeding Score of <=[ADDRESS_965954] baseline visits  
where an endoscopy was performed (Week 12, Week E12, and Week 52).  
Time to Response  
Time to response for a given scoring method is defined (in weeks) as:  
(First study day when response status is changed to “ Yes” – Randomization date + 1) / [ADDRESS_965955] visit during the induction period.   
For placebo patients continuing to the extension period, their time to respo nse is defined as:  
(First study day when response status is changed to “ Yes” – Extension Period Randomization 
date + 1)  / 7 
Time to response will be evaluated during the induction and extension periods only.  
Duration  of Response  in Maintenance  
The duration  of response in maintenance is defined (in weeks) as:  
(study day of discontinuation or becoming eligible for rescue - Study day of 
randomization into Maintenance (or first dose date in Extension Maintenance) +1) / 7 
Patients who discontinue early (without loss of response) or complete the study period  will be 
censored . Patients who have a reason for study discontinuation of lack of efficacy or Adverse 
event will be considered as events.  
Duration of response in maintenance will be evaluated during the maintenance and extension 
maintenance periods only.  
Histologic Remission  
For the exploratory definitions of histologic re mission , analyses will include the presentation  of 
data using spotfire or any other custom analyses deemed appropriate . These  presentat ions are for 
exploratory purposes only  and will be presented in a manner analogous to the proposed 
histologic remission, described in section 6.14.9 .  
6.12.  Health Outcomes/Quality -of-Life Analyses  
6.12.1.  Secondary Health Outcomes Endpoints  
There are four self -administered questionnaires used for measuring health outcome in this trial:  
1. PGI-S (Patient’s Global Impressions of Severity score)  
2. PGI-I (Patient’s Global Impressions of Improvement score)  
3. IBDQ (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnair e score)  
4. SF36 (36 -Item Short Form Health Survey score)  
Where appropriate, the total scores and sub -totals for individual dimensions collected will be 
summarized with means and 95% CIs by [CONTACT_129228]. The summary table

Summaries of domain and summary scores will be provided by [CONTACT_710363].  
An A NCOVA model will be used to analyze the change from baseline in the physical component 
score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS) through Week 24. T he ANCOVA model 
will include treatment, geographic region, and prior biologic experience (prior biolog ic 
experience vs prior biologic naïve), and baseline value  (consistent with adjustments of other 
efficacy analysis) as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate with change from baseline as 
the dependent variable. To test the treatment difference bet ween LY3074828 and placebo, the LS 
mean difference, 95% CI, and p -value will be presented. The LOCF approach will be used to 
impute missing data.  
Analyses will be repeated for the eight health domains (physical functioning, bodily pain, role 
limitations du e to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health 
perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality).  
Summary statistics per treatment group will be tabulated for the transformed scale scores 
(physical functioning, role limitations / physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, 
vitality, social functioning, role limitations / emotional, mental health) and the two summary 
scores (PCS and MCS).  
Minimum Clinically Important Differences (MCID):  
The summary a nd analyses of the SF -36v2 Acute Score will include the number of patients 
achieving a MCID, which is defined for each summary score, physical component score (PCS) 
and the mental component score (MCS), as:  
 MCID ≥ at least 2.5 or 5 -point improvement (decre ase) in PCS  
 MCID ≥ at least 2.5 or 5 -point improvement (decrease) in MCS.  
The proportion of patients achieving the SF -36v2 score MCID will also be analyzed using a 
logistic regression model with treatment, geographic region, and prior biologic experience ( prior 
biologic experience vs prior biologic naïve), and visit (when appropriate) as fixed effects. The p -
value and 95% CI of the odds ratio from the logistic regression model will be reported. The 95% 
CI of the MCID rate difference will be calculated using  the Newcombe -Wilson method without 
continuity correction. The NRI method described in Section 6.4.1 will be used to impute missing 
data.

 6.13.  Bioanalytical and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Methods   
PK/PD analyses to address secondary and exploratory objectives of this study will be described 
by [CONTACT_710364]/PD analysis plans. Conduct of the PK/PD analyses will be the 
responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company.  
The PK/PD analyses will be initiat ed up to approximately three weeks before the planned 
database lock dates. All analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_710365], who are 
unblinded to subject treatment assignments to support dose adjustments, as specified in protocol 
Section 9.5.   Results from the PK/PD analyses will not be shared with site or blinded study team 
personnel prior to the respective database lock.  
6.14.  Safety Analyses  
All safety evaluations will be based upon the Safety Population as defined in Section 6.2.  
Any statistical  comparisons for safety data will be performed only between the “All 
LY3074828” treatment group and Placebo. No pairwise comparisons between LY3074828 
induction treatment arms will be performed. Pairwise comparison of LY3074828 maintenance 
treatment arms will be performed (no comparison to placebo). No multiplicity control procedure 
will be performed for these tests of safety data.  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated in terms of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuations of study drug, SAEs, deaths, changes in clinical laboratory 
test results, and vital signs. These measures will be analyzed for each dose group and combined 
LY3074828 groups, separately for each  study part, as well as across study parts for key 
summaries.  
For all quantitative safety analyses, baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment 
recorded on or prior to the date of first study drug injection at Week 0 (Visit 2). However, 
placebo patients who enter the Extension Period will have their baseline reset. Their new 
baseline will be defined as the last non -missing assessment on or prior to the date of first 
injection of study treatment at Week EW0 (Extension Visit 1).

6.14.2.  Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is d efined as an event that first occurred or 
worsened in severity after baseline. The MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT) will be used in the 
treatment -emergent computation. The maximum severity for each LLT during the screening 
period will be used as baseline. Th e treatment period will be included as post -baseline for the 
analysis.  
In an overview table, the number and percentage of patients who experienced a TEAE, serious 
adverse event, adverse event related to study drug, died due to an adverse event, or discont inued 
from the study due to an adverse event will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. These summary tables 
will additionally be provided for the Induction, Maintenance and Extension Periods.   
The percentages of patients with TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] u sing MedDRA

The percentages of patients with TEAEs by [CONTACT_710375] . For each subject 
and TEAE, the maximum severity for the MedDRA l evel being displayed (Preferred Term, High 
Level Term, or System Organ Class) is the maximum post -baseline severity observed from all 
associated LLTs mappi[INVESTIGATOR_355690]. These summary tables will additionally be 
provided for the Induction, Mainte nance and Extension Periods.  
In the event differential dropout rates are seen or to further investigate events of interest, 
summary tables comparing exposure -adjusted incidence rate (that is, person -time-adjusted 
incidence rates) over the entire time perio d will be generated for the Induction and Maintenance 
Periods.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Two main analyses are performed in support of assessment of potential immediate 
hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and infusion related reactions (IRR), and well  as 
potential non -immediate hypersensitivity.  
Time Period A , of potential immediate hypersensitivity, includes all TEAE occurring on the day 
of study drug administration.  
Time Period B , of potential non -immediate hypersensitivity, includes all TEAE occurr ing 
strictly after the day of study drug administration (but prior to subsequent drug administration).  
Analyses of both time periods use the current standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) Standardised Medical Queries (SMQs) to searc h for relevant events. 
TEAE are characterized as follows:  
 Anaphylactic reaction SMQ ( 20000021; narrow, algorithm per MSSO SMQ guide, and 
broad)  
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 37 
LY3074828  
SAP Final v 3.0 
  Hypersensitivity SMQ ( 20000214;  narrow and broad)  
 Angioedema SMQ (20000024;  narrow and broad ) 
 Preferred term (PT) of Infusion related reaction  (10051792 )   
 
The number and percentage of patients  who experienced a TEAE  for the following will be 
analyzed for each of the two time periods :  
 Any narrow or algorithmic term from any one of the 3 SMQs indicated above (that is, 
combined search across narrow and algorithmic portions of all 3 SMQs)  
 Any narrow scope term within each SMQ, separately (that is, narrow SMQ search)  
 Any term within each SMQ, separately ( that is,  broad  SMQ search)   
Within query, individual PTs that satisfy the queries will be summarized.  For Infusion related 
reaction (PT), the individual LLTs will be summarized.  
The Anaphylactic reaction SMQ algorithm will be run only for Time Period A.  The SMQ 
defines a category (A, B, C, D) for each SMQ PT.  All  Narrow terms have category A, and the 
occurrence of a Narrow term satisfies the algorithm.  Additionally, a pair of PTs from the same 
drug administration  satisfies the algorithm if the two events are from different categories ( i.e., 
B&C, or B&D, or C&D).  Both contributing events must begin within Time Period A.  Tables 
will summarize (the number of patients experiencing) each PT that contributes to such an 
algorithmic pair, and include such terms in the combined narrow and algorithmic search.  Broad 
event s that do not contribute to the algorithm will be summarized in a distinct portion of the 
table.  
For Time Period A only, the number and percentage of each PT that is not in any of the [ADDRESS_965957] 3 patients 
receiving LY3074828  will be displayed in this portion of the table.  
The PT and LLT are listed for summary in decreasing order of incidence for LY -treated patients. 
Note that an individual patient may contribute multiple events. Also, a single event may satisfy 
multiple SMQ, in which case the event contributes to every applicable SMQ.  
The analyses of this section will be performed fo r Induction Period, for Induction and 
Maintenance Periods combined, and for Induction and Extension  Periods combined.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Injection Site Reactions  
A summary will be provided, by [CONTACT_1570], of the number of patients with reported events 
that map to any one of the following:  
 MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) of Injection site reaction   
 HLT of Ad ministration site reaction  
 HLT of Infusion site reaction.  
The number and percentage of patients  who experienced a TEAE  for the following will be 
analyzed :   
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 38 
LY3074828  
SAP Final v 3.0 
  Any term from either of the HLTs indicated above ( that is,  a combined query of these 
HLTs)  
 Any term  within each HLT separately  
Within HLT, individual PTs that satisfy the queries will be summarized . 
The PT will be listed for summary with each category in decreasing order of incidence for LY -
treated patients.  
The analyses of this section will be performe d for Induction Period, for Induction and 
Maintenance Periods combined, and for Induction and Extension Periods combined.  
6.14.3.  Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant 
Adverse Events   
The number and percentage of patients who experienced a serious adverse event during the 
treatment period will be summarized by [CONTACT_710376]. Events will be ordered by [CONTACT_710377].  
These summary tables will be generated for the  study overall and additionally will be generated 
for the Induction, Maintenance and Extension Periods.  
In the event differential dropout rates are seen, summary tables comparing exposure -adjusted 
incidence rate (that is, person -time-adjusted incidence rat es) over the entire time period will be 
generated for the Induction and Maintenance Periods for applicable safety evaluations of interest . 
The number and percentage of subjects who permanently discontinued from study treatment  due 
to an adverse event (including adverse events that led to death) during the treatment period will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_710378].  
Events will be ordered by [CONTACT_710371].  
A listing of deaths  will be provided. All deaths will be included, regardless of the Investigator's 
or the Sponsor's judgment about causality, including (1) any deaths occurring during 
participation of the study, (2) any deaths occurring after a patient leaves (i.e., discont inued from 
the study or completes the study the study if the death is the result of a process initiated during 
the study, regardless of when it actually occurs. Each listing will include investigator ID, patient 
ID, treatment group, baseline age, sex, asso ciated AE, whether or not the death and Lilly’s 
assessment of whether the process leading to death (NOT the death itself) began:  
 “On study”:  during study or within the [ADDRESS_965958] dose in study.  
 “Shortly after study”:  from the end of t he “On Study” time period to [ADDRESS_965959]

 6.14.4.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
Laboratory evaluations will be summarized and analyzed for the following periods:  
 Induction Period,  
 Maintenance Period,  
 Extension Period (including Extension Induction and Extension Maintenance)  
 
Laboratory tests include all planned analytes as defined in the protocol, excluding those collected 
in a reflex manner (only collected under certain circumstances).  
Values at each visit (starting at randomization) and change from baseline to each visit for 
laboratory tests will be displayed in box plots (notched box for each treatment with out liers 
displayed) for patients who have both a baseline and a result for the specified visit. Individual 
measurements outside of reference limits (defined by [CONTACT_710379]) will also be 
displayed using distinct symbols overlaying the box plot. B aseline will be the last non -missing 
observation in the screening period. Original -scale data will be used for the display. Unplanned 
measurements will be excluded. Displays using both SI and U.S. conventional units will be 
provided (when different). The f ollowing summary statistics will be included in a table below the 
box plot:  N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum. Box plots 
will be used to evaluate trends over time and to assess a potential impact of outliers on central 
tendency summaries.  
Change from baseline to last observation  will also be summarized within the box plot of changes 
(rightmost column) for patients who have both baseline and at least one post -baseline result. 
Baseline will be the last non -missing observation  in the screening period. The last non -missing 
observation in the treatment period will be used as the last observation. Original -scale data will 
be used. Unplanned measurements will be excluded. A p -value will be included in the summary 
statistics at the bottom of the box plot for this assessment, using an ANCOVA model containing 
terms for treatment and the continuous covariate of baseline measurement.   
For quantitative laboratory analyte measurements, 3 -panel displays that include a scatterplot, a 
shift t able, and a shift to high/low table will be created. Specifically, for each measurement, both 
a 3-panel display assessing low values and a [ADDRESS_965960] commo n limit will be displayed. The shift table will include the number and 
percentage of patients within each baseline category (minimum value is low, normal, high, or 
missing) versus each treatment category (minimum value is low, normal, or high) by [CONTACT_3148] . 
Patients with at least one result in the treatment period will be included in the shift table. The 
shift from normal/high to low table will include the number and percentage of patients by 
[CONTACT_710380] 
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page [ADDRESS_965961] one result 
during the treatment period are included. The Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare 
percentages of patients who shift from norma l/high to low between treatments.  
The 3 -panel display to assess high values will be created similarly. The scatterplot will plot the 
maximum value during the screening period versus the maximum value during the treatment 
period. The shift table will inclu de the number and percentage of patients within each baseline 
category (maximum value is low, normal, high, or missing) versus each treatment category 
(maximum value is low, normal, or high) by [CONTACT_3148]. The shift from normal/high to low table 
will includ e the number and percentage of patients by [CONTACT_710381]. Patients whose maximum 
baseline result is normal or low and have at least one result during the treatment period  are 
included.  
For laboratory analyte measurements collected qualitatively, a listing of abnormal findings will 
be created. The listing will include patient ID, treatment group, laboratory collection date, 
analyte name, and analyte finding.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hepatic  Labora tory Examinations  
Analyses for laboratory analyte measurements are described in Section 5.3.  This section 
describes additional analyses for the topic.  
To further evaluate potential hepatotoxicity, an eDISH (Evaluation of Drug -Induced Serious 
Hepatotoxicity) plot will be created. Each subject with at least one post -baseline ALT and total 
bilirubin contributes one point to the plot. The maximum ALT measurement and the maximum 
total bilirubin measurement during the treatment period are used. The measurements do not need 
to be taken at the same blood draw.  
 The percentages of subjects with the following elevations in hepatic laboratory tests at any  time 
will be summarized between treatment groups:

Individual graphical patient profiles will be prepared for subjects with a n ALT or AST 
meas urement greater than or equal to 5X ULN or with an alkaline phosphatase measurement 
greater than or equal to 2X ULN.  A graphical patient profile will be created for any patient 
meeting the criteria from the safety population (any phase, any mediation).  T he graphical patient 
profile will include demographics, disposition, and a display of study drug exposure, adverse 
events, medications, and the liver -related measurements over time.  The review for these subjects 
includes an assessment of the proximity of any ALT or AST elevation to any total bilirubin 
elevation, alkaline phosphatase levels, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels, other 
potential causes, and the temporal association with events such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
abdominal pain, or fati gue. 
A plot of maximum post -baseline ALT vs. maximum post -baseline total bilirubin will be created  
that includes all patients from the safety population .  Each subject  with at l east one post -baseline 
ALT and total bilirubin contributes one point to the plo t.  The maximum ALT measurement

signs and physical characteristics will be displayed in box plots (notched box for each treatment 
with outliers displayed) for patients who have both a baseli ne and a result for the specified visit. 
Individual measurements outside of reference limits will also be displayed using distinct symbols 
overlaying the box plot. Baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment recorded on or 
prior to the first stu dy drug injection at Week 0 (Visit 2 ). Original -scale data will be used for the 
display. Unplanned measurements will be excluded. The following summary statistics will be 
included in a table below the box plot:  N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, Q1, me dian, Q3, 
and maximum. Box plots will be used to evaluate trends over time and to assess a potential 
impact of outliers on central tendency summaries.  
Change from baseline to last observation  will also be summarized within the box plot of changes 
(rightmost column) for patients who have both baseline and at least one post -baseline result. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment recorded on or prior to the first study drug 
inject ion at Week 0 (Visit 2). The last non -missing observation in the treatment period will be

excluded. A p -value will be included in the summary statistics at the b ottom of the box plot for 
this assessment, using an ANCOVA model containing terms for treatment and the continuous 
covariate of baseline measurement.  The percentages of patients with treatment -emergent high or 
low vital signs and physical characteristics r esults at any time  will be summarized. A treatment -
emergent high result is defined as a change from a value less than or equal to the high limit at all 
baseline visits to a value greater than the high limit at any time that meets the specified change 
criteria during the treatment period. A treatment -emergent low result is defined as a change from 
a value greater than or equal to the low limit at all baseline visits to a value less than the low

Summary tables will be provided by [CONTACT_710386].  
A graphical representation for the observed value and the change from baseline over time will be 
presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
The above summaries may be presented separately for each study period if appropriate.  
Correlational analysis to determine  the relationship of LY3074828 dose levels to biomarker 
readings will be performed.  
Additional correlational analyses to investigate the biomarker readings as a predictor of efficacy 
outcomes (Clinical remission/response and endoscopic remission) and health outcomes 
questionnaire findings may be performed if considered useful in further understanding of the 
study exploratory objectives.  
6.14.8.  Immunogenicity  
Figure 1 provides an overview of the immunogenicity assay process.  
At a high level, an individual sam ple is potentially examined multiple times, in a hierarchical 
procedure, to produce a sample Anti-Drug Antibodies ( ADA) assay result and potentially a 
sample neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay result. The cut points used, the drug tolerance of an 
assay, and  the possible values of titers are operating characteristics of the assay.  
It can be the case that the presence of high concentrations of LY will affect the measurements of 
the presence of ADA or NAb, and conversely high levels of ADA or NAb may affect the  
measurement of LY concentration. Thus an LY drug concentration, assessed from a sample 
drawn at the same time as the ADA sample, plays a key role in clinical interpretation of a sample 
when the laboratory result is Not Detected, as shown in Figure 1.  
The rest of this section defines the component concepts of Figure 1 in greater detail.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions of Sample ADA Status  
Table 6  Sample ADA Assay Results  
Sample Laboratory 
Result  Explanation  
Detected  ADA are detected and confirmed.  
Not Detected  The raw result as reported from the laboratory indicates not detected. The 
clinical interpretation of such results depends on other factors (see below).  
NO TEST, QNS, etc.  Sample exists but was unevaluable by [CONTACT_124445]

SAP Final v 3.0 
 Table 7  Sample Clinical ADA Interpretation Results  
Sample Clinical 
Interpretation  Explanation  
ADA Present  ADA assay result is Detected  
ADA Not Present  ADA assay result is Not Detected and simultaneous drug concentration is at 
a level that has been demonstrated to not interfere  in the ADA detection 
method (i.e. drug concentration is below the assay's drug tolerance level).  
 
For patients receiving placebo, drug concentration is not assessed and is 
assumed to be below the assay's drug to lerance level.  
 
If drug concentration was planned but is not available for a treatment -period 
sample, a Not Detected sample will be declared ADA Not Present, on the 
basis of prior knowledge that the drug tolerance level of the ADA assay is 
high relative to  peak PK levels.  
ADA Inconclusive  ADA assay result is Not Detected but drug concentration in the sample is at 
a level that can cause interference in the ADA detection method.  
ADA Missing  ADA sample not drawn, QNS, not tested, etc., causing there to be no  
laboratory result reported or the result is reported as “no test”.  
 
Parallel terminology applies for Neutralizing ADA (NAb) Detected, NAb Not Detected, NAb 
Present, NAb Not Present, NAb Inconclusive, NAb Missing. ADA and Neutralizing ADA (NAb) 
are distin ct assays and have different assay operating characteristics.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions of Immunogenicity Assessment Periods  
Immunogenicity Baseline Observations:   Screening period for immunogenicity assessment for 
each patient includes all observations on or prior to first administration of study drug. In 
instances where multiple baseline observations are collected, to determine patient ADA status 
the last non -missing immunogenicity assessment prior to first administration of study drug is 
used to determine treatment -emergent status (see below).  In this context, ‘missing’ includes 
explicit ‘ADA Missing’ results, as defined in Table 7 . 
Imm unogenicity Postbaseline Period Observations:  Postbaseline period observations for each 
patient includes all observations after the first administration of study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions of Patient ADA Status  
 
Patient evaluable for treatment -emergent ADA:  A pat ient is evaluable for treatment -
emergent ADA if the patient has a non -missing baseline ADA result, and at least one non -
missing post -baseline ADA result.  
Treatment -emergent ADA positive (TE ADA+) patient:  A patient who is evaluable for 
treatment -emergent ADA is treatment -emergent ADA positive (TE ADA+) if either of the 
following holds:  
a. The patient has baseline status of ADA Not Present and at least one post -baseline status 
of ADA Present with titer ≥ 2*MRD, where the MRD is the minimum required dilution 
of the ADA assay.  
b. The patient has baseline and post -baseline status of ADA Present, with the post -baseline 
titer being 2 dilutions (4 -fold) greater than the baseline titer. That is, the patient has 
baseline status of ADA Present, with titer 1:B, and at least  one post -baseline status of 
ADA Present, with titer 1:P, with P/B ≥ 4. 
Treatment -emergent ADA Inconclusive patient:  A patient who is evaluable for TE ADA is 
TE ADA Inconclusive if ≥ 20% of the patient’s post -baseline samples, drawn pre -dose, are ADA 
Inconclusive and the patient is not otherwise TE ADA+  (i.e. over all postbaseline visits, the 
patient does not have a TE ADA+ titer) . 
Treatment -emergent ADA negative (TE ADA -) patient:  A patient who is evaluable for TE 
ADA is treatment -emergent ADA negative ( TE ADA -) when the patient is not TE ADA+ and 
the patient is not TE -ADA Inconclusive.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analyses to be performed  
A listing will be provided of all immuno assessments for those patients who at any time had 
ADA Present. This includes the laboratory ADA assay r esult (Detected or Not Detected), LY 
concentration from a simultaneous PK sample, and the clinical interpretation result that 
combines these (ADA Present, ADA Not Present, ADA Inconclusive, Missing). When Detected, 
a titer will be included, and TE ADA+ obs ervations will be flagged. Also included, when the 
NAb assay was performed, will be the laboratory NAb assay result (Detected or Not Detected) 
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 49 
LY3074828  
SAP Final v 3.0 
 and the NAb clinical interpretation result (NAb Present, NAb Not Present, NAb Inconclusive, 
Missing).  
In the rema inder of this section, "ADA result" will refer to the clinical interpretation result, and 
similarly for NAb.  
The number and proportion of patients who are TE ADA+ will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570], 
where proportions are relative to the number of patient s who are TE ADA evaluable, as defined 
above. The tabulation will include all post -baseline observations and will include the number and 
proportion of patients with ADA Present at baseline, and also the number and proportion of TE 
ADA+ patients exhibiting NAb+.   This summary will be provided for Induction Period, for 
Induction and Maintenance Periods combined, and for Induction and Extension Periods 
combined.  
For each TE ADA+ patient, a plot will be constructed of titer values from individual samples 
over time. Samples that are ADA Not Present or ADA Inconclusive will also be indicated.  
A summary will be provided of the number and percentage of LY -treated patients experiencing 
specific TEAE (see Table 8 ) by [CONTACT_710387] ( TE ADA+, TE ADA -, TE ADA 
Inconclusive).  The PT will be ordered by [CONTACT_710388]+ status group.  For 
event terms not occurring in any TE ADA+ or TE ADA Inconclusive patient, a summary will be 
provided of the number of distinct terms report ed, but individual PT will not be summarized. 
This summary will be provided for  Induction and Maintenance Periods combined and for 
Induction and Extension Periods combined.  
A listing will be provided of all TEAE alongside ADA data, for any patient who had ADA 
Present at any time (including baseline) or had any specific TEAE (see Table 8). This listing 
includes a time course of ADA (clinical interpretation result plus flags for samples meeting TE 
ADA+ criteria and for NAb+ samples) along with the TEAE.

6.14.9.  Histopathology  
The histopathologic images will be read centrally in a blinded manner by a qualified pathologist 
and scoring performed using the Geboes Score and Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) [3].  
The Geboes score assigns subjects to grades 0, 1, 2A, 2B, 3, 4 and 5 according to seven 
histological features: structural (architectural change), chronic inflammatory infiltrate, lamina 
I6T-MC-AMAC Statistical Analysis Plan   Page 50 
LY3074828  
SAP Final v 3.0 
 propria eosinophils, lamina propria neutrophils, neutrophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], crypt destruction and 
erosion or ulceration  [3].   
In practice, the highest grade in which there is evidence of disease is assigned.  For example if 
<50% crypts involved (3.2) is checked and Crypt destruction is noted as ‘none’ (4.0) and Erosion 
or ulceration is ‘No erosion, ulceration ,or granulati on tissue’ (5.0), the subject will be assigned a  
score or grade of 3.  For scoring , a subject with either abnormalities in lamina propria 
eosinophils or lamina propria neutrophils will be assigned a score or grade of 2.  
The Robarts Histopathology Index is  based on the chronic inflammatory infiltrate, lamina 
propria neutrophils, neutrophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and erosion ulceration components of the Geboes 
score.   As reported in Mosli et al, the RHI is calculated as:  
 
RHI = 1 x chronic inflammatory infiltrate l evel (4 levels)  
                               + 2 x lamina propria neutrophils (4 levels)  
       + 3 x_neutrophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (4 levels)  
       + 5 x erosion or ulceration (4 levels after com bining Geboes 5.1 and 5.2).  
The total score ranges from 0 (no  disease activity) to 33 (severe disease activity).  
The following proposed definition for histologic remission will be used for the purpose of 
analyses and interpretation in this study:  
 Proposed definition: Histologic remission, defined as Geboes histolog ical subscores of 0 
for parameters:  
o 2B (neutrophils in lamina propria), and  
o 3 (neutrophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), and  
o 5 (erosion or ulceration)  
 
The following three additional definitions are also presented for exploratory purposes only:  
 Exploratory definition 1 : Histologic remission, defined as Geboes histological subscores 
of 0 for parameters:  
o 2B (neutrophils in lamina propria), and  
o 3 (neutrophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), and  
o 5 (erosion or ulceration)  
and 
o 0 (structural [architectural change]) – no worse than baseline.  
 
 Exploratory definition 2: Histologic remission, defined as Geboes histological subscores 
of 0 for parameters:  
o 2B (neutrophils in lamina propria) and  
o 3 (neutrophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), and  
o 4 (crypt destruction) , and  
o 5 (erosion or ulceration)

For Week 12 Clinical Remission analyses, a logistic regression model with tre atment, subgroup, 
and the interaction of treatment -by-subgroup included as factors will be used. The treatment -by 
[CONTACT_710390] 0.10. Treatment group differences 
will be evaluated within each category of t he subgroup using Fisher’s exact test, regardless of 
whether the interaction is statistically significant. Missing data will be imputed using NRI, as 
described in Section 6.4.1. If any group within the subgroup (for example, yes, no) is less than 
10% of th e total population, only descriptive statistics will be provided for that subgroup (that is, 
no inferential testing).

6.16.  Protocol Violations  
Review of all m ajor and minor protocol violations will be performed on an ongoing basis during 
the conduct of the study. All protocol exemptions/violations identified from the following 
sources will be tracked:  
 During clinical monitoring visits  
 During data validation pr ocess  
No patient will be excluded from the ITT population due to any protocol violations.  
There is no Per -Protocol Population in this plan.  
All protocol exemptions and violations that require medical review will be listed.  
For the purpose of protocol devia tion programming for p rior med ications  the following 
imputation  will be applied .  
If month and day are both missing, impute to Jan 1; and  if day is missing, impute to 1.  
When year, month and day are missing the date will be treated as missing (i.e. there will 
be no imputations).  
This imputation will be applied for  partial  end dates alone  and will only be used for protocol 
deviation programmable purposes.  Since many of the  important protocol deviation categories 
identify certain medication s within weeks of baseline, the end dates of prior meds are imputed  as 
described above . Table 9 lists the categories, subcategories, and study specific terms of important  
protocol deviatio ns.

6.17.  Number and Timing of Analyses  
6.17.1.  Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis will take place when all randomized patients have had an opportunity to 
complete 12 weeks of induction treatment.  
6.17.2.  Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
One interim analysis will be conducted to assess the primary efficacy results when 
approximately half (~120) of the patients have completed the dosing inducti on phase (or 
discontinued study treatment). The interim efficacy results will be used for internal decision 
making to trigger planning activities associated with the investigational product and to aid 
development of PK/PD modeling. The study may not be sto pped for positive efficacy. Hence, 
there will be no alpha adjustment the interim analysis. The assessment will be conducted by a 
sponsor assessment committee with a limited number of pre -identified team members who do 
not have direct site contact [CONTACT_710392] e ntry/validation responsibilities. To minimize any bias being

LY3074828  
SAP Final v 3.0 
 introduced into the analysis of the study results, the SAP and PK/PD analysis plan will be 
finalized and approved before the efficacy interim analysis begins.  
Information that may unblind the stu dy during the analyses will not be reported to study sites or 
the blinded study team until the study has been unblinded.  
Ongoing monitoring of safety data (including AEs, SAEs, and selected laboratory 
measurements) will be continued throughout the study us ing blinded data.   Reviewing details 
are specified in the trial level safety review (TLSR) plan or a separate document.  
6.18.  Changes to the Planned Analysis from the Clinical Study 
Protocol  
The primary analysis method for categorical variables will now be logi stic regression not CMH.   
Prior Concomitant and Current Concomitant medication will not be summarized as reported in 
section 12.2.4 of the protocol. Prior Medication and Concomitant medications will be summarized 
per section 6.10 of the SAP.  
As of the approval date of SAP version 3, there are no additional changes to the planned analysis 
in the protocol.

 7. Unblinding Plan  
A limited number of pre -identified individuals at Eli Lilly and Company may gain access to the 
unblinded data as part of t he prespecified interim analysis (see section 6.17) in order to initiate the 
final population PK/PD model development processes for primary analyses and/or to evaluate 
safety data. Information that may unblind the study during the analyses will not be repo rted to 
study sites until the Maintenance period has been completed.  
Additionally, a limited number of pre -identified individuals, an Eli Lilly and Company PK/PD 
Scientist and unblinded site pharmacists will have access to patients dosing information in or der 
to conduct the TDM adjustments. Unblinded dosing information will not be shared with any other 
study or site personnel.

Appendix A. The UCEIS  
The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity is evaluated at the time of endoscopy. The 
scoring of the sub scores can be found in Table 10.  
Table 10 UCEIS Scoring  Algorithm  
 
 The UCEIS score is defined as th e sum of the Vascular Pattern Score (0 -2), the Bleeding Score 
(0-3) and the Erosions and Ulcers Score (0 -3). Possible values of the UCEIS score range from [ADDRESS_965968] severe.

 Appendix B. IBDQ Missing Data Handling Algorithm  
The instructions on how the IBDQ score is calculated in the presence of missing or incomplete 
information is provided below with detailed scenarios given in Table 11.  
IBDQ : The IBDQ is a 32 -item self -administered questionnaire. The IBDQ has 4 dimensions : 
bowel symptoms (10  items), systemic symptoms (5 items), emotional function (12 items), and 
social function (5 items). Responses are graded on a 7-point Likert scale  in which 7 denotes “not 
a problem at all” and 1 denotes “a very severe problem.” Scores range from 32 to 224;  a higher 
score indicates a better quality of life. The 4 dimensions are defined as:  
• Bowel symptoms: Questions 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29  
• Systemic symptoms: Questions 2, 6, 10, 14, 18  
• Emotional function: Questions 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27,  30, 31, 32  
• Social function: Questions 4, 8, 12, 16, 28  
 
Rules for handling missing data:  
1. If no response is given for a particular question and only one response per 
dimensional score is missing, impute the missing value to be equal to the mean score 
for the other items of the subscore.  
2. If two or more questions are unanswered for a particular domain, then the subscore 
will be set to missing.  
3. If after steps 1 and 2, more than 4 questions are missing for the full IBDQ, then the 
total IBDQ will be set to missi ng.

 CONFIDENTIAL Page 11 of 27 4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 General 
The study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of RJX in healthy participants. This study will be conducted as a 
2-part study. 
4.1.1 Part 1 
Part 1 is designed as single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study in 52 participants in 
6 cohorts. 
• Cohorts 1 to 5 will include 8 participants per cohort (6 RJX: 2 placebo) between 18 and 
50 years of age, inclusive 
• Cohort 6 will investigate an older population of 12 participants 51 to 70 years of age, 
inclusive (9 RJX: 3 placebo) 
The assignment to either RJX or placebo will be blinded to the participants, investigators, and 
study site staff.  
Part [ADDRESS_225258] as an IV infusion on Day 1. 
Cohort 1 will include the initial dosing of a sentinel group (1 RJX and 1 placebo). The remaining 
6 participants in Cohort 1 (5 RJX: 1 placebo) will be dosed if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_190123], there are no significant safety concerns identified in the sentinel participants within 
the first 24 hours after administration of the dose (RJX or placebo). 
Participants will be confined to the study site from Day -1 to Day 2 ([ADDRESS_225259] dose) and then 
required to return to the study site on Day 5 for follow-up. Safety and PK assessments will be 
performed at selected timepoints throughout the study. 
4.1.2 Part 2 
Part 2 of the study is designed as a multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study in 
24 participants as 3 cohorts of 8 participants (6 RJX: 2 placebo). The MAD arm will commence 
in parallel with Part 1, Cohort 6 following completion and review of the safety findings for 
Part 1, Cohorts 1 to 5.  
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 proposed doses of RJX or placebo 
(6 RJX: 2 placebo) daily for [ADDRESS_225260] of screening, treatment, and follow-up periods. Screening will occur between 
Days -21 and -1 to determine eligibility in the study. Those participants who meet the eligibility 
criteria will be admitted to the study site on Day -1, when their continued eligibility will be 
assessed. Participants will commence a standardized diet the day prior to dosing to control 
vitamin intake. 
Participants will be confined to the study site from Days -1 to 8 ([ADDRESS_225261] final dose on 
Day 7) and then return to the study site on Day 12 for follow-up. Safety and PK assessments will 
be performed at selected timepoints throughout the study. 
4.1.3 Dose Escalation in Parts 1 and 2 
Details about dose escalation are described in Section 6.3.2 of the study protocol. 
4.2 Study Population 
The study population will include 76 healthy male and female participants between 51 to 
70 years of age (Part 1, Cohort 6) or 18 and 50 years of age (all other cohorts), inclusive, with a 
body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, weight not exceeding [ADDRESS_225262] results within normal reference range or 
judged to be not clinically significant. 
4.3 Evaluations at Screening and Check-in 
A detailed schedule of events is provided in Table 6 (for Part 1) and Table 7 (for Part 2) in 
Section 8.[ADDRESS_225263] will be made 
of randomly permuted blocks of appropriate sizes, as determined by [CONTACT_190131]. The schedules will be generated through the Statistical 
Analysis System software, version 9.3. 
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), each participant will be given a unique screening 
number according to the screening order. Then, prior to dosing, each participant will be allocated 
a randomization number according to their chronological order of inclusion in the study. This 
number will correspond to a treatment (RJX or placebo) as specified on the pre-determined 
randomization schedule. 
Confirmation of the randomization number allocated will be documented in the drug 
accountability records and recorded in the eCRF. Both the screening and randomization numbers

following completion and review of the safety findings from Part 1 (Cohorts 1-5) and preceding Part 2 Cohorts but 
will not exceed 0.759 mL/kg.  
 
Participants in each cohort will be dosed in staggered dosing. All doses will be administered as 
IV infusion by [CONTACT_190132]. 
Food restrictions in relation to dosing are described in more detail in Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_225267] No. 3957-0002 Statistical Analysis Plan

respectively. 
4.4.2 Concomitant Medications 
Should any treatment/medication other than the investigational product be used, the investigator 
must note the use of the concomitant medication in the source documentation and the CRF. This 
record should include the drug name (generic name), total daily dose, route of administration, 
start and stop date of administration, and the indication. 
Concomitant medications will be recorded from Day -[ADDRESS_225268] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
This includes an exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug 
interaction, or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded 
elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments. Assessment of AEs starts with 
signing informed consent. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. The 
AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_190133] a nonleading question, for example, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” The AEs 
should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF.

4.5.[ADDRESS_225270] 5 minutes.  
The following parameters will be assessed: heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF (Fridericia’s 
formula). The investigator (or a qualified observer at the investigational site) will interpret the 
ECG using one of the following categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not clinically 
significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. 
In Part 1, a safety 12-lead ECG will be performed at every visit except follow-up. In Part 2, a 
safety 12-lead ECG will be performed at every visit except check-in (refer to Protocol 
Appendix 1, Tables 6 and 7 Error! Reference source not found.).

.5.5 Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Full physical examinations will be performed at screening and follow-up by a physician or a 
clinically qualified delegate at the site. The physical examination will include examination of the 
following: general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), skin, 
cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal system, 
lymph nodes, and nervous system. Any findings made during the physical examination must be 
noted regardless of whether they are part of the patient’s medical history. An abbreviated 
physical examination will be performed at check-in. 
Daily neurological assessments per standard of care will include pyramidal functions, limb 
strength, cerebellar functions, and sensory functions. 
4.5.6 Weight and Height 
Body weight (in kg; wearing light clothes, no shoes) and height (in cm) will be measured. Height 
and weight measurements will be used to calculate body mass index (BMI). 
4.5.7 Protocol Deviation Reporting 
If any issue relating to the safety of study participant arises that requires a deviation from the 
protocol, the study unit through the investigator may immediately make such a deviation. The 
nature and reasons for the protocol deviations/violations will be recorded in the participant’s 
eCRF. All protocol deviations/violations will be captured by [CONTACT_190134]. Failure to obtain 
samples due to clinical issues, such as problems with venous access, will not be considered 
protocol violations. Changes in dose levels or the implementation of additional cohorts as 
directed by [CONTACT_190135].

Version 9.4 or newer (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics including number of participants, 
mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, 90% confidence interval, minimum, and 
maximum by [CONTACT_11139], where appropriate.  
Data collected from all randomized participants will be presented in data listings. Both absolute 
values and change-from-baseline values for each participant will be given where applicable. All 
continuous data will be listed with the same precision as is presented in the database. Data 
listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_14455], treatment, participant identification, and timepoint.  
Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_190137]. Participant data will be 
summarized using the count of distinct participants who fall into the category and the percentage 
of the total number of participants. Timepoint data will be summarized using the count of the 
assessments that fall into the category and the percentage of the total number of assessments. 
Percentages will be rounded up or down to the next integer percentage. Population counts (either 
number of participants or number of timepoints at the assessment) for each treatment group will 
be used as the denominator in the calculation of percentages unless otherwise specified. 
7.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
All data from withdrawn participants will be included in all analyses up to the time of 
withdrawal regardless of the duration of treatment. There will be no imputation for missing data 
unless otherwise specified.

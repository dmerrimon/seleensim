Analysis Populations 
• Intent- to-Treat Population – The intent- to-treat (ITT) population includes all 
randomized subjects. The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT 
population. Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as randomized. 
• Per Protocol Population – The per  protocol (PP) population includes subjects in 
the ITT population who do not have significant protocol deviations and who 
complete the study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prio r to database lock

 and unmasking . Subjects in the PP population will be an alyzed as treated . 
• Safety Population – The safety population includes all subjects who have 
received  at least one dose of the investigational product. The safety population 
will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the Safety population 
will be analyzed as treated.  
Sample Size  
This study is expected to enroll 240 subjects in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_87992] approximately 90% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_87993] at a two -sided significance level of 0.05. Again, 
it is assumed that adjusting for baseline and site will fu rther reduce variability and 
provide >90% power. 
Likewise, the standard deviation for change from baseline scores in the post- CAE ODS 
at Day [ADDRESS_87994] approximately 90% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_87995] at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. It is assumed that adjusting for baseline and site 
will further reduce variability a nd provide >90% power. 
Multiplicity Consideration : 
Common factors for multiplicity are multiple arms and multiple endpoints. 
1) Multiple arms 
The primary treatment comparison will be between the  K -161  treatment arm 
and the vehicle  treatment arm. Other treatment comparisons will be considered 
secondary  or exploratory.  
2) Multiple endpoints 
The primary and important secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically to maintain the study- wise Type I error rate of 0.05. First, change from baseline in inferior corneal 
fluorescein staining will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05. The test for change from baseline scores in the ODS will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_87996] for change from ba seline in Schirmer’s 
test will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_87997] demonstrates  significance.  All other secondary and 
exploratory endpoints and treatment comparisons will be considered exploratory. 
The hierarchical testing order will be as follows: Primary comparisons:  

K-161 Sponsor:  Kowa Research Institute (KRI)  
Clinical Trial Protocol No.: K -161-2.01US   
Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_87998] -CAE inferior corneal stain ing at 
Day 29 (  K-161  vs vehicle) 
2. Comparison of the change from baseline in post -CAE ocular discomfort at Day 
29 (  K- 161  vs vehicle)  
Important Secondary comparisons: 
3. Comparison of the change from baseline in pre -CAE Schirmer’s test value at  
Day 29 (  K-161  vs vehicle) 
4. Comparison of the change from baseline in post -CAE TFBUT at Day 29 (  
K-161  vs vehicle) 
Thus, the study- wise Type I error rate will be maintained at 0.05 by [CONTACT_80684] K- 161 as the primary treatm ent comparison and using a hierarchical testing 
procedure. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses :  
The primary comparisons of change from  baseline in post- CAE inferior corneal staining 
and ocular discomfort between  the  K-161  group and the vehicle group at Day 
29, will be performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. The respective 
baseline post- CAE score will be included as a covariate in each model and site will be 
included as a fixed effect. Treatment by [CONTACT_80685], if significant, analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_80686]/or site, respectively, to further examine significant interactions. In addition, unadjusted two- sample t -tests and Wilcoxon rank- sum tests 
will be performed for each comparison as sensitivity analyses. The primary analyses 
will use the ITT population. 
For the primary endpoints multiple imputation with a control- based pattern mixture 
model will be used.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary and  exploratory endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary analyses 
on the ITT population. Continuous and ordinal variables collected at each visit will be 
summarized descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum), and analy zed with ANCOVA models and two -sample , two -sided  t-tests 
comparing  each  K-[ADDRESS_87999] diary symptom da ta will be analyzed using each weekly average score from the 
diaries, as well as using repeated measures models across the diary collection period.  
For the two important secondary endpoints , other secondary , and  exploratory endpoints , 
multiple imputation with a control -based pattern mixture model  will be used.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
Dry eye disease is a multifactorial, progressive disorder of the ocular surface resulting 
from insufficient tear coverage of the surface of the eye in combination with ocular 
surface inflammation.  Patients with DED often experience severe pain, visual 
impairment, tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, inflammation, and corneal wounding. While the prevalence of DED is difficult to report due to varying definitions and diagnostic criteria, the gl obal prevalence of DED is estimated to be between 5% and 
50%, and increases with age ( Bron et al. 2017) . In the [LOCATION_002], it is estimated that 
as many as 3.[ADDRESS_88009] DED, with a projected 40% increase in number of patients affected by 2030 ( Schaumberg et al. 2002, 
Schaumberg et al. 2003, Schaumberg et al. 2009 ). 
Current treatment and management of DED consists primarily of tear supplementation 
with lubricants (artificial tears). While artificial tears improve symptoms associated with 
DED, they have no effect on resolving the underlying conditions that lead to 
inflammation of the ocular surface. Three  currently available options for treating 
inflammation at the ocular surface are Restasis
® (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion) 
CEQUA™ (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution), and Xiidra® (lifitegrast ophthalmic 
solution). It has been shown that only 15% of patients respond to Restasis® after 6 
months of treatment, as measured by [CONTACT_80688]’s te st, and many more report ocular side-
effects such as burning and stinging (Mah et al. 2012) . Xiidra® has also been shown to be 
associated with ocular adverse events; in a clinical study of Xiidra® for subjects with 
DED, subject s reported increased ocular irritation upon instillation with Xiidra® 
compared to placebo (7.8% compared to 1.4% in the placebo group) (Tauber et al. 2015) . 
Similarly, common adverse reactions reported after use of CEQUA include instillation site pain and conjunctival hyperemia ( CEQUA 2018 ). Thus, there remains a medical need 
for more efficacious treatment options with a more favorable safety and comfort profile 
for patients with DED.  
 Drug Profile from Non-clinical Studies  1.[ADDRESS_88010] potent anti- inflammatory activity both  in vitro  and in vivo   
.  
 was shown to suppress ocular surface infla mmation 
and corneal injury in a mouse model of dry eye disease ( ). Because  
inflammation is a key component of DED, targeting the inflammatory pathway via  
 to reduce cytokine production and/or immune cell infiltration at the ocular 
surface may reduce the signs and symptoms of DED.

Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_88011]’s medical treatment and/or study visit procedures, the 
study will be discussed with each subject and subjects wishing to participate must give 
written informed consent (and/or assent) and sign a HIPAA form.  
The objectives of the study are  to assess the safety, efficacy, optimum dosage, and dosing 
regimen  of K -161 compared to its vehicle  from Day 1 ( baseline ) to Day [ADDRESS_88012] s with moderate to severe dry eye disease  both in 
environmental and Controlled Adverse Environment ( CAE ) setting s. 
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES  
The clinical hypotheses for this study is  that  K-161 Ophthalmic Solution  
 (  is superior to its vehicle (  for the primary endpoints of signs and 
symptoms  of dry eye , as follows :  
• Sign: Post- CAE  inferior corneal fluorescein staining score on the Ora Calibra® 
scale, measured by [CONTACT_80689] (Visit 2) to Visit 5  
• Symptom: Post- CAE  ocular discomfort scale on the Ora Calibra® scale, measured 
by [CONTACT_80689] (Visit 2) to Visit 5  
4 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double- masked , vehicle-controlled, parallel-
group design with block enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to one of the following 
treatment groups at Visit 2:  
•  K-161;  (   (N=~ 60) 
•  K-161;   (N=~ 60) 
•  K-161;  (   (N=~ 60)  
• Placebo Ophthalmic Solution (Vehicle);   (N=~ 60) 
Approximately 240 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups (1:1:1:1).  
 Subjects, Sponsor, Contract research 
organization ( CRO ), and site personnel will be masked to treatment assignment. To 
ensure masking, a dedicated unmasked st aff member/technician will be delegated to 
dispense and observe instillation of randomized study drug and collect randomized study drug from a subject for drug accountability. This person cannot perform any other study-related procedures.  Additionally, the informed consent form (ICF) will not indicate any 
relationship between dosing regimen and treatment. Subjects will be instructed not to discuss their assigned dosing regimen or perceived treatment effects with other study participants.

 During the screenin g period, two 90-minute exposures to the CAE  will be conducted to 
ascertain eligibility to enter the study.  Subjects who qualify after the initial screening visit 
will enter the run -in phase, where they will self- administer vehicle  for 
approximately 14 days.  Those who qualify at Visit 2 (Day 1)  will be randomized to 
receive study drug in a double- masked fashio n for [ADDRESS_88013]- CAE ocular 
discomfort on the Ora Calibra® scale. Subjects will self -administer drops either  or

Evaluations that may be conducted at an Unscheduled Visit include: 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
• Assessment of AEs 
  
• Any other assessments needed in the judgment of the investigator. 
 Compliance with Protocol 8.[ADDRESS_88032] is less than 80% or more than 125% compliant with

non-compliant and a dosing deviation should be recorded.  
In the subject daily diary, if more than 20% of Dose boxes are checked “no”, left blank, 
or missing for a diary period, a subject will be deemed non-compliant and a diary deviation will be recorded. If more than 20% of the total diary symptom assessments for that dosing period are missed, these subjects will be deemed non- compliant and a diary 
symptom assessment deviation will be recorded. These guidelines will be used by [CONTACT_3433] e 
Investigator for determining  the subject’s necessary compliance for the study and for 
recording deviations from this compliance .

 8.6.2 Discontinued Subjects  
Subjects may be discontinued prior to their completion of the study due to: 
• subject request/withdrawal 
• AEs 
• protocol violations 
• administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue, lost to follow up) 
• sponsor termination of study 
• other 
Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinued for any sound medical reason. 
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will be made 
to  and/or sponsor and will be clearly documented on the e CRF.  
 Study Termination 8.7
The study may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_093], the sponsor, and/or  with appropriate notification. 
 Study  Duration 8.8
An individual subjec t’s part icipation will involve 5 visits over approximately a 6- week 
(~42 days) period (14 days pre- screening , 28 days of treatment ) and a follow -up phone 
call. 
 Monitoring and Quality Assurance 8.9
During the course of the study an  monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits 
to review protocol compliance, assess IP accountability, and ensure the study is being 
conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domesti c and foreign agencies,  quality assurance and or its 
designees may carry out on-site inspections and/or audits which may include source data 
checks. Therefore direct access to the original source data will be required  for inspections 
and/or audits. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.

 unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with th e use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE  can arise 
from any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, including medical device failure, subject  characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy applied , sizing, dose release , and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate pages of the CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078]. 
Exacerbation of conditions related to the signs and symptoms of DED will not be reported as an AE. 
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_88035] 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_80694]: 
• Related : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A related  AE 
can be further defined as  follows: 
 Occurs within a reasonable temporal sequence to administration of study drug  
 Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]  
 Improves or disappears on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80675] (de- challenge)  
 Reappears on repeated exposure to study drug (re- challenge)  
K-161 Sponsor:  Kowa Research Institute (KRI)  
Clinical Trial Protocol No.: K -161-2.01US   
Confidential   Page 43 
  Is an unusual event that is known to be associated with the drug or this class 
of compound, and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_80695] ’s 
physical condition 
 Unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawal (de- challenge)  
• Not Related : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. A 
not related AE can be further defined as follows:  
 Occurs with a temporal relationship to administration of study drug which makes a causal relationship improbable 
 Other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations 
of causality  
 Is known to be associated with the participant’s clinical condition, or with 
other medication taken by [CONTACT_80696] a reasonable possibility that 
the IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE . Types of evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE  event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., 
angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
The investigator should initially classify the relatednes s of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination  unless revised by [CONTACT_429], which has the ultimate responsibility for judging relatedness. 
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
• Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has 
been observed. 
• Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected.

Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_88036] to the Medical Monitor’s determination. 
 Serious Adverse Events 9.2
An AE  is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life-threatening; 
Note: An AE  is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 hours), unless the inpatient admission was pre-planned prior to the 
signing of the informed consent. For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient 
unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; 
outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures;  observation/short stay units; 
rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical 
research/phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension 
of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80677].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious a dverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve).  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  9.[ADDRESS_88037] be reported to 
 and the sponsor as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and 
governing health authorities and recorded on the appropriate CRF. Adverse events will be

 collected from the time of the signing of the Informed Consent until the follow-up phone 
call ( about 7 days  after the final day of randomized study drug treatment).  
9.3.1 Reporting a Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
All SAEs that are both ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are also to be reported to the 
IRB/IEC and the regulatory authorities as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local 
regulations and governing health authorities. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_88038] be recorded on the 
appropriate CRFs . The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the sponsor in addition to that information reported on the CRF . 
All subjects experiencing a SAE  must be followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a SAE , the investigator must notify  and the sponsor immediately  
using the contact [CONTACT_31307] ; obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent 
medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the 
treatment and follow -up of the subject; provide  and the sponsor with a complete case 
history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IP; and inform the IRB of the SAE  within their guidelines for 
reporting SAEs .

 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable) 9.[ADDRESS_88040]. 
When possible (i.e., in non-emergent situations),  and/or the study sponsor should be notified before unmasking study drug.  and/or the study sponsor must be informed immediately about any unmasking event.  
If an investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment assignment of a 
subject, he/she should contact  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the medical monitor prior to unmasking the identity of the IP, if possible.  will ask the site to complete and send them t he 
Unmasking Request Form.  will notify the sponsor, and jointly will determine if the 
unmasking request should be granted. They may consult the medical monitor as needed. The result of the request will be documented on the Unmasking Request Form. If approval is granted to unmask a subject, written permission via the Unmasking Request 
Form will be provided to the investigator . The investigator  will unmask the subject using 
IWRS. The investigator will complete the Unmasking Memo form and include it in the 
subject’s study file and provide a copy for the TMF. For each unmasked request, the reason, date, signature, and name [CONTACT_80702]’s study f ile.  
Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study. Unmasked subjects will be followed for safety monitoring until resolution of the adverse event or study completion, whichever occurs last.

AEs identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_80697].  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE 
(i.e., resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new  SAE/Unanticipated Report 
Form must be completed and faxed to  within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the new information. The original SAE form is not to  be altered. The report should describe 
whether the event has resolved or cont inues and how the event was treated.  
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES 
 Analysis Populations 10.1
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
• Intent- to-Treat Population – The intent- to-treat (ITT) population includes all 
randomized subjects. S ubjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as 
randomized. 
• Per-Protocol Population – The per -protocol (PP) population includes subjects in 
the ITT population who do not have significant protocol deviations and who complete the study. Protocol devia tions will be assessed prior to database lock 
and unmasking. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated . 
• Safety Population – The safety population includes all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of the investigational product. Subjects in the Safety population will be analyzed as treated.  
The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the safety population. The 
analysis of efficacy data will be performed for the ITT population and on the PP 
population as sensitivity analyses . 
 Statistical Hypotheses  10.[ADDRESS_88042] their respective two -sided 
alternative hypotheses in the order: 
H01:  There is no diff erence in the change from baseline in the post- CAE inferior corneal 
staining score after 28 days of treatment of  K-161  compared to vehicle.   H
02:  There is no difference in the change from baseline in the post- CAE ocular 
discomfort score after 28  days of treatment of  K -161  compared to vehicle.   

K-161 Sponsor:  Kowa Research Institute (KRI)  
Clinical Trial Protocol No.: K -161-2.01US   
Confidential   Page 48 
 Upon rejecting both H 01 and H 02, the secondary hypotheses will be tested as detailed in 
Section  10.4.4 in the following order  
H03:  There is no difference in the change from baseline in the p re-CAE Schirmer’s test 
value after 28 days of treatment of  K-161  compared to vehicle. 
H04:  There is no difference in the change from baseline in the post- CAE TFBUT  after 
28 days of treatment of  K-161  compared to vehicle. These four hypotheses will be tested hierarchically, each at the alpha = 0.05 level to 
maintain a study- wise Type I error rate at 0.05 . 
 Sample Size   10.3
This study is expected to enroll 240 subjects in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_88043] approximately 90% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_88044] at a two -sided significance level of 0.05. Again, it is assumed that 
adjusting for baseline and site will further reduce variability and provide >90% power. 
Likewise, the standard deviation for change from baseline scores in the post- CAE ODS at 
Day [ADDRESS_88045] approximately 90% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_88046] at a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05. It is assumed that adjusting for baseline and site will further reduce variability and provide >90% power. 
 Statistical Analysis  10.4
10.4.1 General Considerations  
Quantitative variables will be summarized descriptively using number of subjects (n), 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Qualitative variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_3148] g roup. Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and subject disposition. For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and AEs  will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate.  Change from pre-CAE to post- CAE will be calculated as post -CAE value minus pre- CAE 
value. Baseline measures are defined as the last non-missing measure prior to the 
initiation of randomized study treatment. Change from baseline will be cal culated as 
follow-up visit value minus baseline value. Treatment comparisons between active and 
vehicle will be calculated as active minus vehicle. 

K-161 Sponsor:  Kowa Research Institute (KRI)  
Clinical Trial Protocol No.: K -161-2.01US   
Confidential   Page 49 
 All analyses will be 2 -sided at a significance level of 0.05  unless otherwise specified . For 
all efficacy analyses, 95% confidence intervals on the difference between each dose of K -
161 and vehicle will be provided. 
10.4.2 Unit of Analysis 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes. For efficacy endpoints, the unit of 
analysis will be the  study eye, or the “worst eye ,” as defined by [CONTACT_716]:  
Worst Eye: Eyes are eligible for analysis if they meet all of the inclusion criteria. At least one eye (the right eye or the left eye) must meet all of the criterial. In the case that both 
eyes are el igible for analysis, the worst eye will be selected as the eye with the worst 
post- CAE inferior corneal staining at Visit 2. If the post- CAE inferior corneal staining at 
Visit [ADDRESS_88047] of missing and spurious data:  
• Using complete case data (i.e. observed data only) on the ITT population  
• Using last observation carried forward (LOCF) on the ITT population  
• Multiple imputation under missing at random assumption with Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo  (MCMC) techniques on the ITT population  
• Using complete case data on the PP population.  
No imputation will be used for safety endpoints. 
10.4.4 Multiplicity Consideration  
Common factors for multiplicity are multiple  arms and multiple endpoints. 
1) Multiple arms 
The primary treatment comparison will be between the  K -161  treatment arm 
and the vehicle  treatment arm.  
  
2) Multiple endpoints 
The primary and important secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically to maintain 
the study -wise Type I error rate of 0.05. First, change from baseline in inferior corneal 
fluorescein staining will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05. The test for cha nge from 
baseline scores in the ODS will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_88048] for change from baseline in Schirmer’s 
test will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_88049] for change  from baseline in TFBUT will be conducted at an alpha 

K-161 Sponsor:  Kowa Research Institute (KRI)  
Clinical Trial Protocol No.: K -161-2.01US   
Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_88050]  demonstrates  significance.   
The hierarchical testing order will be as follows: 
Primary comparisons:  
1. Comparison of the change from baseline in post -CAE inferior corneal staining at 
Day 29 (  K-161  ) 
2. Comparison of the change from baseline in post-CAE ocular discomfort a t Day 29 
(  K-161   
Important Secondary comparisons: 
3. Comparison of the change from baseline in pre -CAE Schirmer’s test value at Day 
29 (  K- 161 ) 
4. Comparison of the change from baseline in post -CAE TFBUT at Day 29 (  
K-161 ) 
Thus, the study -wise Type I error rate will be maintained at 0.[ADDRESS_88051]- CAE inferior corneal staining 
and ocular discomfort between the  K-161  group and the vehicle group at Day 
29, will be performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. The respective baseline post- CAE score will be included as a covariate in each model and site will be 
included as a fixed effect. Treatment by [CONTACT_80698], if significant, analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_80686]/or site, respectively, to further examine significant interactions. In addition, unadjusted two- sample t -tests and Wilcoxon rank- sum tests will be performed 
for each comparison as sensitivity analyses. The primary analyses will use the I TT 
population. 
For the primary endpoints, multiple imputation with MCMC techniques will be used. 
Imputation will be performed by [CONTACT_80699] 29 scores. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary analyses 
on the ITT population. Continuous and ordinal variables collected at each visit will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum), and analyzed with ANCOVA models and two -sample  two-sided t- tests 
comparing  each  K-[ADDRESS_88052]-
CAE within each visit. Data collected during the CAE will also be analyzed using 

K-161 Sponsor:  Kowa Research Institute (KRI)  
Clinical Trial Protocol No.: K -161-2.01US   
Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_88053] diary symptom data will be analyzed using each weekly average score from the 
diaries, as well as using repeated measures models across the diary collection period.   
For the two important secondary endpoints, other secondary, and exploratory endpoint s, 
multiple imputation with MCMC techniques  will be used. Imputation will be performed 
by [CONTACT_80699] 29 scores.  
 
 
 
10.4.6 Safety Variables 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious 
TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_29974] ; by [CONTACT_6657] ; by [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term and maximal severity ; by [CONTACT_80687] -
related TEAEs;  and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and study day of onset. 
Separate summaries will be performed for ocular and non-ocular AEs.

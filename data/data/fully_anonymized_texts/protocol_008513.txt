Study Rationale  
 
Pancreas Cancer. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_677004] 3% of cancer incidence in the U.S. population , 
pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was the 4th lead ing cause of cancer death in U.S.  in 2012.1  
A successful , microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_580269] -negative R0 operation is the only potentially  curative option for 
patients with PDAC.  However,  only 20% of patients with this condition present with early stage 
disease amenable to curative resection. Even then, the 5 -year overall survival rate after curative 
resection is approximately  20%.2  Thus, the overall 5 -year survival rate for PDAC is 5- 8%.   
 
Surgery.   Patients who are candidates for potentially R0 resections are now divided into two 
categories: “resectable” (R) or “borderline resectable” (BR).  Maurer et al first used the adjective 
“borderl ine” to describe PDACs that were between classically resectable and unresectable because 
of clear vascular invasion into critical arteries and veins.3   The clinical definition of borderline 
resectable pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma (BR -PDAC) has been larg ely based on multidetector 
computed tomography (CT).4  There is general agreement that the prognosis of BR -PDAC will be 
inferior to patients with resectable pancrea s ductal adenocarcinoma (R -PDAC).5  Unfortunately , BR-
PDAC patients present more often than patients with classically R -PDAC.  While the definition of BR -
PDAC has been debated, for the purposes of this protocol, the 2014 NCCN guidelines will be utilized 
(see Eligibility Criteria).  
 
Adjuvant Therapy.  Postoperative gemcitabine or 5 -Fluorouracil (5FU) improves the survival by a 
meager 10% after an R0 resection for patients with PDAC.6 Unfortunately , approximately 25% of 
patients do not receive any form of adjuvant treatment due to post -operative complications and/or 
poor performance status.  Moreover, 25% of patients who undergo curative surgery for resectable 
disease will experience rapid progression , which is  a reflection of its aggressive tumor biology.  In 
this situation, these patients will not benefit from the extensive s urgery for resection of their tumor.  
 
Neoadjuvant Therapy.  Neoadjuvant therapy offers advantages in the treatment paradigm of PDAC . 
The probability of delivering therapy prior to surgery is higher compared to initiation of adjuvant 
treatment. In a well -selected population, 90 -100% of patients were able to complete the entire course 
of planned neoadjuvant treatment.[ADDRESS_915893] recently supplanted single -
agent gemcitabine in the treatment  of patients with stage IV PDAC.  FOLFIRINOX, a three drug 
combination with 5FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin improved survival for stage IV PDAC with performance status (PS) 0- [ADDRESS_915894] clinicians reserve this combination for 
patients younger than 70.  The combination of gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  demonstrated a 
remarkably high response rate in association in prolonged median surviva l of 12.2 months in the 
phase II study .11 Interestingly, stromal SPARC was associated with longer OS when treated with this 
combination in the phase II trial  (n=36).   Analysis of the subsequent phase III MPACT for stage IV 
PDAC patients with PS 0- 2 demonstrated a response rate  for gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  of 23% 
with significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) compared to gemcitabine alone (8.5 versus 6.7 months).

was comprised primarily of metastatic tissue with onl y 11% of the samples from pancreatic lesions.[ADDRESS_915897] undergone an R1 or R0 patients is testing 6 cycles of gemcitabine alone versus 5 cycles of gemcitabine plus conventional radiation therapy.  
Conventional radiation therapy employs a relatively large field and treats pati ents to 5040 cGy over 
five weeks.
14  The development of advanced imaging techniques has allowed for compensation for 
organ movement associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  The administration of stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) to extracranial organs is now  feasible due to these advancements.[ADDRESS_915898] introduced multiple fractionation of dosing as well as decreasing the total 
administered dose.  Systemic chemotherapy has also been added to SBRT in an attempt to augment 
the survival benefit as sociated with SBRT.  Chuong et al. introduced the concept of dose -painting to 
SBRT.16  This strategy treats the tumor abutting the vessel with a higher dose (35 -50 Gy) with the 
remainder of the tumor receiving 25 -30 Gy over 5 fractions.  This SBRT strategy  administered after 
neoadjuvant gemcitabine, taxotere and capecitabine in patients with borderline resectable tumors resulted in a 77% treatment response rate. The addition of [ADDRESS_915899] SBRT of 24 -
36 Gy administered in 3 fractions resulted in a local control rate of 78% with low frequency of GI 
toxicity (14% grade 3) and a median survival of 14.3 months.  Although SBRT has not been 
prospectively investigated in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy for PDAC   SBRT has been shown to 
safely facilitate margin -negative resection in patients with borderline resectable disease (96.9%) 
while maintaining high rate of local disease control in unresectable patients (1 -year local control 
81%).
16 
 
Treatment Strategy.  This protocol will evaluate the utili ty of perioperative  therapy for patients with 
both R -PDAC and BR -PDAC , as two independent patient cohorts.  Patients will receive 3 cycles of 
neoadjuvant  gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  (Nab-paclitaxel®) chemotherapy and stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT)  administered sequentially  prior to definitive surgery followed by [CONTACT_33018] [ADDRESS_915900] led to conflicting reports.   Attemp ts to link intratumoral SPARC 
evaluation with response to nab- paclitaxel  (Nab-paclitaxel ®) have been inconsistent  as well .   
Recently, Commisso et al published data demonstrating a role for the degree of  “macropi[INVESTIGATOR_103009]” 
in KRAS -mutated cells, which may explain the efficacy nab- paclitaxel  in KRAS mutant PDAC.

 SMAD4: The loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 (also known as deletion in 
pancreas cancer 4 (DPC4)), occurs as a late event 50% of pancreas adenocarcinomas.  SMAD4

forms a protein complex with receptor -specific SMADs to promote signal transduction  of the 
transforming growth factor -b (TGF -b) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways.18,19  The 
loss of function of S MAD for occurs by a combination of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or intragenic 
mutation.20,[ADDRESS_915901], an analysis of site of disease at the time of death utilizing a rapid 
autopsy program demonstrated the 70% of patients will die of distant  metastasis, whilst 30% die of 
complications of locally aggressive disease.  Seventy -five percent of patients with distant metastases 
harbored SMAD4 deletion analyzed by [CONTACT_677110] 22% of patients with local disease possessed a SMAD4 dele tion.
25 A prospective evaluation of the predictive nature of SMAD4 
deletion in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy is yet to be completed.  
 
Circulating DNA Analysis of KRAS:  Mutations in KRAS is the most common genetic  abnormality 
found in pancrea s adenocarcinoma tumors, occurring in upward of 95%.26  KRAS is one of three 
human RAS genes (HRAS, NRAS and KRAS).  These are 21 k -Da small GTPases that function to 
transduce receptor mediated signal s to activate the mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAP kinase, 
MAPK) pathway, amongst others.27  Mutated KRAS proteins in pancreas cancer are a result of one 
of three single point mutations at residues G12, G13 and Q61.  Oncogenic substitutions at G12 and G13 are activating mutations resulting in constitutive ac tivation of Ras, which effectively results in 
receptor- independent stimulation downstream signal -regulating cellular functions such as increased 
proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, altered metabolism, metastasis and alterations of the tumor microenvir onment.
28  Q61 point mutations interfere with GTP hydrolysis.29  Recently it has been 
demonstrated that circulating DNA found in the peripheral blood possess representative genetic 
abnormalities originating from tumor DNA.30  These cell -free fragments of DNA (cfDNA) are shed into 
the bloodstream by [CONTACT_677111] -free DNA 
correlates with tumor staging and prognosis.31 Techniques such as digital polymerase chain reaction, 
beads, emulsion, amplification and magnetics (BEAMing) or pryrophosphorylsis -activated 
polymerization (PAP) now allow for the enumeration of rare mutant variants in complex DNA 
mixtures.32-[ADDRESS_915902] to assess therapeutic response to therapy.  Since all 
patients will be undergoing surgical resection of their pancreas tumor, a comparison between levels of KRAS mutation in circulating DNA with the primary tumor will be possible to assess the concordance between alterations in circulating DNA KRAS frequency with pathologic response to 
therapy.  
 Gene Expression and Mutational Analysis :  Next generation sequencing allows for increased base 
coverage of a DNA sequence, as well as higher sample throughput.  This technique also allows for the sequencing of RNA transcripts, which facilitates the evaluation of alternative gene splicing, post -
transcriptional modification, gene fusions and mutations.  Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) can be 
utilized to analyze the resultant RNA -Seq data to allow for interpretation of the data in terms of genetic 
pathways.  RNA -Seq will be performed from primary tum or samples obtained at baseline, completion

SPARC:  Secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is frequently overexpressed in PDAC.  
SPARC both positively and negatively effects tumor growth properties.  Data shows that SPARC 
inhibit s angiogenesis by [CONTACT_677112] (VEGF) function; whilst, 
promoting epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion through altering matrix 
metalloprotease expression.36,[ADDRESS_915904] of nab- paclitaxel ’s effect with

 Stromal Elasticity:  Pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by [CONTACT_677114].  The stroma functions to support the growth of the malignant pancreas cells.  
The dense stromal compartment results in an increase in intratumoral turgor p ressure, which in turn 
collapses the tumor vasculature.  This phenomenon impairs the intratumoral pharmacokinetic 
properties of chemotherapy.  It has recently been demonstrated that the combination of gemcitabine 
and nab- paclitaxel denude the desmoplastic stroma resulting in increased intratumoral vasculature 
patency to promote increased chemotherapy intratumoral penetration.
11  The dynamic change in the 
stroma architecture can be measured both by [CONTACT_677115] (EUS).  Alvarez et al have utilized immunohistochemical analysis of type I 
collagen to demonstrate that nab- paclitaxel induces a reduced stromal content by [CONTACT_677116].43  Concordantly they 
observed a decrease in tumor stiffness (increased tumor elasticity) as measured by  [CONTACT_677117] -paclitaxel.

The study is designed as a multi -institutional, open -label phase II trial  to obtain safety and preliminary 
efficacy data for a new peri -operative treatment regimen consisting of neoadjuvant gemcitabine and 
nab- paclitaxel  combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a sequential manner 
followed by [CONTACT_677118] R -PDAC  (20 patients) or BR-PDAC  (30 patients). Neoadjuvant 
therapy will consist of [ADDRESS_915907] after completion of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy will subsequently  receive SBRT followed by [CONTACT_677119].  Adjuvant  
therapy consisting of 3 cycles of  gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  will be administered to patients 
without evidence of metastatic disease , Figure 1.  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab- paclitaxel  125 
mg/m2 will be administered intravenously on days 1, [ADDRESS_915908] 21 
days  and no longer than 35 days after completion of the 3 cycles of neoadjuvant combination 
chemotherapy.   Ideal administration of SBRT will between 21 and 28 days after completion of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
 Resectable Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma.  R-PDAC  is defined as having no evidence of 
distant metastasis and tumor mass showing no extension to super ior mesenteric artery (SMA) and

Statistical Analysis:  
 
Statistical Rationale:  
 This Phase II study is designed to test the feasibility and safety of a new preoperative regimen for 
patients with R -PDAC and BR -PDAC.  The primary objective of the trial is to estimate the rate of R0 
resections.  All patients entered into each cohort will be included in the estimates of R0 res ection 
rates (intent to treat) and progression -free survival, Overall surviva l will also be summarized. Specific 
molecular p roperties of the patient’s tumor that are thought to relate to therapeutic efficacy will be 
analyzed and correlated with clinical outcomes . The trial will also be monitored for grade III/IV 
hematologic toxicity.  
 
Assumptions: In the R -PDAC cohort, the trial will be considered to be successful  if 81.6% or greater 
of R-PDAC patients entered  on the trial have R0 resections; for the BR -PDAC cohort, the trial will be 
considered successful if R0 resection rate for this group of patients is ≥ 42% . See sample size and 
study design below. Target designs are Simon two-stage optimal phase II designs with 80% power 
and alpha of 0.05.   
 Primary Analysis:  
The primary endpoint is the e xact 95% confidence intervals for each cohort R0 resection rates  by 
[CONTACT_677121]. Secondary endpoints include Kaplan Meier curves for PFS  and overall survival by [CONTACT_9084].   
Changes over time in biologic correlates using mixed effects models within and across cohorts to take into account incomplete longitudinal data.  
 
Sample Size:  
R-PDAC: [ADDRESS_915912] the null hypothesis 
that the rate of R0 resection rate is ≤50% versus the alternative that the R0 resection rate is ≥81.6%. 
If the regimen is not effective, there is a 2% probabil ity of concluding that it is (target  =0.05).
 If the

regimen is actually effective, there is a 15% probability  of concluding  that it is not (target power = 
80%).  Based on this 2- stage design, if the regimen is tested on [ADDRESS_915913] stage . With a total 
of 20 patients, the regimen would be accepted for further study if 15 or more R0 resections are 
observed in the total group of 20 patients.  
 
BR-PDAC: [ADDRESS_915914] the null 
hypothesis that the R0 resection rate is ≤20% versus the alternative that the R0 resection rate is ≥  
42%, if the regimen is not effective there is a 0.05 probabili ty of concluding that it is (target α=0.05). 
If the regimen is actually effecti ve, there is a 20% probability  of concluding that it is not (power = 
91%, target power =80%).  Based on this [ADDRESS_915915] stage, if 3 or fewer patient s go on to R0 resection, the trial will be terminated. With a total of 
30 patients, the regimen would be accepted for further study if  or more R0 resections are observed in the total group of 30 patients.

1.0     BACKGROUND 
1.1     Pancreas Adenocarcinoma  
 
Background.  Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA C) remains a devastating disease.  
Unfortunately  upwards of 80% to 85% of patients diagnosed with this disease will have unresectable 
advanced disease at diagnosis.[ADDRESS_915928] majority of patients from receiving the only 
curative therapy of surgical resection.  Only approximately 20% of patients are candidates for resection 
of the cancer.  Approximately eighty percent of patients that undergo surgical resection for this disease 
will develop disease recurrence .2  As a result, the overall survival rate for this disease is less than 5% 
for all patients diagnosed with pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma.  In recent years, there has been a significant improvement  in the understanding of the genetics and biology of this disease.  It is estimated 
that PDA C develops over a [ADDRESS_915929] 2 to 3 years 
of the disease natural history.
46  Furthermore, there appears to be central founder mutations that are 
common to all foci of PDA C whereas, passenger mutations appear to be differentiate d by [CONTACT_677124].  Additional work demonstrates that pancreas cancer metastasis occurs as an early event in oncogenesis.
47  These results may underpin the clinical observation in some patients who develop 
distant disease early after surgical resection of the primary tumor.  It also suggests that the majority of patients with resectable locally advanced disease  possess a  subclinical systemic component of their 
disease that is not treated by [CONTACT_78043].   These are some of the factors that may account for 
the overall poor long -term survival associated with surgical resection of the disease.   
 
Surgery.   Surgical resection of PDAC is a technically challenging surgery that is associated with a 
high rate of morbidity and mortality in inexperienced centers.
48  However, i n centers performing a large 
volume of these surgical procedures the surgery -related mortality rate is less than 3% , although 
complication remains a reality for a proportion of patients. Surgical resection for this disease can be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_677125] . The approach to resect the pancreas  head involves a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple 
Procedure) in which the head of the pancreas along with the tumor, the common bile duct 
(choledochectomy), gall bladder and cystic duct (cholecystectomy), duodenum, proximal jejunum and regional lymph nodes  are resected.  Reconstructive surgery  then follows, consisting  of 
pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy and a gastrojejunostomy.  These procedures allow  the 
digestive juices, bile and food to reach the gastrointestinal tract.   This procedure has bee n modified in 
several ways over the course of time to include a pylorous sparing procedure as well of the introduction 
of minimally invasive techniques such as a laparoscopic approach or the implementation of robotic assistance.  PDAC  involving the body an d tail of the pancreas generally are approached with a distal 
pancreatectomy with splenectomy.  A small minority of patients will undergo a total pancreatectomy to 
resect a pancreas tumor.   
 
The complexity of the surgical approach as well as the peri- pancreatic anatomy requires a deliberate  
approach to identify patients that may be surgical candidates.  Resectable PDAC  is defined as 
patients having no evidence of distant metastasis and tumor mass showing no extension to superior 
mesenteric artery (SMA) and hepatic artery. There must be a clear ly defined  fat plane between SMA 
and celiac axis.  A patent superior mesenteric vein (SMV) / portal vein (PV) individually or at the 
SMV/PV confluence wit h no distortion of venous architecture is an additional requirement .  Locally 
advanced disease is characterized as either Borderline Resectable  PDAC  or Unresectable  PDAC .  
The importance of this designation is that patient s with BR-PDAC  are treated on a curative  intent  
paradigm with possibility of undergoing surgical resection in conjunction with perioperative therapy, whilst those deemed unresectable are destined for palliative therapy.  The definition of true borderline resectable dise ase remains controversial.  Katz et al published a definition to be incorporated into 
clinical trial standardization that has been adopted by [CONTACT_677126][INVESTIGATOR_799] (Alliance A021101) as 
well as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)  Pancreat ic Cancer Guidelines  of 2014.

In this protocol, BR-PDAC  is defined as localized PDAC with 1 or more of the following features: a) an 
interface between the primary tumor and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) -portal vein (PV) measuring 
180o or greater  of the circumference of the vein wall, and/or b) short -segment occlusion of the SMV -
PV with normal vein above and below the level of obstruction that is amenable to resection and venous 
reconstruction and/or c) short -segment interface of any degree betwee n tumor and hepatic artery with 
normal artery proximal and distal to the interface that is amenable to resect ion and arterial 
reconstruction  and/or d) an interface between the tumor and SMA or celiac trunk measuring less than 
180o of the circumference of the artery wall. The goal of surgical resection for this disease is to achieve 
R0 resection without any evidence of microscopic disease involving the surgical margins.  The natural 
history of the disease requires that all fit patients receive perioperative therapy; however, the 
appropriate perioperative remains controversial at this time  and remains an  active area of 
investigation.   Central radiologic review by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alex Megibow at [LOCATION_001] University will be used to 
determine the eligibility and stratification of identified patients for study participation.  
 
Perioperative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   The primary controversial issues regarding perioperative therapy for 
pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma revolve around the timing of initiation of said therapy as well as 
defining the appropriate therapeutic modalities to be utilized in this setting.  Some groups have 
advocated for adjuvant therapy, whilst others have supported the use of neoadjuvant therapy.  The 
historical benefit of adjuvant therapy has been the removal of the tumor at an early stage in the 
absence of distant metastases and at a time when the patient is likely to be at an ultimate fitness level 
to withstand the surgery -associated morbidity.  Unfortunately, the enthusiasm for this approach has 
waned of late due to the high rate of both local and distant recurrence.  In contrast, neoadjuvant therapy 
affords the opportunity administer systemic therapy early in the treatment paradigm after identif ication 
of the primary tumors.  Additionally, neoadjuvant therapy can identify those patients that would not 
benefit from surgical resection due to rapid disease recurrence.  Indeed, a pproximately 30% to 40% 
of patients who initiate neoadjuvant therapy with the serial administration of chemotherapy and 
chemo radiation therapy discontinue therapy prior to surgical resection.[ADDRESS_915930] -of-care for this disease since a randomized trial demonstrated a n overall  survival benefit over 
5-fluorouracil  (5-FU) in patients with metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma .51   Postoperative adjuvant 
therapy with chem otherapy alone has been shown to improve overall survival.  The Charite Onkologie 
Clinical (CONKO -001) trial evaluated 6 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine versus observation, 
demonstrating favorable associated survival of 22.8 months in comparison to 20.2 mon ths in the 
observation arm.52  The long -term results of this trial demonstrate persistent benefit for chemotherapy 
with a 5 -year overall survival of 20.7% compared to 10.4% for patients not receiving adjuvant therapy.[ADDRESS_915931] demonstrated improved overall survival in comparison to gemcitabine in the metastatic 
disease setting.  Both t he combination  of infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, irinote can and oxaliplatin 
(FOLFIRINOX) as well as  the combination of gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  (Abraxane/ Nab-
paclitaxel ®) have demonstrated an improved median overall survival over gemcitabine of 11.7 and 8.5

and 28%, respectively associated with FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine combined with nab- paclitaxel  
relative to gemcitabine.  Importantly when conside ring perioperative therapy, both regimens were 
associated with clinically significantly improved response rates and disease control rates in comparison to gemcitabine in the metastatic setting. Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677009] s ignificant toxicities of bone marrow suppression and neuropathy , as well as GI toxicity 
and dehydration associated with FOLFIRINOX.  As a result, it is incumbent upon clinical researche rs 
to demonstrate the safety of these regimens in the perioperative setting for the treatment of potentially curable PDAC .  The results of these clinical trials set the stage for the incorporation of effective 
combination chemotherapy into the perioperative  setting for the management of PDAC . 
 In this trial, we have selected gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel as the perioperative systemic regimen.  
This doublet is generally well tolerated initially with cumulative bone marrow and neurotoxicity as the 
usual dose -limiting toxicities.  Gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel can be administered to patients over 70 
with less initial concern and less initial dose modification than FOLFIRINOX.  The lead P rincipal 
Investigator (PI) at University of Colorado and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_677010] (see below) and have found the regimen safe.  Finally, our 
interest in potential molecular biomarkers such as SPARC and macropi[INVESTIGATOR_677011]- paclitaxel as more compelling in the perioperative setting.   
 
 
1.2    Radiation Therapy for Pancreas Cancer 
 
1.2.1 Chemoradiation Therapy  (CRT) 
 
The role of conventional combined chemotherapy and radiation (chemoradiation therapy, CRT) in the 
treatment of pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma remains controversial.  Support for this therapeutic 
modality in the adjuvant setting was initially demonstrated in 1985 by [CONTACT_389833] (GITSG).
14  A total of 43 patients were randomized to receive adjuvant chemoradiation with split 
course radiation and 5FU compared to observation.  Patients receiving CRT had a median survival 
rate of 20 months compared to 11 months for those in observation.  This was also associated with an 
improved 2 -year survival of 42% versus 15% for those receiving C RT.  The role of conventional CRT 
was further evaluated in the European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer -1 (ESPAC -1) trial used a [ADDRESS_915933] evaluated the role of adjuvant CRT in pancreas cancer therapy.  The 
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial RTOG 9704 explored the role of adding systemic chemotherapy to CRT.
55  All patients received conventional external beam radiation therapy to 50.4 
Gy combined with 5FU 250 mg/m2 per day.  Subsequently, p atients were randomize to receive either 
5FU or gemcitabine for one cycle prior to CRT and followed with [ADDRESS_915934] pat ients developi[INVESTIGATOR_677012].

1.2.2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) 
 
The development of advanced imaging techniques has allowed for compensation for organ movement 
associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  The administration of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to 
extracranial organs is now feasible due to these advancements.  The early use of SBRT for the treatment of pancreas cancer utilized the administration of a single fraction of high dose radiation of 20-25 G y.
57  This was associated with a marginal survival benefit and delayed gastrointestinal toxicity.  
Work by a number of investigators has now demonstrated that several dosimetric parameters are 
predictive of toxicity including V 15 (volume receiving 15 Gy or greater) > 9.1 cc, V 20 > 3.3 cc and V 25 > 
20 cc correlating with a 50% chance of intestinal toxicity.15  D max (Maximum dose received) D max of 35 
Gy and 38 Gy correlated with 5% and 10% rate of at least grade [ADDRESS_915935] SBRT of 24 -36 Gy administered in 3 fractions resulted in 
a local control rate of 78% with low frequency of GI toxicity (14% grade 3) and a median survival of 14.3 months.
58  The use of neoadjuvant gemcitabine for 2 cycles followed by [CONTACT_677128] a local 
control rate of 85% and a median survival of [ADDRESS_915936].  The subsequent cycles of gemcitabine 
were administered  without delay.  No grade 3 toxicities were observed with this strategy; thereb y, 
demonstrating that a delay  is not required between chemotherapy administration and SBRT.  Chuong 
et al introduced the concep t of dose -painting to SBRT.
16  This strategy treats the tumor abutting the 
vessel with a higher dose (35 -50 Gy) with the remainder of the tumor receiving 25 -30 Gy over 5 
fractions.  This SBRT strategy administered after neoadjuvant gemcitabi ne, taxotere and capecitabine 
for patients with BR-PDAC  resulted in a 77% treatment response rate.  Ninety -seven percent of 
patients undergoing surgical resection attained an R0 resection with a pathologic complete response occurring 9% of patients.  Patients completing surgical resection had a median survival of 19.[ADDRESS_915937] in terms of toxicity and efficacy of combining SBRT with modern combination 
chemotherapy in the perioperative setting for R -PDAC and BR -PDAC on R0 resection rate and survival 
remains to be defined.  
1.3    Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)  
 
1.3.1 Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) – Guided Tissue Acquisition 
 
Endoscopic Ultrasound - Guided Tissue Acquisition  (EUS -TA) by [CONTACT_123494] -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (EUS -FNA) 
and fine- needle biopsy ( EUS- FNB) has become an integral to the diagnosis and staging of 
gastrointestinal malignancies.60  The  common indications for EUS -TA include diagnosis and staging

of pancreaticobiliary, esophageal, gastric and rectal malignancies along with evaluation of GI 
subepi[INVESTIGATOR_677013].  The ideal EUS -TA technique needs to be safe, accurate 
and achieve a high diagnostic yield (DY).   
 
The key relevant outcomes of EUS -TA include specimen adequacy, DY, accuracy, and adverse 
events. There are several limitations and technical challenges associated with this procedure. Low DY 
(false -negative diagnoses) is the most important pi[INVESTIGATOR_677014].  A recent review reported a false -negative diagnoses rate of 
4-45% in solid pancreatic masses, 21 -53% in pancreatic cystic neoplasms, and 6 -14% in lymph 
nodes.61  This usually is a result of sam pling errors [related to improper EUS -TA, errors in image 
recognition, experience of the endosonographer (ES) and lesion characteristics].60-[ADDRESS_915938] evaluation (OCE) during the procedure 
and the skill and experience of the ES and the cytopathologist.  
 A recent review of the literature by [CONTACT_677129] -TA to optimize 
EUS- TA for tissue acquisition has identified the following parameters to optimize the safety, accuracy 
and diagnostic yield of the procedures:  the rout ine use of a stylet during EUS -FNA; t he use of suction 
during EUS -FNA of a pancreas mass; t he use of a 25 -g needle is associated with a higher DY 
compared to 22 -g needle in patients undergoing EUS -FNA of pancreas mass; the high- definition FNB 
needle (Echo Tip Procure™) is highly effective for acquisition of core specimens; the routine use of 
the “capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]” technique is preferable to standard suction and should be utilized for EUS -FNB for 
histologic specimens.   This study will employ these parameters to op timally and safely administer 
repetitive EUS -TA to assess the dynamic change in tissue specific biomarkers to correlate with clinical 
outcome.
 
 
1.3.2 Endoscopic Elastography 
 Endoscopic elastography has been developed as a noninvasive method  to characterize pancreas 
masses of benign and malignant etiologies.  This technique utilizes real -time assessment of the tissue 
elasticity distribution calculation with subsequent representation in fundamental B- mode imagining.  
An Elastography Score rang ing from 1 to 5 is assigned to the pancreas masses.  Score 1 is a 
homogeneous soft mass (green) associated with normal pancreas.  Score 2 remains a soft (green, 
yellow or red) mass that has become heterogeneic corresponding to fibrosis.  Score [ADDRESS_915939] (blue) with minimal heterogenicity that correspond to small early pancreas adenocarcinoma (< 
25mm).  Score [ADDRESS_915940] (blue) 
tissue, corresponding with hypervascular lesion such neuroendo crine tumor or pancreas metastasis.  
Score 5 is associated with advanced pancreas adenocarcinoma are primarily blue with a soft tissue 
(green, red) core.   Dynamic changes in elastography characteristics of a pancreas may represent a 
novel modality to asse ss tumor response to therapy.  Indeed Alvarez et al have now demonstrated 
that increased elasticity (decrease tumor stiffness) is associate d with response to combination 
gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  chemotherapy.  This trial will gather preliminary data on the effects of 
preoperative chemotherapy on the Elastography Score on a cohort  patients enrolled in the trial.

the role “macropi[INVESTIGATOR_103009]” in KRAS -mutated cells, which may explain the efficacy nab -paclitaxel in 
KRAS mutant PDAC.17 
 
SMAD4: The loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene S MAD4 (also known as Deletion in 
Pancreas Cancer 4 (DPC4)), occurs as a late event 50% of PDACs .  SMAD4 forms a protein complex 
with receptor -specific SMADs to promote signal transduction of the transforming growth factor -b (TGF -
b) and bone morphogenetic pr otein (BMP) pathways.18,19  The loss of function of SMA D4 occurs either 
by a combination of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or intragenic mutation.20,[ADDRESS_915942], an analysis of 
site of disease at the time of death utilizing a rapid autopsy program demonstrated the 70% of patients 
will die of distant metastasis, whilst 30% die of complications of locally aggressive disease.  Seventy -
five percent of p atients with distant metastases harbored SMAD4 deletion analyzed by [CONTACT_677130] 22% of patients with local disease possessed a SMAD4 deletion.25  A prospective 
evaluation of the predictive nature of SMAD4 deletion in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy is yet 
to be completed.   Hence, we will evaluate the basal and dynamic SMAD4 loss of function in tumors of 
patients.  
 Circulating DNA Analysis of KRAS:  Mutations in KRAS is the most common genetic abnormality 
found pancreas adenocarcinoma  tumors, occurring in upward of 95%.
26  KRAS is one of three human 
RAS genes (HRAS, NRAS and KRAS).  These are 21 k -Da small GTPases that function to tranduce 
receptor mediated signals to activate the mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAP kinase, MAPK) 
pathway, amongst others.27  Mutated KRAS proteins in pancreas cancer are a result of one of three 
single point mutations at residues G12, G13 and Q61.  Oncogenic substitutions at G12 and G13 are 
activating mutations resulting in constitutive activation of Ras , which effectively results in receptor -
independent stimulation downstream signal -regulating cellular functions such as increased 
proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, altered metabolism, metastasis and alterations of the tumor microenvironment.
28  Q61 point mutations interfere with GTP hydrolysis.29  Recently it has been 
demonstrated that circulating DNA found in the peripheral blood possess representative genetic 
abnormalities originating from tumor DNA.30  These cell -free fragments of DNA (cfDNA) are shed into 
the bloodstream by [CONTACT_677111] -free DNA 
correlates with tumor staging and prognosis.31 Techniques such as digital polymerase chain reaction, 
beads, emulsion, amplification and magnetics (BEAMing) or pryrophosphorylsis -activated 
polymerization (PAP) now allow for the enumeration of rare mutant variants in complex DNA 
mixtures.32-[ADDRESS_915943] to assess therapeutic response to therapy.  Since all patients will be undergoing surgical resection of their pancreas tumor, a comparison between levels of KRAS mutation 
in circulating DNA with the primary tumor will be possible to assess the concordance between 
alterations in circulating DNA KRAS frequency with pathologic response to therapy.  
 Gene Expression and Mutational Analysis :  Next generation sequencing allows for increased base 
coverage of a DNA sequence, as well as higher sample throughput.  This technique also allows for

utilized to analyze the resultant RNA -Seq data to allow for interpretation of the data in terms of ge netic 
pathways.  RNA -Seq will be performed from primary tumor samples obtained at baseline, completion 
of chemotherapy as well as from the resected tumor.[ADDRESS_915945] to clinical outcomes of pathologic response and survival 
estimates.   
 
SPARC:  Secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is frequently overexpressed in PDAC.  
SPARC both positively and negatively effects tumor growth properties.  It has been shown to inhibit 
angiogenesis by [CONTACT_677112] (VEG F) function whilst, promoting  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion through altering matrix metalloprotease 
expression.36,[ADDRESS_915946] with the former

 Stromal Elasticity:  Pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by [CONTACT_677131].  The stroma functions to support the growth of the malignant pancreas cells.  
The dense stromal compartment results in an increase in intratumoral turgor pressure, which in turn 
collapses the tumor vasculature.  This phenomenon impairs the intratumoral pharmacokinetic properties of chemotherapy.  It has recently been demonstrated that the combination of gemcitabine 
and nab -paclitaxel denude the desmoplastic stroma resulting in increased intratumoral vasculature 
patency to promote increased chemotherapy intratumoral penetration.
11  The dynamic change in the 
stroma architecture can be measured both by [CONTACT_677132] (EUS).  Alvarez et al have utilized immunohistochemical analysis of type I collagen to 
demonstrate that nab- paclitaxel induces a reduced stromal content by [CONTACT_677133].43  Concordantly they observed a 
decrease in tumor stiffness (increased tumor elasticity) as measured by  [CONTACT_677134] -paclitaxel.

4.3    Rules for Dose Omission and Schedule Modification  
 
Day 1 dose  missed:  
 
If the dose held or missed was to be given on Day  [ADDRESS_915963] dose is actually  administered to the patient (i .e., 1-2-3- Rest,  
X-1-2-3- Rest, etc .).  
 
Day 8 dose is missed:  
 Cycle continues per protocol, with one dose not given (i .e., 1-2-3- Rest, 1-X-3- Rest,  1-2-3- Rest,  etc.).   
Day 8 is administered as per cycle calendar if counts and chemistries permit.   NOTE:  The same applies 
to any  intracycle dose of Cycle 1 of gemcitabine single agent (Days 8,  15, 22, 29, 36, 43): the cycle 
continues with  1 dose not given.  
 
Day 15 dose missed:  
 
That week becomes the week of rest.  Next dose (if counts and chemistries permit) becomes  Day  [ADDRESS_915964] had a x2q3 (21-day) cycle  (i.e., 1-2-3- Rest,  1-2- X, 
1-2-3- Rest, etc .). 
 
NOTE: The  maximum delay  between a missed scheduled dose and the next one (whichever dose was  
missed) should not be longer than  14 days (except for peripheral  neuropathy; see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_915965] degree of toxicity.   Toxicities will be graded  using the NCI  CTCAE  
Version 4 .0. 
Two levels of dose modifications are permitted according to the criteria below.   If a toxicity  requiring  
dose modification occurs following  the second dose reduction of eit her study drug,  further treatment 
should be discontinued.   Any further dose modification  requires prior Celgene  approval.

toxicity, respectively.  Please  refer to Table  5 and Table  6 for specific recommendations  regarding  dose 
modifications  within  a cycle  for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, respectively. 
B.     A maximum of  2 dose level reductions  are allowed.  
 
 
Patients experiencing  study drug- related toxicities  that require a delay in scheduled nab-
paclitaxel or gemcitabine  dosing for 21 days will be discontinued  from further  treatment in this 
study (except for peripheral neuropathy;  see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). When  a dose reduction  is 
required,  no dose re- escalation  will be permitted for the duration of study treatment  (with the 
exception mentioned  in Table  5, namely: on Day 15, re-escalation  with granulocyte -colony  
stimulating  factor (G-CSF) support is permitted,  after a previous dose reduction on Day 8 of 
the same cycle).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications at Day 1 
 
In the event dose modifications are required  at the beginning of a cycle  due to AEs or  hematologic  
toxicities, doses of nab- paclitaxel  and gemcitabine may be adjusted as detailed  in Table 3 and Table

B. If patients do not experience  resolution  of neutropenia  within  21 days,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_677019] G- CSF  treatment,  study 
treatment  will be discontinued.  
C. Febrile patients (regardless  of neutrophil  count)  should  have their chemotherapy  treatment  interrupted.   A full sepsis 
diagnostic work -up should  be performed while  continuing  broad spectrum  antibiotics.   If cultures are positive,  the antibiotic  
may or may not be changed,  depending  on the sensitivity  profile  of the isolated  organism.   Patients  with persisting  fever  
after  3 weeks,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_677020],  will discontinue  study treatment.   Febrile  neutropenic patients can 
also receive  G-CSF,  in addition  to antibiotic  treatment,  to hasten the resolution  of their febrile  neutropenia  (following  current  
institutional  guidelines).   In all cases,  blood  counts must  have returned  to baseline  levels  before resuming  chemotherapy  
treatment.  
 
Note:   for Gemcitabine  Cycle  1 (of 8 weeks  duration),  intracycle  dose modifications  should  be managed  by [CONTACT_677138],  or reducing  the dose,  at the 
physician’s  discretion  and based on the nature and severity of the hematologic toxicity.   For doses  held,  the criteria  specified  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] should  be fo llowed.  
For dose reductions,  the criteria  specified  for Day 8 gemcitabine  in Table 5 should  be followed.  For subsequent  (weekly  x 3 every  4 weeks)  gemcitabine  
monotherapy  cycles,  Table  5 criteria  for both Days  8 and 15 apply.

C. Pulmonary embolism (a Grade 4 toxicity in the CTCAE tables) if mild or asymptomatic, will be exempt  
  from this  requirement  (please  see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy 
 
Nab-paclitaxel  should be withheld in patients who experience ³ Grade 3 sensory neuropathy.  
Treatment may be resumed at the next lower dose level (see Table 2) in subsequent cycles after the sensory neuropathy improves to £ Grade 1. The time to resolution to Grade £ 1 should be the 
adverse event duration used for adverse event reporting.  In those patients who experience Grade 
4 sensory neuropathy, study drug should be withheld, and treatment resumed at a reduction of 2 dose levels (Dose Level -2; see Table 2) in subsequent cycles after the sensory neuropathy 
improves to £  Grade 1.  Note: the PI [INVESTIGATOR_677021] 3 sensory neuropathy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity Reactions 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions rarely occur.  If they do occur, minor symptoms such as flushing, skin 
reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, hypotension, or tachycardia may require temporary interruption 
of the infusion.  However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea 
requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of study drug administration and aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Patients who experience a severe 
hypersensitivity reactions to nab- paclitaxel  should not be re -challenged . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary Embolism 
 
Asymptomatic  or clinically mild  pulmonary  embolism can be treated with low-molecular -weight  
heparin without interruption of therapy.  Moderate  to severe pulmonary  embolism  will require  
permanent  discontinuation of treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Colony Stimulating Factor Administration 
Colony  stimulating  factors may be given according to institutional  guidelines for the treatment of  
neutropenic  fever or infections  associated with neutropenia and for the prevention of febrile  
neutropenia in patients  with an ANC <500 cells/µL (as per  Table 7).  Patients not experiencing

infection or tumor with a 10% drop in O [ADDRESS_915968] cycle. Compare it to the O 2 saturation level taken at the initial 
visit. 
 
Interstitial pneumonitis has been observed in ~1% during nab -paclitaxel monotherapy and in ~1% 
during combination treatment with nab -paclitaxel and carboplatin.  However, the risk has been higher 
for the combination of nab- paclitaxel with gemcitabine.  Pneumonitis has been reported at a rate of 
4% with the use of nab- paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine.  Monitor patients closely for signs 
and symptoms of pneumonitis.  After ruling out infectious etiology, and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently  discontinue treatment with nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine and promptly 
initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 
 
Prevention, Surveillance and Management of Interstitial Pneumonitis  
 a. Before starting treatment with nab -paclitaxel candidates should be evaluated for familial, 
environmental or occupational exposure to opportunistic pathogens: do not enroll patients 
with a history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, or pulmonary conditions such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivi ty 
pneumonitis or multiple allergies.  
 b. During treatment with nab -paclitaxel epi[INVESTIGATOR_677022]. Radiographic evaluation 
with chest X -rays and computed tomogra phy (CT) scans (normal or high resolution) may be 
indicated to look for infiltrates ground -glass opacities or honeycombing patterns. Pulse 
oximetry and pulmonary function tests can show respi[INVESTIGATOR_510782].  
 c. Infections should be ruled  out with routine microbiological and/or immunologic methods. 
Transbronchial lung biopsy is not recommended, given its limited value and risk of 
pneumothorax and hemorrhage, and should be reserved for cases with unclear etiology.  
 d. Upon a diagnosis of in terstitial pneumonitis nab -paclitaxel should be permanently 
discontinued. After ruling out an infectious etiology, intravenous high -dose corticosteroid 
therapy should be instituted without delay, with appropriate premedication and secondary 
pathogen coverage. Patients with an added immunological component may also require 
immune modulation with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Appropriate ventilation and oxygen support should be used when required.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sepsis 
 
Sepsis has been reported in less than 1% during monotherapy and fatalities attributed to these 
events have been rare. However, the risk was appreciably higher in patients with advanced or 
metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving nab -paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine with a rate of 
5% in pa tients in patients with or without neutr openia receiving nab -paclitaxel combined with 
gemcitabine. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. The increased risk of 
sepsis in the setting of advanced or metastatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine could be managed with prophylactic antibiotic treatment in febrile patients (regardless of neutrophil count) 
and dose reduction, and wi th G-CSF treatment in neutropenic patients.  If a patient becomes febrile 
(regardless of neutrophil count), initi ate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile 
neutropenia, withhold nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500, then

resume treatment at reduced dose levels.  
 
4.4    Concomitant Medications  
 
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti -emetic medications, may be administered at the 
discretion of the PI.  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is allowed.  Erythropoietin and G -
CSF may be administered at the discretion of the PI, consistent with institutional guidelines.  
4.5    Discontinuation  
A patient  may voluntarily discontinue study  participation at any time.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_677023],  at his/her 
discretion discontinue the patient's study participation at any time.   In the event of  discontinuation,  
the patient  should  return to the study  site as soon as feasible to have the EOS  assessments 
performed and the appropriate follow -up evaluations should occur.   Patients  must discontinue 
study treatment  if any of the following  occurs:  
• Progressive disease  with evidence of distant metastasis  as determined by [CONTACT_677139]. CA19 -9 will not be used to determine disease  progression or as a criterion 
for patient  withdrawal  from  the study.   
• Development of toxicity  that is unacceptable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_677024]. 
• Patient  develops  moderate  to severe pulmonary  embolism.  
• Patient  declines to continue therapy  (ie, withdraws  consent).  
• If following  the second  dose reduction there is a recurrence of Grade 4 
neutropenia,  or any other Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity  or non-
myelosuppressive  AE, unless  per the PI [INVESTIGATOR_677025], and after  consultation  with 
the Celgene . 
• Patient  does not experience  resolution  of Grade 4  neutropenia within  21 days, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_14134] G-CSF treatment.  
• Initiation  of other  anticancer  therapy.  
• In the  PI’s judgment, it is in the patient’s best interest to discontinue  the study 
treatment.  
 
Responders and stable disease patients may continue on study  treatment  unless they develop an 
unacceptable toxicity.  
Patients  who discontinue study treatment  secondary to a  laboratory  abnormality  or adverse event  
should be followed  as outlined in  Section  6.10. 
Patients  who discontinue study treatment or active participation  in the study should still  be followed 
up for safety,  disease progression  and OS as described in Section  6.10, Section  6.11, and Section  
6.12, respectively.   Onl y if a patient  withdraws consent for any  further follow -up or contact [CONTACT_677140].

5.0    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  DRUG MANAGEMENT  AND 
ADMINISTRATION 
5.1    Nab-paclitaxel 
 
5.1.1 Packaging, Labeling, and Storage of Study Drug 
 
Availability  
 
Each single -use vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel and approximately 900 mg of human albumin. 
Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel.  
 
Storage and Stability  
 Storage:  Store the v ials in original cartons at 20 º C to 25  ºC (68 ºF to 77  ºF). Retain in the original 
package to protect from bright light.  
 Stability:  Unopened vials of nab- paclitaxel  are stable until the date indicated on the package when 
stored between 20  ºC to 25  ºC (68  ºF to 77  ºF), in the original package. N either freezing nor 
refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product.  
 Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Vial  
 
Reconstituted nab- paclitaxel  should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2  ºC to 8  ºC 
(36 ºF to 46  ºF) for a maximum of [ADDRESS_915969] any unused portion.  
 
Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Infusion Bag  
 
The suspension for infusion prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used 
immediately, but may be stored at ambient  temperature (approximately 25 º C) and lighting conditions 
for up to 4 hours.  
 Study Medication Administration  
 
Nab-paclitaxel  is injected into a vein [intravenous (I.V.) infusion] over 30 minutes.  The use of an in -
line filter  is not recommended.  
 
Reconstitution and use of Nab-paclitaxel  (ABRAXANE ) 
 
1. Calculate the patient’s body surface area (BSA) at the beginning of the study and if the 
weight changes by > 10% by [CONTACT_677141].  
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
• Total Dose (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2 )  
3. Calcula te the total number of vials required by:  
[CONTACT_192488] = Total Dose (mg)  
                             100 (mg/vial)

Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when 
a fractional number of vials is obtained by [CONTACT_192489] (e .g., if the total number of 
vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
4. Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Aseptically, reconstitute each ABRAXANE vial by  [CONTACT_44579] 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP.  
• Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 
1 minute, using the sterile syringe directing the solution flow onto the inside wall  of 
the vial.  
• DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly onto the 
lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming.  
• Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) minutes 
to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/po wder.    
• Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete 
dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid generation of foam.  Rapid agitation or shaking will result in foaming.  
• If foaming or clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_4095], stand solution for  at least 15 minutes until foam 
subsides.  
• Each ml of reconstituted product will contain [ADDRESS_915970] total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the patient:  
• Dosing volume (ml) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/ml)  
8. The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogeneous without visible 
particulates.  If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be  gently  inverted again 
to ensure complete resuspension prior to use.  Discard the reconstituted suspension if  
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_192457].  
9. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE has been withdrawn from the vials, discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated  dosing volume of reconstituted 
ABRAXANE suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC IV bag using an injection 
port.  Inject perpendicularly into the center of the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic 
material into the IV bag.   
11. Administer the cal culated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE suspension by [CONTACT_170147] 30 minutes.  The use of in -line filters is not recommended because the 
reconstituted solution may clog the filter.

Formulation 
Gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine)  is a pyrimidine  antimetabolite, which is an analogue  of 
deoxycytidine.   It was initially  synthesized as a potential  antiviral  drug but selected for  anticancer 
development because of its activity  in in-vivo and in vitro tumors.   Gemcitabine is  approved  for the 
treatment  of patients  with pancreatic cancer  and will be obtained commercially  and relabeled 
as clinical supplies.   Gemcitabine  should  be stored, reconstituted  and administered according to 
the manufacturer’s recommendation.  
 
Instructions for Storing Gemcitabine  
 
Store unopened vials  per the gemcitabine product label.   Preparation and administration of 
gemcitabine should  be per the gemcitabine package insert.  
 
Instructions for Use/Handling of Gemcitabine  
Use/handling of gemcitabine should be per the gemcitabine package insert.  
 
5.3 Endocopic Ultrasound Procedures  
 
5.3.1 Endoscopic Ultrasound 
 
Many p atients with suspected pancreatic cancer will undergo endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) 
examinations and EUS -guided fine- needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy (EUS- FNA/FNB) as indicated to 
confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_677142]; each having performed >1000 cases. The curvilinear array echoendoscopes 
(GF-UC140P or GF -UCT140, Olympus) will be used and the procedures w ill be performed with the 
patients in the left lateral position or prone position under moderate -deep sedation with 
midazolam/fentanyl and/or intravenous propofol. The location (head, genu, body and tail of 
pancreas), size, shape, margins (regular, irregular, well defined, poorly defined) and echogenicity of 
the lesions will be recorded. In addition, endosonographers will document evaluation for vascular 
invasion. This evaluation will be standardized among all endosonographers and documented in a case repor t form. After localizing the lesion, a 22 or 25- guage needle (EUS N- 3/ProCore Biopsy 
Needle, Cook Medical, Winston Salem, N.C.) will be used for FNA/FNB under EUS guidance. The use of a stylet and suction during the procedure will be at the discretion of the endosonographer. It is routine practice to perform these procedures in the presence of an on -site cytopathologist in the 
endoscopy unit to render an opi[INVESTIGATOR_677026].  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_915971] in the room. After each 
pass, the sample from the needle will be expressed using a 10 mL air -filled syringe onto a glass 
slide until no further m aterial could be expressed. Then using another glass slide the sample will be 
spread out to make two slides. These slides will be numbered according to the number of the pass. One slide will be air dried and stained with Diff -Quik stain for immediate on -site interpretation. The 
other slide will be fixed in alcohol (95% ethanol) and stained later with Papanicolaou stain. The 
residual contents of the needle after every pass will be flushed with 5 -10 ml of sterile saline solution 
into the Saccomano or cytolyte  solution. After flushing the needle, the exterior of the needle will be 
wiped with sterile gauze soaked in saline solution to reduce cross contamination between the passes. The on -site evaluation of smears will be performed to assess cellular adequacy and  to 
assess the need for any additional passes. The overall number of passes will be at the discretion of

 Template Final Ver. 7JAN2015 Protocol/COMIRB # 15 -0150 – PI: [INVESTIGATOR_677001] – Version Date: 11.16.2016  
  
the endosonographer as clinically indicated. Based on institutional experience and published 
literature, four EUS -FNA passes are required to confirm th e diagnosis of malignancy. Two additional 
EUS- FNA/FNB passes will be made and collected for biomarker studies. Experienced 
cytopathologists will evaluate cytology slides. The slides for each pass were assessed using strict 
predefined criteria for the follo wing: cellularity, adequacy of specimen, contamination, amount of 
blood, and diagnosis. The final diagnosis of malignancy will be made by [CONTACT_677143]. The results will be entered in a case report for m and 
then transferred to a database.     
 
5.3.3 Elastography 
 
Endoscopic elastography has been developed as a noninvasive method to characterize pancreas masses of benign and malignant etiologies.  This technique utilizes real -time assessment of the 
tissue elasticity distribution calculation with subsequent representation in fundamental B -mode 
imagining.  An Elastography Score ranging from 1 to 5 is assigned to the pancreas masses.  Score 1 is a homogeneous soft mass (green) associated with normal pan creas.  Score 2 remains a soft 
(green, yellow or red) mass that has become heterogeneic corresponding to fibrosis.  Score [ADDRESS_915972] (blue) with minimal heterogenicity that correspond to small early pancreas 
adenocarcinoma (< 25mm).  Score [ADDRESS_915973] (blue) tissue, corresponding with hypervascular lesion such neuroendocrine 
tumor or pancreas metastasis.  Score 5 is associated with advanced pancreas adenocarcinoma are 
primarily blue with a  soft tissue (green, red) core.   Dynamic changes in elastography characteristics 
of a pancreas may represent a novel modality to assess tumor response to therapy.  Indeed Alvarez et al have now demonstrated that increased elasticity (decrease tumor stiffness) is associated with 
response to combination gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel chemotherapy.  This trial will gather 
preliminary data on the effects of preoperative chemotherapy on the Elastography Score of selected 
patients enrolled in the trial.  
 
5.3.4 Fiducial markers placement  
 
After completion of three cycles of gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel  in 12 weeks, repeat EUS will be 
performed. The protocol described above will be used to evaluate the pancreatic lesion. In addition, 
two EUS -FNA/FNB biopsies will  be obtained and specimens will be collected for biomarker studies. 
After EUS -FNA/FNB, fiducial markers will be placed by [CONTACT_677144] a 19 -
gauge EUS -FNA needle (Cook Endoscopy, Winston -Salem, NC). Traditional fiducials (gold/carbon 
measuring 5 mm in length, 0.8 mm in diameter) will be used for this study. Fiducial marker placement 
involves first backloading the FNA needle with one fiducial marker at a time. The stylet of the EUS needle is withdrawn approximately 2 -3 cm and the fiducia l is backloaded into the needle tip by [CONTACT_677145]. The needle tip of the EUS needle is then sealed with sterile bone wax to prevent unintended loss of the fiducial while advancing the needle through the therapeutic channel of the 
echoendoscope. The needle will then be inserted into the target lesion under EUS guidance. The 
stylet of the EUS needle will be advanced to maximal insertion, thus pushing the fiducial out of the needle and into the lesion. The EUS needle will then be withdrawn from the echoendoscope and 
reloaded with a new fiducial, and the technique will be repeated until a total of three fiducials are 
placed into the lesion in different planes. The goal will be to provide ample distance and angulation for image guided radiation ther apy. The use of fluoroscopy will be at the discretion of the 
endosonographer. Intraprocedural intravenous antibiotics (Unasyn 3 gm or ciprofloxacin 400 mg) will be administered prophylactically in all patients. Technical difficulty and success along with t he 
number of fiducials placed will be documented in a case report form.

chemotherapy .  
5.4.2 Radiation Simulation  
Prior to simulation patients will undergo endoscopic fiducial marker placement  (as described above .)  
Simulation will occur at least [ADDRESS_915975] (unless contraindicated) and oral contrast ([ADDRESS_915976] to opacify the duodenum) will be required to define clinical and planning target volumes and 
the critical organs at risk (OAR) . The treatment plan ning CT will be acquired with the subject set up in 
the same position as for daily treatments. [ADDRESS_915977] (4D-CT) simulation tracking respi[INVESTIGATOR_677027].  Target volumes will be contoured based on the maximum tumor excursion , 
for example on maximum intensity projection image. Normal structures will be contoured based on 
average image intensity projection image. 
Each subject will be positioned in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. A  stereotactic body frame will be used to minimize 
set-up variability . Abdominal compression may be used at the discretion of the treating physician. Oral 
and intravenous contrast agents are recommended but not required. The CT scan of the abdomen 
should start at or above the mid -thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_677028] -lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  All tissues 
to be irradiated must be included in the CT scan. CT s can thickness should ideally be 1.0 – 3.[ADDRESS_915978].  
5.4.3 Radiation Planning  
The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the ICRU Report #50  and 62: The Gross Tumor 
Volume (GTV) is the extent of disease based on available diagnostic imaging (including PET/CT) and 
CT simulation images .  The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is the gross tumor volume plus areas 
considered to contain microscopic disease. Elective lymph node regi ons will not be included in the CTV. 
The Internal Target Volume (ITV) includes the CTV with a margin to account for physiological patient movements (mostly breathing motion), based on the maximum tumor excursion on 4D -CT. The 
Planning Target Volume (PTV) will provide a margin around the ITV to compensate for the variability of 
treatment set up. Ideally a  2mm margin in all directions around the ITV will define the PTV  as long as 
not prohibitive for the OAR . To maintain OAR constraints, the PTV may be cropped  back from the 
duodenum and stomach. The treatment plan used for each subject will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose including dose -volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTV and critical normal 
structures. DVHs must be generated for all criti cal normal structures and the unspecified tissues.  
Megavoltage equipment is required with effective photon energies ≥ 6 MV. Treatment may be delivered 
with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or Image Guided Volumetric 
Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT ).

5.5 Surgery 
 
5.5.1  Definitive Surgical Resection  
 
Diagnostic laparoscopy should involve simple laparoscopy to assess for small volume metastatic 
disease, which can be missed on conventional cross sectional imaging .  Laparoscopy should include 
general assessment of abdominal cavity to include liver, peritoneal surfaces and extra pancreatic 
sites. Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_677029]. Cytologic washings will not be acquired due to 
its unclear significance in disease outco me.  
 
Pancreatic resections (pancreaticodudenectomy for uncina te and head lesions, distal 
pancreatectomy  +/- splenectomy for neck, body and tail  lesions) will be performed in either an open 
or minimally invasive manner. For pancreaticoduodenectomy patients, e ither classic or pylorus -
preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy  may be performed. Surgical drains and enteral tubes (e.g. 
gastrostomy and/or jejunostomy tubes) may be placed at the discretion of the operating surgeon. 
Exploration of the peritoneal cavity, laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_677030], should include evaluation for 
radiolo gically occult macroscopic peritoneal or hepatic metastases. Biopsy proof of any metastatic 
disease (by [CONTACT_677146]) is required prior to aborting planned procedure. Cytologic washings are not to be performed. Regional adenopathy is not a con traindication to resection if in 
the normal resection field for the planned operation. For pancreaticoduodenectomy operations, the retroperitoneal dissection along the medial edge of the uncinate process and the right lateral border of the superior mesenteric artery is the retroperitoneal margin to be inked and assessed by [CONTACT_677147] R0 or R1 resections. If gross disease is left behind the procedure is deemed an 
R2 resection.  
 
All soft tissue to the patients right of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) should be removed. This 
requires exposure and dissection along the right lateral border of the SMA. For distal pancreatectomy operations, dissection should continue lateral to the celiac axis and include the retroperitoneal tissues to th e patients left of the celiac axis. Vascular resections (venous, and hepatic 
arterial) should be performed when indicated to achieve resection of all gross disease but not SMA resections , which have poor survival outcomes.

(IRB)/Ethics  Committee (EC) and by  a Celgene  or other sponsor -nominated representative.  
A complete medical history  (including specific information regarding any prior anthracycline- related 
cardiac abnormality) and physical  examination  will be conducted on each patient  for a review of 
systems and determination  of any  concurrent symptoms or conditions prior  to the first  dose of study 
drug.  
Routine study  evaluations will be conducted to monitor for existing adverse events and the  
development  of new adverse  events.   Study  site personnel will ask patients the following  questions:  
6.1.[ADDRESS_915982] you had any (other) medical problems since your last study  visit?  
6.1.[ADDRESS_915983] you taken any new prescribed or over-the-counter  medicines  or 
herbal/vitamin  preparations,  other than those given to you for this study,  
since  your last study visit?  
6.1.[ADDRESS_915984] study visit?  
In addition,  patients  are to be encouraged to call the site to report any  unexpected symptoms or  
problems  they encounter  between study visits.  
Medical symptoms or conditions present at or before study  drug administration that manifest with 
the same intensity  or frequency  subsequent  to study drug administration do not need to be  recorded 
as adverse events in the CRF.   However, any pre -existing condition that presents with  increased 
intensity  or increased frequency following  study drug administration, or any  exacerbation of an event 
that is present at the time of study  drug administration,  should be considered an adverse event.  All 
adverse  events  occurring  from  initial dosing through study  end, inclusive, should be followed  as 
outlined in Section  6.10.  All adverse events must be completely  and promptly  recorded in the 
patient's source document (e .g., patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], patient  clinic charts, and laboratory  reports) 
and on the CRF (see Section  6.10).  Note  that individual  signs/symptoms  should  not be recorded in 
the CRF as adverse events.   If a unifying diagnosis is  known,  it is the diagnosis  that should be 
recorded as the adverse event.  
Clinically significant laboratory  abnormalities  present at the  Baseline  visit will be recorded as  
pretreatment  signs and symptoms.   Aft er study treatment administration, laboratory  abnormalities

significant laboratory abnormalities  will not be recorded as  serious  adverse events unless the event 
meets the definition  of serious.

possibly drug related, or  clinically relevant abnormal laboratory tests of uncertain causality,  must 
be repeated.  Any abnormal  values that persist should be followed at the discretion  of the  PI.  In

Patients  who are discontinued from  treatment  in the absence of disease progression (e .g., patients  
removed for unacceptable toxicity  or patient/ PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) should undergo repeat  imaging  and tumor 
response  assessments  until disease  progression  is documented.   CT scans should be continually 
performed into follow -up every  12 weeks (at any time during that week),  regardless of regimen.  
If a patient starts a new anti-cancer  therapy  prior  to disease progression, then repeat imaging and  
tumor response assessments should be discontinued.

Adverse event  follow -up will be conducted as follows:  
• Non-serious adverse events, other than neuropathy, will be followed  for 30 
days after  the patient’s last dose of study drug.  
• Neuropathy  will be followed  until improvement to Grade [ADDRESS_915999] elapsed without  improvement or worsening, or the 
patient initiates any other anticancer therapy  during follow -up.  For patients 
taking  nab- paclitaxel  and gemcitabine, if nab- paclitaxel  is discontinued but 
gemcitabine is continued, this should be  considered as continuation  of the 
study regimen and AE follow -up should continue.  
• All serious  adverse events (regardless of relationship to study  drug) will be 
followed  until resolution. 
Clinical laboratory  tests  may be repeated during follow -up if clinically indicated.   
Follow -up evaluations  include studies necessary  to document  the resolution or persistence 
of any unresolved  AEs and could include:  
• Physical examination,  weight;  
• Concomitant  medication  evaluation; 
• Concurrent  procedures;  
• Vital signs;  
• ECOG  performance status score.   Only one observer is required at these time 
points;  
• CBC, differential,  platelet  count, and clinical chemistries;  
• Peripheral  neuropathy  assessment  (physician). 
 
6.12    Follow -up for Disease Progression  
Patients  who are discontinued from  treatment  in the absence of disease progression (e .g., 
patients  removed for unacceptable toxicity  or patient/ PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) should undergo repeat  
imaging and tumor response assessments  until disease progression is documented.   
Imaging  studies  (CT scans) should be continually performed into follow -up every  8 weeks 
(at any  time during that week), regardless of regimen.   It is recommended that subsequent 
therapy  not be instituted  until disease progression  is documented.  
If a patient starts a new anti-cancer  therapy  prior to disease progression, then repeat 
imaging and  tumor response assessments should be discontinued.   For patients  taking 
nab- paclitaxel  and gemcitabine, if nab- paclitaxel  is discontinued but gemcitabine is 
continued, this should be considered  as continuation  of the study regimen and imaging 
should continue.

agreeing to  the provisions of this protocol, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_677045] .  Celgene  in turn will be 
responsible for reporting the SAEs to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  
Adverse events occurring  during the study  will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
Scale,  where applicable.   Adverse events that are not included on the toxicity  scale will be 
designated as Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life 
threatening , and Grade  5 = death.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_677046].   Adverse events that are determined  not to be possibly,  probably,  
or definitely  related  to study drug may not require  further evaluation but will need to be 
recorded on  the CRFs.  Study  medications  may be interrupted  for an adverse  event  at the 
discretion  of the PI.  Patients  requiring  toxicity  management  should be assessed and 
evaluated at least  weekly as indicated by  [CONTACT_677151].  
7.2 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any  untoward medical  occurrence  in a patient  receiving a marketed  
pharmaceutical product or in a patient who is participating on a clinical trial who is receiving 
an investigational  or non- investigational pharmaceutical  agent.   The AE does not 
necessarily have  a causal relationship with the patient’s treatment.  Therefore, an 
adverse event can be any  unfavorable  and unintended sign,  symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated with the use of a  medicinal  product,  whether  or not considered  to 
be related  to the medicinal  product.  In cancer  clinical trials, many AEs are in fact related  
to progression  of the patient’s underlying  malignancy.  
 
An adverse event includes:  
7.2.1 An exacerbati on of a pre-existing illness;  
7.2.2 An increase in frequency or intensity  of a pre-existing  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756];  
7.2.[ADDRESS_916003] been present prior to the start of the study;

7.3 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any  untoward medical  occurrence  at any dose 
that: 
7.3.1 Is fatal; 
7.3.2 Is life-threatening  (defined as an  immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred);  
7.3.3  Results in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity ; 
7.3.4 Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928].  
(Exception: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63336] a pre-existing condition  that 
did not worsen during the study  is not considered an adverse event.  NOTE:  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677048] a 
complication  prolongs  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  then the event  is serious);  
7.3.5 I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient  who 
received  medication ; 
7.3.6 Conditions  not included in the above definitions  that may jeopardize  the patient 
or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above unless 
clearly  related  to the patient’s  underlying  disease.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_677049].  
Examples of important medical events which may also meet the definition of a SAE include: 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for a reversible condition  that did not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e .g., allergic bronchospasm or convulsions),  certain  laboratory  
abnormalities  (eg, blood dyscrasias), or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
If there  is any question,  please consult the relevant Medical Monitor.  
7.4 Timeline for Consideration of AE/SAE Reporting Requirements  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_677050], reporting and following  all adverse events,  regardless 
of causality,  observed during the study  period, starting with signing of the informed 
consent form  and ending at the time the patient goes off study  or 30 days  after  patient’s 
last dose of study drug and those made known to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_677051] , whichever  is later.   Events  occurring  
wi
thin 30 days prior to study  drug administration should be recorded as pre-treatment

signs and symptoms. 
7.5 Lack of Efficacy is not considered an AE or SAE  
“Lack of efficacy” (progressive  disease) is not considered an adverse event and 
therefore should  not be captured  as an adverse  event  or serious adverse event.  
7.6 Laboratory Results as Serious Adverse Events  
According to the NCI CTCAE system  of adverse event grading, laboratory  values of Grade  
3 or 4 are described as “severe” or “life -threatening.”  For example, an absolute neutrophil  
count  (ANC)  <500/mm3 would  meet  laboratory  criteria as Grade  4 (“life-threatening”).   This 
description is not always  synonymous  with the assessment of the  “serious” criteria of an 
AE as  “life-threatening”.   In order for adverse events to be considered serious by “life -
threatening”  
criteria,  it must be medically judged as possessing “an immediate risk of death from the 
event as  it occurred,” not because of the theoretical potential for life -threatening  
consequences.   In the case  of a neutrophil count <500/mm3, the AE would be captured  
as an AE of Grade [ADDRESS_916005]  questions:

abnormalities  will not be recorded as adverse events unless cons idered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_978], and clinically significant laboratory  abnormalities  will not be recorded 
as serious AEs unless the event meets the definition of serious.  
AEs and SAEs should be reported on the appropriate CRFs.   Any AE that meets a criterion 
for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report  Form  in addition to being recorded 
on the AE  page/screen of the CRF.   In addition, all SAEs must be reported  to Celgene 
Drug Safety  within 24 hours of  the PI’s knowledge of  the event  by [CONTACT_6972], or other  
appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or  approved equivalent form.   This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE report as well as any follow -up reports.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_677054].  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless  of relationship  to IP) that occur during the 
study (from  the time of initial study drug administration  to [ADDRESS_916010]  be 
submitted  to Celgene  Drug  Safety.   If during the follow -up period for a SAE, a patient 
dies due to another event unrelated to the SAE  being followed,  the event causing 
the death will be reported as a separate SAE.  
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from  Celgene Drug Safety  to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more  than five (5) 
business  days.  Urgent queries (e.g. missing causality assessment)  may be handled by

8.0 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
8.1    Statistical Considerations  
 
8.1.1 Brief Statistical Rationale:  
This is a Phase  II study with two primary  aims: 1) to estimate the rate of R0 resection in 
each of the two cohorts separately; 2) to test the feasibility  and safety of a new preoperative  
regimen  for patients  with R-PDAC  and BR-PDAC.   All patients  entered into each cohort will 
be included in the estimates of R0 resection  rates  (intent to treat).  Secondary  
objectives  include  estimation of Progression -free survival  and Overall  Survival  in each 
cohort (strata). Outcomes will be examined in relation  to the correlative biomarkers for 
each patient’s  tumor.  The trial will also be monitored  for grade III/IV hematologic  toxicity.  
Although  dose reductions  for chemotherapy are written  into the protocol,  as part of their 
charter, the Steering  Committee  will develop criteria for safety evaluation for all portions  of

the clinical  trial (chemotherapy,  SBRT  and surgery).  
 
In the R -PDAC cohort, the trial will be considered to be successful if 81.6% or greater of 
R- PDAC patients entered on the trial have R0 resections; for the BR-PDAC cohort, the 
trial will be considered successful if 42% of patients or greater have a R0 resection. See 
sample size and study design below. Each of the designs is a Simon optimal two stage phase II design with 80% power and alpha of 0.05. 
 
8.1.2 Sample Size 
R-PDAC: [ADDRESS_916021] the null 
hypothesis that the rate of R0  resection  rate is ≤50% versus the alternative that the R0 
resection rate is ≥81.6%. If the regimen is not effective, there is a 2%  probability  of 
concluding that it is (target  =0.05).  If the regimen is actually effecti ve, there is a 15% 
probability of concluding that it is not (target power = 80%).  Based on this [ADDRESS_916022] stage . With a total of 20  patients, 
the regimen would be accepted for further study if 15 or more R0 resections are observed 
in the total group of 20 patients.  
 
BR-PDAC: [ADDRESS_916023] 
the null hypothesis that the R0 resection rate is ≤20% versus the alternative that the R0 
resection rate is ≥  42%, if the regimen is not effective there is a 0.05 probability  of 
concluding that it is (target α=0.05). If the regimen is actually effecti ve, there is a 20% 
probability of con cluding that it is not (power = 80%, target power =80%).  Based on this 
2-stage design, if the regimen is tested on [ADDRESS_916024] stage, if 3 or fewer 
patient s go on to R0 resection, the trial will be terminated. With a total of 30 patients, the  
regimen would be accepted for further study if 10 or more R0 resections are observed in 
the total group of 30 patients.  [Calculations from PASS 2014,  NCSS, J. Hintze, Kaysville, 
Ut] 45 
 
8.1.3 Statistical Analysis   
 
Within  each cohort,  patient  and disease  characteristics will be summarized  using 
descriptive  statistics  (means, standard  deviations,  medians,  etc.) for continuous  variables 
and frequency  distributions for qualitative variables. Each of the biomarkers measured  
at the pretreatment  biopsy (e.g., SPARC  and collagen deposition ) will be described similarly  
in each cohort.  Macropi[INVESTIGATOR_677066] a similar manner.  For the 
primary  endpoint  of R0 resection, resection  rates  for each cohort  will be estimated with 
exact 95% confidence intervals at the completion of the trial. 
Biomarkers  and R0 Resection  Rates.  To evaluate the influence  of the biomarker  levels  and 
other  characteristics on R0 resection  rates  in each cohort,  logistic  regression  models  will 
be used to evaluate the role of each of these  biomarkers  in dividually  and in combination  
in predicting  response  to treatment.   Further,  the association  between R0 resection  
(yes/no)  and macropi[INVESTIGATOR_677067].  From  these 
analyses, we will estimate the odds  of R0 resection as a function of each of the biomarkers  
alone,  macropi[INVESTIGATOR_677068],  or in combination  as well as the area under  the curve  
(AUC) for the Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  Curve  (ROC). From  the ROC curves 
associated  with each of these biomarkers (univariate analyses and multivariable  analyses), 
we can estimate the sensitivity and specificity for various cut-points  of each of the

biomarkers individually and in combination with 95% confidence  intervals.  To frame  these  
analyses, for a single  biomarker (e.g., macropi[INVESTIGATOR_677069]),  we can detect  an odds  
ratio of 2.8 if the observed R0 rate is 50%  for a one standard  deviation change  above the 
mean  activity  with 58 patients  in the BRPDAC  cohort  (3.5 in the 20 patient RPDAC  
cohort).  [Calculations  from PASS 2014, NCSS,  J. Hintze,  Kaysville,  Ut].[ADDRESS_916025] 75%.  Two- sided z tests will be used to test the increases  in AUC  with 
additional  biomarkers.  Validation  studies will be undertaken if these  initial studies 
support  the utility  of these  biomarkers  to predict  response  to the chemotherapy  regimen. 
Safety. All adverse experiences will be summarized  within  cohort  by [CONTACT_677152].  Summary  tables  will be provided  that indicate  the proportions  of patients with one 
or more  specified  AEs in these  classes.  
Other  Endpoints.  Progression -free survival  and survival  will be estimated separately for 
each cohort of patients  with Kaplan  Meier  curves and estimates of median  survival 
with 95% confidence  in tervals.  Exploratory  analyses  will be undertaken to evaluate the 
prediction of PFS and OS based on measured  biomarkers  using Cox regression  methods  
with a strategy similar  to that used above for response prediction  with logistic regression  
methods. 
8.[ADDRESS_916026] 1 dose of study drug, will be the 
analysis  population for all safety/  tolerability  analyses.   In addition, overall -survival, 
progression -free survival and disease -free survival analysis will be stratified based 
upon the ability to have tumor resection or resection outcome (R0 or no -R0).

8.9 Independent  Data Monitoring Committee  
 
Monitoring and Oversight  
 
The Lead Principal Investigator ( Lead PI) will be responsible for overseeing the safety and 
efficacy of the trial, executing the DSM plan, and complying with all reporting 
requirements. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer 
Center (CU Cancer Center).  The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and patient safety for all clinical studies at the CU Cancer Center.   A summary of the DSMC’s 
activities is as follows:  
 
• Ongoing review of all serious adverse events (SAEs), unanticipated problems 
(UAPs) and reportable adverse events (AEs) 
• Has the authority to close and/or suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues 
• May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s 
Executive Committee 
 
Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor per protocol.  All SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are to be reported to the DSMC within [ADDRESS_916031]’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_779]’s i nvestigators and staff 
at regularly scheduled disease -oriented working group meetings.  Data regarding number 
of subjects, significant toxicities, dose modifications, and treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  
 
The Lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a DSM report to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a six month 
basis. The DSM report will include a protocol summary; current enrollment numbers;  
summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs; any dose modifications; 
all protocol deviations; and protocol amendments. The DSM report to the DSMC will also 
include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted, as  well as any 
internal DSMB reports. Results and recommendations from the review of this six month 
report by [CONTACT_677156].

Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Site monitoring visits will be performed by [CONTACT_95702]’s authorized representative on a 
regular basis, pursuant to the Monitoring Plan. During these visits, information recorded on the CRFs w ill be verified against source documents. After the CRFs are received by

Appendix B: Radiology Technical Manual  
1. Imaging:  
Every attempt should be made to assure that imaging studies used for determination  
of eligibility for this protocol are obtained with a “pancreas protocol”. While the details 
of this will vary from site to site, important components are given below. Please note, that MOST sites will easily meet these requirements.  
 a. CT 
 
1. CTs should be performed on a multidetector scanner with [ADDRESS_916037] enhanced  
 
3.   2-phase acquisition is preferable with images taken during a “pancreatic 
parenchymal”  
      phase (approximately [ADDRESS_916038] bolus) and a 
portal  
      venous phase (approximately [ADDRESS_916039] 
bolus).  
 
b. MRI 
 
1. Studies should be obtained using a phased array body coil  
 
2. IV gadolinium gradient recalled echo sequences  through the liver and 
pancreas should be obtained during arterial, early portal venous, and portal venous phases.  
 
3. Other sequences will be obtained including some form of T2 weighted 
sequence, non  contrast T1 sequences. Most sites will acquire diffusion 
weighted images. MRCP   sequences are NOT a requirement for determining 
resectability. 
 *For patients who present with imaging studies not performed at participating sites, eligibility will be at the discretion of the PI. Every attempt will be made to avoid 
having the patient repeat the study; however , this may not be possible in all cases.  
 
2. Transferring of Images.  
Images should be collected on a CD. For CT studies, please ask your technologists to 
include the “THIN SECTION” data as well as the con ventional reconstructed images. 
The thin sections are important to visualize the vascular structures, which are critical for determining resectability status. MRI studies, by [CONTACT_677162], do NOT require additional thin sect ion images to be sent.   
 For research purposes, please also include the site radiologist’s report on the study.  
The CD should be anonymized and named for the site and the sequence of the study sent (e.g. NYU_1, NYU_2…NYU_n). Reports should have names red acted.  Once the

3. Image interpretation  
Determination of protocol eligibility will be based on 2014 NCCN guidelines for resectability.  The central PI [INVESTIGATOR_677092] a simple email stating 
that the patient is eligible or ineligible. If the site disputes the central PI [INVESTIGATOR_677093],

Appendix  C:  RECIST CRITERIA 1.1  
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Reference  
ELIGIBILITY  
• Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols 
where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint.  
Measurable Disease  – the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If th e 
measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
Measurable Lesions  – lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension with the minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_916041] scan or M RI (no less than double the slice thickness and a 
minimum of 10 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measureable).  
• 15 mm for nodal disease in short axis 
• [ADDRESS_916042] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776])  
• Malignant lymph node: [ADDRESS_916043] scan 
(CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -
up only the short axis is to be followed.  
Non-Measurable  Lesions – all other lesions, including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with >10 to <15 mm short axis) as 
well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable 
include leptomeningeal disease , ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_33486], and nodal disease that is 10 to 
<15 mm in short axis.

Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability: Bone lesions, cystic 
lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment:  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
compone nts, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_677163].  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions: 
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cysti c metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local  treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Measurement of Lesions  
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.

Methods of Measurement  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and at each subsequent 
response assessment. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than 
clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by [CONTACT_12148].  
• For the case of skin lesions,  documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
• CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure target lesions selected for response assessment. The CT scan slice thickness sh ould be [ADDRESS_916044] a slice thickness that is greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable. Eisenhauer et al. (2009) for more details concerning the use of CT 
scan and MRI.  
• Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
• Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. The utilization of 
endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluations is not advised.  
• FDG -PET can be used to determine a new lesion if the lesion was absent at baseline 
on FDG  PET.  
• Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete response when all lesions have disappeared.  
• Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate between resi dual benign lesions and 
residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).  
Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions 
• All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addit ion should lend 
themselves accurate repeated measurements.

Template Final Ver. 7JAN2015 Protocol/COMIRB # 15 -0150 – PI: [INVESTIGATOR_677001] – Version Date: 11.16.2016  
 
 
• A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference by [CONTACT_677164] e the objective tumor. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added to the sum.  
• If a target lesion becomes too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm is assigned. 
If the lesion disappears, the measureme nt is recorded at 0 mm.  
• If extranodal target lesions fragment, the LDs of the fragmented portions are added in the sum. If targets lesions coalesce and cannot be distinguished, the LD of the 
coalesced lesion is added to the sum.  
• For a patient with SD or PR , a lesion which disappears and then reappears will 
continue to be measured and added to the sum. Response will depend upon the 
status of the other lesions. For a patient with CR, reappearance of a lesion is 
considered PD.  
• New lesions should be unequivocal  and not attributable to differences in scanning 
technique or findings which may not be tumor. If a new lesion is equivocal, repeat 
scans are needed to confirm. If confirmed, PD is assessed from the date of the first 
scan.  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not 
required, but the presence or absence of each or in rare case unequivocal 
progression should be noted at each subsequent response assessment.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA 
Evaluation of Target Lesions
 
* Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <1 0 
mm 
* Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
* Progressive Disease 
(PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 
mm. The appearance of one or more new le sions is also considered 
progression.  
* Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

Template Final Ver. 7JAN2015 Protocol/COMIRB # 15 -0150 – PI: [INVESTIGATOR_677001] – Version Date: 11.16.2016  
 
 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
* Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (i.e., <10 
mm short axis)  
* Non -CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits  
* Progressive Disease 
(PD):  Unequivocal progression of the existing non -target lesions. The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressive 
disease.  
Note: Although a clear pro gression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_677095].  
 
Evaluation of Overall Response  
The overall response is assessed according to the following table. 
Target lesions  Non-Target lesions  New Lesions Overall response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR 
CR Not evaluated No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all evaluated  No SD 
Not all evaluated  Non-PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
• Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
• In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it 
is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) 
to confirm the complete response status. If described in the clinical protocol, FDG -
PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual ra diographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.

Confirmation  
Confirmation of PR or CR to deem either one the ‘best overall response’ is only 
needed in non -randomized trials if response is the primary endpoint. 
REPORTING OF RESULTS  
• All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if 
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient 
will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial 
response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) inevaluable for response: 
specify reason such as early death from malignant disease, early death from toxicity, tumor assessments not repeated/incomplete, or other (specify )

Study Title: Perioperative
 Therapy for Resectable  and Borderline Resectable 
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Molecular Correlates
You are being asked to be in a research study.  This form provides you with information about 
the study. 
A member of the research team will describe this study to you and answer all of your 
questions. Please read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t 
understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
Why is this study being done?
This study plans to
 learn more about pancreatic cancer. We will study the safety and 
effectiveness of a
 new treatment for patients with a type of pancreatic cancer called operable 
and borderline operable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This treatment is a combined 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The treatment will be given to patients before they have 
surgery (preoperative) and again after they have surgery (postoperative). 
We hope to learn how well this combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy works to 
shrink tumors before surgery.
 This way, the tumors can be safely and more completely removed 
during surgery. Patients in this study have operable, non-metastatic (no spread to other organs) 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The main goal of this study is to find out the rate at which surgery 
may remove all visible cancer from the study patients. The study researchers will look at the 
harm that this treatment might cause patients. The researchers will also look at the tumor 
markers of the disease found in tumor tissue and blood samples.
Standard treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677103], chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Generally, surgery comes first, followed by 
[CONTACT_677165]. In this study, patients will first be given a combination of two 
chemotherapy drugs that are intended to help stop the growth and spread of cancer. Next, they 
will receive radiation, then have their surgery, and again receive the combination chemotherapy. 
In this study receiving chemotherapy before and after surgery is considered investigational. 
The two chemotherapy drugs are nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) and gemcitabine (gemzar). These 
drugs will be given through a vein (intravenously, or
 “IV”). Throughout the rest of this form, 
when these drugs are referenced by [CONTACT_677166] “abraxane” and 
“gemcitabine”. When referenced together in combination use they will be called the 
“study drugs”.
Abraxane has been approved by [CONTACT_677167] (FDA) for the 
treatment of advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs. However, 
the use of abraxane to treat patients whose pancreatic cancer can be removed by [CONTACT_44850] 
(resectable or operable) or partly removed by [CONTACT_44850] (borderline resectable or borderline 
operable) is considered “investigational”. This means this study drug has not been approved by 
[CONTACT_365027]. 
Gemcitabine has been approved by [CONTACT_677168].

metastatic. Your doctor has reviewed your computerized tomography (CT) or Magnetic 
Resonance Images (MRI) and believes you are eligible to take part in this study. 
Other people in this study
Up to 15 people from your area will participate in the study. 
Up to 50 people around the country will be in the study.  Two patient groups (cohorts) will be 
taking part in this study: 
Up to 20 people will be in Cohort 1: Resectable (Operable) tumors
In general “resectable” pancreatic cancers are those which can  be removed 
because they do not touch major blood vessels.  
Up to 30 people will be in Cohort 2: Borderline Resectable (Borderline Operable) 
tumors
“Borderline resectable” generally includes those which touch the major arteries 
and/or veins that
 take blood to or from the pancreas or its surrounding tissues.
What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study, you will be asked to sign this consent form before you receive any study 
related tests or procedures. Some of these procedures are
 the same as you would receive as 
standard of care treatment even if you did not participate in this trial.
There are three parts to this study:
1. Screening (before the study)
2.
Treatment
3. After Treatment Follow-up
Below is a general description of these three parts of this study,  including which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], tests, 
and procedures will be given and when.  It is also an overview of what will be expected of you if 
you decide to take part in this study. 
1.  SCREENING
Once you sign this consent form the following will be done to see  if you can be in this study. In 
the next section “Study Procedures” will give a description of these and other procedures you 
can expect to have if you take part in this study.
Medical History 
Physical exam 
Height and weight
Body Surface Area calculation (for chemotherapy dosing)
Review of medications (those you are allergic to or taking including, vitamins, herbs 
or over-the-counter medications)

Radiology review
Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) with diagnostic tumor biopsy. You will  sign a separate 
consent form when you have this procedure. Tumor tissue that is taken during this 
procedure and not needed for your diagnosis and standard treatment would normally 
be thrown away, but we will use this left-over tumor tissue in this study to do a 
molecular tumor analysis (this may also include looking to see if the tumor tissue is 
hard or soft).
Archived tumor tissue
2.  TREATMENT
The study treatment consists of:
3 months (12
 weeks) of chemotherapy (the study drugs)
5 days of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
surgery (4 to 6 weeks after SBRT) to remove any operable cancerous tumors
3 months (12 weeks) of chemotherapy. 
The chemotherapy you receive before your operation and after your operation will be the same.

B. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Archived Tumor Tissue
If you also had surgery in the past, you must allow us to request tumor tissue from your prior 
biopsy to be used for this study. We will contact [CONTACT_677169] a portion of your tumor tissue that they have stored so that it may be used this research. We will also do molecular tumor testing on this tumor tissue.
Body Imaging Studies (CT or MRI)
Body imaging studies such as Computerized Tomography (CT) Scans and Magnetic 
Resonance Imagining (MRI) will be used to determine your eligibility for this trial.  Your 
doctor will make the choice which test is appropriate for you. These tests are routine for patients with pancreas cancer. They will help determine if you are eligible for this study. They will also show the size of your tumor and whether the size changes during treatment.  Since these are standard tests, your doctor and/or radiologist will describe this procedure including the side effects you might experience. 
Blood Tests
We will take approximately [ADDRESS_916052] will also be done for women of childbearing potential.

Page 5 of 24Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An ECG  is a simple,  noninvasive  procedure  that makes  a recording  of the electrical  activity 
of the heart.  Electrodes  are placed  on the skin of the chest  and connected  in a specific  order 
to a machine.  Output  usually  appears  on a long scroll  of paper  that displays  a printed  graph.
Peripheral  Neuropathy  Assessment
When your medical history is reviewed, your doctor will also do an evaluation about 
peripheral neuropathy. This is numbness, tingling, pain, or lack of feeling in your arms, legs, 
hands, or feet. This is done to see how well you may tolerate the treatment.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and Diagnostic  Tumor Biopsy  
This is a minimally invasive procedure done to assess many things, including cancer of the 
pancreas.  Under 
light sedation, an experienced, well trained physician will pass a thin 
flexible tube into your stomach and duodenum to visualize the pancreas and your tumor.  It 
uses high-frequency sound waves to produce detailed images of the lining and walls of your 
digestive tract, chest, and nearby [CONTACT_250011], such as the pancreas, liver, and lymph nodes.  An 
EUS is a formal outpatient surgery that allows your doctor to sample (biopsy) tissue from 
your pancreatic tumor.  This procedure will also include tumor marker testing. Your doctor 
will give you specific instructions to prepare for your EUS which may include asking you to:
Fast before the EUS procedure, to make sure your stomach is empty.
Stop taking certain medications, such as blood thinners. Blood thinners may 
increase your risk of bleeding if a biopsy
 is performed during EUS. If you 
have chronic conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, your doctor 
will give you specific instructions about your medications.
Plan ahead for your recovery, if you will be sedated before EUS. Most people 
who have EUS are given medication to relax them.
 You should arrange for 
someone to drive you home after the procedure.
This study requires 2 endoscopic evaluations of your pancreatic tumor.  During the second 
evaluation, radiation markers (tiny gold seeds) will be placed to help guide your radiation 
oncologist for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). A doctor trained in analyzing 
biopsies (pathologist) will report the test results if you have fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Your 
doctors will discuss any important findings and next steps with you.
Molecular Marker Analysis
Molecular markers (also called biomarkers) are substances such as  genetic material (DNA 
and RNA) and proteins found in blood and tumor tissue. These can show if a patient with 
cancer will or will not respond to a treatment. Currently, no such markers are available for 
patients with your type of pancreas cancer. In this study we will be testing your blood and 
tumor tissue (from your biopsy) before treatment is started and after chemotherapy is 
completed. The biopsy and the blood needed for this testing will be taken prior to the start of 
chemotherapy and prior to the start of SBRT (most likely at the time of radiation marker 
placement).

Page 6 of 24The intent of the treatment used in this study is to  make your operation more successful, but 
the biopsies and blood draws for biomarker analysis will not be used to determine your 
treatment in this study. Instead they will be analyzed after all enrollment in this trial is 
complete. You will not receive the results of these analyses.
Chemotherapy (the Study Drugs)
Cancer chemotherapy is designed to safely kill tumor cells while doing less harm to normal 
cells. The next section of this consent form will tell you about the known side effects of the 
chemotherapy that you will receive.  Chemotherapy prior to surgery is designed to kill both 
tumor cells in your pancreas and other invisible cells that might have escaped the pancreas 
to invade other parts of your body.  This is called “preoperative chemotherapy.” 
In this trial you will receive two chemotherapeutic agents (two drugs) by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) 
infusion. These 
are gemcitabine and abraxane.  These drugs are FDA approved to be given 
to patients with advanced pancreas cancer. However, they are not FDA approved to be 
given to patients before or after an operation for pancreas cancer.  These drugs are given 
on the same day.  This study visit procedure will last several hours so you can receive the 
drugs safely and with medication to prevent nausea or vomiting.
Gemcitabine is a type of chemotherapy known as anti-metabolites which

will receive gemcitabine through a tube in your vein (IV infusion) for [ADDRESS_916053] of an IV infusion each week for 3 consecutive weeks with one week off.  
The 3 cycles will take approximately 12 weeks.  This is the same schedule we

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and Radiation Marker Placement 
Radiation Therapy 
This is a standard of practice in the [LOCATION_002] for many patients after they 
have had a successful operation for pancreatic cancer. 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
 
This is a type of radiation therapy in which a few high doses of radiation are 
delivered to 
small, well-defined tumors. The goal is to deliver a radiation dose 
that is high enough to kill the cancer, while minimizing exposure to healthy 
tissues and organs nearby. SBRT is typi[INVESTIGATOR_677106], early-stage 
tumors, or isolated recurrences or spread from various types of cancer. SBRT

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_677104]:  01/04/2021
Page 7 of 24has been used successfully to treat early-stage pancreatic cancer and metastatic 
cancers. SBRT 
begins with one or more sessions of treatment planning. This 
planning uses imaging (such as a CT scan, or MRI) to map the exact position of 
the tumor to be treated. These images are then used to create customized 
treatment plans. During treatment, high-level computerized devices point several 
radiation beams of different intensities at different angles, so that the radiation is 
directed precisely to the tumor. 
SBRT Delivery: In this study, SBRT will be given [ADDRESS_916054] chance for long-term control of all types of 
pancreatic cancer.  If a tumor is able to be removed with surgery,
 it is called resectable.
Different types of  surgery are performed depending on the location of the tumor within the 
pancreas:
Whipple Procedure (Pancreaticoduodenectomy)
Distal
 Pancreatectomy
Total Pancreatectomy
The Whipple
 Procedure, or pancreaticoduodenectomy, is the most common 
surgery 
to remove tumors in the pancreas.  In a standard Whipple procedure, the 
surgeon removes the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the 
duodenum (the uppermost portion of the small intestine), the pylorus (a small 
portion of the stomach), and the lymph nodes near the head of the pancreas.  
The surgeon then reconnects the rest of the pancreas and digestive organs so 
that pancreatic digestive enzymes, bile, and stomach contents will flow into the 
small intestine during digestion.  
A distal pancreatectomy  is generally performed if a tumor is located in the body 
or tail portion of the pancreas.  The surgeon removes the body and tail of the 
pancreas, and sometimes the spleen.  All other organs are left in place.

HYPOTHESIS: 
Oral progesterone  is a useful therapy  for the management of bleeding associated  
with the etonogestrel contraceptive implant. 
OBJECTIVE:
The overall  objective  of this study is to confirm that oral  progesterone is an effective 
way to manage bothersome bleeding; thus increasing  the rate of continuation of the 
etonogestrel contraceptive  implant in adolescents. 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
Of the approximately three million  pregnancies annually in the [LOCATION_002], 50 
percent are unintended pregnancies. Adolescents  bear a significant  burden  of such 
unintended pregnancies, with 82 percent of adolescent pregnancies being 
unplanned (1). It is well  documented  that  adolescent pregnancies have  deleterious 
effects on women’s health and educational  attainment, the health of newborns, and 
incur a significant  emotional and financial burden, both for the individual  and 
society as a whole.  Furthermore, greater than  one-third of unintended adolescent 
pregnancies end in abortion  (2). 
While most sexually active adolescents report using a method of contraception  at 
some point in their lifetime - they  are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_737550].  Combined oral contraceptives and condoms are the most popular and 
most requested  method of contraception  by [CONTACT_737559] (3, 4). Unfortunately, the 
failure rates  of both oral contraceptives and condoms among adolescents are higher 
compared with all typi[INVESTIGATOR_737551] (5, 6). Specifically,  adolescent mothers are 
Protocol Version Date  11/14/16documented to have  a high rate of repeat pregnancy and are more likely to use 
ineffective methods  and to use effective methods  inconsistently or incorrectly (6). 
 It is encouraging that there has been in increase  in the number of adolescents who 
use long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods,  such as the intrauterine 
device or contraceptive  implant. With  4.5% of adolescents using  such methods in 
2009, compared to only 1.5%  in 2007, and just 0.3% in 2002 (7). In fact, when 
adolescents were counseled on the full range  of contraceptive options and the 
barrier of cost for LARC methods was removed in a large study, more than two-
thirds of females aged 14 – 20 years chose LARC  methods (8).  It is also promising 
that national organizations, such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, have emphasized the importance of LARC method  use by [CONTACT_65754]. 
Specifically, ACOG states  that LARC  methods are safe and appropriate for most 
women and adolescents, and that  they provide top-tier  effectiveness, high rates  of 
satisfaction and continuation (9). Furthermore,  the Contraceptive  CHOICE  project,  a 
large prospective  cohort  study designed to promote the use of LARC methods to 
reduce unintended  pregnancy, found that  sexually active teens  using  the 
contraceptive implant or intrauterine device have significantly  lower  mean  annual  
rates of pregnancy, birth, and abortion (34.0, 19.4, and 9.7 per 1000 teens) 
compared to sexually experienced U.S. teens (158.5,  94.0, 41.5 per 1000) (10). Data 
from the contraceptive  CHOICE project also  demonstrates that teens continued to 
use LARC  methods longer than shorter acting  methods (i.e. the oral contraceptive 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_737552]) – two thirds  of teens in the 
CHOICE project were  still using  their LARC  method  at [ADDRESS_1007568] of teens using a non-LARC method (11).  
The sub-dermal single rod etonogestrel-only  implant offers highly effective, long-
acting, reversible contraception (12).  It consists  of a single rod (4 cm in length, 2 
mm in diameter) made of ethylene vinyl acetate, containing 68 mg of etonogestrel 
that is released  subdermally  over three years.  Prevention of pregnancy is 
accomplished by [CONTACT_244112] – suppression of ovulation, thickening  of 
Protocol Version Date  11/14/16cervical mucus  inhibiting sperm penetration into the uterus,  and alteration of the 
endometrium. In the clinical trial of 301 Nexplanon (the radiopaque  etonogestrel 
implant) users, no woman became pregnant while the implant was in situ, up to and 
including 14 days  after  implant removal. This resulted in an estimated overall Pearl  
Index of 0.0 (95% CI, 0.0 – 0.56)  (12); which translates clinically to >99 percent 
effective at preventing pregnancy.  They  are documented to be safe for use in the 
adolescent population. However, the implant is currently used by [CONTACT_21316] 1% of 
U.S. women  using contraception, and by 0.5% of those  aged 15-19  years (13). 
It is well documented  that women  using  the contraceptive implant can expect 
changes in their menstrual bleeding patterns, and these changes  account  for the 
most commonly cited reason for method discontinuation.  The  bleeding pattern 
women experience in the first three  months after insertion is predictive of future 
bleeding patterns  throughout the duration  of use (14).  When analyzing 11 clinical 
trials, bleeding patterns  were  described as infrequent bleeding in 33.3% of 90-day 
cycles, amenorrhea  in 21.4% of cycles, prolonged bleeding in 16.9% of cycles, and 
frequent bleeding in 6.1% of cycles (15).  
There have been studies that propose management options for treating bothersome  
bleeding associated with  the etonogestrel contraceptive implant  – such options 
include combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, 
mefenamic acid, mifepristone, and doxycycline. Unfortunately there  is limited  
clinical data supporting the effectiveness of these treatments (16-18).   To our 
knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the use of oral progesterone  for 
management of bothersome bleeding associated  with the contraceptive implant. 
Given the success of norethindrone acetate  in the management of pain  and bleeding 
in adolescents  with endometriosis (19), we chose to use norethindrone acetate  as 
our oral progestin of choice  for managing bothersome bleeding associated with  the 
contraceptive implant.
Protocol Version Date  11/14/16When investigating bleeding  patterns, a common  challenge encountered is that  of 
patient compliance with  menstrual calendars.  The burden of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a daily  
menstrual calendar may lead  to reduced  response  rates, incomplete data, and poor 
data fidelity.  The widespread  popularity of mobile phone technology has increased 
the ability to connect  with study participants  in real  time,  thus  decreasing  the 
reliance on traditional pencil and paper  methodology for data collection. There are 
several potential  advantages for using short-message service  text messaging (SMS)  
for data collection: (a) data is time stamped thus  providing accurate real-time 
information, (b) study  designers have the ability  to ensure data responses conform 
to a set criteria, (c) automatic SMS  texts  provide prompts for participants  to record 
the data of interest, (d) data transfer is instantaneous  thus reducing  data loss or 
incompleteness, and (e) data collection is more convenient and accessible for 
participants as they are likely  to have  their mobile phone devices with them and be 
familiar with the SMS texting function of their particular device. To our knowledge 
there have been  no studies that use SMS text messaging to record data  on daily 
bleeding patterns  – essentially creating  a real-time electronic menstrual calendar.  
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
We will conduct a prospective study of adolescents using the etonogestrel  
contraceptive implant. Participants will be recruited from the Norton Children’s 
Gynecology practice in Louisville, Kentucky. This  practice provides care  to a diverse 
population of females, from  a wide  range  of socioeconomic statuses, age birth to [ADDRESS_1007569]-menarchal female presenting to the Norton 
Children’s Gynecology practice, who  desires to use the etonogestrel  contraceptive 
implant and has access  to a mobile phone device. 
All patients presenting and choosing to have an implant placed will be offered 
participation. The study will enroll subjects until 30 active  participants are in each 
study arm;  for a total of 60 study participants.   In order to achieve the enrollment  of 
Protocol Version Date  11/14/1660 active subjects  up to 100 participants  will be enrolled.   All enrollments will be 
voluntary. Participants will receive  compensation for their participation.   After 
obtaining informed consent and assent, participants will provide baseline 
demographic information, including:  age,  race/ethnicity, zip code of residence, 
health insurance  provider, number of current and past partners, use of prior 
contraceptive methods, concomitant  condom use,  sexually transmitted infection  
history, age at menarche, menstrual cycle regularity, last menstrual  period, weight  
and height. The date of etonogestrel implant insertion will be confirmed.
All patients using  etonogestrel contraceptive implants will receive daily  SMS texts in 
the evening  via the Qualtrics SMS program  asking them to respond with  their 
bleeding pattern that  day.  If the SMS text messages are unable to connect  to your 
personal cell phone we request an alternative  cell phone number be given in order 
to reach you.    We  will record responses  according to the World Health 
Organization definitions of bleeding:  (a) bleeding  day, (b) spotting  day, (c) bleeding-
free day [see Table I for WHO bleeding  definitions].  At their initial follow-up visit  3 
months after Nexplanon insertion, we will identify those who report “bothersome” 
bleeding patterns. For the purpose of this study,    “bothersome” bleeding will be 
defined as prolonged and/or frequent bleeding, as characterized by [CONTACT_737560]-recommended definitions of bleeding. The definitions are listed in 
Table I.

Norethindrone acetate (aygestin) will be used to manage bothersome  bleeding. 
Patients will be prescribed aygestin 5 mg by [CONTACT_737561], 
followed by [CONTACT_737562] 5 mg by [CONTACT_737563].  Medication  will then 
be discontinued. Patients will be evaluated  in the office three months after 
medication initiation, and then  again six months after medication initiation.  If the 
patient is unable  to take norethindrone acetate (aygestin) due to medical  
contraindications or cost, they will receive  medroxyprogesterone acetate  (provera) 
10 mg once  daily  as alternate oral progesterone. Figure 1 below highlights the study  
design.

During the aygestin administration,  patients will again receive  daily SMS texts in the 
evening via the Qualtrics SMS  program asking  them to respond  with their bleeding  
pattern that  day. We will record  responses according to the World Health 
Organization definitions of bleeding:  (a) bleeding  day, (b) spotting  day, (c) bleeding-
free day. Patients not reporting bothersome bleeding after the initial  [ADDRESS_1007571]  bleeding via SMS texts for the next 6 months to serve as the 
control group (normal bleeding group). 
Protocol Version Date  11/14/16Participants will be compensated  as an incentive  to increase daily participation.  The  
participant will receive a pre-paid card if they respond  to >70% of text messages 
over each 90-day  cycle and attend the scheduled  office visit.  Patients will receive a 
$[ADDRESS_1007572] at visit one (3 months  after insertion of etonorgestrel implant), $[ADDRESS_1007573]  at visit  two (6 months  after  insertion of etonorgestrel implant), and a 
$[ADDRESS_1007574]  at visit three (9 months after insertion of etonogestrel implant).
At the completion of the study,  [ADDRESS_1007575] study questionnaire  will assess overall  satisfaction with the etonogestrel  
implant and evaluate participants’ perceptions  of text messaging as a tool  to collect 
information. See Appendix II.
Participants who have already completed the [ADDRESS_1007576] to sign the updated 
consent and assent forms.  See Appendix III for a copy of a letter  to be included with  
the updated  consent and assent.  Once the updated consent and assent are received 
by [CONTACT_737564]’s  Gynecology the post survey follow up will 
be sent to the participant by [CONTACT_737565].   Study participants who 
are seen in the office for their [ADDRESS_1007577]-
protected computer. Study size will be a convenience sample. Based on the current  
rate of etonogestrel implant  insertions in our practice, it is anticipated that 30 
participants can be recruited over  a six-month  period of time. 
Protocol Version Date  11/14/16Data Collection and Analysis
All patients who meet the inclusion criteria and enroll in the study  will be sent a text 
message daily for 90 days (3 months).  The daily message will prompt the 
participant to indicate the bleeding  level  for the day. This  single question will have 4 
options: 
1.Bleeding Day
2.Spotting Day
3.Bleeding Free Day
4.Prefer  not to answer today.
On day 90, descriptive tallies of the responses will be done.  Using SPSS v20, an 
algorithm will count the number of bleeding days,  spotting days, and bleeding free 
days and prefer not to answer (PNA) days;  the data record  for each participant will 
contain four count  variables (bleeding,  spotting, free, PNA).  Secondly, the algorithm 
will identify and tally –according to WHO guidelines in Table 1 - bleeding-spotting 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (BSE), amenorrhea (AM), infrequent  bleeding (IF),  normal frequency of 
bleeding (NF), frequent bleeding (FB), and prolonged bleeding  (PB).
Participants who have at least a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_737554] “bothersome bleeding”.  Those without  a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_737555] “normal  bleeding”.  Participants  in the Bothersome Bleeding group  will be 
offered aygestin to control the bothersome bleeding. Participants in the Normal  
Bleeding group will continue as before, with  no additional medications. Following 
the principle of intent-to-treat, data  from those in the Bothersome  Bleeding group 
will be assigned to the aygestin group,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_737556].
During the first month, participants in the Bothersome Bleeding group will take one 
5 mg tablets  of aygestin  twice daily (morning  and evening). After 30 days, the dose 
of aygestin will be halved,  such  that only  one 5 mg tablet is taken daily. Sixty days 
Protocol Version Date  11/14/16later, the Bothersome Bleeding group will discontinue aygestin.  Ninety days later, 
both the normal group and the Bothersome  Bleeding  group will be re-evaluated.
Data Analysis
A descriptive table will be used to sort participants  into Normal Bleeding and 
Bothersome Bleeding. Non-parametric  and parametric statistics will be used to 
compare the demographics  of these two groups.
A dose-response curve covering six months will be plotted for the Bothersome  
Bleeding group to visually  reveal the impact  of one month of 10 mg of aygestin vs. 
two months  of 5 mg aygestin vs. three months 0 mg of aygestin. Plotted on the curve 
will be the group averages of the daily bleeding value (1 for no bleeding, .5 for 
spotting, 0 for bleeding). A second no-dose curve  will be added to the X-Y plot for 
the six months of data  from the Normal Bleeding group.
Repeated Measure  Multivariate Analysis  of Variance (RM-ANOVA)  with  a Between-
Subjects variable included, will be conducted (assuming sufficient data is available – 
e.g., low PNA rates) to compare the first  [ADDRESS_1007578]-hoc comparisons will evaluate  changes between the control group and 
intervention group at the three time  points.
Additional analyses may also include regression  analysis to assess for predictive  
factors related  to response to aygestin.

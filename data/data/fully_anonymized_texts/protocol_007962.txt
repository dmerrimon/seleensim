1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Transplantation of pancreatic islets represents a clinical therapeutic option to preserve 
and/or restore beta- cell function in patients with diabetes ( 1, 2). Since the 1970’s islets are 
embolized into the hepatic portal system by a minimally invasive technique consisting of 
trans -hepatic cannulation of the portal vein under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance 
followed by [CONTACT_520028]. Alternatively, in patients at risk of bleeding, the transplant is performed by [CONTACT_520029] a tributary of the portal vein using open surgery (mini -laparotomy) or laparoscopic approach ( 3).  
Several improvements in islet cell processing, immunotherapy and patient management 
have led to incremental advances in islet graft outcomes ( 4, 5).  Progressive loss of islet 
graft function has been recognized after implantation in the intrahepatic site used clinically for the last three decades ( 2). This phenomenon seems to be common to autologous and 
allogeneic islets, and was described also in pre -clinical animal models of autologous islet 
transplantation ( 6). 
An instant blood- mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) occurring early after intra -
portal islet infusion activates the coagulation cascade and the endothelium of the hepatic sinusoids, triggering adhesion of platelets and leukocytes, generation of thrombi and ischemia contributing to the loss of a conspi[INVESTIGATOR_519936] ( 7, 8). 
Nonspecific inflammation (innate immunity) generated at the  time of transplant may 
heighten the intensity of subsequent adaptive immune responses that in organ transplantation are responsible for higher incidence of acute and chronic rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 
and in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) promote also recurrenc e of autoimmunity. 
Accumulation of peri -insular fat in the liver of intrahepatic islet recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519937] (9-14). Other disadvantages of the hepatic site include the relatively 
hyperglycemic environment and the elevated concentration of immunosuppressant  (first -
pass) that are toxic to islets.  
Identification of a clinically relevant new ‘home’ for islet grafts will likely contribute 
achieving reproducibly successful biological replacement of beta -cell function in insulin -
requiring diabetes. Definition of extra -hepatic transplantation sites has been recognized 
one of the current research priorities, and the focus of actively ongoing investi gations 
(Table 1 ) aimed at identifying a microenvironment that could provide prompt engraftment, 
minimize early inflammation and islet cell death, while achieving sustained function.  
Engraftment of islet grafts in several extra -hepatic sites and with or w ithout 
bioengineering strategies has been demonstrated in experimental models ( 2, 15-17), 
although clinical transl ation for some remains arguable ( Table 1 )(18). An ideal new 
‘home’ for islet grafts should accommodate rela tively large volumes of tissue ( e.g., low 
purity, or pooled donor islet preparations, and/or re -transplantation), rely on minimally -
invasive transplant procedures, allow for noninvasive longitudinal monitoring and easy access for biopsy. Por tal blood drainage may be preferable to reproduce physiological 
metabolic responses. Confinement and irretrievability  of the graft is desirable, particularly 
for bioengineering approaches to optimize the site.  Extra -hepatic sites already tested in  humans include muscle ( 17, 19-21), and peritoneal 
cavity (to accommodate large microencapsulated islets)  (22, 23). Clinical feasibility and

safety of intra -bone marrow (BM) islet transplantation ( 24) has also been recently proposed 
in patients with contraindications for intrahepatic islet transplantation.

Implantation of islets into the omentum is appealing because the site offers a large, 
well-vascularized surface that could be used to distribute  an islet graft ( 18). Furthermore, 
the omentum has portal blood drainage, which may allow for the achievement of  more 
physi ological , metabolic responses when compared to other extra -hepatic sites shown to 
associate with hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and impairment of insulin action, none 
of which observed with intra -omental islet grafts ( 25, 26) . 
The omentum develops as a loose mesothelial sheet of tissue from the yolk sac. The 
greater omentum develops in the eighth week of gestation from the dors al mesogastrium 
(27). It is composed of two mesothelial sheets enclosing predominantly adipocytes 
embedded in a loose connective tissue, and also aggregates of mononuclear phagocytic cells. The omentum has a rich vascular supply with numerous characteristic capi[INVESTIGATOR_519938] ( a.k.a ., omental glomeruli due to their similarity to renal glomeruli). These 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_519939] ( 28). The size of the human omentum 
varies from 300 to 2000 grams with a surface area of 300 to 1500 cm
2 (29). 
 The omentum has been utilized in different experimental models of islet transplantation 
over the last [ADDRESS_674447] reported the successful reversal of experimental 
diabetes in rats after implantation of islet isografts into a peritoneal omental pouch constructed by [CONTACT_520030] a pouch formed from a strip of parietal peritoneum obtained from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]; normoglycemia was maintained in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519940] a rapid return to hyperglycemia ( 30). The suitability of  the 
omentum for islet transplantation in large animal model was first reported by [CONTACT_520031]. in pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] ( 31) and then extended by [CONTACT_520032] . to the canine model with titration of mass 
in an allogeneic combination, though suggesting the need for higher numbers when compared to intrasplenic implantation ( 32, 33). More recently, the omental site has been 
explored as a site for bioengineering approaches aimed at enhancing islet transplant engraftment and survival ( 34, 35) . 
An interesting approach to intra -omental islet transplantation was presented by [CONTACT_520033] . 
in a canine model of total and partial pancreatectomy ( 36). The autologous grafts wer e 
prepared in a three -dimensional (3D) matrix consisting of autologous plasma supplemented 
with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) that was placed in and rolled -up with 
the greater omentum to have omental layers on both sides of the matrix (36). Another recent 
study by [INVESTIGATOR_406598] -Tulleneers -Thevissen et al. in immunodeficient rats (nude rats) showed 
that human islet cell implants survive better in the omentum than intra -hepatically, with 
positive influences of the number and purity of implanted beta cells ( 37). Similarly, 
Bartholomeus et al. demonstrated that perinatal porcine islet cell grafts display comparable 
growth of the β -cell volume over time when comparing the omentum and the kidney 
subcapsular space; but that the omentum leads to higher insulin reserves and an increased pool of proliferating cells, which might be related to a more extended vascular network 
(38). 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_519941] a means  to 
attain hemostasis and prevent bleeding during various surgical procedures ( 39-41). The 
development of recombinant human thrombin lead to standardization of this  product, 
overcoming limitations imposed by [CONTACT_520034] -derived thrombin, both of which were costly 
to manufacture.  In addition , bovine thrombin carries the risk of immunogenicity, 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 10 of 73 
 
potentially resulting in formation of cross -reactive antibodies to bovine thrombin, factor 
V, and other impurities that may be present in these formulations, and potential bleeding 
and thromboe mbolic events ( 40).  
 In this study we propose to use R ECOTHROM   (thrombin alfa, ZymoGenetics, Inc.) , 
developed via recombinant DNA technology, identical in amino acid sequence  and 
structurally similar to naturally occurring human thrombin . The cell line used to 
manufacture RECOTHROM® has been extensively tested and shown to be free of known 
infectious agents. It is not derived from animal or human blood, and contains no added 
human or animal components. Thus, R ECOTHROM ® is inherently free from the risk of 
transmission of human-  borne pathogens, such as HIV, hepatitis, parvovirus, and the 
infectious agents associated with Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease (CJD) and variant CJD. 
RECOTHROM ® has low immunogenicity with a significantly lower rate of specific anti-
product antibody formation than treatment with bovine thrombin. After surgery, only 1.5 
per cent of R ECOTHROM ® patients developed antibodies ( 42). It could be used safely in 
patients with pre -existing anti- thrombin antibodies to bovine thrombin preparations ( 43).  
RECOTHROM ® is easy to prepare and use. It is supplied as a lyophilized powder and sterile 
diluent for reconstitution in single use, preservative -free vials of 5,000 IU or 20,000 IU. It 
requires no refrigeration and can be stored in the operating room. When reconstit uted, it 
can be kept up to 24 hours for lengthy surgical procedures. According to a recent clinical 
study, RECOTHROM ® was found to successfully stop 80 per cent of surgical bleeding within 
three minutes and 95 per cent of bleeding within 10 minutes ( 42). RECOTHROM ® is intended 
for topi[INVESTIGATOR_44785], and it is generally applied directly to the bleeding site, or used in conjunction with a compatible absorbable gelatin sponges to promote hemostasis, with clot formation occurring shortly after reconstituted R
ECOTHROM ® solution comes into contact 
[CONTACT_166922]. 
 For the purposes of this study we propose to use R ECOTHROM  to promote clot 
formation in autologous plasma used to re -suspend allogeneic islet cells for the 
implantation onto the omentum . Hence, we intend to use R ECOTHROM  as for the approved 
clinical use. The data from the experimental studies conducted in small a nd large animals 
models confirm that the additional of R ECOTHROM  to islet cells re --suspended in 
autologous plasma and placed in the omentum results in prompt gel (clot) formation and 
adherence of the islets to the surface of the omentum , desirable to promote engraftment. 
The latter is achieved through increased surface exposure and circumventing pelleting, 
which may result in reduced oxygen diffusion, and competition for nutrients and 
accumulation of metabolism bi -products.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_674448] demonstrated that the current site of 
transplantation in the liver is not an ideal site due to several factors.  These factors include (1) significant liver inflammation following islet infusion; (2) potential for life -threatening 
procedure -related complications such as bleeding and thrombosis; (3) high levels of 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 11 of 73 
 
immunosuppressive drugs and GI toxins in the liver contributing to islet toxicity; (4) the 
inability to retrieve islets after infusion ; and (5) development of graft dysfunction in a 
number of  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519942] .  
Based on these premises, development of a clinical protocol for the implantation of 
islets into the omentum is a desirable  goal. As an attempt to maximize the engraftment of 
islet cell clusters onto the omentum, implantation site should promote islet adherence to  
the omental peritoneal layer and avoid cell  pelleting. We have recently performed a series 
of experiments in animal models of diabetes to assess the feasibility of transplanting pancreatic islets in the omentum using a plasma -thrombin gel. With our approa ch, the islets 
are re -suspended in either donor or autologous plasma and distributed onto the omentum . 
Cell adherence is achieved by [CONTACT_520035] -grade recombinant human thrombin that 
reacts with plasma to create a biocompatible, degr adable gel con taining the islet graft. 
Preliminary data obtained as a result of these studies demonstrate the feasibility of our approach , and are described in Section [ADDRESS_674449] outlined our initial patient trial as 6 subjects, based on clinical judgme nt and 
extensive experience in clinical islet transplantation trials. If initial safety and efficacy is satisfactory (no adverse events related to the transplantation and efficacy in two of the three first transplanted subjects), we will transplant [ADDRESS_674450] observed a decline in beta cell function compared to the 6 months data and similar to findings reported in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519943] t allografts ( 114). 
Possible factors responsible for this loss/decline in graft function include immunological activation (i.e., allo - and/or autoimmune rejection), non- specific inflammatory responses 
and islet graft exhaustion due to metabolic demand in t he setting of a marginal mass. In 
addition, factors inherent to this novel transplantation site may have also contributed to the observed decrease in beta- cell function.  
 In order to preserve long- term islet allograft function the introduction of adjuvant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519944] -transplant period may be required to minimize islet graft loss, 
sustain beta -cell health and decrease burden of metabolic demand on islet allograft .  
 We have shown that in the intrahepatic site the use of GLP -1 RA t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_519945] ( 115-118) for over [ADDRESS_674451] also recently 
reported that combination of GLP -1 RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519946] ( G-CSF) leads to prolonged islet allograft survival ( 119). Th ese therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519947] a tolerogenic environment.  
 It is known that inflammatory responses account for substantial beta -cell loss early 
after transplantation . Notably, TNF -alpha has been associated with islet graft loss. Farney 
et al. described a beneficial role of etanercept , a TNF -alpha blocker, in promoting 
engraftment of marginal mass islet grafts in mice (91). Hering et al. used etanercept in a 
recent trial of 8 type 1 diabetic patients receiving single donor islet transplant, and all 8 
achieved insulin independence suggesting a beneficial role for anti -TNF therapy in 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 12 of 73 
 
clinical islet transplantation (92).  Although experience with anti -TNF alp ha therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519948] , the introduction of TNF -
alpha blocking therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519949].  
Traditionally we have used etanercept (Enbrel ®) as a TNF -alpha blocker in islet 
transplantation  (5). Recently, it has been shown that adali mumab (Humira ®) in addition 
to blocking TNF -alpha promotes the development of T -regulatory cells (128, 129). 
Adali mumab has been shown to be clinically comparable and with a similar side effect 
profile to Enbrel as tumor necrosis factor blocker. Since adali mumab may also promote a 
tolerogenic environment we will use adali mumab instead of Enbrel as a TNF -alpha 
blocker.  
 However, currently there are no clinical trials that incorporate the use of anti-
inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519950].  
 
A safe, orally administered, anti -inflammatory intervention that has been extensively 
evaluated in the m edical literature is the use of omega 3 fatty acids ( 120). The use of omega 
[ADDRESS_674452] been postulated as the molecular basis for the anti -inflammatory 
properties of omega 3 fatty acids ( 121).   
  Derivatives from omega 3 fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid  (DHA)] have been associated with marked anti -inflammatory  effects 
whereas arachidonic acid (AA), an omega 6 fatty acid , is the precursor of eicosanoids  
associated with pr o-inflammatory properties. Thus, a high AA/EPA ratio would suggest 
that the balance is shifted towards a pro -inflammato ry state. Treatment with omega -3 fatty 
acids aimed  at lowering the AA/EPA ratio may then prove to be beneficial particularly in 
diseases associated  with a high inflammatory s tate. 
 Taking into account the first transplant experience under this protocol  as well as 
additional pre -clinical data in small and large animal mode ls, it is clear that adjuvant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519951]- term islet allograft survival and thus we will 
incorporate the following intervent ions to be started in the peri -transplant period:  
 a. Pegylated G -CSF (Neulasta
®; Pegfilg rastim) 
b. Exenatide extended -release (By[CONTACT_28556]®) 
c. Ultra -refined omega -3 EPA/DHA concentrate (ZoneLabs® OmegaRx®2) 
d. Supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula  
 
 
Pegylated G -CSF (Neulasta®; Pegfilgrastim)  
G-CSF, an agent well known to help mobilize hematopoietic precursors from the bone 
marrow, has been used  clinically for nearly 20 years to help repopulate peripheral cell

counts in patients undergoing cancer therapy. However, a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_519952] G -CSF has the potential  to be used in the 
treatment of autoimmune diseases. G -CSF has been shown to favor the differentiation 
and mobilization of Treg cells, induce tolerogenic DC, and alter the b alance between 
proinflammatory and anti -inflammatory soluble mediators both animals and in humans 
Specifically, G -CSF can  mobilize functional bone marrow CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg 
cells. Preclinical models of G -CSF-induced inhibition of autoimmune and allogenei c T 
cell responses have demonstrated the potential efficacy of G -CSF in treating  Crohn’s 
disease, myasthenia gravis, and T1D  (122). 
Pegylated G -CSF i s a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human granulocyte 
colony stimulating factor (filgrastim) and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. Neulasta® 
is a Colony Stimulating Factor  that acts on hematopoietic cells by [CONTACT_520036], thereby [CONTACT_170140], differentiation, commitment, and end cell functiona l activation. Neulasta® is supplied in 0.6 mL prefilled syringes for 
subcutaneous injection. Each syringe contains 6 mg pegfilgrastim (based on protein weight), in a  sterile, clear, colorless, preservative- free solution (pH 4.0) containing 
acetate (0.35 mg ), sorbitol (30.0 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.02 mg), and sodium (0.02 mg) in 
water for injection, USP.  
 
Exenatide extended -release (By[CONTACT_28556]®)  
The naturally occurring form of exenatide (exendin- 4) was originally isolated from the 
salivary secretions of the liz ard Heloderma Suspectum (Gila monster). Exendin- 4 has a 
53% amino acid sequence overlap with mammalian glucagon- like peptide -1 (GLP -1). In 
mammals, GLP -[ADDRESS_674453] gene, not from the Gila monster 
homologue of the mammalian proglucagon gene, from which GLP -1 is expressed. In 
mammals, exendin -4 is resistant to degradation by [CONTACT_36273] -IV (DPP -IV) and 
has a much longer plasma half -life than GLP -1, which is degraded by [CONTACT_149789] -IV with a 
half-life of less than 2 min. Exendin- 4 is not an analogue of GLP -1. In other words, the 
structure of the synthetic exendin- 4 peptide (exenatide) was not created by [CONTACT_520037] -1. Ho wever, exendin- 4 and GLP -1 share many 
glucoregulatory actions, which may be mediated by [CONTACT_520038] -1 
receptor; they enhance glucose- stimulated insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon 
secretion. ( 123-125).  
A summary of the effects of GLP -1 are:  
•  Insulinotropic effects, which are glucose dependent (potentiates glucose action with no effect on insulin secretion at glucose <4.5mM); this contrasts with the action of other insulin secretagogues agents, such as sulfonylureas, which increas e insulin secretion 
regardless of glucose concentrations; GLP -1 is therefore unlikely to cause lasting and 
profound hypoglycemia. GLP -1 enhances insulin secretion through the regulation of ion 
channels (including ATP -sensitive K+ channels, voltage- dependen t Ca²+ channels, 
voltage -dependent K+ channels, and nonselective cation channels), of intracellular 
energy homeostasis, and exocytosis Moreover, the expression of genes that are essential for beta cell function, such as glucokinase and GLUT 2, are up - regu lated following 
GLP -1 treatment  
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 14 of 73 
 
•  Stimulation of all steps of insulin biosynthesis, as well as insulin gene transcription, 
thereby [CONTACT_520039]. Effects on insulin gene transcription are proposed to occur via the up -regulation of the transcription factor 
pancreatic duodenal homeobox- 1 (PDX -1)  
•  Improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, which was reported in human and rat adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Several studies suggest that GLP -1 may 
directly enhance glucose disposal in an insulin- independent fashion, although this may 
also result from the overall inhibition of glucagon secretion  
•  Stimulation of beta -cell proliferation, and enhancement of the differentiation of new 
beta cells from progen itor cells in the pancreatic duct epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. A proliferative action of 
GLP -1 on insulin secreting cells has been shown both in vitro and in vivo models. 
•  Inhibition of apoptosis induced by [CONTACT_520040] .). Studies have shown 
that GLP -1 added to freshly isolated human islets preserves morphology, function and 
inhibits cell apoptosis. ( 126) Furthermore, the ability of GLP -1 to inhibit apoptosis is 
relevant to the islet transplantation procedure. Treatment of islets with GLP -1 or its 
analog could potentially enhance islet graft survival through inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of proliferation, thus decreasing the requirements for a large islet cell mass   
•  Anti -inflammatory properties, which have been documented in several studies () . Our 
own studies showed that exenatide has anti - inflammatory properties that protect human 
islets in vitro ( 127). Exenatide treatment improved islet function, significantly reduced 
content of inflammation -related molecules (tissue factor, IFN -γ, IL -17, IL-1β, and IL -2) 
and caspase 3 activation, whereas increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and Akt in vitro. Immunostaining showed expression of GLP -1R in β -cells but not in α -cells. 
IL-1β colocalized with GLP -1R in β -cells. Induction of serine proteina se inhibitor 9 (PI -
9) was detected after exposure of human islets to exenatide in vitro, and after 
transplantation into immunodeficient mice. These anti-  inflammatory and cytoprotective 
properties of exenatide could be beneficial to protect the transplante d pancreatic human 
islets.  
 
Ultra -refined omega -3 EPA/DHA concentrate ( ZoneLabs® OmegaRx®2)  
A safe, orally administered, anti -inflammatory intervention that has been extensively 
evaluated in the medical literature is the use of omega 3 fatty acids (120). The use of omega [ADDRESS_674454] been postulated as the molecular basis  for the anti -inflammatory 
properties of omega 3 fatty acids (121) .  
 
Derivatives from omega 3 fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA)] have been associated with marked anti -inflammatory  effects whereas 
arachidonic acid (AA) , an omega 6 fatty acid , is the precursor of eicosanoids  associated 
with pr o-inflammatory properties. Thus, a high AA/EPA ratio would suggest that  the 
balance is shifted towards a pro -inflammatory  state. Treatment with omega -3 fatty acids 
aimed  at lowering  the AA/EPA ratio may then prove to be beneficial particularly in 
diseases associated  with a high inflammatory s tate.

Some fish may contain potentially harmful contaminants, such as heavy metals (including 
mercury), dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs). In order to minimize 
contaminats we will use ultra -refined O mega- 3 (ZoneLabs® OmegaRx®2).  
Supplemental Oxygen Therapy.  
a. Adequate oxygenation at implantation of the islet allograft is critical for beta cell survival. We hypothesize that oxygen supplementation in the peri -transplant period may 
result in increased oxygen delivery at the transplant site allowing for improved engraftment and allograft survival. Subjects will be started after islet transplantation on 
supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_520041] 4L/min (to provide FiO2 of 36%) which will be 
continued throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and up to [ADDRESS_674455] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157450].

3.1 Patient Population  
This trial is an open label, single -arm, P hase I/II, single center trial.  
 
Potential participants will be initially identified using pre -screening tools as approved 
by [CONTACT_1201] . Candidates who meet the general inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
consented, enrolled, and assigned a unique subject identification number. Subjects will 
then be more thoroughly evaluated for eligibility as part of the protocol -specific screening 
visit procedure. Recruitment at the University of Miami will continue until all subjects 
[N=6] needed for the trial are identified, appropriately consented,  screened  and 
transplanted . 
 
3.1.1 Placement of Islets into the O mentum  
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the transplantation of islets in  a more 
favorable alternative site , i.e. omentum, will result in similar islet engraftment (and 
therefore similar or higher rates of insulin dose decrease and similar or better  metabolic 
outcomes) than conventional islet transplants in the liver. In the last 7 intraportal islet infusions , there was an insulin reduction of 57 ± 16% reduction of insulin use (range 
32 to78%), basal c -peptide 0.85 ±  0.35 ng/ml (range 0.4 to 1.48 ng/ ml), and 90 minute 
C-peptide 1.89 ±1.19 ng/ml (range 0.8 to 4.3 ng/ml) at 75 days after a single islet 
infusion. Immunosuppression regimen will be similar to that used in the CIT consortium trials ( 44). In order to avoid side effects related to Sirolimus ( e.g. 
impairment of wound healing) , we will use Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil 
(MMF) as maintenance immunosuppression. This protocol has proven to be successful in recent is let clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_520044] ( 45, 46) .

REATMENT OF PATIENTS  
4.1 Study Therapy and Dosages  
4.1.1 Study Investigational Therapy: Isolation of Allogeneic Islet Cells  
 Pancreas is removed from the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_519958] a 
tray with Trimming Solution with Cefazolin (a sample of UW is collected for microbiological analysis), placed in a larger tray with [ADDRESS_674462] is cannulated with a 16- 18 gauge 
angiocatheter, and the pancreas is distended with cold collagenase solution (Liberase MTF and Thermolysin dissolved in water, supplemented with HEPES, Calcium Chloride, NaOH, DNAse). The distended organ is placed inside a digestion chamber (47-49); additional collagenase solution is added, re -circulated and brought to 37
oC, 
while chamber is agitated  (47-49).  During the digestion samples are collected at 
regular intervals to monitor the breakdown of the pancreas, via microsc opy.  When 
sufficient number of free islets are detected by [CONTACT_520049], digestion is stopped, the 
heat is switched off, and digest is collected (while collagenase is diluted) in cold RPMI -
1640 (with 5- 1.5% HSA, DNAse, 25 mM HEPES, 10 U/ml Heparin, 0.2 U/ ml insulin) 
to quickly cool the digest. The digest is centrifuged and washed in Wash Solution (Cold Storage / Purification Stock Solution, 10% PentaStarch, 0.625% HSA, 10 U/ml 
Heparin, 0.2 U/ml Insulin).  Digest volume is recorded, and re -suspended in the final 
volume of 200 ml of CIT Purification Solution (Cold Storage / Purification Stock Solution, 10% PentaStarch, 10 U/ml Heparin). Islets are separated from exocrine tissue using continuous and modified continuous density gradient centrifugation, in a COB E 
2991 blood cell processor ( 47-51).   
 Continuous gradients are composed of Purification Solution mixed with OptiPrep, 
10% PentaStarch and gradient Stock Solution to achieve densities of 1.100 gm /ml and 
1.065gm/ml. 20- [ADDRESS_674463] is loaded and centrifuged 3- 5 minutes. Purified 
islets are collected in fractions, the purity of which is assessed with DTZ. Islet fractions 
with purities >30% are saved and washed with CMRL -1066. Similar purity fractions 
are then combined for culture.  
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 23 of 73 
 
 Modified continuous purification is used as a rescue purification method. Light 
(1.062 gm/ml) and heavy (1.073 gm/ml) modified conti nuous density gradients are 
achieved by [CONTACT_520050] 1.1gm/ml Biocoll to UW. Up to ~[ADDRESS_674464] is re -suspended in 150 ml of UW and incubated for ~30 minutes. Biocoll 1.1 
gm/ml is loaded first, followed by [CONTACT_520051], 1.073 gm/ml, and light, 1.062 gm/ml, density gradients, followed by [CONTACT_520052]. Digest is centrifuged for 3 minutes at 3000 rpm, islets are collected in the CMRL -1066, and their purity is assessed. Fractions of similar purity 
are cultured together.   
 Islets are cultured 36- 72 hours, in 95% air, and 5% CO 2, at 37°C, in CMRL 1066, 
Supplemented (0.5% HSA, 10 U/ml Heparin and IGF -1), at a concentration of ~20,000 
IEQ/30 ml media, in 175cm2 tissue culture flasks. Islets with purity ≥ 70% are cultured 
at 37°C for the first 12 -24 hours, and at 22°C thereafter ; islets with purity ≤70% are 
cultured at 22°C. In preparation for implantation onto the Omentum , islets are collected 
from the tissue culture flasks, re -suspended in Tx media (CMRL 1066, 2.5% HSA, 25 
mM Hepes), washed and set tled by [CONTACT_520053]. Final assessment 
samples are collected at this point. The final settled islet cell pellet is transferred to a 10 or 20 ml luer -lock syringe, depending on the settled tissue volume . 
 
4.1.2 Study Investigational The rapy: Administration  
 This is a single procedure protocol. Only a single islet transplant will be performed 
in the patient. Islets are isolated from a single pancreas donor. A minimum of 5000 
IEQ/KG will be transplanted. A single dose of at least 5000 IEQ/KG should be able to achieve a meaningful metabolic improvement and prevention of severe hypoglycemia, as previously seen in our experience with intraportal islet transplants. 
Allogeneic islet cells will be isolated as described in section 4.1.1of this  document 
(see above) and cultured for 36- 72 hours. At the time of transplant, islets will be 
collected in a sterile conical tube, and settled by [CONTACT_20138]. The final settled islet cell 
pellet in Tx media (CMRL 1066, 2.5% HSA, 25 mM Hepes) will be transferre d to a 
10 or 20 ml luer -lock syringe, depending on the settled tissue volume. The final 
settled islet cell pellet is transported to the Operating Room (OR) in the final container (10 -20 ml luer -lock syringe), washed in autologous plasma, settled again, 
and re-suspended in 2:[ADDRESS_674465] is a sterile suspension of ≥70% viable, ≥30% pure, allogeneic islets. The final product contains a single dose of 5,000 or more Islet Equivalents (IEQ)/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148] (BW).  
At the time of transplant and under general anesthesia, through a laparoscopic 
approach  and/or mini laparotomy the islets will be delivered and distributed on the 
surface of the omentum using a 12 Fr. Gastrostomy catheter (Cook Medical).  R
ECOTHROM® will be added to promote formation of a gel clot (as needed to cover the 
graft surface, approximately in a volume equal to that of the graft implanted) to promote islet cells adhering to the surface of the omentum, and avoid cell pelleting.  
An omental pouch will be created by [CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_519959]. Each 
procedure is projected to take approximately 1- 2 hours. Recombinant human thrombin 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/[ADDRESS_674466] included in 
the exclusion criteria possible scenarios that may require future surgeries or subjects with previous abdominal surgeries, inflammatory bowel disease, and history of bowel 
obstruction.  
 
4.1.3 Dose Rationale  
This study is not  a dose escalation study. A single dose of 5,000  or more  IEQ/kg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148] (BW) will be transplanted.  
There is no method to assess  islet survival as a fraction of surviving cells/total islets 
transplanted.  Once the patient is s tabilized (in 6 – 8 weeks), however, it is possible to 
monitor islet mass via FSIGT .  FSIGT  allows for measurement of acute insulin release 
in response to the injected glucose ( 38, 48) . 
Our extensive past experience with islet transplantation has proven that a dose of 
≥5,000 IEQ/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148] (BW) has proven to be safe, and demonstrated to result in long term improvement of metabolic control, and reduction of hypoglycemic unawa reness associated with intensive insulin therapy ( 52-63).  
 
Although this study is a single dose protocol, i slet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519960] a second islet  transplant (intra -hepatic 
administration)  if they : 
 a. do not achieve primary efficacy endpoint criteria at [ADDRESS_674467] be met:  
 
1. Subject received ≥5,000 IE/kg with the first transplant, but failed to achieve primary efficacy endpoint . 
2. Subject has been compliant with study monitoring and prescribed immunosuppressive therapy.  
3. Subject has no unresolved SAEs.  
4. No evidence of progressive renal dysfunction, with blood creatinine rising above 
2.0 mg/dL (177 μmol/L).  
5. No evidence of hypersensitization, allergic responses, or other potentially serious 
drug reactions to medications required by [CONTACT_760].  
6. PRA <50% by [CONTACT_20369] (assessment performed locally) and the 
alloantibody specificity not cross -reactive with antigen(s) present in the subsequent 
islet preparation in order to avoid unacceptable antigen(s).  
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 25 of 73 
 
7. Absence of any medical condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], will 
interfere with a safe and successful second islet transplant.    If a participant is deemed eligible for an intrahepatic islet infusion, the participant will continue to be followed according to the 2
nd year schedule of events unti l 
intrahepatic islet transplantation is performed at which time follow up will reset and continue for 2 years as per protocol.  
 D-dimer testing and samples for unmethylated insulin DNA (Benaroya 
collaboration) are not required to be obtained for intrahepatic islet transplants under this protocol.  
 
If graft failure  occurs after the second islet transplant, these recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519961]. 
Islet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519962] , i.e. subjects who do not 
achieve primary endpoint criteria at 1 year follow -up, will be  eligible to  receive a 
second islet transplant via intra -hepatic administration. With the exception of 
performing induction with basiliximab (Simulect®) instead of anti -thymocyte globulin 
(ATG, Thymoglobulin®), the regimen will be identical to the initial islet transp lant.  
The transplant will be done by a radiologist in the Special Procedures section of the Radiology department, under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. Islets will be infused under  sterile conditions over 20- 30 min. by [CONTACT_511401]. Gel foam plugs 
and/or collagen/thrombin paste will be used to embolize the entire peripheral catheter tract immediately before the catheter is withdrawn, to reduce the chances of bleeding. A minimum of 5,000 IEQ/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148] (BW) will be transplanted to  
maximize possibility of insulin independence.  
In case the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_519963] (in radiology), he can offer a second infusion through a 
mini- laparotomy (in the operating room ). 
The mini -laparotomy is done under general anesthesia. A small incision (about 2 -3 
inches) is done on the abdominal wall.  The surgeon will do a catheterization of the 
mesenteric vein toward the portal vein.  The study team will then infuse the islets into 
the portal system. Islets will be delivered from the Ricordi bag  through catheter into 
your liver over about 30 ±25 minutes. The portal vein blood pressure will be checked 
often to make sure it does not critically increase . After the islets are injected, the 
catheter will be removed and the vein it was in will be tied off so it does not bleed.  The 
incision will be closed with stitches, and a sterile dressing  will be put ove r the incision.  
 
4.1.4 Dosage and Dosing 
The study team will maintain detailed records as to the cell dose each patient 
enrolled in this study will receive. Allogeneic islet cells will be placed in the omentum, 
under general anesthesia, by a mini laparotomy and/or laparoscopic approach. During 
the procedure, patients will be monitored followed established standard of care. The 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018

procedure will be termin ated if the patient becomes unstable.

Study therapy (allogeneic islet cells) will be dispensed only after a patient has 
provided a written informed consent, met all eligibility criteria for entry into the study, 
and complete d all the necessary evaluations. As the cells are intended for 
administration immediately following preparation, they will be destroyed should they’re not used right away.   
4.1.6 Study Investigational Therapy Accountability Procedures  
The Principle Investigator (PI) is responsible for the study investigational therapy 
accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance. In accordance with all 
applicable regulatory requirements, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_519964] (CPF)  
responsible for cell manufacture will maintain accountability records throughout the length of the study.

TUDY  PROCEDURES  
5.1 Study outline  
• Prior to transplantation, the patient is screened, qualified, listed for transplanted, and signs the informed consent form.
 
 
• Subjects screening data from 20053135 protocol will be accepted for subjects eligible for this study. If 20053135 visit was 12 months prior to enrollment, Visit 2 laboratory should be repeated.  
 
• At the time a suitable islet preparation becomes available, the patient will receive 
allogeneic islet cells transplanted onto the omentum .  Islet transplant will be 
performed under  rabbit  Anti -Thymocyte Globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin®) induction 
immunosuppre ssion ([ADDRESS_674468] -transplant).   
Maintenance mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy (1- 2 g/day as BID dosing)  will 
be started on Day –[ADDRESS_674469] -transplant to target  a trough level of 10- 12 ng/mL for the 
first 3 months, and 6- 10 ng/mL thereafter. However, target drug levels will ultimately 
depend on clinical status, tolerability, and biochemical/immunological profiles as 
determined by [CONTACT_458]. 
  
 Adalimumab (Humira) will be given IV before the islet transplant ( 80 mg) and then 
40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks after islet transplant for 2 doses .

5.2 Islet Transplant: Immunosuppression , Adjuvant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519965] t han the one for which they are currently approved and for use in 
combinations, which have not been formally studied. These medications have only been 
used for a short period of time and in a small number of subjects. In the islet transplant setting, they have been used in several i slet a lone and islet a fter kidney t ransplant t rials. A 
number of known side effects can be experienced when taking these drugs. The study 
medications will be provided by [CONTACT_520054] [ADDRESS_674470] of five doses IV infusion of rabbit Anti -
thymocyte Globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin®), starting two days prior to the islet transplant. The doses will be administered as directed on the package insert.   
 Considering that the presence of pre -formed rabbit antibodies may predict the 
occurrence of an immunologic response agains t Thymoglobulin®, participants 
will be tested during the screening visit for presence of antibodies  to rabbit serum 
proteins and epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] .  
 Patients who have : a) a positive  history of rabbit allergy/anaphylaxis, or b) 
positive IgE to rabbit serum proteins and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] , will not be eligible to 
undergo induction with Thymoglobulin® due to the increased risk for an anaphylactic reaction. T hese patients  will be  considered for induction with 
alemtuzumab (see below) once this drug becomes available for utilization under this protocol.   
o Maintenance mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy (1- 2 g/day as BID dosing) 
will be started on Day –[ADDRESS_674471] -transplant to target a trou gh level of 10 -12 
ng/mL for the first 3 months, and 6- 10 ng/mL thereafter. However, target drug 
levels will ultimately depend on clinical status, tolerability, and biochemical/immunological profiles as determined by [CONTACT_458].  
 
 
Rabbit Ant i-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin )  
A total of 6 mg/kg will be given as an IV infusion on days –2, - 1, 0, +1, and +2. The dose 
will be 0.5 mg/kg on day –2, 1.0 mg/kg on day –1, and 1.5 mg/kg on days 0, +1, and +2. The doses will be administered as directed on the package insert.  
 Pre-medications will be used as follows: 
#1: Acetaminophen (Tylenol ) 650 mg PO/PR ½ hr before and midway through ATG 
infusion 
#2: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl ) [ADDRESS_674472] through ATG 
infusion 
#3: Methylprednisolone (Solu- Medrol®) 1 mg/kg IV one hour prior to ATG infusion and 
as needed to prevent cytokine release syndrome.

#4: Pentoxifylline (Trental®) [ADDRESS_674473] 
ATG infusion and to be continued through day +[ADDRESS_674474] Thymoglobulin® dose, it may be administered IV via a peripheral l ine as follows: 
• Dilute the Thymoglobulin® in 500 cc Normal Saline (not D5W)  
• Combine with Heparin 1000 units and Hydrocortisone 20 mg. 
 
If a significant adverse reaction to Thymoglobulin® occurs , the patient will be treated 
accordingly, the transplant will be cancelled and no further doses of Thymoglobulin® 
will be administered . The patient will undergo islet transplantation at a later time under 
induction with basiliximab which will be administered as  described for participants who 
are eligible for a second islet transplant (see section 5.3).   
 
Alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada®):  
Alemtuzumab induction, instead of Thymglobulin®, will be performed in the event of high 
risk for anaphylactic reaction to Thymoglobuli n® (i.e. patients with history of rabbit 
allergy/anaphylaxis or having positive IgE to rabbit serum protein and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]).   Induction with alemtuzumab will consist of an initial dose of 20mg IV over 3 hours given on Day –[ADDRESS_674475] dose of alemtuzumab  with Benadryl 
(50mg IV), acetaminophen (650mg PO), ibuprofen (400mg PO) and (Solumedrol 125mg iv). Pre -medication, WITHOUT Solumedrol, will also be given before the second dose of 
alemtuzumab . 
 
We will monitor and perform Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for 
Alentuzumab (Lemtrada ®) due to serious risks of autoimmune conditions, infusion 
reactions and malignancy.  
 
 
Mycophenolate mofetil ( CELLCEPT)  
Maintenance mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy (1- 2 g/day as BID dosing) will be 
started on Day –1 pre -transplant. 
The MMF treatment regimen may be modified if clinically required, (e.g. in times of inter -
current illness, suspected graft dysfunction, or other clinical circumstances including intolerable or undesirable side effects) at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. Enteric -coated mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic®) may be substituted for MMF, at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_519966]. Standard mycophenolate 
sodium dosing is 720 mg PO BID ( or as tolerated).  
Mycophenolate -containing medicines are associated with an increased risk of first 
trimester pregnancy loss (miscarriage) and congenital malformation (birth defects) if taken 
during pregnancy. Subjects  will be informed on these risks and  must practice two methods 
of contraception while taking MMF.

taking mycophenolate mofetil) , mycophenolate mofetil exposure will be reviewed and 
mycophenolate mofetil administration will be adjusted as part of the study protocol’s 
neutropenia management plan. 
  The protocol and informed consent will be consistent with MMF ’s Risk Evaluation and 
Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ). “Mycophenolate can cause fetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant female. Exposure to mycophenolate during pregnancy is associated with 
increased risks of: F irst-trimester pregnancy loss, c ongenital malformations (especially 
external ear and abnormalities such as a cleft lip and palate), a nomal ies in babies of the 
distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney”. We will follow the following steps to help 
ensure the successful implementation of Mycophenolate REMS with females with  
reproductive potential:  
1.Enroll in Mycophenolate REMS  
2.Check Pregnancy Status  
3.Educate Females of Reproductive Potential  
4.Obtain a Signed Patient -Prescriber Acknowledgment Form  
5.Report Any Mycophenolate -Exposed Pregnancies. 
 
Tacrolimus  (PROGRAF)  
Tacrolimus will be administered o rally twice daily starting on Day [ADDRESS_674477] -transplant to 
target  a trough level of 10- 12 ng/mL for the first 3 months, and 6-10 ng/mL thereafter.  
However, target drug levels will ultimately depend  on clinical  status, tolerability, and 
biochemical /immunological  profiles as determined by [CONTACT_458] . 
Should subjects experience a sustained increase in serum creatinine ≥ 2 ti mes pre-
transplant baseline or  decrease in their eGFR of ≥33% compared with baseline, a 
nephrology consult will be obtained, and Tacrolimus target trough levels will be reduced 
by 25% should CNI toxicity be suspected as the primary cause for the decline in renal function.  Sirolimus  (RAPAMUNE®)  
Sirol imus will be used in case of T acrolimus or /and mycophenolate mofetil  intolerance.

INSULIN THERAPY  
Glucose levels will be ta rgeted to 80- 120 mg/dL. Insulin ( e.g., Regular, Lispro, NPH, 
Glargine) will be administered , as needed , to maintain glucose levels in the target range. 
The subject will test BG five times per day (AM fasting, before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, 
before suppe r, and at bedtime). For subjects not on CGM, a CGM device will be placed on 
day of admission to facilitate adjustments to insulin therapy for as long as clinical indicated . 
The subject’s daily BG levels will be reviewed by a study nurse and/or one of the investigators three times per week during the first two weeks after discharge, and then 
weekly during the next month. Exogenous insulin will be withdrawn or adjusted as needed. Patients able to maintain fasting BG levels below 140 mg/dL and 2- hour postprandial levels 
below 180 mg/dL after insulin discontinuation will be considered insulin independent.

Basiliximab ( SIMULECT ®) 
Two IV doses of Basiliximab, a monoclonal antibody IL -[ADDRESS_674483] is a 200 mL sterile suspension of ≥70% viable, ≥30% pure, allogeneic 
human purified islets in CMRL [ADDRESS_674484] is supplied in up to three 200 mL Ricordi® bags, containing a dose of ≥4,000 IEQ/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148] (BW).  Administration:  
The islet mixture is delivered slowly via gravity drainage from a bag attached to the catheter in the portal vein or portal vein tributary. Access to the portal vein is achieved by [CONTACT_520056], ultrasonographic, or real -time CT 
guidance. Alternatively, access to a mesenteric or omental venous tribut ary of the portal 
vein can be obtained by [CONTACT_170885] -laparotomy under general anesthesia (transplant site 
preference or in the rare circumstance that percutaneous access cannot be achieved).  
At a minimum, portal pressure will be monitored before and after infus ion of each bag of 
the islet product, as well as after the final wash. Portal pressure measurements will be documented in the medical record.

5.4 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Use of Investigational Agent: Transplant of Allogeneic Islets  
Transplantation of islets is associated with the several potential risks. These risks 
may be categorized in terms of:  a) transmission of disease from donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], b) 
risk of microbial contamination of islet preparations, c) sensitization of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519973], d) acceleration of retinopathy with acute correction in glycemic control, and e) psychologic al impact of successful or failed islet transplantation.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_674488] laboratory tests for low -risk of transmission of donor disease. Donor 
families are therefo re questioned about high risk lifestyle and detailed medical history. 
Donor blood samples are screened for conditions including (but not limited to) Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)  1, HIV2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV, Epstein Barr 
Virus (EBV) disease, and syphilis.  
Donors are excluded if: a) there is known pre -existing metabolic disease including 
T1 or Type 2 diabetes, or if the HbA1c is elevated above 6.1% in the absence of 
transfusions in the week prior to death, b) if there is malignancy ot her than primary 
brain tumors, c) septicemia is present or suspected at the time of death, d) there is evidence of clinical or active viral hepatitis (A, B or C), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), syphilis, active viral encephalitis of unknown ori gin, Creutzfeldt -
Jacob disease, rabies, treated or active tuberculosis, septicemia, dementia, individuals that have received pi[INVESTIGATOR_519974] (pit -hGH), or serious illness of unknown 
etiology.  
Therefore , islets will only be isolated from donors who have undergone the same 
screening process used by [CONTACT_520057]. With careful donor selection as summarized above, the risk of tra nsmission of disease 
from donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519975].  
The administration of valganciclovir routinely post -transplant may minimize risk for 
certain viral pathogens. The risk of transmission of CMV disease from donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519976], particularly 
in the most recent era with routine use of purified islet preparations. For instance, there have been no epi[INVESTIGATOR_519977] 77 consecutive islet recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519978]. In the international Immune Tolerance Network 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 34 of 73 
 
(ITN)/NIAID multi- center islet trial, there was no CMV disease in any of the 36 
patients transplanted at the nine different sites. Sixteen of 36 (44%) subjects were CMV 
positive initially. Two initially negative subjects became CMV IgG positive without any apparent clinical sequelae. The University of Miami recently presented data on three islet recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519979], after discontinua tion of anti -viral prophylactic therapy.  
Therefore , while CMV transmission from donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519980], the fact that islet preparations are purified and are contaminated with only a low number of passenger lymphocytes may e xplain why the risk of CMV 
transmission from donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519981].  
With respect to EBV transmission, only recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519982].  EBV polymerase chain reactions (PCR) monitoring will 
be carried out routinely after transplantation at defined intervals throughout the trial. EBV disease and the risk of PTLD have not been reported in the recent era of clinical islet transplantation, sug gesting that the risk of this complication may be less than 2%.
  
5.4.[ADDRESS_674489] fulfill stringent in -process and lot release criteria before use in 
transplantation. A Gram stain is obtained (and must be negative), and an endotoxin determination is completed (less than 5 EU/kg based on the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]), prior to product release for transplantation. A sample of the final islet product is obtained prior to the addition of antibiotics and the absence of adventitious microbial and fungal contaminants is confirmed. Broad- spectrum antibiotics  are added to the released final 
product prior to transplant to further diminish the subjects’ risk of infection.  
In [ADDRESS_674490] been previous reports of two cases of islet transplantation- related 
septicemia (Enterobacter cloacae) due to transplantation of contaminated cryopreserved  pancreatic islets (64). Additionally, the University of Minnesota 
investigators have previously reported on the incidence and significance of contaminated islet preparations in clinical islet auto - and allotransplantation (65). 
Positive cultures from isle t tissue preparations were identified in 11 of 29 patients 
(38%) receiving autologous islets. The occurrence of serious infection morbidity (as defined as positive blood cultures, abscesses, or intra -abdominal infections) did not 
differ significantly betwe en the positive and negative culture groups (p=0.99). In the 
allogeneic islet transplant group, 7 of 33 patients (21%) received tissue that retrospectively was  determined to be contaminated. None of these patients developed 
serious infectious complications  (despi[INVESTIGATOR_126340]- spectrum immunosuppression). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_519983], there was no serious increase in 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 35 of 73 
 
infectious morbidity. Presumably the inocula were kept low by [CONTACT_520058][INVESTIGATOR_519984].  
Of the islet allotransplants performed at the University of Minnesota between 1993 
and 1999, 3 of 20 patients (15%) received tissue that was retrospectively determined to be contaminated. The species isolated included Candida krusei, Enterococcus faecium , 
and two strains of coagulase -negative Staphylococcus. None of these patients have had 
SAEs related to the contamination of the transplanted islet tissue.  
Additional steps have been taken to decrease the incidence of contamination. First, 
since 2000, pancreatectomy specimens for clinical islet allotransplantation have exclusively been processed under current cGMP regulations. Overall, the risk of islet trans plantation -related septicemia is considered very low in view of the precautions 
detailed in the islet manufacturing protocol.  
5.4.4 S ensitization of the Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519985], islet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519986]- donor histocompatibility antigens (HLA), leading to development of panel 
reactive alloantibodies (PRA). These alloantibodies may develop while the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519987]. 
Furthermore, donor specific alloantibodies may develop after loss of the islet transplant function and discontinuation of the immunosuppressant drug. Data on the development of cytotoxic antibodies against donor HLA in islet allotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519988] (66 -69). In the ITN -
sponsored trial of islet transplantation using the Edmonton protocol of steroid- free 
immuno suppression, [ADDRESS_674491] -transplant 
when measured by [CONTACT_4133]. Two of these 5 subjects experienced primary islet 
non-function. Moreover, data from five participating centers in the current CIT 
consortium indicat e that approximately 25% of the islet alone transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519989] a PRA >20% while on maintenance immunosuppression. These results are comparable to those reported for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519990] e immunosuppression (70- 72). Importantly, the incidence 
of elevated PRA (>20%) in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519991] 84%.  
The available information suggests that there is a strong correlation between islet allograft failure and a rise in anti -donor HLA sensitization as detected by [CONTACT_520059]. 
A potential consequence of high PRA levels in type [ADDRESS_674492] to qualify for a suitable kidney (73).  
5.4.[ADDRESS_674493] study28, about 10% of patie nts with pre -existing retinopathy 
receiving intensive treatment experienced a transient worsening of their retinopathy during the first year, but nonetheless had a lower cumulative incidence of sustained progression when compared to the conventional group after the third year. A transient worsening of retinopathy has not been formally documented in islet transplantation trials, but it is assumed that a similar process might occur. Exclusion of patients with 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/[ADDRESS_674494] -transplant f ollow -up will help to minimize the 
incidence of such occurrences and their morbidity should they occur.  
When type 1 diabetic recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519992] s in the retinopathy 
score, they did not differ significantly in the rate of progression whether retinopathy was mild (Grade P0 to P5) or advanced (Grade P6 to P14) at baseline (74). Long- term 
follow -up of both groups suggested that successful pancreas tra nsplantation may have 
a late beneficial effect that becomes evident only after [ADDRESS_674495] of Successful or Failed Islet Transplantation  
Clinical islet transplantation, as a potential therapy for T1D, has been discussed in 
the m edia and diabetes lay publications with an excessive degree of optimism not 
justified on the basis of clinical results to date. Therefore, failure of the procedure to reverse hyperglycemia and maintain insulin independence could be associated with a level of psychological disappointment that might progress to clinical depression. The 
informed consent process has been carefully organized to minimize unrealistic expectations or legal ramifications. Patients who appear to be incapable of understanding and/or c opi[INVESTIGATOR_519993].

These agents are not recommended for nursing mothers, and it is recommended (and mandated in the current protocol) that women and men of childbearing potential use effective contraception before, during and for at least 4 months following administration of these 
agents.  
 
 
 BASILIXIMAB (SIMULECT®)  
Basiliximab is a chimeric (murine/human) monoclonal antibody (IgG1k) approved 
by [CONTACT_53010] a nd Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis against acute organ 
rejection in adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519995]. It is usually given at a dose of [ADDRESS_674496] infections, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], surgical wound complications, acne, hyper tension, headache, tremor, insomnia, and anemia. In the four 
placebo -controlled studies, the pattern of adverse events in 590 patients treated with 
the recommended dose of basiliximab was similar to that in 594 patients treated with placebo (see product mo nograph for details). Basiliximab did not increase the incidence 
of serious adverse events observed compared with placebo. As with any protein product, anaphylaxis can occur, particularly with repeated administration, but this has been reported only rarely .  
 
 Rabbit  ANTITHYMOCYTE GLOBULIN (THYMOGLOBULIN®)  
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 37 of 73 
 
Rabbit Thymoglobulin® was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 1999 for the treatment for 
acute renal graft rejection in conjunction with concomitant immunosuppression (see 
product monograph for details). It is a polyclonal IgG antibody obtained by [CONTACT_520060] T lymphocytes. Thymoglobulin® has shown a consistent safety profile with most AEs being manageable and reversible; the most common events are fever, chills and leukopenia. While rare, the most severe events include allergic or anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness. As with all immunosuppression, administration of Thymoglobulin® may be associated  with an 
increased risk of infection and development of malignancy (especially of the skin and lymphoid system).  
In 82 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_513160] 1.5 mg/kg/day for 7 – 14 days, the principal 
AEs were fever (52%) and chills (47%) associated wit h the infusions, leucopenia 
(47%), and thrombocytopenia (30%). CMV infection (13%) and PTLD (2%). Neutropenia has been described; anaphylaxis has been reported rarely.  
Published results of the use of Thymoglobulin ® in clinical and experimental islet 
trans plantation are limited to relative small cohorts. Hirshberg et al. described the 
successful role of rabbit ATG and sirolimus in reducing rejection of islet allografts in primates, with no evidence of direct islet toxicity from Thymoglobulin® . Hering et al.  
described a beneficial role of Thymoglobulin® induction (6mg/kg) in [ADDRESS_674497] recurrence of hypoglycemia ( 75). Acute islet rejection was 
described in patients receiving calcineurin- free immunosuppression when sirolimus 
levels fell below 9ng/mL. The use of higher doses of sirolimus exacerbated the neutropenic side effects of Thymoglobulin ®, but these could be managed safely 
without risk of opportunistic infections when appropriate dose reduction and/or 
administration of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G -CSF; Neupogen®) if 
required.  
 
 Alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada ®) 
Alemtuzumab is directed against the CD52 antigen expressed on vir tually all 
lymphocytes and monocytes. The antibody is a powerful depleting agent that causes lysis of all cells expressing this antigen and resulting in a dramatic reduction in the levels of lymphocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood and in the bone  marrow. 
Alemtuzumab has shown to be effective in promoting the engraftment of CD34+ 
enriched stem cell infusions given for the treatment of a variety of hematological disorders ( 106). In clinical trials it has also been used to treat kidney transplant 
rejection, to prevent graft versus host disease and to treat lymphoid malignancies 
(107-110). Ale mtuzumab has also been used effectively in the treatment of various 
autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura ( 111), multiple 
sclero sis.  The effect of Ale mtuzumab on multiple inflammatory cell types may also 
provide a benefit by [CONTACT_520061], thus preventing early islet loss due to the deleterious effect s of cytokines on islets (112, 113).  
 Alemtuzumab , the initial dose of 20mg IV over 3 hours will be given on Day –1 and a 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/[ADDRESS_674498] dose of alemtuzumab  with Benadryl (50mg 
IV), acetaminophen (650mg PO), ibuprofen (400mg PO) and (Solumedrol 125mg iv). 
Pre-medication, WITHOUT Solu- Medrol, will also be given before the second dose of 
alemtuzumab . The most common side -effects of alemtuzumab  include infusion- related 
reactions characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. These usually occur with the initial dose of alemtuzumab . These events are prevented 
or improved with the premedication treatment administered prior to the infusion of alemtuzumab . An increased incidence in infectious complications (when compared to 
other immunosuppressive regimens) was not apparent in 31 renal transplant patients who received alemtuzumab  as induction therapy (113). These patients also received 
prophylactic treatment against PCP and viral infections such as CMV as detailed below. Hematologic Toxicity: Serious and, in rare instances fatal, pancytopenia/marrow 
hypoplasia, autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia have occurred in patients receiving alemtuzumab  therapy. Single doses of 
alemtuzumab  greater than [ADDRESS_674499]’s disease. One third of patients 
developed Graves’ disease between 6 and 18 months after the alemtuzumab  treatment 
(112). This complication has not been described in patients who received alemtuzumab  
for other indications than multiple sclerosis (lymphoid malignancies, renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). Thyroid function will be closely monitored in all patients. Another recent trial has demonstrated a small but significant incidence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 3 cases  in 334 subjects, one resulting in death (this subject did not seek 
medical attention). alemtuzumab In both trials patients were treated with very high 
doses of alemtuzumab  (100mg given over 5 days).  
 
 SIROLIMUS (RAPAMUNE ®)  
The FDA approved sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune ®) as an immunosuppressive 
agent in 1999 (see product monograph for details). In 208 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_513160] 5 mg of sirolimus daily compared to 124 receiving placebo, there was an increased incidence of hyperch olesterolemia (46 vs. 23%), hyperlipemia (57 vs. 23%), 
rash (20 vs. 6%), arthralgia (31 vs. 18%), diarrhea (35 vs. 27%), anemia (33 vs. 21%), leucopenia (13 vs. 8%), thrombocytopenia (30 vs. 9%), and hypokalemia (17 vs. 9%). Side effects are related to dru g concentration and are improved with maintenance of 
the sirolimus 24 -hour trough level between 10–20 ng/mL. Of infections, only mucosal 
herpes simplex virus (HSV) occurred at a greater rate with sirolimus. There was no increase in rate of malignancy (3.4 vs. 3.1%). While sirolimus was originally proposed as a non -nephrotoxic agent, it is becoming apparent that sirolimus -associated 
nephrotoxicity does occur in clinical practice. Crew et al. described two patients with thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to sirolimus exposure121. Sirolimus alters the 
pharmacokinetic profiles of other CNIs ( e.g., tacrolimus) and may thereby [CONTACT_520062] (76). Fervenza et al. described nephrotoxicity from sirolimus in patients 
with chronic glomerulopathies that was non- reversible on cessation of therapy (77). 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 39 of 73 
 
Nephrotoxicity from combined sirolimus and tacrolimus has been described in patients 
with T1D undergoing islet transplantation, particularly where there is underlying pre -
existing r enal damage from diabetes (78, 79).  
The majority of islet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519996], lower extremity edema; perinephric edema and a high incidence of benign ovarian cysts have also been described in islet recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519997]. Pneumonitis and colitis have also occurred (80 -82). The most common (> 30%) adverse reactions are: peripheral 
edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  creatinine 
increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia.  
Concerns have been raised by [CONTACT_520063]/tacrolimus in liver transplant r ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], where there has been a statistically 
increased risk of hepatic artery thrombosis and late death in sirolimus -treated 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. A careful analysis of these events does not establish causative association between sirolimus/tacrolimus and thrombosis or death events. There was no increased association with portal venous thrombosis in the liver transplant trials. While sirolimus continues to be used off -label in islet recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], there is not presently felt to be an 
association between portal thrombus formation in islet recipi[INVESTIGATOR_519998].  
 
 TACROLIMUS (PROGRAF ®)  
Tacrolimus (Prograf ®, FK506) has been in wide clinical use for the prevention of 
allograft rejection since 1994 when the FDA approved it after several years o f testing. 
Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic which inhibits calcineurin after binding intracellularly to FKBP12 within T cells, inhibiting IL -2 transcription. Tacrolimus is 
invariably administered with other immunosuppressive agents but is known to be associated with several side effects including hypertension, diabetes, nephrotoxicity, 
hyperkalemia, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], pruritis, neurotoxicity, neurologic sequelae (including tremor, ataxia, and extremely rarely central pontine myelinolysis), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), interstitial lung disease, BK nephropathy, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (see product monograph for details). In 205 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506539], the  principal AEs were neurologic (tremor [54%], headache [44%], 
insomnia [32%], paresthesia [23%]) and gastrointestinal (diarrhea [44%], nausea [38%], constipation [35%]) complaints, hypertension (50%), and kidney dysfunction 
(52%); hyperkalemia (31%) and hyperglycemia (22% in previous non- diabetics) also 
occurred. The severity of these events appears to be dose dependent, with very high 
plasma levels also producing delirium, seizures, and coma. Complications can be minimized with the relatively low dose long -term therapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_519999].  
 
 MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL (CELLCEPT ®) AND MYCOPHENOLATE SODIUM 
(MYFORTIC ®)  
CellCept® and Myfortic® are associated with: diarrhea, leucopenia, vomiting, and 
evidence of higher frequency of certain type s of infections. CellCept® and Myfortic®

5.4.8 Risks of Immunosuppressive / Anti -inflammatory Therapy: Adali mumab 
(Humira ®) 
Adali mumab  is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for 
human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). I t is FDA -approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis, 
juvenile arthritis,  ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’ s disease, ulcerative 
colitis and uveitis. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha represent important 
treatment advances in a number of inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA ), the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, and inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). TNF -alpha inhibitors offer a targeted strategy that contrasts with the 
nonspecific immunosuppressive agents traditionally used to treat most inflammatory diseases. However, mu ltiple adverse effects of TNF -alpha inhibition have been 
identified through both clinical trials and post -marketing surveillance. These include: 
Injection site reactions, infusion reactions, neutropenia, infections, demyelinating disease, heart failure, cu taneous reactions, malignancy and induction of autoimmunity.  
 
5.4.9 Risks from Adjuvant Interventions  
a. Exenatide Extended -Release (By[CONTACT_28556]®).  
Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, headache and injection- site 
pruritus were the most common adverse effects reported with ER exenatide in clinical trials. Gastrointestinal effects occurred in about 35% of patients, but decreased over 
time. Acute renal failure and acute pancreatitis have been reported in patients with 
diabetes taking exenat ide; whether they were caused by [CONTACT_520064].  Injection -site nodules have been reported in about 77% of patients and 
injection -site reactions in about 17% of patients. Weight loss is reported with 
exenatide. In subjects with T2D who took exenatide for 4 weeks, the average weight loss was 1.3±0.[ADDRESS_674501] of GLP -1 receptor agonists. However, the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D 
treated with combination of exenatide (By[CONTACT_28557]) and exogenous insulin has been low. In the DURATION [ADDRESS_674502] 1 hour prior to taking exenatide .

Thyroid C -cell hyperplas ia has been reported with use of exenatide in rats, and the 
FDA has required a boxed warning about the risk of thyroid C -cell tumors in the 
package insert.  
 
Contraindications for the use of Exenatide include : 
• Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: Exenatide is contraindicated in patients with a 
personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with 
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).  
• Hypersensitivity: Exenatide is contrai ndicated in patients with a prior serious 
hypersensitivity reaction to exenatide or to any of the product components.  
 
Warning and precautions : 
• Risk of Thyroid C -cell Tumors:  In both genders of rats, exenatide extended-
release caused a dose -related and  treatment- duration dependent increase in the 
incidence of thyroid C -cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically 
relevant exposures compared to controls. A statistically significant increase in malignant thyroid C -cell carcinomas was observed in  female rats receiving exenatide 
extended -release at 25 -times clinical exposure compared to controls and higher 
incidences were noted in males above controls in all treated groups at ≥2- times 
clinical exposure. The potential of exenatide extended -release t o induce C -cell tumors 
in mice has not been evaluated. Other GLP -[ADDRESS_674503] also induced 
thyroid C -cell adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice and rats at 
clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether By[CONTACT_497646] C -
cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of exenatide extended -release -induced rodent thyroid C -cell tumors could 
not be determined by [CONTACT_57665]. Serum calcitonin was not assesse d in the clinical trials supporting the approval of By[CONTACT_28556].   
Serum calcitonin is a biological marker of MTC. Patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should be  referred to an endocrinologist for further 
evaluation. Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with By[CONTACT_28556]. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecess ary procedures, due to the low 
specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease.    
 • Acute Pancreatitis:  Based on post marketing data, exenatide has been associated 
with acute pancreatitis, including fat al and non- fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing 
pancreatitis.  
 • Hypoglycemia:  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when exenatide is used in 
combination with a sulfonylurea. Therefore, patients receiving By[CONTACT_497647] a sulfonylurea may require a lower dose of the sulfonylurea to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. It is also possible that the use of By[CONTACT_497648] -
independent insulin secretagogues (e.g. Meglitinides) could increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

• Renal Impairment: By[CONTACT_520065] (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end -stage renal disease and should 
be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation. In patients with end- stage 
renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of By[CONTACT_28557] 5 mcg were not well tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects. Because By[CONTACT_497650], treatment may worsen renal function. Use By[CONTACT_520066] (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min). By[CONTACT_520067]- stage 
renal disease or severe renal impairment.   
There have been post marketing reports of altered renal function with exenatide, 
including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Some of these events occurred in patients receiving one or more pharmacologic agents known to affect renal function or hydration status such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, or 
diuretics. Some events occurred in patients who had been experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, with or without dehydration. Reversibi lity of altered renal 
function has been observed in many cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including exenatide. Exenatide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in preclinical or clinical studies.  
 • Gastrointestinal Disease:  exenatide is commonly associated with gastrointestinal 
adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  
 
• Immunogenicity:  Patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following 
treatment with By[CONTACT_28556]. Antiexena tide antibodies were measured in all By[CONTACT_28556] -
treated patients in the five comparator -controlled 24- 30 week studies of By[CONTACT_28556]. In 
6% of By[CONTACT_28556] - treated patients, antibody formation was associated with an 
attenuated glycemic response.   • Hypersensitivity:  There have been post marketing reports of serious 
hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis and angioedema) in patients treated with exenatide.  
 • Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing 
conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with By[CONTACT_497653].   
 • Pancreatic Cancer: A recent meta- analysis suggested an increase rate of 
pancreatic cancer in patients with T2D who used GLP -1 receptor agonists or DPPIV 
inhibitors. More recently, an analysis of histologic sections from patients with T2D suggested expansion of exocrine and endocrine pancreas with incretin therapy and increased exocrine pancreas dysplasia and the potential for glucagon -producing 
neuroendocrine tumors . As a result of these reports, the FDA is initiating an investigation of the safety of DPPI V inhibitors and GLP -1 receptor agonists. In the

event that this and other studies show efficacy of this and other agents in T1D, further 
assessment of the risk/benefit ratio will be necessary in the context of the forthcoming investigations. The potential  risks for pancreatic cancer or medullary carcinoma of the 
thyroid are believed to be minimal for participants in this study because of the very short exposure to study drug.   
b. Pegylated G -CSF (Neulasta®).  
There are some potential risks associated with pegylated G -CSF therapy. 
Although the risk is entirely theoretical at this time, there is a possibility that the G -
CSF injections could worsen and not improve the  autoimmunity associated with T1D. 
The side effect profile of pegylated G -CSF injection will be monitored by  [CONTACT_520068] [ADDRESS_674504] 5 days of G -CSF therapy and 
weekly thereafter.  Pegylated G -CSF carries a risk (10 -20% of patients) of bone pain 
and a risk (less than 10%) of fever, pain or  redness at the si te of injection, headache, 
and dizziness. There is also a risk that the subjects’ WBC could become elevated while taking G -CSF. There are also now a small  number of reports in which 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_520000]/or splenic rupture. This risk 
will be explicitly discussed in the consent  form and subjects will have close physical 
examination and phone follow -up to screen for any signs or  symptoms. In addition, 
weekly phone calls for the month following therapy will be used to document any adverse reactions. The CBC and complete metabolic pro file at each blood draw will 
be carefully reviewed for  any clinically relevant abnormalities. T here are no other 
known long- term risks from a 12 week course of G -CSF.  
 
c. Ultra -refined omega -3 EPA/DHA concentrate (ZoneLabs® OmegaRx®2)  
Omega- [ADDRESS_674505] as 
well. As with any drug, it is possible that subjects could experience an allergic reaction to OMEGA -3. Such allergic reactions include: itching, skin rash, sudden 
drop in blood pressure, loss of consciousness and/or associated with seizures, including the possibility of death.  
  
d. Supplemental oxygen.  
Low flow supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula can lea d to dryness of nares 
and bleeding after prolonged use. Oxygen toxicity has been associated with hyperoxia from high FiO2. However, as per protocol, subjects will receive supplemental oxygen at FiO2 36% and data in the literature suggest that by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_520001] O2 below 40 to 50%, 
oxygen toxicity can be minimized.    5.4.10 Risk of Study Procedures  
 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 44 of 73 
 
The procedures involved with the care of research subjects undergoing clinical islet 
transplantation include risks pertaining to: a) blood draw testing, b) metabolic 
stimulation testing, c) the procedural risks of islet implantation, and d) specific follow -
up testing.  
 
 BLOOD DRAW TESTING  
Peripheral blood draws performed during these research studies will not exceed [ADDRESS_674506] may experience some discomfort at the site of 
the needle entry, and there is risk of bruising at the s ite. There is a remote risk of 
fainting or local infection.   
 METABOLIC STIMULATION TESTING  
The risks associated with metabolic testing are generally regarded as minor. Placement of IV cannulae may be associated with pain and discomfort at the puncture si te, 
bruising, bleeding, interstitial infusion of fluids, local vein thrombosis, infection or thrombophlebitis.  
The administration of bolus glucose or insulin by [CONTACT_520069], or rarely may induce ketoacidosis.   
 HYPOGLYCEMIA  
Severe hypoglycemia is a risk associated with the infusion of islets. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia in the immediate post -transplant period is a rare event. Frequent blood 
glucose monitoring immediately following islet transplantation  is recommended to 
avoid severe unrecognized hypoglycemia in the early post -transplant period. In 
longer -term follow -up, life -threatening hypoglycemia (Grade 4) occurred in six of the 
236 SAEs reported to CITR (93) For these six occurrences, the events occ urred at the 
following time intervals; [ADDRESS_674507] the second infusion. The loc al CITR 
investigators did not attribute any of the six events to the infusion procedure or to the immunosuppression medication.  
 
 CHEST X -RAY 
A chest x -ray exposes subject  to a dose of radiation equal to approximately the amount 
one receives in [ADDRESS_674508] , but this is not known for sure.  
 
 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)  
The risk of MRI performed  with intravenous  gadolinium contrast is that of an allergic 
reaction which can be life threatening (anaphylaxis).  Some patients with impaired kidney function who have received gadolinium have experienced a worsening of their kidney function that in some cases has been severe and irreversible and has required dialysis. Some patients may also experience claustrophobia and i f this should happen

can be arranged.  
 
 FLU ORODEOXYGLUCOSE POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY 
INTEGRATED WITH COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (18F-FDG PET/CT)  
The risk associated with this procedure is the exposure to radiation. To better 
understand the amount of radiation that people receive from various medical X -ray 
exams it is best to compare it to the radiation people are exposed  to from natural 
sources in the environment. The unit of measurement for an effective radiation dose is called the millisievert (mSv). The average person in the [LOCATION_002] receives a dose of about [ADDRESS_674510] X -ray is the same as the amount of radiation a 
person is exposed to from their natural surroundings in 10 days  (94) . 
 The radiation exposure from a PET -CT can range from 12 to 30 mSv, which is 
comparable to  what a person would receive from natural background radiation over a 
period of 3 to 9 years  (94-95). This degree of radiation exposure has been associated 
with a less than 1% increase in lifetime risk of cancer  (95, 96, 97) . 
 
 
 
 RISKS FROM ISLET TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE IN RADIOLOGY:  
Islets will be transplanted under fluoroscopic guidance (X -RAY imaging). The 
procedure will expose subject  to a dose of radiation equal to approximately the amount 
one receives in [ADDRESS_674511] , but this is not known for sure.  
 
 CENTRAL LINE  
A Central line will be needed for induction. The risks related to a PI[INVESTIGATOR_520002], infection, and clotting of the veins.  In case a 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_520003], a c entral line in the neck might be placed. The risks related 
to central line in the neck are:  bleeding (internal or external), lung collapse, vein 
thrombosis , damage of adjacent structures , irregular heart rhythm, infe ction, shortness 
of breath , and hypotension.  
 
 CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING  
It may cause skin irritation at the site of implantation. It may be related to:  bruising, discomfort, pa in, bleeding, redness, raised bumps, local infection, and appearance of 
a small “freckle- like” dot where the needle was inserted.  It may lead to an infection 
where the sensor was inserted.  If there is pain, redness, irritation, or rash at insertion site, the sensor will be removed and re -inserted in a different site.

5.6.5 RABBIT ANTI -THYMOCYTE GLOBULIN -Induced  Anaphylaxis  
In rare instances, anaphylaxis has been reported with Thymoglobulin® use. In such 
cases, the infus ion should be terminated immediately. Medical personnel should be 
available to treat subjects who experience anaphylaxis. Emergency treatment such as 
0.3 mL to 0.5 mL aqueous epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000 dilution) subcutaneously and other resuscitative measures including oxygen, IV fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated, should be provided. Thymoglobulin® or other rabbit immunoglobulins should not be administered again for such subjects.  
 5.6.6 RABBIT ANTI -THYMOCYTE GLOBULIN -Induced C ytokine  Release  
Thymoglobulin® infusion may cause cytokine release -related fever and chills. To 
minimize these, the first dose should be infused over a minimum of 6 hours into a high-flow vein. Also, premedication with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, acetaminophen, and/or an antihistamine will be provided in order to minimize the reaction incidence and/or intensity. At any sign of the above reaction, slowing the infusion rate by 50% 
will also occur.

PLT >50 x 109/L, after which sirolimus is resumed at 50% of the dose that preceded 
the drop in PLT to <50 x 109/L. If the  PLT is between 50 and 75 x 109/L, reduce anti -
thymoglobulin dose by 50% until PLT is >75 x 109/L. 
5.6.9 N ephrotoxicity  
A sustained  increase in serum creatinine ≥ 2 times pre -transplant baseline or  
decrease in their GFR of ≥ 33% compared to baseline warrants a prompt referral to a 
nephrologist for evaluation. If it is determined that the decrease in renal function is 
attributable to CNI immunosuppressive therapy, the treating physician should choose  
a therapeutic alternative. A repeat assessment of creat inine  should be performed [ADDRESS_674519] of care.  
5.6.10 Premature Discontinuation of Study Treatment (Transition to “Off -Protocol” 
Treatment)  
Study tr eatment may be prematurely discontinued for any subject for any of the 
following reasons:  
1. The subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.  2. The investigator believes that the study treatment is no longer in the best interest of the su bject.  
3. Graft Failure.  
4. An unexpected related SAE. The agent(s) to which the event is attributed will be discontinued.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment will remain in the study until normal termination, for the purpose of monitor ing safety and efficacy parameters and 
will enter the post graft failure follow -up (section 5.6.2) . Data from these subjects will 
be used in the intent -to-treat analysis. These subjects are permitted to simultaneously 
enroll in a specific graft failure fol low-up protocol, if available.  
 
5.7 Risks of surgery and anesthesia  
Islet cells will be placed in the omentum by [CONTACT_520071]. The general risks of surgery include bleeding, wound infection, wound hernia, bowel obstruction (adhesions), deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risks 
associated with anesthesia include difficulties with airway management, cardiac arrhythmias and drug- related anaphylactic reactions. Pain and discomfort at the surgical 
site is exp ected in the early period following surgery, and may be reduced by [CONTACT_520072][INVESTIGATOR_2573], opi[INVESTIGATOR_161128]- steroidal analgesic medications. If an ileus develops, a prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_520009] . The risks related to the intrahepatic islet tran splantation 
are listed below:  
 
• moderate pain or discomfort;  
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 50 of 73 
 
• bleeding from the liver  puncture, which may require a blood transfusion;  
• damage to liver or blood vessels , which may require surgery;  
• damage to gallbladder, which may lead to the removal of gallbladder;  
• bleeding as a result of the blood thinners used to prepare the islets;  
• portal vein thrombosis , which may heal itself or may lead to the need for a liver 
transplant;  
• shortness of breath or apnea as a result of the sedation used for the procedur e; 
• pulmonary edema or/and pleura effusion;  
• death from complications (this risk is rare but possible);  
• liver or kidney injury that may or may not resolve; and severe hypoglycemia during the 
procedure, or in the hours afterwards.  
 
 
5.8 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_520010]:  
1.  Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening AE possibly related to the use of the  test 
therapy.  
2.  Primary non- function (PNF) occurs in [ADDRESS_674520] -transplant . 
3   C-peptide less than 0.3 ng/mL (on random testing, at baseline and 1- [ADDRESS_674521] 
MMTT) at [ADDRESS_674522] eligibility will be confirmed through the performance of the screening visit procedures detailed in the Schedule of Events (SOE). More than one visit may be necessary to complete all of the screening procedures.  
6.[ADDRESS_674523]/Baseline 
 
After completion of the screening assessments required to confirm eligibility for the 
study, he/she will be listed for an islet transplant. Waitlist assessments will be repeated at pre-defined intervals as detailed in SOE. Results from assessments done closest to the start 
of immunosuppression will be used as the  subject’s baseline values. All one -time 
waitlist/baseline assessments should be completed on Day - 2, whenever possible, but 
always prior to the start of immunosuppression. As in any other transplant situation, medical conditions that arise ( e.g., new seri ous infection, malignancy, compliance issues, 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 51 of 73 
 
etc.) will automatically trigger a re -evaluation to determine if the subject remains qualified 
for the protocol. Only qualified subjects may proceed to donor organ matching and 
transplant.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_674524] will undergo a 24- month follow -up period following their islet transplant. 
Please refer to the Schedule of Events, for the clinical time points of specific follow -up 
study procedures.  
Subjects will be followed for adverse events only until 24 mont hs after their islet 
transplan t. 
 
6.5 Imaging modalities to localize the transplanted islet  allograft . 
 
A major challenge in islet transplantation has been the identification of imaging studies that may allow for in -vivo visualization of the transplanted islet allograft. Ideally, such 
imaging techniques should allow to adequately correlate the visualized islet mass with islet graft metabolic function  and also permit quantification of the islet mass.   
 The use of MRI in t he assessment of the peritoneum, particularly for peritoneal 
malignancies, is well established in clinical practice.  In addition, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for primary pelvic/gynecologic malignancies due to its superior contrast resolution. Considering that in this protocol islets are transplanted onto the omentum and that it is possible that some of the islets may have not adhered onto the omentum but travelled down and engrafted in the pelvis, we have opted for the utilization of MRI with 
intravenous contrast as the imaging modality for localization of the i slet graft in the 
abdomen and pelvis.  
 Positron Emission Tomography integrated with Computed Tomography (PET/CT) has been used as a functional imaging modality for identification and visual ization of islet 
allografts. Several tracers have been evaluated including 
18F-FDG,  GLP -1, Exendin- [ADDRESS_674525] recently [11C]5-HTP  (98-102). We will perform an  18F-FDG PET/CT study for 
localization of the islets . PET/CT is a functional imaging technique mos tly used in the field 
of oncology. It comprises the use of a radiopharmaceutical which is administered intravenously to the patient. The uptake of the tracer by [CONTACT_520073] a PET scanner and CT providing two and three -dimensional images of  the distribution of the 
tracer in the body. The most common tracer used is 2- deoxy- 2-[fluorine -18]fluoro -D-
glucose (
18F-FDG), also known as fluorodeoxyglucose, an analogue of glucose containing 
the positron- emitting radionucleide fluorine -18. 18F-FDG is t aken up by [CONTACT_520074]- metabolic activity such as 
cancer cells thus providing significant information regarding tumor identification and

persistent graft function and fasting C -peptide ≥0.5 ng/mL .  
 
6.6 Mechanistic assays  
 
Immunologic assays  
We will obtain islet transplant donor splenocytes and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_520011] 
T-cell assays . A maximum of 50 ml of blood will be obtained from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_520012] -donor reactivity. Frequency of T -cell assays will 
be determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_520013] 6 months.  
Cytokine/Chemokines  
We will perform a cytokine/chemokine panel to explore the inflammatory milieu  during 
the peri -transplant period. In addition, we will also assess cytokine/chemokine profiles at 
[ADDRESS_674527] -transplantation to evaluate the role of inflammation on islet 
allograft function.  
Unmethylated prepro insulin DNA  
It has been postulated that as β -cells die unmethylated prepro insulin DNA emanates from 
the β -cells and is detectable in the circulation. Thus, changes in circulating levels of 
unmethylated preproinsulin DNA during the peri -transplant period may correlate wi th 
beta cell loss.   
Investigators from the Human Islet Research Network (HIRN) have developed assays to  
detect circulating  unmethylated preproinsulin DNA. We will collaborate with the HIRN 
for validation of these assays by [CONTACT_520075].  Serum and plasma samples  will be 
obtained pre -transplant, 1hr, 3hr and [ADDRESS_674528] -transplant. S amples will be  shipped to the Juvenile 
Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Core for Assay Validation at the Benaroya Research Institute. Results from these assays will not be made available to our center.   
7 A
DVERSE EVENT S 
 This section defines the types of AEs and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, 
grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the CIT -TCAE V5.0  Date: 03Aug2011.  
 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/2018  
Page 53 of 73 
 
An AE is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, symptom 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), or disease that is temporally associated with the use 
of a study- related treatment whether considered related to the treatment or not.   
 
7.1 Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is defined per 21CFR§312.32 as “ an adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes .” This includes but is not limited to any of the following 
events:  
1. Results in death, 
2. Is life threatening, (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event/reaction in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/ reaction which hypothetically might have caused death if it were  more 
severe),  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322519],  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
6. Is a medically important event or reaction. Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 7. Other conditions specified in the protocol. 
 In addition, events that occur at a higher than expected frequency, as determined by 
[CONTACT_520076], may be consider SAE’s. Regardless of the relatedness of 
the AE to study drug, the event must be reported as an SAE if it meets any of the above definitions. 
 
7.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” when its nature (specificity) or severity is not 
consistent with available product information, such as safety information provided in the package insert, the protocol, or the investigator’s brochure.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_674529] prematurely withdraws from the study.  
 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/[ADDRESS_674530]. AEs may be discovered 
through any of these methods:  
 1. Observing the subject.  
2. Questioning the subject, this should be done in an objective manner.  
3. Receiving an unsolici ted complaint from the subject. 
4. An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation (e.g., a 
radiograph, an ultrasound, or an electrocardiogram) can also indicate an AE. If this is the case, then the evaluation that produced the value or result should be repeated until the value or result returns to normal or can be explained and the subject’s safety is not at risk. If an abnormal value or result is determined by [CONTACT_11150], it must be reported as an AE.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_674531] all AEs on the appropriate AE case 
report form (CRF) regardless of their severity or relation to study medication or study procedure. The investigator will treat subjects experiencing AEs appropriatel y and observe 
them at suitable intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes.  
 
7.5 Reporting Procedure  
The following process for reporting an SAE ensures compliance with the ICH 
guidelines and 21CFR §312.32.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_674532] reporting. (i.e., should be included in the investigational new drug 
[IND] annual report to the health- authorities). This requirement applies if the AE is 
classified as any of the following:  
Serious, expected, and drug related.  
Serious, expected, and not drug related.  
Serious, unexpected, and not drug related.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_674533] be reported by [CONTACT_520077] 15 days; fatal or life -threatening events must be reported within [ADDRESS_674534] (IRB) and Ethics Committee  
The investigator will ensure the timely  dissemination of SAE information, 
including expedited reports, to the IRB and Ethics Committee (EC) in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. 
 
 PREGNANCY Sexually -active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the 
course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study 
VERSION 3.4 DATE:  12/03/[ADDRESS_674535] that they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time duri ng 
study participation. Male subjects should also notify study team in case their female 
partners become pregnant during the study participation. 
 
 REPORTING PREGNANCY AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
All pregnancies that are identified during the study must be f ollowed to conclusion 
and the outcome of each must be reported. The investigator should report all pregnancies within [ADDRESS_674536] should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy, and a follow -up SAE report form detailing the outcome 
of the pregnancy should be submitted. 
 
7.6 Grading and Attribution 
7.6.1 Grading Criteria  
The study site will grade the severity of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_520078] -TCAE V5.0  Date: 03Aug2011. This 
provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret 
data, and to arti culate the clinical significance of all AEs.  
AE severity will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following 
standards in the CIT -TCAE manual:  
Grade 1 = Mild AE.  
Grade 2 = Moderate AE.  
Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable AE.  
Grade 4 = Life -threat ening or disabling AE. 
Grade 5 = Death.  
AEs, not included in the CIT-TCAE listing, should be recorded and their severity 
graded from 1 to 5 according to the General Grade Definition provided below:  
All AEs will be reported and graded, by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461] , whether they are or are 
not related to di sease progression or treatment.  
7.6.2  Definition of Attribution  
Attribution will only be determined and collected for all adverse events.  
The relatedness, or attribution, of an AE to islet transplantation, which includes the 
transplant procedure and/or the islet product, the secondary investigational agent, or to the immunosuppression and/or infection prophylaxis will be determined by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator will also record the determination of attribution on the

1 WL = Waiting List. BL = Baseline. These samples can be obtained at any time before transplant. Repeat assessments as indicated while subject is on the waiting list every 6 
months or annually from screening. All one -time WL/BL assessments should be completed on Day -2 whenever possible, but always prior to start of immunosuppression. For 
repeat WL/BL assessments, results from test done closest  to the start of immunosuppression will be used as the baseline value.  
2 Day 0 = the day of transplant.  
3 Chemistry includes: Sodium, albumin, magnesium, chloride, potassium, alk phosphatase, total bilirubin, CO 2, creatinine, ALT (SGPT), BUN, gamma GT,  
glucose, AST (SGOT), calcium, phosphorus.  
[ADDRESS_674551] within 72 hours prior to the initiation of study medication.  
5 Serology includes: HBc Ab, HBs Ab, HBs Ag, HCV Ab, and HIV. Do not repeat Hepatitis B tests if HBs Ab was previously positive.  
[ADDRESS_674552] -transplant if reactivation is suspected.  
11 Spot urine  testing  includes: albumin, protein, and creatinine  
[ADDRESS_674553] for participants with graft failure. Results of tests performed at the time of graft failure will be used for day 75 endpoint calculations.  
  
 
  
13 MMTT with Acetaminophen (to measure gastric emptying) include s 0, [ADDRESS_674554] (BSR) is completed using information gathered from subject diary logs, glucometer download data, and insul in requirements.

16 Data from 20053135 protocol can be used for this visit. If data was collected more than 12 months prior to enrollment, screening labs from visit 2 should be repeated.  
17 All visits that include a physical exam are in person at Miami  
18 If Sirolimus is used, levels should be checked concomitant with Tacrolimus levels.  
19 Pro-inflammatory  cytokines/chemokines  
20 Samples for pro -inflammatory  cytokines/chemokines for day 0 will be collected at 12 and 24 hrs after transplant  
21 Daily while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. For D -dimer, a sample will be obtained prior to placement of peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) for Thymoglobulin infusi on.  
22 Day of admission 
23 Day of admission and will be continued as clinically indicated  
24 C-peptide/glucose creatinine ratio calculation is: [C -peptide (ng/mL) x100]/[glucose (mg/dL) x creatinine (mg/dL)] 
25 Urine C -peptide/Creatinine ratio is obtained from a spot urine. During protocol scheduled site visits coinciding with MMTT, spot urine fo r C-peptide/creatinine ratio will be 
obtained before and at completion of MMTT.  
26 A maximum of 50 ml of blood will be obtained to perform T -cell assays to evaluate for anti -donor reactivity. Frequency of T -cell assays will be determined by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_520013] 6 months. 
27 IgG and IgE to rabbit serum proteins and epi[INVESTIGATOR_520026]. After transplantation, samples for these a ntibodies may be obtained as clinically indicated (e.g. 
in ca se of a patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_520027]).  
28 AA/EPA ratio will be measured monthly starting at POD - 2 until target levels are achieved and as clinically indicated thereafter . 
29 Samples for unmethylated preproinsulin DNA wi ll be collected as follows:  
- Serum and plasma samples will be obtained pre -transplant, 1hr, 3hr and [ADDRESS_674556] -transplant.  
30  To be performed in patients with persistent graft function and fasting C -peptide ≥0.5 ng/mL.  
 31Test will be done prior to listing subject in UNOS waiting list.

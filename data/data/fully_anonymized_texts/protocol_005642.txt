 Protocol Synopsis 
Protocol Number: 5714 
Protocol Title: Assessment of Safety of Air Travel in Patients with Diffuse Cystic 
Lung Disease 
Study Chair: Nishant Gupta, MD 
Statistician: Laura E James 
Consortium: Rare Lung Diseases 
Participating Sites: University of Cincinnati  
Activation Date: December 4, 2015 
Sample Size: 300 subjects - 100 with Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome (B HD), 200 
with Pulmonary Langerhans Ce ll Histiocytosis (PLCH) 
Target Enrollment Period: Sept ember 2015 – September 2016 
Study Design: This is a questionnaire-based study of patients with diffuse cystic 
lung diseases (DCLDs) to gather i nformation relevant to safety of 
air travel, especially pertaining to the risk of pneumothorax 
associated with air travel. In addition, this study will be use d to 
further characterize clinical aspects of disease and establish a 
contact [CONTACT_317641].  
Primary Study Objective(s):  To define the risk of pneumothor ax associated with air travel i n 
patients with DCLD. 
Secondary Study 
Objective(s):  To establish a contact [CONTACT_317642] 
 To define the clinical pheno type of each DCLD in their 
respective cohort of patients 
 To define current screening pra ctices for surveillance of 
disease-specific anomalies (i.e. renal tumors in BHD) 
 The study will enroll participant s through the c linic network at the 
Rare Lung Disease Consortium  (RLDC) and through the BHD 
and PLCH foundation websites. Participants will have access to 
the questionnaire via REDCap (an online data management 
system) and each participant will be provided a link to complet e 
the survey. In case of lack of i nternet access or inability to 
complete the online questionnaire, a paper survey will be maile d 
out with a pre-paid envelope  to return the survey.  
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
 Adult, age 18 or older 
 English literate 
 Signed, dated informed consent; either given 
electronically or via paper form 
 Diagnosis of BHD, or PLCH as defined by [CONTACT_317643], histopathological and/or genetic criteria.  
 For BHD, diagnosis would include the presence of 
fibrofolliculomas/trichodiscomas  on skin biopsy, or the 
presence of pathogenic FLCN mutations.  
 For PLCH, it would include characteristic radiographic 
findings and tissue biopsy consistent with PLCH 
(presence of CD1a positive Langerhans cells or 
stellate fibrosis in late stages). 
 Exclusion Criteria: 
 Inability to give in formed consent

 Outcome Measures: Number of pneum othoraces associ ated with air travel, estimated 
as a percentage of the number of flights taken. 
Statistical Considerations 
(sample size and analysis 
plan): Data from all surveys will be pooled together. The rate of 
pneumothorax will be esti mated as a percent age of the number of  
flights taken. We will compar e other diseas e and patient 
characteristics to try to deter mine factors associated with an 
increased risk of in-flight pneumothorax. 
Variables collected  Contact [CONTACT_3031] 
 Demographics 
 Age, gender, ethnicity 
 Medical history 
 Diagnosis 
 Surveillance information  for associated clinical 
anomalies, such as renal tumors in BHD 
 Evaluation of dyspnea, other pulmonary problems and 
need for supplemental oxygen 
 Family history 
 S m o k i n g  h i s t o r y  
 Pneumothorax information (diagnosis, management, 
measures to prevent prevention such as pleurodesis, relationship with flights) 
 Flight history 
 Effect of pneumothoraces on attitudes towards 
undertaking air travel 
 
Ethical and Scientific Review 
Procedures Institutional Review Board appr oval will be obtained. Informed 
consent will be obtained from participants. Every effort will b e 
made to protect participant conf identiality according to privac y 
laws and medical record confidentiality regulations.

 Lay Summary 
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is an uncommon genetic disease ch aracterized by [CONTACT_317644], as well as lung cyst formation.  These lung cysts can rupture thus 
placing patients with BHD at a higher risk for development of p neumothoraces, or collapsed 
lungs.  
Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is an uncommon d isease characterized by [CONTACT_317645], and is strongly associated wit h smoking cigarettes. Similar to 
BHD, patients with PLCH have an increased risk of development o f pneumothoraces. 
 
The safety of air travel in patients with BHD and PLCH is not established. The concern with air 
travel in these diseases is related to the risk of cyst expansi on with decreasing atmospheric 
pressure, which could lead to cyst rupture causing a pneumothor ax. Safety of air travel has 
been studied for patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), another rare cystic lung 
disease. Based on the results from studies done in patients with LAM, recommendations regarding air travel are provided to patients with BHD and PLCH. The aim of this study is to conduct a survey-based assessment of patients with BHD and PLCH  and establish the risk of 
pneumothorax associated with air travel in these diseases.   
As a follow up to the original protocol, we plan to re-contact [CONTACT_317646]. We will obtain results of their lung function tests and 
images of CT chest to correlate PFT data and cyst preponderance (size, number, volume etc.) 
with the risk for spontaneous pneumothorax.   
 Detailed Description 
The aim of this study is to conduct survey-based assessments for the safety of air travel in patients with BHD and PLCH. The study will enroll patients thro ugh the clinic network at Rare 
Lung Disease Consortium (RLDC) and through the BHD and PLCH foundation websites. Patients will have access to the questionnaire via REDCap (an o nline data management 
system) and each patient will be provided with a link to comple te the survey. In case of lack of 
Internet access or inability to complete the online questionnai re, a paper survey will be mailed 
out with a pre-paid and addressed envelope to return the survey . Paper surveys returned to 
Nishant Gupta, MD [ADDRESS_1028964] registry for these patients, in order to facilitate fut ure studies.  
 
This research will be accomplished as part of the Rare Lung Dis ease Clinical Network 
Consortium, with data stored and analyzed by [CONTACT_5038] 
(DMCC) at the University of South [LOCATION_012] as part of the NIH-supported Rare Disease 
Consortium.

2.0 Specific Aims (Hypothesis and Objectives) 
 
 Hypothesis 
The hypothesis to be tested is that air travel is safe in patie nts with diffuse cystic lung diseases, 
and there is no increased risk of pneumothorax in this disease population related to air travel.  
 
 Objectives 
1. To define the risk of pneumothorax related to air travel in patients with BHD and PLCH.  
 
2. To establish a contact [CONTACT_317647], in order to facilitate 
participation in future trials.  
 
3. To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with BHD and PLCH, as 
well as ascertain clinical practices related to management and surveillance of related medical 
conditions, such as surveillance of renal tumors in patients wi th BHD.  
 
4. To determine the relationship between lung function, and rad iographic cyst characteristics 
and the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with BHD a nd PLCH.

3.0 Background 
BHD is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited genodermatosis characterized by [CONTACT_317648], kidney tumors, and pulmonary cysts 
1. Pulmonary cysts are seen in 80-
100% of patients with BHD 2,3, and lead to an increased risk of development of pneumothorax in 
these patients 2. Zbar et al., have reported that the risk of development of pn eumothorax is 32-
fold higher in patients with BHD as compared to the general pop ulation 4.  
Atmospheric pressure changes have the potential to cause cyst e xpansion leading to an 
increased chance of cyst rupture causing a pneumothorax. Based on this risk, patients with BHD are advised to not undertake scuba diving 
5, although no disease specific data exists for 
this recommendation. In general, air travel is considered to be  safe in patients with diffuse cystic 
lung diseases 6, although disease specific data for safety of air travel in BH D are lacking.  
PLCH is a rare diffuse cystic lung disease seen most commonly in young-middle aged adults, 
and is associated with exposure to cigarette smoke in greater t han 90% of patients 7. 
Approximately 15% of patients with PLCH develop a pneumothorax over their lifetime, with a 
recurrence rate of approximately 60% after a sentinel event 8. Similar to BHD, recommendations 
regarding air travel are given to patients with PLCH on the bas is of extrapolation from other 
diseases.  
 
Having specific information about safety of air travel in BHD a nd PLCH will help these patients 
make informed decisions about air travel. We aim to conduct a questionnaire-based 
assessment of patients with BHD and PLCH to ascertain the risk of pneumothorax related to air travel. In the first part of this study we will distribute the questionnaires for BHD, followed later 
by [CONTACT_317649]. In addition, we aim to establish a contact [CONTACT_317650].  
 
With the current amendment, we will re-contact [CONTACT_317651] D and PLCH, who gave us the 
permission to contact [CONTACT_317652]. We wil l ask permission to obtain their 
medical records, specifically their pulmonary function tests (P FTs), and CT scan(s) of the chest. 
We will correlate the PFT data and cyst features such as cyst n umber, size, and volume with the 
risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. These results will provide us  the ability to do individual, 
patient-specific risk stratification for spontaneous pneumothor ax in patients with BHD and 
PLCH.

5.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The study protocol will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_163000] l Institutes of Health (NIH) 
before submission to the University of Cincinnati’s IRB and the University of South [LOCATION_012] 
(USF) for approval. Participant enrollment may only begin with IRB approved consent forms. 
This is an observational study that meets the federal definitio n of minimal risk. 
 
Since this is a survey based registry study, traditional study monitoring will not occur. We do not 
expect any adverse events (AEs) nor will we solicit them. If participants contact [CONTACT_317655], USF will report the adverse event to the 
USF IRB and the Consortium.  Otherwise patients will not be solicited for adverse events. The questionnaire data will be stored in a password protected electronic format in REDCap. Only the investigators will have access to the data files. Paper files will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked office.  
 
The medical records will only be obtained after getting the required permissions from the patients. Since no intervention is being planned for the partic ipants, there will be minimal risk, 
and we do not expect any adverse effects. The patient records will be kept in a locked cabinet at all times, and access restricted only to the study personnel.    
 Study Oversight 
The Study Chair has primary oversight responsibility of this st udy.  
 
 Definitions and Standards 
The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network defines an adverse event as:  “…an unfavorable 
and unintended sign, symptom or disease associated with a parti cipant’s participation in a Rare 
Diseases Clinical Research Network study.”  Serious adverse events include those events that:  “result in death; are life-threatening; require 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005]; create persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defects.”   An unexpected adverse event is defined as any adverse experienc e…the specificity or severity 
of which is not consistent with the risks of information described in the protocol.   
Expected adverse events are those that are identified in the research protocol as having been 
previously associated with or having the potential to arise as a consequence of participation in 
the study 
 All reported adverse events will be classified using the Common  Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed and maintained by [CONTACT_5042].Only those events associated with  the conduct of the study and as de fined above are reportable.  
 
 Reporting Timeline 
 
Within 24 hours (of learning of the event), investigators must report any repo rtable Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) that: 
Is considered life-threatening/disabling or results in death of  subject 
-OR- Is Unexpected/Unanticipated  
NIH Approved 02-28-[ADDRESS_1028972] report all other reportable SAEs within 5 working days  (of learning of the 
event). 
All other (suspected) reportable AEs must be reported to the RD CRN within 20 working days  
of the notification of the event or of the site becoming aware of the event. 
 Local institutional reporting requirements to IRBs, any CRU oversight committee and the FDA, if appropriate, remain the responsibility of the treating physicia n and the Study Chair.
 
 
 RDCRN Adverse Event Data Ma nagement System (AEDAMS) 
Upon entry of a serious adverse event, the DMCC created Adverse  Event Data Management 
System (AEDAMS) will immediately notify the Study Chair, site P Is, the Medical Review Officer, 
and any additional agencies of any r eported adverse events via email.  
 
Serious adverse events: The committee appointed Medical Review Officer (MRO) determines 
causality (definitely not related, probably not related, possib ly related, probably related, 
definitely related) of the adverse event. The MRO may request c hanges to the protocol or 
consent form as a consequence of the adverse event. A back-up notification system is in place 
so that any delays in review by [CONTACT_66124] a specified period of time are forwarded to a secondary reviewer. The Adverse Event Data Management System (A EDAMS) maintains audit 
trails and stores data (and data updated) and communication rel ated to any adverse event in 
the study. The DMCC will post aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not serious and expected, unexpected) for si te investigators and IRBs. 
 
 Known Risks/Discomforts Associated with Study and Procedures 
There is a risk of breach of confidentiality. The risks of comp leting the questionnaires include 
fatigue, anxiety and the perception on the part of the patient that questions may be too personal. 
The patients will be infor med in the consent  that they can skip  any questions they  like, or opt out 
of the questionnaire portion of studies.  
 
 Study Discontinuation (Observational) 
This study will not have study discontinuation rules as it is a  survey based registry study. The 
NIH and local IRBs (at their local site) have the authority to stop or suspend this trial at any time .  
 
 Subject Discontinuation 
All data acquired prior to termination for the reasons outlined  below will be included in the 
primary analysis unless patient withdraws consent.  
 Withdrawal of consent 
 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_2299] 
 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_317656]-line 
data entry via visual basic des igned screen forms. Data element constraints, whether 
independent range and/or format limitations or ‘relative’ referential integrity limitations, can be enforced by [CONTACT_5057]. QA reports assess data quality post-data entry. As we note, data quality begins with the design of the d ata collection forms and 
procedures and incorporates reasonable checks to minimize transcription and omission errors.  
Of the more important quality assurance measures are the intern al validity checks for 
reasonableness and consistency.

mechanisms using methods that are set forth by [CONTACT_317657].  
 
Confidentiality:  Only investigators and other key personnel involved in the st udy will have 
access to individually identifiable private information about human subjects.  
 Data Entry  
Data collection for this study will be accomplished with online electronic case report forms.  Using encrypted communication links, on-line forms will  be developed that contain the 
requisite data fields. 
NIH Approved 02-28-[ADDRESS_1028974] to 
enroll over 100 patients with BHD and over 200 patients with PLCH in this study. Adult patients 
(18 years and older) will be eligible to participate in the stu dy.  
 
 Written Informed Consent 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant before participation in the study. 
For the online survey, the informed consent portion will immedi ately precede the survey in 
REDCap.  Participants will be able to begin the survey only after certifying that they have read and understood the informed consent for the study.   For those using paper forms, the participant’s willingness to participate in the study will be documented in writing in a consent form, which will be signed b y the participant with the date of 
that signature [CONTACT_80389].  The investigator will keep the origi nal signed consent forms and copi[INVESTIGATOR_168178].    
 Process of Consent 
Subjects are required to sign an informed consent prior to unde rtaking the survey in accordance 
with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6; 4.8, “ Informed Consent of Trial 
Subjects.”     It will be clearly explained to the participants that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice t o future treatment.  Written and/or 
oral information about the study in a language understandable b y the participant will be given to 
all participants

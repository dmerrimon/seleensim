1)   Protocol Abstract (Briefly (in 250 words or less) describe the study in language understandable to a layperson.  Include a 
brief description of the study purpose, target disease/condition if applicable, key eligibility crit eria, and main study 
interventions ): Each year in the [LOCATION_002] 550,000 people develop upper -extremity movement deficits after 
stroke (hemiparesis). The recent success of mirror therapy (MT) is notable because it is a simple treatment for 
hemiparesis, and may be feasible for home use. MT uses a standard mirror to create a compelling illusion in 
which movements of the unimpaired limb appear as if they are being made by [CONTACT_809852]. We propose 
to complete a randomized placebo -controlled  clinical trial of home -based MT with a target enrollment of [ADDRESS_1119867], and elbow movements 
completed in two daily 30 -minute sessions, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Patients a ssigned to the placebo 
treatment (identical therapy with an opaque divider rather than a mirror) will be crossed over to receive MT 
after a three month follow -up. The therapy will be performed by [CONTACT_809853]/her home. This 
project will have two phases. The first phase, to be completed at Einstin, will include all of the behavioral 
testing . The second phase, to be completed at the University of Pennyslvania, will be limited to MRIs and CTs  
and will be completed under a separate IRB protocol a t the University of Pennsylvania with [CONTACT_349744] at the 
site PI.  
 
2)   Project Objectives  and Hypotheses :  The first goal of the study will be to determine whether a home -based 
form of MT is an effective treatment of hemiparesis. The second  goal will be to determine the optimal dosing of MT 
by [CONTACT_809854]. The third goal will be to understand individual differences in the 
efficacy of mirror therapy. Previous MT studies have not reported, or lacked the power to te st, why some patients 
benefit from MT and others do not, even though significant individual differences have been reported. Our use of a 
large sample of patients will allow us to assess predictors of therapeutic benefit.

A.1. Hemiparesis in patients with stroke  
Every year 550,000 people in the [LOCATION_002] develop problems making arm and hand mo vements because of a stroke. Of those 
with deficits, 30% - 60% fail to ever recover adequate usage of the limb [1]. The consequences of these impairments are profound, 
and stroke patients rate the return of upper -extremity functioning as a high priority [2 ]. Motor deficits also lead to negative 
psychological and social outcomes such as depression and withdrawal [3]. Beyond the impact on individuals, stroke patients pl ace 
a significant burden on the health care system, with stroke -related medical and disabil ity costs totaling $62.7 billion each year in 
America alone [4].  
Motor deficits in stroke patients are most clearly observed in the limb opposite the lesioned hemisphere (hemiparesis) and af fect the 
distal portions of the limb such as the hand more signif icantly than proximal portions such as the shoulder [5]. Previous studies 
show that these deficits are caused by [CONTACT_809855][INVESTIGATOR_88735], including the primary motor cortex and internal cap sule, 
as well as cortical areas such as the premotor and supplementary motor areas [6, 7]. In addition to motor production problems, 
non-motor deficits such as poor limb sensation and pain contribute to limited use of the paretic limb [8]. Treating these motor a nd 
non-motor deficits is especially difficult in ch ronic patients [1].  Improvement for most chronic patients is also hindered by [CONTACT_809856] -term therapy, leading many to receive little to no therapy in the chronic stage.  
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_809824] e varied and include strength training [9], functional task practice [9], bilateral 
training [10] and electrical stimulation [11]. To date, the single therapy with the greatest amount of empi[INVESTIGATOR_555040] i s 
constraint -induced movement therapy (CIMT), w hich combines restraint of the unimpaired limb and intense practice using the 
impaired limb under the supervision of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 10 6 -hour sessions over two weeks [12]). A common feature of almost 
all of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809825] a si gnificant amount of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332214], a burden that is becoming increasingly 
problematic due to cost concerns. Motivated by [CONTACT_809857][INVESTIGATOR_4284], there has been considerable rec ent 
interest in the use of robotic training to bo th reduce reliance on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809826] (e.g. [13]). These benefits, however, come at the expense of the significant initial cost to acquire the 
robotic device.   
A.2. Mirror therapy  
The recent success of mirror therapy (MT) for treating hemiparesis in stroke patients is notable because it does not require a  significant 
investment in equipment. Originally developed as a treatment for phantom limb pain (for review, see [14]), MT involves  the patient 
being seated at a table in front of a vertically -oriented mirror. The patient places her unimpaired arm on the reflective side of the 
mirror and her impaired arm behind the mirror so that it is not visible. Using this setup, the patient only s ees the unimpaired arm in 
the mirror. However, when the mirror is placed midway between the two limbs, movements of the unimpaired limb (viewed in the 
mirror) appear in the same location as the impaired limb. Thus, the MT setup creates a compelling illusio n in which movements of 
the unimpaired arm appear as if they are being made by [CONTACT_809858] [16].  
The illusory visual feedback of the perceived impaired limb moving like the unimpaired limb is the basis for MT’s therapeutic  benefit. 
Although only visual feedback is directly modified in the therapy, the results of several case studies [17, 18], a small -sample study 
without a control group [19], and three randomized control trials with moderate sample sizes (40,40, and 36 patients; [15,  20, 21]) 
indicate that MT produces a benefit for stroke patients that is comparable to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For example, both MT and a bri efer 
version of CIMT produce an approximate 20% increase in FIM score, a common measure of functional independence in act ivities 
of daily living (ADLs) and the only outcome measure that has been reported for both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [20, 22]. The benefit of MT is 
especially noteworthy given its methodological simplicity and the potential for use in the home. Informal case studies [17]  and one 
RCT with 20 treated patients [21] have reported improvement in paretic limb functioning with home -based mirror therapy, a finding 
that is consistent with a recent report that home -based CIMT may be as effective as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -administered CIMT [23].   
We propose to complete the largest randomized clinical trial of home -based mirror therapy. The therapy will consist of a standardized 
set of hand, wrist, and elbow movements completed in two 30 -minute sessions per day, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Patie nts

 assigned to the placebo treatment (identical therapy with an opaque divider rather than a mirror) will be crossed over to rec eive MT 
after a three month follow -up. To date [ADDRESS_1119868] completed the proposed therapy regimen in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and ove rall the 
results were encouraging. Patients showed an average improvement (relative to baseline) of 27% and 24% on the Wolf Motor 
Function test and Jebsen Hand Function test, respectively, two functional tests of simulated ADL performance. Even greater 
improvements were observed at the impairment level, with average improvement on grip force, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4790], and finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_809827] 63%, 58%, and 43%, respectively.  If the results of the full trial match those of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  home -based MT would be a 
mean ingful advancement in the cost of hemiparesis rehabilitation.  
 Reduced medical costs could also come from more efficient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809828]. Because the therapeutic benefits of rehabili tation 
often decrease over time, it would be worthwhile to know the balance between treatment dosing and treatment benefit. To date 
little is known about the dosing of MT because only one study [18] has measured therapeutic benefit at multiple time points d uring 
treatment (in contrast to only before and after 4 or 6 weeks of treatment in previous RCTs [15, 20, 21]). Stevens and Stoykov [18] 
reported that two chronic stroke patients given [ADDRESS_1119869] rapi[INVESTIGATOR_37181] 3 sessions (the first 
assessment point) and showed relatively minor improvement in th e following 7 sessions (the second assessment point). These 
case studies suggests that reducing dosage of MT could still lead to a clinically significant improvement in functioning. The  
proposed study would inform the issue of MT dosing by [CONTACT_809859] a large sample of 
patients. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_809829]’s therapeutic benefit may occur within the first two weeks of trea tment.  In 
this study we administered three impairment level tests (grip force , pi[INVESTIGATOR_4790], finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) as well as the Jebsen test after 
each week of therapy. Average improvement was 21%, 44%, 46%, and 47% for weeks [ADDRESS_1119870] that reduced therapy dosing may be nearly as 
therapeutic as longer courses of treatment.  
Previous tests of MT indicate that its benefit is not limited to movement production. For example, the use of MT for the trea tment of 
pain following limb a mputation and complex regional pain syndrome [14] suggest that it can quickly and significantly reduce pain 
(e.g., from a mean visual -analogue score of 70/100 to 10/100). Limb pain is also a common consequence of stroke [8], and data 
from one of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_809830] a significant reduction in pain following MT (from 
80/100 to 19/100). In addition to pain, one MT RCT [15] found significant improvements in both sense of touch and hemispatial  
neglect, a disorder Dr s. Buxbaum and Coslett (two co -investigators) have significant experience studying and treating [24 -29]. 
Patients with neglect, more commonly observed after right than left hemisphere damage, are more impaired than patients withou t 
neglect on measures of d isability, have poorer motor function than patients without neglect, have longer rehabilitation 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809831], even after controlling for sco res 
on tests of functional independ ence [24]. In addition to its potential for treating hemiparesis, our trial will test whether MT reduces 
symptoms of pain, decreased touch sensitivity, and hemispatial neglect by [CONTACT_809860].  
B.1. Understandi ng individual patient differences in treatment response   
A critical, but often understudied, issue in rehabilitation is predicting individual patient differences in treatment respons e. As reviewed in 
section A.1, a wide range of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809832], and several recent RCTs comparing two active 
treatments have reported equivalent benefits at the group level [9, 30, 31]. It would be clinically valuable to understand th e 
characteristics of patients who do and do not respond to each  therapy given the magnitude of these individual differences. For 
example, in a recent RCT of MT for chronic stroke patients [20], improvement in the Brunnstrom scale outcome measure ranged 
from 0% to 33% (estimated from two standard deviation above and be low the mean of 16.5% improvement). Information about 
predicted individual differences would be useful for clinicians when deciding the course of treatment most likely to benefit the 
patient.  
We assert that individual differences in response to MT are pre dictable through an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for 
MT’s therapeutic benefit. The assembled team composed of researchers trained in the basic science of sensorimotor control (Dr . 
Jax) and its application to stroke patients (Drs. Jax, Buxbau m, and Coslett) is uniquely positioned to address this issue. The 
project is innovative because it will test competing predictions regarding the mechanism of MT by [CONTACT_809861] p rocesses that may underlie MT’s benefit. As an overview, we will first discuss 
the four sensorimotor processes that may underlie the mechanisms of MT’s benefit (B.2), and then proceed to a summary of the 
 AEHN Protocol/Summa ry

4 
 neural substrates that subserve these processes (B.3 ). Following this will be a discussion of the behavioral tasks we will use as 
convergent validity tests of the neuroanatomic predictions (B.4). Finally, we will summarize all of these predictions in Tabl e 1.  
B.2. Proposed mechanisms of MT  
Understanding th e mechanisms of MT requires an understanding of how the perceptual -motor system functions. A wealth of research 
on perceptual -motor control indicates that accurate movement production relies on cyclical interactions between descending 
muscle commands and a scending sensory feedback. That is, during movement the motor system produces a descending signal to 
the muscles which is based on a prediction about the sensory and motor consequence that signal will have [32]. After this sig nal is 
sent, ascending sensory  signals, primarily from vision and proprioception, detect the effect of the descending signal and whether 
that ascending signal matched what was predicted before movement initiation [33]. Any mismatch between the predicted and 
observed sensory signals is then used to modify the motor system so that the prediction is more accurate in the future. Using this 
framework, let us consider the step -by-step progression of sensorimotor processing that takes place when a patient attempts to 
move both limbs in paralle l using the MT setup (the instruction given during MT).  
The cycle begins when descending signals to each limb are produced primarily by [CONTACT_809862], with the 
signal coming from the lesioned hemisphere being insufficient to produ ce accurate movement (because stroke disrupts either the 
signal itself or the descending pathways). With a slight temporal delay, ascending sensory feedback from both proprioception and 
vision are received. Visual information is processed to determine how the limb configuration changed because of the descending 
signals. This processing is a form of action observation. A significant recent finding in the field of neuroscience is the di scovery that 
the same neural populations that are active during action obs ervation are often active during action production (“mirror neurons”; 
[34]). Clearly, not all forms of action observation are beneficial because stroke patients spend their entire post -stroke lives 
observing the unimpaired actions of others without making significant improvements. Observing one’s own actions during MT is 
different from observing someone else’s actions because only one’s own motor system has access to the specific signals that 
were sent to both the impaired and unimpaired arm. Because of the  mirror, the action observation feedback matches the signal 
sent to the unimpaired arm and not the impaired arm. Thus, one mechanism for MT’s therapeutic benefit may be a form of 
Hebbian -like learning (“what fires together wires together”) in which the act ion observation system in the intact hemisphere, which 
controls the unimpaired arm, becomes more strongly associated with the signals sent to the impaired limb. Subsequent movement  
production with the impaired limb may therefore be more reliant upon the ac tion observation system in the intact hemisphere. 
Alternatively, the action observation system may only be responsible for recognizing more abstract aspects of action. Consist ent 
with this claim, mirror neurons often respond primarily to the goal of an act ion rather than how the action is executed [36]. The 
therapeutic benefit of action observation proposed above would require that the action observation system is able to contribu te to a 
more detailed level of action production than simply understanding the  action’s goal. Thus, action observation may not be the 
primary mechanism of MT’s therapeutic benefit. Testing these competing predictions about the role that action observation pla ys in 
MT will be done by [CONTACT_23992] a patient’s MT benefit to that patient’s  accuracy on an action observation task unrelated to MT (see 
C.13).  
In addition to action observation, proprioceptive feedback is relied upon during MT. The most obvious prediction is that poor  
proprioception would lead to poor response to MT, just as it does in other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [37]. This outcome would be logical because 
proprioception is the only source of sensory feedback about the hidden impaired limb during MT (since vision of that limb is 
blocked). The perceptual -motor system may require some form of feedback to recognize that the movement of the impaired limb 
does not match the visual feedback, and thus the system must modify the motor command to more closely match the visual 
feedback about the unimpaired arm. Without that feedback, adjustment of the perceptual -motor system might not occur. The 
alternative, and more counter -intuitive, prediction is that intact proprioception might disrupt MT. Our reasoning is that MT sets up a 
conflict between the proprioception signal coming from the impaired arm and the visual feedback about the mirror -reflected 
unimpaired limb. The presence of a veridical proprioception signal from the impaired arm may disrupt the effects of the false  visual 
feedback. Support for this second prediction comes from other studies in whi ch proprioceptive feedback is actively suppressed 
when the to -be-learned task involves a conflict between vision and proprioception [38]. If this counterintuitive prediction is verified, 
it would be especially noteworthy because poor proprioception often l eads to poor recovery with standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Advancing a 
therapy that would benefit patients who respond poorly to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809833]. The pro posed 
study will be able to differentiate between these two possibilitie s by [CONTACT_2329] a behavioral assessment of proprioception to determine 
whether disrupted proprioception is associated with greater or reduced benefit of MT (see C.13).

HRP -204 11/1/[ADDRESS_1119871] focused on the separate processing of vision and proprioception, although it  has long been known that these two 
sources of feedback are eventually integrated to form a unitary representation of the body’s configuration. The distinction b etween 
the proprioceptive feedback account above and the visual -proprioception integration acco unt presented below is that the second 
account concerns a later stage in sensory processing. Thus, assuming that some proprioception is present, the integration of 
vision and proprioception may be disrupted. The “odd” feeling when neurologically -intact par ticipants experience the illusion 
induced by [CONTACT_809863]. Disrupting this compariso n 
may affect if and how strongly one experiences the MT illusion. Experiencing the illusion may b e a necessary, but not sufficient, 
requirement of MT’s benefit because the detection of a mismatch may initiate changes to the sensorimotor system to correct th e 
mismatch. Informal reports from the use of MT in the Right Hemisphere Stroke Center of MossReh ab, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Buxbaum (a  
co-investigator), indicate that MT with patients who fail to initially experience the illusion rarely leads to significant impro vement. 
Alternatively, there may be no relationship between the illusion induced by [CONTACT_809864] m otor production benefit. Dissociations 
between perception and action have been previously reported. For example, visual illusions can affect the visually perceived 
lengths of two lines much more than the movement to grasp those same lines [39]. Across pati ents we will use the results of two 
visual -proprioception integration tests (self -report rating of initial sensation of the mirror illusion; Parson’s task) to see if these tests 
predict MT’s benefit.  
Finally, a previous study of MT [18] hypothesized that removing visual feedback of the impaired arm causes the perceptual -motor 
system to try to fill in that information using motor imagery. Given that other forms of motor imagery can be therapeutically  
beneficial, the authors proposed that motor imagery was s imilarly beneficial in MT. Data from a later RCT of mirror therapy calls 
this claim into question [20]. When MT was compared to the same therapy with a covered mirror, the results clearly indicated that 
MT benefited patients while the covered mirror therap y did not. However, in both forms of therapy vision of the impaired limb was 
blocked, and thus motor imagery would be called upon in both. We will test whether MT’s benefit is predicted by [CONTACT_809865] (see C.13 for details).  
In summary, we will t est competing predictions about the mechanism of MT by [CONTACT_809866] (action observation, proprioceptive feedback, visual/proprioceptive integration, and motor imagery) th at 
may underlie MT ’s benefit .  
B.3. Neural substrates of sensorimotor processes required for MT  
 The neural substrates of the four sensorimotor processes mentioned above have been identified from a variety of sources 
including single -cell recordings in non -human primates a s well as neuroimaging, TMS, and brain -damaged patients in humans. 
Space considerations prevent a detailed presentation of existing evidence, but we have reviewed this literature and developed  a 
consensus of the neural substrates of proprioceptive feedback  [40-44], action observation [45 -53], visual -proprioception integration 
[54-56], and motor imagery [54, 57 -67]. This review is summarized in Table 1. We note that the specific neural regions listed in 
Table 1 are based on incomplete, and often conflicting,  results. To avoid relying too strongly upon the limitations of previous 
studies when trying to understand individual differences in MT response, we will use whole -brain voxel -based lesion -symptom 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (VLSM) analyses to determine how lesion location af fects the benefit of MT. VLSM will allow us to determine which areas 
of the brain are most predictive of MT’s benefit without limiting our analyses to those predicted areas.  
B. 4. Converging evidence between lesion location and other behavioral tests  
 In addition to making predictions about the integrity of the four processes that may underlie MT’s benefit based on lesion locat ion, 
we will measure performance on confirmatory behavioral tests to (1) provide further evidence about the neural substrates of t hese 
functions and (2) allow clinicians to have simple behavioral tests to predict individual differences in MT response without h aving to 
rely on lesion location information. All behavioral tests have been previously used in our labs. For action observatio n, we will use a 
test that involves viewing sequentially presented video pairs of actions, with the patient making same/different judgments ab out the 
actions [68]. For proprioceptive feedback, we will use the RASP [69], a standard clinical measure of propr ioception that will also be 
a primary outcome measure . For visual -proprioceptive feedback, we will use a visual -analogue scale of initial mirror illusion 
sensation (rate how strongly it feels as if the arm you see in the mirror is actually the arm behind the mirror) and a simple judgment 
task (Parson’s task [70]) that has been shown to require integration of visual and proprioceptive input. In this task, patien ts judge 
whether a visually presented hand is a left or right hand. These judgments are affected by [CONTACT_809867]’s own 
hand, suggesting the decision is based on the seen and felt position of the body. We will have patients make verbal judgments  
while we systematically manipulate the orientation of the patients’ hand. Finally, mot or imagery will be assessed using consistency

6)  Study Design  
 
a. Recruitment Methods :  
 
i. Describe wh en, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited  (Describe the source of subjects.  
Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects.  Describe materials, such as 
advertisements, that will be used to recruit subjects (include th ese with submission materials . If study is a 
chart review, describe which records will be accessed to collect data  and how you will access them  :   
Participants will primarily be recruited by [CONTACT_809870], then making 
an initial phone call to introduce the study and invite participation, and then meeting in person 
to explain the study and complete the informed consent process.  Participants will also be 
recruited using a flyer distributed by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_809838] . The flyer will contain a brief summary of the project, and will 
provide telephone contact [CONTACT_809871], who will 
provide all information about the study. Study team  members will distribute the flyers to the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] , and instruct the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809839].  Flyers will also be distributed  by [CONTACT_809872]. As part of the consent process, 
we explain to potential participants that if they meet the inclusion criteria, we may find they 
are eligible to have a new brain scan  (MRI or CT) , free of charge, through our collabora tors at 
the University of Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and that they are free to choose whether or not they 
want to hear more about this.  Brain scanning (both MRI s and CTs) will be completed under a 
separate IRB protocol at the University of Pennsylvania with Dr . Coslett as the site PI.  
 
ii. Will payments to subjects be provided?  
     Yes, amount and timing:  $15 per hour for sessions completed at MRRI .  For travel 
costs in excess of $5, we also contribute to the costs up to a maximum of  $ 50 per session.  
Payment is made in cash at each session attended.  For each 30 minute treatment session a 
participant completes at  at home, they  will receive $5. Payment will be made in cash at 
the weekly laboratory sessions. In order to receive this payment, the experimenter must 
be able to verify that the participant  completed the session using the video recordings 
he/she  will make. If the participant does  not bring these recordings with him/her  to a 
weekly laboratory session, he/she  will have the op portunity to be paid at the next weekly 
laboratory session that he/she  bring s the recordings to. In the event of a camera 
mulfuntion or other event that would prevent viewing of the video recordings, the

 researcher will take the participant's word and pay him/her for each session he/she says 
were completed. At the end of the 4 weeks of treatment the participant  will receive a 
bonus of $50 if he/she  complete s at least 36 of the 40 treatment sessions.

b. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria :  
i. Describe how you will screen for eligibility  (e.g. review charts, perform specific screening tests, etc. ):  
After recruitment, the first session will be devoted to inclusion criteria and exclusion testing.  
 
ii. Describe the criteria that define who will be included or excluded in your final study sample : 
 All pa rticipants  will be between [ADDRESS_1119874] daily life. Aphasia comprehension will be assessed with the 20 item comprehension subscale 
of the Western Aphasia Battery [75]. Participants with compre hension scores below 8 will be 
excluded from further testing, as will patients with significant perceptual deficits (such as a 
hemianopia that prevents vision of both limbs in the mirror). Any patient will be excluded if they 
report previous head trauma, p sychiatric illness or chronic exposure to medications that might be 
expected to have lasting consequences for the central nervous system (e.g., haloperidol, 
dopaminergics). Subjects with a history or neuropsychological findings suggestive of dementia will 
also be excluded. This initial screening should take approximately 90 minutes . 
 
c. Study Timelines:  
i. Duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study:  All participants will complete the initial 
screening session to determine whethe r they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. If they meet the criteria, they 
will complete 2 additional 90 minute pre -treatment testing sessions which will include other study endpoint 
assessments as well as the measures of individual differences (see 6.e .iii). They will also be asked to complete 
a [ADDRESS_1119875] scan (if unable or unwilling to undergo MRI scanning because of claustrophobia or 
medical contraindications, e.g., pacemaker, aneurysm clips, other metallic implants) at the University of 
Pennsylvania. MRIs and CTs will be completed under a separate IRB protocol at the University of Pennsylvania 
with [CONTACT_349744] as the site PI. Then therapy will begin, which will include 2 daily 30 minute therapy sessions, 5 
days per week over a 4 week period,  which will be done in the participant's home. At the end of each week of 
therapy, the participant will come into the lab for a [ADDRESS_1119876] -treatment asse ssments (1 day and 3 months after final 
treatment session).       
 
ii. Time period anticipated to enroll all study subjects  or to complete chart revi ew:  4.5 years 
 
iii. Estimated overall study duration  (i.e. from initiation to  completion of primary analyses):  6 years

 i. Describe the primary and secondary study endpoints ( i.e. the outcome (s) that the study is designed to 
evaluate): Overall, the study will examine motor functioning of the impaired arm as well  as sensation in the limb 
as well as hemispatial neglect (participants with right hemisphere lesions only). The primary outcome 
measures will be the (1) upper extremity portion of the Fugl -Meyer test, a standard clinical 
measure of arm motor impairment , (2), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), a valid and reliable 
measure of arm function in simulated ADLs, (3) the Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory 
Performance (RASP), which tests proprioception, two -point discrimination, surface pressure 
touch, surface loca lization, and tactile extinction [121], and (4) in right hemisphere patients 
only, a virtual -reality assessment of navigation (VRLAT) developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Buxbaum [77], 
which is more sensitive to mild forms of hemispatial neglect than paper -and-pencil tests. 
Secondary outcome measures will be (1) the Stroke Impact Scale , a self -report measure of use 
of limb in activities of daily living  (2) timed finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], (3) maximum grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_4790], 
as assessed using a dynamometer, and (4) the Wolf Motor Function T est [78] to assess 
function limitations and allow comparison with the results of CIMT (used as a secondary 
measure because patients with lower Fugl -Meyer score will not be able to complete many 
items on this test).  
 
 
ii. Describe any primary or secondary saf ety endpoints ( e.g.  any disease or s ymptom that would result in 
the withdrawal of that subject from the study ): N/A 
 
e.  Human Research  Methods: 
 
i. Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinic al trial or 
retrospective chart review) :  randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial  
 
 
ii. Describe all research activities involved in this protocol, including a study visit timeline if 
appropriate :  C.5. PRE -TREATMENT ASSESSMENT : Should the patient meet the inclusion 
criteria, an additional battery of pre -treatment assessment tests will be completed as the 
first measure of the primary and secondary outcome measures. The primary outcome 
measures will be the (1) Fugl -Meyer test, de scribed above, (2), Action Research Arm Test 
(ARAT), a valid and reliable measure of arm function in simulated ADLs, (3) the Rivermead 
Assessment of Somatosensory Performance (RASP), which tests proprioception, two -point 
discrimination, surface pressure to uch, surface localization, and tactile extinction [121], 
and (4) in right hemisphere patients only, a virtual -reality assessment of navigation 
(VRLAT) developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Buxbaum [77], which is more sensitive to mild forms of 
hemispatial neglect than paper -and-pencil tests. Secondary outcome measures will be (1) 
Stroke Impact Scale [76], (2) timed finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], (3) maximum grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_4790], as 
assessed using a dynamometer, and (4) the Wolf Motor Function Test [78] to assess 
function limitations and allow  comparison with the results of CIMT (used as a secondary 
measure because patients with lower Fugl -Meyer score will not be able to complete many 
items on this test). Finally, the confirmatory behavior tests listed in Table 1 will be 
included in the pre -treatment assessment (see B.4 for details). We anticipate that the full 
pre-treatment screening can be completed in 2 90 -minute sessions. De -identified data 
from both the inclusion screening and pre -treatment assessment will be discussed with the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_809840] (C.6) and the patient is assigned to a therapy group

 (C.7.a) to ensure that the patient meets inclusion criteria and that no unusual combination 
of scores might suggest errors in data collection or scoring.                                                         
C.6. LESION IDENTIFICATION: Neuroimaging data will be analyzed to examine the 
relationship between treatment outcomes and lesion location & volume.  Existing 
neuroimaging data may be used  if the scan is an acceptable resol ution. Scan data and 
processed (mapped) images may be obtained from the MRRI Cognition and Action or  
Language and Aphasia laboratories if available.  Scan records from other facilities may be 
requested if necessary.  However, for the majority of patients, a high -resolution MRI scan 
will be performed  including a T1 -weighted spoiled gradient -recalled -echo transverse 
images with [ADDRESS_1119877] resolution with a 192 X 256 
matrix. Images will be obtained on a 1.5T scanner at a single site (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71972]). Based on past experience, 30% of the patients who consent to 
scanning will be unable or unwilling to undergo MRI scanning because of claustrophobia or 
medical contraindications (e.g., pacemaker, aneurysm c lips, other metallic implants). 
These patients will have a CAT scan of the brain without contrast. CAT scans will be 
obtained on a 64 -slice Siemens scanner at the University of Pennsylvania with 1.5 mm gap 
throughout. For analysis of brain -behavior relatio nships in brain lesion subjects, imaging 
data will transformed to a common template (“Colin27” from MNI) using procedures 
outlined in [79]. Briefly, for MRI scans, lesions will be delineated in the subject’s native 
space (that is, on the subject’s MRI) by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Coslett, an experienced neurologist and co -
investigator. The structural scans and lesion maps will be registered to a common template 
using a symmetric diffeomorphic registration algorithm [80]. A single mappi[INVESTIGATOR_809841] M NI-space “Colin27” volume will be used to complete the 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_809842]. For CAT scans, the Colin27 brain in MRICro will 
first be re -pi[INVESTIGATOR_809843]’s scan. The lesion 
contour identified in th e patient’s scan will then be manually drawn onto the template on a 
slice -by-slice basis by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Coslett, taking into consideration the distance from the lesion 
margin and identifiable landmarks such as gyri, ventricles and subcortical structures. We 
have p reviously demonstrated excellent intra - and inter -rater reliability with this method 
[79]. [CONTACT_349744] will be blind to the behavioral data when tracing lesions.                                                                                           
C.7. THERAPY REGIMEN                                                                                                                               
a. Group assignment: A research assistant (RA), who will not be involved in any 
assessments, will assign patients  to the MT or placebo therapy (identical therapy with an 
opaque divider rather than a mirror) using stratified randomization based on the patient’s 
Fugl -Meyer score. Before starting the trial an assignment order will be developed based on 
whether a patient ’s pre -treatment Fugl -Meyer score was low (between 10 and 30) or 
moderate (between 30 and 50). A previous MT RCT using a similarly chronic patient 
population and an identical placebo therapy showed little benefit of the placebo therapy . 
Thus, we must cons ider a balance between the scientific requirements of an appropriate 
control group and the ethical considerations of using patients’ time to complete a therapy 
that is known to be ineffective. To balance these considerations, we will assign patients to 
the MT and placebo treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio, respectively. This inequality in sample 
size will only reduce statistical power by [CONTACT_3450] 3% [81]. In addition, patients 
assigned to placebo treatment will be given the option of being crossed over to  receive MT 
after the three month assessment. Patients will not be aware of which therapy is the 
placebo because both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809844] a test of “mirror therapy.” Both treatments will include 2  daily 30 minute

 therapy sessions, 5 days per week over a 4 week period.                                                                                                                 
b. Training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: Therapy instructions for both treatment groups w ill be presented 
using the same DVD shown using a portable DVD player. The [ADDRESS_1119878] movement (pronation/supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810], 
flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation), and flexion and extension at the elbow. Each 
trained movement will first be shown to the patient [ADDRESS_1119879] break, after which the next movement will be presented. 
Instructions on the video will remind participants to make the same movement with both 
limbs “as well as possible” [19].                                                                                                                 
c. Compliance assurance: Several steps will insure that the treatment procedure is 
followed. First, at the start of each patient’s therapy the device will be  delivered to the 
patient’s home by [CONTACT_21118], who will instruct the patient and caregiver on use of the system. 
The RA will lead the first session and then observe the second session. To further ensure 
compliance, and control for the timing of the mid -treatm ent assessments relative to the 
previous treatment session (see C.8), after every fifth therapy session ( before day 6 , 11, 
and 1 6) will be completed in the lab in the presence of the RA (and in a different room 
from the assessor) immediately prior to the m id-treatment assessment. Compliance 
outside of the RA’s oversight will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a simple, detachable, flash -
memory video recorder on the mirror/divider apparatus. The video recorder will be 
selected for its ease of use  (e.g., recording is done by [CONTACT_7326] a single red button). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_809845] 7 patients indicated that patients had little trouble completing therapy outside 
of researcher supervision, and our use of video recording resulted in 100% compliance 
without any reports of difficul ty using the video system. The RA will also deliver a pre -
made therapy packet including a step -by-step checklist for each of the 20 therapy days, 
including a reminder to start the video recorder and questions to be completed before 
treatment (pain level) a nd after treatment (pain level, discomfort level, effort exerted 
during therapy, free -form question about any adverse effects). Before each mid -treatment 
assessment (see C.8), the RA will call and remind the patient and caregiver to bring the 
packet and re corder with them. The RA (who will know the therapy assignment) will 
download the video while the assessor completes the mid -treatment assessment. The RA 
will then view the video and confirm compliance with instructions regarding timing and 
production of m ovements. If non -compliance is discovered, the RA will discuss the issue 
with the  patient. The RA will raise (without revealing the patient’s group assignment) any 
compliance concerns with the PI.                                                                                                                      
C.8. MID -TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS: Three mid -treatment assessments will be 
performed, one immediately before  every 5th day of therapy ( before start of day 6, 11, and 
16; see C.7.c), and will include o nly the primary outcome measures. The assessors will be 
unaware of group assignment, and before each session the assessor will remind patients to 
avoid mentioning any details of their therapy.  The assessor will be given a questionnaire 
at the end of each assessment concerning the treatment to which they believe the patient 
has been assigned.                                                                                                                                       
C.9. POST -TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS:  The two post -treatment assessments (1 day and 3

13 
 months after final treatment session) will test both primary and secondary outcome 
measures. Procedures will be identical to mid -treatment assessments. To maximize 
retention at [ADDRESS_1119880] with the patient and be aware of any upcoming scheduling issues that 
might prevent timely follow -up.  
 
 
iii. Identify which tests/procedures are being administered  solely for research purposes  and which are 
being conducted as part of standard of care (i.e. procedures that would be done even if the 
participant were not involved in research) :  All tests are solely for research purposes. As a summary 
these tests are the screening tests (Fug l-Meyer, Western Aphasia Battery comprehension test, clinical 
hemianopia test, spatial action recognition test, Parson's test of hand laterality decisions, imagined 
graspi[INVESTIGATOR_809846]) and assessment tests (Fugl -Meyer, Action Research Arm Task, Rivermead 
Assessment of Somatosensory Performance (RASP), virtual reality laterized attention task, Stroke Impact 
Scale, timed finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], maximum grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_4790], Wolf motor function task) and brain scans (MRI 
or CT). Brain scanning (both MRIs and CTs)will  be completed under a separate IRB protocol at the 
University of Pennsylvania with [CONTACT_349744] as the site PI.  
 
iv. Describe steps taken to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks  associated with tests/procedures 
being done for research purposes only ( e.g. only appropriately trained personnel involved in 
procedures, extra tests being done for safety purposes ):  Risks to subjects from the behavioral 
tests are minimal. No adverse effects of mirror therapy have been reported. To protect 
against  fatigue, subjects will be permitted to rest or discontinue testing at any time. Should 
subjects appear to be made anxious by [CONTACT_349733], testing will be terminated. Subjects will 
be told that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. A second p otential risk 
comes from brain imaging. CVA subjects will undergo high resolution, anatomic MRI 
imaging using standard pulse sequences (e.g., T1 -weighted, T -2 weighted, FLAIR and 
MPRAGE) or a CT scan of the brain. Brain scanning (both MRI s and CTs) will be  completed 
under a separate IRB protocol at the University of Pennsylvania with [CONTACT_349744] as the site 
PI. Neither gadolinium or iodine containing contrast will be administered. The major risk 
from MRI is that the strong magnetic field will dislodge a met allic object inside the 
subject’s body (e.g., aneurysm clip) or interfere with an implanted device (e.g., cardiac 
pacemaker). Standard protocols have been developed at the University of Pennsylvania to 
ensure that subjects at risk do not undergo an MRI sca n. This protocol includes an 
extensive checklist that is completed by [CONTACT_809873]; additionally, the 
MRI technician interviews patients prior to entering the MRI suite. A second potential 
concern comes from loose metallic objects in the MR I suite that can serve as missiles if they 
are drawn to a powerful magnet. Metallic objects that are not secured to the floor or wall 
are not permitted in the MRI suite. We note that these procedures have been employed in 
the clinical and research settings  at the University of Pennsylvania for many years; no 
adverse effects from MRI scanning have been experienced to date. Subjects who are or 
think they might be pregnant will be excluded because the safety of MRI in pregnancy has 
not been established. The ma jor risk from CT scan is a small dose of ionizing radiation. This 
procedure will be approved by [CONTACT_809874] a consent 
form in which the potential risks are discussed.

conduct of the research .  Specify whether recording is optional or not and how information on 
how recordings will be used and how long they will be retained is being shared with subject :  All 
participants will be video -recorded during the behavioral experiments. Participants are 
informed of this during the informed consent process , and they will sign a separate 
permission to videotape document which will  detail how long the videos will be retained.

i. Describe steps that will be taken to secure the data (e.g. training, authorization of access, password 
protection, encryption, physical controls, certif icates of confidentiality and separation of identifiers 
and data) during storage, use and transmission :  All computerized data will be  password and  
stored only on the network share drive.   
 
ii.       Describe the data analysis plan, includi ng any statistical procedures and method for determining the 
sample size for the study : C.11. Testing Specific Aim 1 (benefit of home -based MT)  
Tests for improvement in the primary and secondary outcome measures (see C.4) administered 
during t he pre -treatment assessment and the two post -treatment assessments will be 
separately compared using ANCOVA analyses with post -treatment values as DVs, therapy 
type (MT, placebo) as the IV, and pre -treatment assessment score as the covariate [74]. 
Confirma tion of MT’s benefit will be tested in the main effect of therapy type.  
C.12. Testing Specific Aim 2 (optimal treatment dosing)  
 Optimal treatment dosing will be examined by [CONTACT_809875]’s 
average value at the three mid -treatmen t assessments and the three -month post -treatment 
assessment as a percentage between pre -treatment (0%) and immediate post -treatment 
(100%) assessments. This information could then be used in clinical decision -making when 
determining whether the magnitude o f change expected in a given time period would be 
“worth” the additional treatment time or whether that addition time would be better spent 
trying another therapy. Inferential tests will not be used because of the problem of being 
unable to detect “non -significant” differences between two time points as well as the 
possibility that the large sample size will be able to detect statistically -significant differences 
across adjacent time points even though the clinical significance of the differences’ 
magnitude s are questionable.  
C.13. Testing Specific Aim 3 (predicting individual differences in therapeutic benefit)  
All tests of Specific Aim 3 will focus on data from the MT group only.  
a. Testing predicted relationships between processes underlying MT and MT b enefit using lesion 
location: We will examine the relationship between the change in primary and secondary 
outcome measures and lesion location using whole -brain voxel -based lesion -symptom 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (VLSM) analyses [83]. VLSM measures whether a behavioral sc ore systematically 
differs between participants with and without damage to each voxel under investigation. 
Tests of this difference use a t -statistic to describe the difference in means between the 
damaged -group and non -damaged -group while taking into acco unt the variances within each 
group. The t -statistic is thus used as a convenient measure of group differences, without the 
intention of comparing it to the parametric t distribution. Instead, statistical significance will 
be determined by [CONTACT_105] -parametric p ermutation tests [84], in which the distribution used for 
inferential statistic calculations are created by [CONTACT_809876] a priori distribution. Thresholds for significance will be calculated from the 95th 
percenti le of this distribution, to ensure a family -wise false positive rate of 0.05 [84]. The total 
number of comparisons will also be reduced by [CONTACT_809877] 10% of participants (to avoid undue influence o f a small number of 
participants).  
As in the previous measures, we will use an ANCOVA -like procedure to determine whether post -
treatment scores (the DV) are affected by [CONTACT_809878] (the IV) after controlling for pre -treatment score and total lesion volume 
(covariates). Separate VLSM analyses will be done for each primary and secondary outcome

 measure. The voxels identified as being predictive of MT benefit using the VLSM analysis 
should be consistent with the a priori ROI predictions (Table 1). VLSM will also allow us to 
test whether voxels outside of these ROIs predict MT benefit.  
b. Testing predicted relationships between processes underlying MT and MT benefit using 
behavioral scores: In addition to using VL SM to test how the proposed neural substrates of 
the four sensorimotor processes are able to predict MT’s benefit, we will also use the 
confirmatory behavioral measures (our proxy for the integrity of the processes) to predict 
MT’s benefit. We will use lin ear stepwise regression to predict post -treatment scores (the DV) 
using each behavioral measure (the second level predictor/ IV) after controlling for pre -
treatment score (the first level predictor/ IV). Note that this analysis is identical to the 
ANCOVAs used above except that a continuous IV is used, thus requiring regression rather 
than ANOVA. Analyses will be done separately for each of the four processes and each 
primary and secondary outcome measure. Testing our predictions about the processes will 
involve examining the sign and significance of second level predictor’s regression weight. For 
example, if poor proprioception leads to reduced benefit of MT(see B.2), the regression 
weight for RASP (where high score corresponds to better proprioception) wil l be significantly 
positive. Alternatively, if poor proprioception lead to increased benefit of MT, the regression 
weight will be significantly negative. Finally, if proprioception does not affect MT benefit, the 
regression weight will not significantly di ffer from zero. Determining the influence of action 
observation, visual -proprioception integration, and motor imagery will use the same logic.  
c. Testing predicted relationships between lesion areas and confirmatory behavioral measures  
As summarized in Tab le 1, we predict that damage to particular ROIs will cause deficits in 
particular sensorimotor processes, which we will assess using the confirmatory behavioral 
tests. We will test these predictions in two ways. First, we will use t -tests to determine 
whet her the pre -treatment confirmatory behavioral tests (the only time the tests are 
administered) will differ as a function of damage status to a particular ROI (using a 20% of 
volume criteria). Second, we will use linear stepwise regression to predict behavi oral 
measure scores using percent damage to each predicted ROI after first controlling for total 
lesion volume. We have previously used both approaches successfully in a study of action 
observation [68].

determine whether subjects remain safe .  Include what data will be reviewed, who will review the 
data and when the data will be reviewed :  N/A 
 
i.  Withdrawal of Subjects:   
 
i. Describe the anticipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the research 
without their consent:  Participants will be withdr awn without their consent only if it is 
determined, after consent, that they no longer meet study criteria, or if it becomes apparent 
that the study is causing the participant undue fatigue or frustration.  
 
ii.      Describe the procedures that will be follo wed when subjects withdraw from the research  (or 
request that their data be withdrawn) , including partial withdrawal from procedures with 
continued data collection:  Following a participant’s withdrawal or request for data 
withdrawal, no new i nformation about that participant is collected.  Data already gathered

this in the consent form.  
 
 
 
 
 
7)  Risks to Subjects:   
  
a) List the reasonably foreseeable  risks, discomforts, hazards or inconveniences to the subjects.  For each 
indicate the probability, magnitude, and duration  when possible  (consider physical, psychological, social, 
legal and economic risks  as well as risks related to confidentiality ):  Anticipated risks include fatigue or frustration 
during the behavioral experiments.  Probability of fatigue or frustration is more than would be expected among healthy 
control participants, but not more than is experienced by [CONTACT_809880]. P articipants who seem fatigued 
or frustrated are invited to take breaks, as needed, during the sessions and are informed of their right to withdraw from 
the study if they so choose. This should decrease the magnitude and duration of the fatigue and frustration.

h) Describe process to ensure subject/parent/LAR’s understanding :  By [CONTACT_809881].  
 
i) Do you plan to consent subjects or their legally authorized representatives when the subject does not speak 
English? 
   Yes  
   No  
If yes, select one of the two options below that best describes  your study:  
   The research targets a specific population that is non -English speaking OR a significant 
proportion of subjects are anticipated to be non -English speaking ( if this is true, translations of 
the standard (i.e. IRB -approved, full -description) informed conse nt documents must be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_809882] -English speaking subjects ).  
   The research does not target a non -English speaking population, AND only a small proportion of 
subjects are anticipated to  be non-English speaking ( if this is true  and a translated study consent 
form is not available , the short form consent process must be used.  For more information, see 
the Investigator Manual .) 
 
Describe your plan for conducting study visits and long-term follow-up with these subjects :   
Interpreters from the EHN pool may be used during the informed consent process and assessment of 
mental functions.  However, participants (with or without the aid of a friend / family member) must 
possess suffi cient English language skills to follow directions  related to assessment of upper extremity 
functioning and the completion of the home -based exercise regimen.  
 
j) Does the study allow for and do you plan to enroll adult participants with diminished decision  making 
capacity?  
   Yes  
   No  
If yes, select one of the two statements in each group  below that is most appropriate for your study (if neither 
statement applies  in one or both groups , your study does not meet the regula tory criteria for enrollment of 
these subjects):  
  
Criterion 1( must select one  box below if you plan to enroll adults who are unable to consent for themselves ): 
   The aims of the research cannot be accomplished if the subjects were limite d to adults capable  
 of consent.  
   The research is intended to be beneficial to the subjects in a manner that is not available outside 
the research context.  
 
Criterion 2 (must select one  box below if you plan to enroll adults who are unab le to consent for themselves ): 
   The research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects.  Minimal risk  means that the 
probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in 
and of themselves th an those ordinarily encountered in daily life of normal persons or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests in normal persons  [45 
CFR 46.102(i)] . 
   The research involves more than minimal risk to s ubjects, but the research holds out the prospect 
of direct benefit to the individual subjects.

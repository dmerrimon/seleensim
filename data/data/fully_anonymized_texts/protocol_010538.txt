STUDY INFORMATION  Location(s) of Research Activity: Loma Linda School of Dentistry Expected Start/Stop Dates of Research: 11/01/2022 to 08/30/2023 Special Time Sensitivities: N/A Type of Research: Minimal Risk Anticipated Enrollment number: 40 Patient Population: [ADDRESS_1257287] gained popularity among the green people. Green people are those who aim to achieve sustainability. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_896934]’ many merits, there is only scarce information on the efficacy, consumer satisfaction, cost, and benefits. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of toothpaste tablets when compared to conventional toothpaste in removing plaque. We aim to evaluate this by, measuring gingival index (GI) and the plaque index (PI) on subjects that have been either using the tabs or toothpaste.   We hypothesize that there will be no statistically significant difference in GI and PI [INVESTIGATOR_896935]. The results of the study will be highly significant as it will serve as a strong pi[INVESTIGATOR_896936]-degradable plastic.   6. STUDY DESIGN  Background Information & Rationale   Countless plastic toothpaste tubes are thrown out daily because conventional toothpaste is the prime tooth cleansing agent for millions around the world. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_896937], malodor (bad breath), calculus, and dentin hypersensitivity, populations are not utilizing the whole tube as 10% still remains when discarded.6,7 Therefore, plastic alternatives such as Colgate’s Anywhere Toothpaste Tabs, DentTabs, Bite, and many other companies manufactured dissolving, chewable toothpaste in the form of small tablets. This favors sustainable consumerism at a slightly higher cost. Containing fewer ingredients than most toothpaste while packaged into reusable jars, toothpaste tablets’ purpose forces individuals to be eco-friendly while still demonstrating excellent oral hygiene care. In addition, previous research has shown toothpaste tablets to have only a negligible dentin abrasion depth of 0.02mm compared to conventional toothpaste’s 0.06mm loss.[ADDRESS_1257288] several years prompted questions regarding tablets’ capability of plaque elimination.  Plaque accumulates on tooth surfaces due to the presence of biofilm. Biofilm consists of bacterial microorganisms that start as translucent, unstructured film that can eventually transition into calcified hard tenacious stones inside the oral cavity.12 Due to its quick formation in a matter of 21 days, untouched biofilm left on tooth surfaces can ultimately lead to the development of dental caries and periodontal disease.   In order to show the effectiveness of plaque removal between conventional toothpaste versus toothpaste tablets, two highly recognized indices will be used: gingival index (GI) and Turesky’s Modified plaque index (PI)–originally changed from Quigley Hein Index.       
Page 4 of 12  Gingival Index (GI) was introduced by [CONTACT_896944] 1963. GI can be used in all teeth or selected teeth. The examination will be done by a blunt probe. The following teeth will be used,             The GI scores will indicate as follows, 0: No inflammation. 1: Mild inflammation, slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on probing. 2: Moderate inflammation, moderate glazing, redness, bleeding on probing. 3: Severe inflammation, marked redness and hypertrophy, ulceration, tendency to spontaneous bleeding.   The GI index will be calculated as follows,  GI Index= GI total scores/No of surfaces (N=18)  GI Index Interpretation,  0.1–1.0: Mild gingivitis  1.1–2.0: Moderate gingivitis  2.1–3.0: Severe gingivitis  For measuring plaque accumulation, the Turesky Modified version contains a basis from 0-5, while also distinguishing severity and location. The same six teeth will be used. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_896938], 0: No plaque. 1: Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth. 2: A thin continuous band of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth. 3: A band of plaque wider than 1 mm covering less than 1/3rd of the crown of the tooth. 4: Plaque covering at least 1/3rd but less than 2/3rd of the crown of the tooth. 5: Plaque covering 2/3rd or more of the crown of the tooth. 
 

Page 5 of 12  Given the environmental advantages of toothpaste tabs, it is worth exploring the effectiveness of tabs following the action of daily brushing within a 2-week trial period.    After measurements are recorded, comparison of the GI & PI [INVESTIGATOR_896939].     a. Endpoints   Primary endpoints  GI and PI [INVESTIGATOR_896940].   Secondary endpoints  Satisfaction on user-friendliness of both types of toothpastes.  b. Overall study design  A convenience sample of 40 participants will be randomized into two groups containing 20 individuals each. Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_2329] a randomization table that is generated by [CONTACT_30165]. Selection of participants will concur to a written consent primarily based on voluntary agreement restricted only to a student consensus.  Group A. Colgate Cavity Protection will be selected as the conventional toothpaste for the control group due to its low abrasivity8.  Group B. Colgate Anywhere Toothpaste Tablets will be used as the prime cleansing agent for the experimental group.   Subjects will be instructed to use their normal oral hygiene routine throughout a 2-week timeline. New toothbrushes will be used for both groups– Colgate Slim Soft Gliding Tips Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact Head.   Group B will be instructed to use Colgate Anywhere toothpaste tablets where one tablet will be used for brushing. Subjects will gently chew on the tablet to dissolve it and will brush for two minutes at least twice a day. Any residual excess from the tablets are to be spit out. Group A will use Colgate Cavity Protection toothpaste and brush at least twice a day for two minutes.  c. Study Procedures and Schedule   Subjects will consent to participate. The examiner will then perform an oral examination to provide an evaluation of plaque and gingival indexes. Post [ADDRESS_1257289]. The teeth will be reevaluated with new numeric data, where the scores will be added then divided by [CONTACT_896945]. At the end participants will receive a 10-item satisfaction survey.   d.

The LLUSD East Wing Clinic will be used for the study. The reception desk will be used for student researchers to obtain the consent form from subjects that volunteer and are eligible.   10. SCREENING             On arrival at the reception desk, subjects will be screened for the listed inclusion and             exclusion criteria.    11. POTENTIAL RISKS   There is minimal risk going through the clinical examination. However, there may be some jaw pain associated with prolonged mouth opening. Standard of care procedures for clinical oral examination will be followed under the supervision of a licensed dentist (including but not limited to proper PPE, infection control) and the process of assessment and survey will be explained during recruitment. 
Page [ADDRESS_1257290]            data will be stored in a locked suite, locked office, and locked cabinet. Data stored            electronically is only kept on secure LLU server.  12. POTENTIAL BENEFIT(S)  Potential benefits to subjects and society would be to provide that there is not a clinical or statistical difference in the efficacy of dental tablets versus conventional toothpaste. Providing data that presents no difference in using either tablets or toothpaste may incline the public to switch to an eco-friendlier dentifrice, thus reducing waste. Potential benefits outweigh the risks of this study due to the very low risk involved.    13. SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL OR TERMINATON  Reasons for withdrawal or termination: Subjects will have the freedom to withdraw at  any time point of the study.   Handling of subject withdrawals or termination: Records will be kept on subjects that  choose to withdraw and the reason why.  Premature termination or suspension of study: N/A          14. COMPENSATION  No compensation will be given to participants   15.

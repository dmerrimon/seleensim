 2. INTRODUCTION   
2.1. Device Description  
Philips Image Guided Therapy Devices has recently developed and received FDA approval  an 
intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)  catheter (VeriSight/ VeriSight Pro, henceforth defined as 
VeriSight in this protocol ) that has 2D and/or 3D imaging capabilities. These catheters are for use 
with Philips EPIQ series of ultrasound system. The indication for use for VeriSight is intended for 
intracardiac and intra-luminal visualization of cardiac and great vessel anatomy and physiology as 
well as visualization of other devices in the heart. The catheter is intended for imaging guidance 
only, not treatment delivery, during cardiac interventional percutaneous procedures. A detailed 
description of VeriSight can be found in the products’ IFU.  
The current benchmark for image guidance in percutaneous cardiac intervention procedure is 
transesophageal echocardiography. The major advantage of ICE over TEE is its unique imaging 
from within the heart, providing shorter image distances to target anatomy or device, and higher 
resolution. In addition, ICE can be used under conscious sedation thus avoiding the need of 
esophageal intubation and eliminating the risk for esophageal trauma. Further, ICE can also reduce 
fluoroscopy exposure to both the patient and the operator. 
 Background  
ICE has been around for more than 20 years and its use has significantly increased with the advent of invasive electrophysiology (EP) and percutaneous structural heart disease (SHD) interventions. 
ICE is an advanced imaging modality that has become an integral part of a variety of percutaneous interventional and EP procedures, potentially improving outcomes and reducing risks
1-3.  
Recent reports demonstrate that ICE utility as a primary guidance or as a supplement to 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in various  SHD and EP interventions such as left atrial 
appendage (LAA) closure, interatrial shunt closure, left and right heart transcatheter valve 
intervention, ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure4. There are 
several ultrasound imaging tools/techniques to guide cardiac interventions. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was initially described  to guide percutaneous interventions in [ADDRESS_853352] 
wall also does not offer continuous procedural guidance and may disrupt the workflow during interventional procedures. TTE use during an intervention can be also problematic due to the need 
for a separate operator (a sonographer) to acquire and manipulate the images. TEE  unlike TTE 
offers superior image resolution for left heart structures, and may allow visualization of the entire 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], including catheter tips, wires, and devices
6. Drawbacks of TEE include the requirement for 
esophageal intubation and potential complications such as gastrointestinal tract injury, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516],

 and anesthetics side effects7. Additionally, anterior structures may be difficult to visualize on TEE 
secondary to far -field exposure and shadowing from adjacent structures. The probe may also 
obscure the interventionalists’ field of view on fluoroscopy8. 
The use of ICE avoids most of those limitations. As such, ICE has become a widely used ultrasound 
based imaging tool in the interventional laboratory. Imaging with ICE has evolved from cross -
sectional imaging using a rotating transducer, to sector -based imaging using a phased-array 
transducer9. Phased array ICE has many advantages over rotational ICE including a greater 
frequency range, greater depth of field, steerability, and the possibility of acquiring Doppler and color flow imaging. Phased-array catheters can be easily advanced and positioned through short 
sheaths and do not require long guide sheaths. The major advantage of ICE over TEE is its unique 
imaging from within the heart, providing shorter image distances to target anatomy or device, and 
higher resolution. In addition, ICE can be used under conscious sedation thus avoiding the need of 
esophageal intubation and eliminating the risk for esophageal trauma. Further, ICE can reduce 
fluoroscopy exposure to both the patient and the operator
10.  
Evidence of Prior Clinical Data with ICE Technology 
The performance and safety of the ICE imaging modal ity has been well established in different 
percutaneous interventions. Below we provide several examples of the outcomes of the utility of 
ICE technology in a variety of SHD and EP procedures.  
Structural Heart diseases interventions  
During transseptal catheterization, ICE helps provide direct visualization of the interatrial septum 
and is invaluable tool to guide a safe transseptal puncture. ICE  delineates the anatomy of intra- and 
extracardiac structures not identified with fluoroscopy and simplifies correct positioning of the 
transseptal dilator, puncture of the fossa ovalis, and cannulation of the left atrium in a timely and 
uncomplicated fashion11. In another study, the use of AcuNav ICE  catheter during left heart 
radiofrequency ablation and transcatheter closure procedures successfully guided transseptal catheterization,  provided imaging of normal or aberrant anatomy of the right/left atrial (interatrial 
septum, fossa ovalis, appendages, 4 pulmonary vein ostia) and right/left ventricular (valves and 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_247450]) structures. AcuNav was crucial in providing early identification of procedure 
complications, including pericardial effusion (n = 2, detected before systematic hemodynamic 
deterioration) and thrombus formation on sheaths deployed in the right atrium (n = 9) and left atrium 
(n = 2, early elimination with management of the sheath)
12.  
Atrial Septal Defect Closure 
Several studies have reported the feasibility and safety of ICE for guiding transcatheter closure of 
Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)3. There was close agreement between ICE and TEE in their assessment 
of devi ce position and the adequacy of septal capture before device release (98%) and in identifying

 the presence of significant residual shunts. ICE detected all potentially adverse events, including 
four malpositions, and guided appropriate remedial action13,14. 
Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Imaging and Closure Procedures  
ICE provides adequate visualization of the LAA and can be used as an alternative to TEE in guiding 
LAA occlusion (LAAO) procedures15-17. Matsuo et  al. investigated a total of 27 patients with AF 
receiving Watchman left atrial appendage closure under ICE guidance at a single center. All patients 
were successfully implanted. There were no major procedural complications. The overall procedure-
related complication rate was 14.8% primarily attributed to access site hematoma16.  
Baseline clinical and procedural characteristics , and in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638215] a Watchman was implanted with ICE vs. TEE guidance. Device implantation 
success rate was 100% in both groups. There were no device embolization, significant peri -device 
leak, tamponade, stroke, and access site bleeding reported in any patient. Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638216]-alone LAAO was comparable between groups (2 days [2-2] vs. 2 days [2-3.3], P = 0.17, in 
ICE vs. TEE, respectively)17.  
The impact of ICE to guide LAAO has been established15-18. Reported high technical success rates 
range between 96.7% and 100.0%, irrespective of RA or LA ICE probe position. Korsholm et al . 
studied the efficacy and safety of ICE and TEE from the left atrium for procedural guidance of 
transcatheter LAAO. Technical success was achieved in 99% of both the TEE and ICE group. 
Procedural success was 94.5% in ICE -guided group. Major peri -procedural complications occurred 
in 4.7% of the TEE gr oup and 1.8% of the ICE group. In addition, contrast use and procedural time 
were reduced with ICE19. 
Mitral Valve Procedures  
ICE guidance for  percutaneous catheter -based Mitral Valve (MV) repair techniques  have been 
described. Saji et al . used ICE adjunctively with TEE for guiding percutaneous MV repair with the 
MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular) in patients with failed prior surgical rings. In this study, the ICE 
catheter was introduced transarterially into the LV and anteflexed to obtain a short-axis vie w of the 
valve. The authors state that ICE was helpful to assess the insertion of the posterior leaflet into the MitraClip’s arms, particularly in this group of patients, in which TEE imaging of the MV may be 
shadowed by [CONTACT_638223]
20. During the MV Valvuloplasty procedure, ICE is used to rule out 
LAA thrombus, guide the transseptal catheterization, confirm optimal balloon position, monitor 
balloon inflation, and assess the valve before and after valvuloplasty21, 22. 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replace ment (TAVR)  
ICE-guided TAVR may represent an important alternative to TEE for TAVR imaging guidance and 
possibly allow for less -intensive sedation or anesthesia23. Other advantages of ICE include

 uninterrupted monitoring, no fluoroscopic interference, and precise Doppler -based assessment of 
pulmonary artery pressures24. 
Electrophysiology procedures  
The EP procedure involves study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart. There are several 
therapeutic and surgical methods to treat many of the rhythm di sturbances of the heart such as 
surgical implantation of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter –defibrillator.  
ICE can be used in AF ablation procedures to guide transseptal puncture. ICE imaging can also be used in the following  procedural steps, including (1) characterization of pulmonary vein anatomy 
(number of veins, diameter, anatomic variants), (2) transseptal catheterization, (3) catheter 
positioning and contact [CONTACT_10056], (4) assessment of lesion formation, (5) prevention and early 
detection of procedural complications such as pericardial effusion or thrombus formation, (6) 
assessment of pulmonary veins physiology/flow before and after ablation, and (7) location of the esophagus in relationship to the pulmonary vein ostium
25, 26. ICE is useful to assist ablation of the 
cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) in patients with typi[INVESTIGATOR_169208]. In a randomized trial  that includ ed 
102 patients with typi[INVESTIGATOR_382868], ICE -guided ablation of the CTI significantly shortened the procedure 
time radiation exposure, and time spent for ablation in comparison with fluoroscopy -only 
procedures. About 13% of the patients from the fluoroscopy -only group crossed over to ICE 
guidance because of failure to achieve CTI block and were all treated successfully27. 
ICE has an invaluable role in the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_638217]. It provides real -
time visualization of the ablation catheter in relation to a particular anatomic structure, allowing for 
continuous assessment of catheter –tissue contact. This is key for effective energy delivery to the 
targeted structure of interest, possibly increasing effectiveness and limiting collateral damage. Lesion formation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_638218]
28. Saksena et al . studied the role of ViewFlex  ICE catheter in 
comparison to TEE in imaging of left atrium and interatrial septal during atrial fibrillation. ICE and 
TEE showed concordance for LAA, IAS and SEC imaging but not for LA and LAA thrombus 
detection where ICE imaging was less sensitive compared to TEE for LAA thrombus identification.  
There were no adverse events or complications reported for ICE or TEE29.  
Transvenous Lead Extraction  
Sadek et al . reported the utility of ICE during transvenous lead extraction. ICE imaging provides 
continuous monitoring for procedural complications. It allows for identification of lead binding sites within the heart or the SVC, which are predictive of a more complex  procedure and the need for 
advanced extraction tools. In addition, ICE can detect the presence of lead-related echo densities, 
suggestive of thrombi or vegetations. Interestingly, these echo densities were found in 72% of 
patients, mostly in the absence of bacteremia

 Registry Rationale  
Until recently, ICE has been limited to only two-dimensional (2D) imaging planes. Enabling real -time 
three-dimensional (3D) imaging with the Philips VeriSight combines the advantages of ICE with 
imaging capabilities that so far have only been available for TEE , and it has the potential to improve 
procedural guidance; quickly and easily locate guidewires, catheters, and devices; and provide 
greater anatomic information during percutaneous interventions. This novel real tim e 2D/3D ICE 
system has received US Food and Drug Administration clearance for commercial use and 
distribution.  The purpose of this observational multi -center registry  is to evaluate real -world safety 
and performance of VeriSight for ultrasound guided ICE imaging in percutaneous cardiac 
intervention procedures when used in standard clinical practice. The intended patient population are 
patients undergoing percutaneous c ardiac intervention procedures  for which VeriSight is indicated. 
The evidence from this post-market registry will be used for publications and to support regulatory 
filings outside  of the US market.  
 Risk/Benefit Assessment   
This will be an open-label all-comers registry. The design of the protocol is observational  and there 
are no interventions as part of the registry. A ll interventions such as procedures occurring during 
this protocol are the standard clinical practice and their use will be directed by [CONTACT_638224]. The Philips VeriSight ICE  catheter  has received 510(k) clearance from  
FDA allowing U.S. commercial sale. Investigators  enrolling patients into the registry, wi ll be imaged 
with the VeriSight catheter. Use of the product in this registry will be on label  per the IFU  and 
standard clinical practice. Patients will not be placed at  additional clinical risk by [CONTACT_638225] y. Although there are no added risks due to standard of care, the benefit at large will involve 
a better understanding of the safety profile for the ICE catheter tech within the respective 
intervention. Any complications associated with the VeriSight catheter and those related to the 
cardiac intervention procedures will be  collected and reported.  
 REGISTRY DESIGN  
 General Description 
This is a prospective, multi -center, observational , single-arm  registry intended to gather real -world 
data to report  VeriSight  ICE catheter performance and safety . It will be conducted in the United 
States under the approval of one or more recognized institutional review boards and in compliance 
with GCP guidelines defined in ISO:[ZIP_CODE];2011 , the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable 
federal and local laws and regulations. Only on label uses of the VeriSight ICE catheter will be 
allowed. No specific  claims are being validated during this registry , though data analyzed from this 
protocol  are intended to inform of future claims regarding the performance and safety of the 
VeriSight catheter.

 Index Procedur e 
Subjects enrolled in the registry will undergo imaging using the VeriSight catheter at the time of the 
index  procedure. This visit will consist of the following procedures. 
The indication for ICE imaging and the types of procedures that utilized Veri Sight will be 
documented. Patient management and treatment decisions are at the discretion of the care team 
per routine standard clinical practice. The model  of VeriSight and the venous access approach are 
to be per the investigator ’s discretion. Confirmation of the delivery of the VeriSight  catheter to reach 
the target intracardiac anatomical position including the number of attempts depending on the 
procedure type will be recorded. The sustained operation of the catheter will be monitored 
throughout the case and recorded as part of the device technical complications  including device 
malfunction/ deficiency  and any additional  procedural delays/ disruption when using VeriSight for 
various procedures . 
Clinical data on the imaging views obtained durin g the procedure will be obtained.  The angle of the 
views  (0, 45, 90, 135 sweep)  including axis , and the use of xP lane,  iRotate, 2D or  3D, TrueVue, 
MultiVue modalities are left to the investigator’s  discretion. The anatomical landmarks for image 
quality assessment depend on the procedure type. Image acquisitions of cardiac structures with 
VeriSight shall be recorded depending on the procedure type.   
The sequence of imaging for each procedure type are according to physician workflow preference. 
The method and access to the left atrium including transseptal puncture depending on the procedure 
type are to be per the investigator’s  discretion. For each procedure labeled screenshots and 
respective measurements will be documented for key procedural steps . The number of great 
vessels and chambers imaged will be documented. Sizing relevant anatomy  for intervention or 
device placement and visualization , guidance and verification for delivery and/or placement of 
interventional device will also be noted in the case report form . Imaging with VeriSight for 
visualization  and evaluation of intra-procedural complications  and hemodynamic monitoring will be 
captured. Images obtained from different procedure types will be reviewed by [CONTACT_638231].  
The image quality will be scored by  [CONTACT_638227] a four point ordinal  Likert-type rating 
scale  with the following response options: excellent, good, acceptable, unacceptable, and 
unusable. The image quality evaluation is an overall assessment of the quality of images of each 
anatomical position/ utilization for the procedure types .  
During the proc edure, the total length of the procedure (wheels in/out time, and skin to skin time) , 
fluoroscopy time, total contrast volume, and fluoroscopic dosage will be documented. The ability 
to image from the right side of the heart  for a left sided intervention for certain procedure types will 
be noted in the case report form . Change in management (if any) including both patient and

Adverse device effects  related to the VeriSight catheter during the procedure will be documented  
appropriately in the case report form . The subcategories are defined per  ISO14155:2011, as 
described in Section 7.0.  
 Post-procedure  
Patients will be followed up until discharge or until  ≤[ADDRESS_853362] procedure whichever is earlier. 
Adverse device effects related with the use of the VeriSight device will be captured in the case 
report form during this visit as defined in Section 7.0.  
 Usability  Assessments during Index Procedure  
Physical attributes of Catheter evaluation method 
The evaluation of the physical attributes of the catheter such as catheter handling characteristics , 
EPIQ system navigation, and imaging modality  will be assessed at specific  enrollment stages at 
each participating site: after first patient enrolled, 10th patient enrolled, and last patient enrolled. 
Evaluation of response will be captured via a scoring scale (poor, average, good, excellent)  based 
on experience acquired with VeriSight in this registry.  
The participating investigator will evaluate the  same physical characteristics of the catheter , 
ultrasound system navigation, and imaging modality based  on their own clinical experiences of 
imaging that would have been generally used during the procedure. This rating score is defined as  
inferior, better, super ior and will be gathered at first enrollment, 10th enrollment, and last enrollment 
at each participating site.

 Device Deficiency - inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety or performance such as malfunctions, misuse or use errors and inadequate labeling  
 Device Malfunction or Use Errors  
Device malfunctions or use errors will be recorded and evaluated for possible untoward effects on 
the subject. For the purposes of this study, a device malfunction is defined as a failure of the device 
to perform its intended function when used in accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU). If a 
VerSight device malfunction results in an adverse experience for the subject, this adverse 
experience should be considered an adverse device effect and recorded on the appropriate CRF. A device malfunction by [CONTACT_638235]-existing condition. If a VeriSight  device malfunction occurs in this 
registry , the site should follow standard commercial procedures. 
 Reporting Requirements 
Philips VeriSight catheter used in this registry for imaging during percutaneous cardiac 
interventional procedures  is cleared for commercial use by [CONTACT_1622] . Therefore, the use described 
in this protocol constitutes a standard clinical practice use. Inform ation related to contraindications, 
adverse effects, warnings and precautions are included in the device instructions for use.  
Reporting for this registry  will be limited to peri -procedural ( at discharge or ≤ 48H) ADEs, SADEs 
and [LOCATION_003]DEs (per the above definition) occurring while performing the index procedure with the 
guidance of Philips VeriSight. VeriSight  may be used in the detection/monitoring of adverse events  
related to the procedure  (i.e., post cardiac procedure thrombus recognition) during the proc edure. 
Adverse device effects  related to the device should also be reported to the Study Medical Monitor 
(see below). All adverse device effects must be reported to Philips IGTD as soon as possible after 
first awareness of the event; every attempt must be made to report such events to Philips IGTD

 no event later than [ADDRESS_853364] information for complaint reporting is: [EMAIL_12168] . The sites  
should follow standard commercial procedures for reporting device complaints. Device deficiencies 
are NOT  to be reported as ADEs. However, if there is an ADE that results from a device deficiency, 
that specific event would be recorded on the appropriate case report form . 
 Severity of Event  
The following guidelines will be used to assess event severity:  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subjects  daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.)  
 Relationship to Study Device  
Relationship to registry  device  administration will be determined as follows: 
• Possible Relationship: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence w ith use of the 
VeriSight device and follows a known response pattern to the study treatment but could have 
been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Probable Relationship: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence with use of the 
VeriSight  device; follows a known response pattern to the study treatment; and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical st ate or by [CONTACT_43596][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Definite Relationship: An AE that follows a plausible temporal sequence with use of the 
VeriSight  device and follows a known response pattern to the study treatment. The reaction 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_638237]’s clinical state 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
• Unknown/Impossible to Determine: Given the information available, sequence and timing of 
events, it is unknown or impossible to determine the relationship of the AE with the VeriSight 
device.  
 Expectedness  
The Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_638219].  An A DE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the device in this 
registry . Please refer to the instructions for use for a listing of adverse effects.

which is less than or equal to [ADDRESS_853365] procedure. Events will be followed until resolution if 
possible.  
Events will be reported via the electronic case report form and submitted to the Sponsor .  
Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relationship to study device  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] 
a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study  due to the use of the study device, it will be recorded as an AD E.  
8. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION  
 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size of up to 200 subjects  was selected based on a goal for the registry to be able to 
obtain performance and safety associated with use of the VeriSight  catheter. This study is 
observational.  Outcomes remain in the exploratory phase, and therefore hypotheses will not be created.  Instead, the study will serve to monitor, measure, and evaluate outcomes as a basis for 
future research.  This sample size will provide the opportunity to make proper statistical inference 
for hypothesis generation. Due to the various procedure types available for use with VeriSight , up 
to 200 subjects could be enrolled in order to analyze the secondary endpoints  by [CONTACT_638238]. 
 
 Populations for A nalyses  
All subjects  age 18 and older  that are scheduled for and will undergo a planned cardiac 
interventional percutaneous procedure in which the guidance  of ICE is indicated, eligible and willing 
to sign an informed consent without meeting any of the exclusion criteria set and  meeting all the 
inclusion criteria set forth in the protocol will be included in the population  for analyses . Those who 
sign consent but do not undergo a cardiac procedure utilizing the Philips ICE catheter will be 
excluded from the analyses  (screen failures) . 
 Statistical Analyses  
No formal statistical hypothesis test is planned and the primary and secondary endpoints will be 
presented as descriptive statistics only. An interim analysis will be conducted following 100th patient 
enrollment to monitor, measure, and review performance and safety measures prior to 
determination of further enrollment in the registry.

 Statistical  analyses will be done on the real-world, all -comer population and presented as descriptive 
statistics  and 95% confidence intervals . Subject data from all clinical sites are intended to be pooled 
for analysis to broaden demographic representation.  However, it is possible that sub- analyses may 
be conducted in a population stratified by [CONTACT_638239]. 
9. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Regulatory, Ethical , and Study Oversight Considerations 
This registry  will be conducted in accordance with the relevant parts of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (21 CFR 11, 50, 56), ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, the ICH -E6 Guidelines for GCP, the Declaration 
of Helsinki (2013). Additional state and local regulations will be followed when applicable.   
 
Investigators and sites are required to have the protocol, informed consent forms, and any other 
materials related to this study plan approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Any additional requirements imposed by 
[CONTACT_137314]. Any amendments to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_305724], and subsequently, by [CONTACT_112110], according to the approval committee’s 
requirements. Prior to enrollment, the Sponsor or designee will review the written approvals for 
completeness, inc luding the required elements of the consent form, and the Sponsor  will provide 
protocol and study administration training. The continued eligibility for participation by [CONTACT_638240] (e.g. annual  reviews, 
amendment reviews).   
 
Each subject will provide written, informed consent as outlined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_853366] comply with applicable 
regulatory requirements (e.g., 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56) and should adhere 
to ICH GCP. Prior to the beginning of the registry, the investigator should have the IRB’s written 
approval for the protocol and the written informed consent form(s), ICF and any other written 
information to be provided to the subjects. The consent form describes in detail the study, 
procedures, and risks. If new information becomes available during the course of the study that is 
relevant to the safety or well -being of the subjects, the consent form may be updated and presented 
to the subjects for review and consideration of continued participation. Consent forms will be 
provided to subjects in their native language and will be translated from the IRB approved version.  
Study participation is voluntary. Potential subjects, and/or their legal representatives if subject is 
unable to consent on their own behalf, are given the most current IRB -approved consent form to 
read.  They shall be provided ample time for review and an opportunity to ask questions about the 
study.  If they agree to participate, they shall sign the consent form and be given a copy of the signed 
document for their records, along with any additional  subject information.  Each of these

 actions/steps shall be documented.  Only after Informed Consent has been obtained, may the 
remaining study procedures begin.  
Patients scheduled for percutaneous cardiac intervention procedure and not contraindicated for  ICE 
use will be asked to provide consent to use their data. Patients who agree to study participation 
must sign an IRB -approved ICF. Subjects will be informed that their participation in this study is 
voluntary and they may refuse to participate or discontinue from the study at any time. Subjects may withdraw from the study at their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable 
representative. The sponsor must be informed in each withdrawal case. The reason for withdrawal 
must be recorded in the eCRF and in the patient medical record. 
 Registry Discontinuation and Closure 
When a registry  is prematurely terminated, refer to Section 4.7, for handling of enrolled study 
subjects.  
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_638241] s.  If the study is prematurely terminated 
or suspended, the Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study subject s, the Instituti onal 
Review Board ( IRB), and will  provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.   
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subject s 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met 
• Determination of futility  
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed,  and satisfy the Sponsor, IRB and/or Food and Drug Administration ( FDA).) 
 Confidentiality and P rivacy  
This registry protocol, its associated methodologies, study devices, study -generated data, and the 
data management system contain confidential and proprietary information.  Subject confidentiality 
will be maintained according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA). Release of such information outside the scope of planned study operation is prohibited.  
All federal and local laws regarding protection of patient confidentiality will be followed, as well as any additional site-specific requirements that may be required.
 Personal H ealth Information (PHI) 
will be acquired during the consenting process of the subject and from the medical records . All data

The study subject’s contact [CONTACT_21225]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for 
as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional policies, or Sponsor requirements. 
 
 Safety Oversight  
Due to the nature of this observational real world registry, a safety oversight/data safety monitoring committee is not planned for this post- market registry.
 
 Clinical Monitoring  
This study will be monitored using a risk -based monitoring approach, consistent with the FDA 
guidance Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk -Based Approach to Monitoring (2013) and 
Philips clinical study monitoring procedures.  Registry monitoring i s the responsibility of the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor or designee will monitor the study throughout its duration. Monitoring will ensure that 
documents used to originally record subject data (source documents) are maintained, and to verify that transcribed data are accurately reflected on the study electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs).  
Monitoring visits will be scheduled based on the enrollment rate at each site, duration of the registry, 
compliance, and any known or suspected inconsistency in data that requires investigation. 
Monitoring visits may be conducted onsite and/or remotely (e.g., virtual visit), as necessary.  
The sponsor may terminate investigator and site participation in the registry if there is evidence of 
an investigator’s failure to maintain adequate clinical standards or evidence of an Investigator or 
staff’s failure to comply with the protocol. Notification of suspension or termination will occur no later 
than 5 working days after the Sponsor makes the determination. In the event of registry sus pension 
or termination, the Sponsor will send a report outlining the circumstances to the reviewing IRB and the appropriate regulatory agencies, and to all participating investigators.

 The registry may also be suspended or discontinued early if there is an observation of serious 
adverse events presenting an unreasonable risk to the registry subjects or inadequate subject 
enrollment. 
The sponsor may delegate some of the above monitoring activities to appropriately qualified contract 
personnel.  
 Quality Assur ance and Q uality Control   
Each site, both clinical and laboratory, should have SOPs for quality management that describe:   
• How data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol, ethical standards, regulatory 
compliance, and accuracy in relation to s ource documents.  
• The documents to be reviewed (e.g., CRFs, clinic notes, product accountability records, 
specimen tracking logs, questionnaires, audio or video recordings), who is responsible, and 
the frequency for reviews.   
• Who will be responsible for addressing QA issues (e.g., correcting procedures that are not in compliance with protocol) and QC issues (e.g., correcting errors in data entry).  
• Staff training methods and how such training will be tracked.  
• If applicable, calibration exercises conducted prior to and during the study to train examiners 
and maintain acceptable intra- and inter -examiner agreement. 
Regular monitoring and an independent audit, if conducted, must be performed according to ICH  
GCP.  See also Section 9.6. 
 Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, 
documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management plan will be developed to 
descri be a site’s quality management. 
 
Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data 
QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies 
will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution. 
 
Following written Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ), the monitors will verify that the clinical 
trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, documented 
(recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Confer ence on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP ), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).  
 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related source data/documents, and 
reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_9177].

 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
This registry  will use an electronic data capture system , DataTrak E DC that is  a [ADDRESS_853367].  The Sponsor will 
train delegated Site personnel on procedures for data entry into the web-based system. Following 
training, delegated staff will be provided ID codes and passwords unique to each team member’s 
delegated study role.  They will be trained on Philips guidelines for maintenance of electronic ID codes and passwords.  A staff member’s ID code/password will never be shared or used by [CONTACT_638242], in any circumstance.  If prior training has already been delivered for other Philips -
sponsored studies of similar design, this training may be reinforced via teleconference prior to study commencement as appropriate. 
 
Source data are all information, original records of c linical findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the  registry .  Electronic source 
data are data initially recorded in electronic form. Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_638220].  Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents. It is acceptable to use 
worksheets that mirror the eCRFs as source documents. Physician surveys and imaging collection worksheets will be provided to the site to capture data that may not otherwise be found in typi[INVESTIGATOR_638221].   
 
It is not acceptable for the CRF to be the only record of a subject’s inclusion in the study.  Registry  
participation should be captured in a subject’s  medical record.  This is to ensure that anyone who 
would access the subject’s  medical record has adequate knowledge that the subjec t is participating 
in the registry . 
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, 
and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible 
manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.

EDC system and will be granted specific user privileges.  All eCRF data are to be completed by [CONTACT_86798], study coordinator, or other designated site personnel. The investigator will perform a 
final review and sign-off at desi gnated times (e.g. registry  exit).  
 
Images acquired by [CONTACT_638243] a removable drive or 
can be downloaded from PACS after anonymization, prior to transfer of images to DataTrak  
following appropriate privacy protections. All images will be saved in Digital Imaging and 
Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format and transferred to a DICOM server. For any 
representative images, loops and/or 3D volumes that are collected as part of the scan, subject names and identifiers will be removed. The site may provide to the Sponsor any additional de-
identified baseline, procedural images that are performed as part of the index procedure (TEE, TTE, 
CT, MRI, fluro etc.). De-identified images, loops, and/or 3D volumes may be used for 
internal/external training, marketing brochures, and promotions.  
 
Completeness  of data entr y will be monitored against the medical record by a monitor during the 
onsite and/or  remote data reviews against the information in the subject’s medical records.  The 
clinical database will be a closed system, allowing for tracking all the data elements and any 
changes made.  
Sponsor will provide the investigational site with supplies for setting up the study files.  Essential documents are listed below: 
• Signed Protocol and amendments; 
• Signed Investigator Agreement; 
• IRB Committee approval letters, consent forms and correspondence;  
• Investigator and Sponsor Reports; 
• Relevant correspondence between the Investigator and Sponsor; 
• Signed Informed Consent Forms (site files only);  
• Notification to Sponsor and IRB of Serious Adverse Events;  
• Administrative Tracking Logs (Monitoring Visits, Training Logs, etc.).  
 Study Records Retention  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the conclusion of the study  (all 
patients at all sites have concluded participation and the Sponsor has indicated the registry  is 
completed/closed out)  or longer if institution requirements dictate. . No records will be destroyed 
without the written consent of the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.

 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as  an event where the clinical Investigator or site personnel deviate 
from the registry  protocol or study procedures.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that 
there are no deviations from the protocol without prior notification and approval of the Sponsor or 
Sponsor’s designee and in full compliance with all established procedures and conditions of the 
reviewing IRB.   
 
The Investigator may deviate from the protocol without prior written approval from the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee in cases of medical emergencies, when the deviation is necessary to eliminate 
an apparent immediate hazard to the subject.  In that event, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor 
or Sponsor’s designee immediately by [CONTACT_127449], notify the reviewing IRB, 
and confirm notification to the Sponsor or designee in writing.  Prior deviati on approval is generally 
not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control, for 
example, the subject was not available for a scheduled follow -up office visit.  These events, although 
outside the Investigator’s control, are still required to be reported on the appropriate protocol 
deviation form in order to ensure that all deviations from the standard subject population are 
adequately documented and reported.  The Investigator will inform the Sponsor or Sponsor’s  
designee of all deviations, and the reviewing IRB of all protocol deviations as per the IRB requirements for this study.  The Investigator shall document all protocol deviations on the electronic 
case report form and submit to the Sponsor for review.  
 
The occurrence of protocol deviations will be monitored by [CONTACT_13679]’s designee for 
evaluation of Investigator compliance to the Protocol, Good Clinical Practices, and regulatory 
requirements.   
 Publication and Data Sharing Policy 
The results of this registry  may be submitted for publication to clinical or medical journals or to 
congresses or conferences for podium presentations.  The rights for publication of results from this 
registry  remain with Philips.  The Investigator must request permission from Philips prior to initiating 
any publication and received in writing.  Review and approval of any data, abstract or manuscript is 
required.  Philips reserves the right to delay publication to review the presentation of study 
methodology, data collection, data analysis, interpretation of data, proprietary information or 
patented technology.  A request for delay and the reason(s) shall be communicated by [CONTACT_638244].   
The study will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and the NCT number w ill be noted in the Sponsor 
study files. The registry  results will be used for publication s and therefore will be posted on the 
website.

 Conflict of  Interest  Policy 
The independence of this registry  from any actual or perceived influence, such as by [CONTACT_638245], is critical.  Therefore,  any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in 
the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed  and managed. 
Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts 
managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the des ign and conduct of this trial.  
The   Institute or C enter  (IC) may have established policies and procedures for all study group 
members to disclose all conflicts of interest and may have established a mechanism for the 
management of all reported dualities of interest. Each investigator participating in the research will 
be asked to complete a financial disclosure form , submit a copy to the Sponsor, and notify the 
Sponsor when there is a change in such disclosures during the course of the study and one year 
following in vestigator discontinuation of participation. Investigators should continue to follow their 
institutional policies regarding the reporting of conflicts of interest in addition to any Sponsor 
requirements.

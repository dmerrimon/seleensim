2.3.1  Correlate  the somatic  mutational  burden* with  clinical  benefit from  nivolumab,  both overall 
response rate (ORR) and progression -free survival (PFS) rate at [ADDRESS_663522]*  with the MSlsensor

2.3.3  Correlate  the MSlsensor  score*  with the MMR  IHC status  (immunohistochemical  staining 
for mismatch repair enzyme proteins).  
2.3.4. Correlate  the pre -treatment immune  phenotype  (tumor  infiltrating  lymphocyte and  PD-L1 
status)  with best overall response rate  (ORR)  and progression free survival rate at 24 
weeks.  
 
* Tissue  will be analyzed for  number of  somatic mutations and  MSlsensor  score  using MSK­ 
IMPACT  under  the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_512738]  #12-245. We will abstract  the data collected  under  12-[ADDRESS_663523] of  care 
for advanced  carcinomas and carcinosarcomas  of the uterus is combination chemotherapy with 
carboplatin and  paclitaxel  2 and gemcitabine plus docetaxel for uterine leiomyosarcomas  3•4. The 
overall response rate  to these regimens is  57% and 27 -36%, respectively,  with complete 
responses being infrequent and all  patients eventually  dying from disease.  More recent studies 
have used  6-month PFS  as a criterion in the assessment of  efficacy in advanced endometrial 
cancer;  single -agent  bevacizumab in  this setting showed a PFS rate  of 40.4% at 6  months  and 
overall response  rate of 13.5%5. There is  a significant need for  new therapeutic  strategies that will 
provide long -lasting  remissions in uterine cancer.  
 
Nivolumab, a fully human, lgG4  (kappa) monoclonal antibody  that binds to  PD-1, has shown 
significant  clinical activity  as a single -agent  in non -small  cell lung cancer 6•8, melanoma  9, renal 
cell carcinoma 10-12, and non-Hodgkin  lymphoma 13. While it  has been shown  that host immune 
response  plays a  role in  controlling malignant progression  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_204629],  thus 
suggesting  immunotherapy  as a rational therapeutic  approach  for this gynecologic  malignancy14, 
similar  data in the  setting of advanced uterine ca ncer has been lacking.  In a study of  63 
endometrial  cancers, polymerase -e (POLE) mutated ultramutated  tumors and microsatellite 
instability high (MSI -H) hypermutated tumors were  found to  be associated  with high neoantigen 
loads, high number of  tumor -infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs), and  corresponding overexpression of 
PD-1 and PD -L1, suggesting POLE -mutant and  MSI-H endometrial  cancers as  excellent 
candidates for PD -1 targeted immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  15. This data is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_512739] "inflammatory"  gene signature [CONTACT_512799] -L1, which may  serve as a  mechanism of adaptive  immune resistance  and indicate a tumor 
that will respond to imm unotherapeutic approaches  16.

In a study  of mutational burden and  mismatch  repair status  in colorectal cancer  (CRC),  [ADDRESS_663524],  a targeted -exome capture assay  of 341 cancer­ 
associated  genes.  Ninety -eight  percent of mismatch  repair -proficient (MMR -P) cases  had 16  or 
fewer somatic mutations detected  with a median number of  6 mutations (range 0 -16) whereas 
MMR -deficient  (MMR -D) tumors had a  median number of  49 somatic mutations (range  23-67) 17. 
This study concluded that using a  cutoff for mutational load, such  as [ADDRESS_663525] tumor  MMR  status or 
microsatellite  instability (MSI).  Such  an approach to determining MSI  status using paired tumor­ 
normal  sequence data  generated by [CONTACT_512770]  18 and 
provides  a promising  method of identifying  MMR -D/MSl -high (MSI -H) cases  that may be missed 
by [CONTACT_385405].  Phase  [ADDRESS_663526] demonstrated that  clinical activity of the anti­ 
programmed death 1 (anti -PD-1) immune  checkpoint  inhibitor pembrolizumab is enriched in  
MMR -D colorectal  and other solid  tumors 19. These  results, taken with  the data from Howitt et  al. 
summarized  above,  suggests  that selecting  patients  with hypermutated,  MMR -D, or MSI-H uterine 
cancers will  enrich for response to  anti-PD-[ADDRESS_663527]  to date 
under IRB protocol #12 -245. These  cases  include 165 endometrial  cancers and  88 uterine 
sarcomas, 23  (9.1%) of which  have 20 or  more  somatic mutations  (range 20 -445; 22 endometrial 
cancers,  1 uterine sarcoma).  We performed mutational signature [CONTACT_512800]  [ADDRESS_663528] a POLE V411L somatic hotspot 
mutation  and had  a predominantly  POLE  signature.  The other 16  tumors,  including 12  with MMR­ 
deficiency by [CONTACT_246115]  (IHC) staining, 2 with unknown MMR  status, and  2 that were 
MMR -proficient  by [CONTACT_4658], had a predominant MSI -H mutational signature (Figure  1). Overall,

3.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab (also  referred to  as BMS -936558 or  MDX1106)  is a human  monoclonal antibody 
(HuMAb;  immunoglobulin  G4 [lgG4] -S228P)  that targets the  programmed death -1 (PD-1) cluster 
of differentiation  279 (CD279) cell  surface  membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative  regulatory 
molecule expressed by  [CONTACT_93247] T  and B  lymphocytes.  20 Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death -ligands  1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of 
lymphocyte activation.  Inhibition  of the  interaction between  PD-1 and its ligands  promotes 
immune  responses and antigen -specific  T-cell responses  to both foreign antigens  as well as  self­ 
antigens. Nivolumab  is expressed  in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cells and  is produced using

OPDIVO™ (nivolumab)  is approved  for use in humans  to treat several  types of cancers,  in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US, Dec -2014),  the European Union  (EU, Jun -2015),  Japan (Jul -2014), and 
several other countries.  
3.2.1  Nonclinical  Development  of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab  has been shown  to bind  specifically  to the human PD -1 receptor and  not to  related 
members of the  CD28  family. 21 Nivolumab inhibits  the interaction of  PD-1 with its ligands, PD -L1 
and PD -L2, resulting  in enhanced T -cell proliferation  and interferon -gamma  (IFN-y) release  in 
vitro.23•24 Nivolumab  binds with  high affinity to  activated  human  T-cells expressing cell  surface  PD- 
1 and to  cynomolgus monkey  PD-1. 21 In a mixed  lymphocyte reaction (MLR),  nivolumab 
promoted a  reproducible concentration -dependent enhancement of  IFN- y release. 23 
 
In intravenous  (IV) repeat -dose toxicology  studies  in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was  well 
tolerated at  doses up  to 50 mg/kg,  administered weekly for  5 weeks,  and at  doses  up to  50 mg/kg, 
administered twice  weekly for [ADDRESS_663531] been assessed in  subjects with non -small 
cell lung cancer  (NSCLC), melanoma, and clear -cell re nal cell carcinoma (RCC)  in addition  to 
other tumor  types . Clinical activity and  safety  information  derives primarily from  that obtained from 
Phase 2/3 studies in  subjects with advanced or metastatic squamous (SQ)  and nonsquamous 
(NSQ) NSCLC, Phase  2/3 studies  in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and a 
Phase 2  study in subjects with  advanced or metastatic clear -cell RCC 21. Nivolumab  is currently 
being investigated both as monotherapy and in  combination with  chemotherapy, targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
Nivolumab is approved in  multiple  countries including the US  for treatment  of previously  treated, 
unresectable or  metastatic  melanoma and  previously treated,  metastatic squamous NSCLC, the 
EU for treatment of  previously treated, unresectable or  metastatic melanoma, and Japan for 
treatment  of unresectable  melanoma. See  Appendix  1 for US Prescribing  Information  (USPI)  and 
Appendix  [ADDRESS_663532] Characteristics (SmPC).  
Clinical  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics  (PK) of nivolumab  was studied in  subjects over a  dose  range of  0.1 to 10 
mg/kg  administered as a  single  dose  or as multiple doses of  nivolumab  every 2  or 3 weeks . The

geometric mean(% CV%) clearance  (CL) was 9 .5 mUh (49.7%), geometric mean volume  of 
distribution  at steady  state (Vss)was 8.0  L (30.4%),  and geometric mean elimination  half-life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%).  Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab  were  reached by  12 
weeks  when  administered at  3 mg/kg O2W,  and systemic accumulation was  approximately  3-fold. 
The exposure to  nivolumab increased dose  proportionally  over the dose  range of 0 .1 to 10 mg/kg 
administered every [ADDRESS_663533] on  the CL 
of nivolumab:  age (29  to 87  years), gender,  race,  baseline  LOH,  PD-L1. A PPK analysis 
suggested no  difference in  CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline 
tumor size, and hepatic  impairment.  
Although  ECOG  status, baseline glomerular  filtration rate (GFR),  albumin,  body weight, and mild 
hepatic impairment had an  effect on  nivolumab CL, the effect was  not clinically  meaningful.  PPK 
and exposure response  analyses have been performed to  support use  of 240 mg  Q2W dosing of 
nivolumab in  addition  to the 3  mg/kg  Q2W  regimen. Using  the PPK  model, exposure of  nivolumab 
at 240 mg  flat dose  was identical to  a dose  of 3 mg/kg  for subjects weighing 80 kg,  which  was the 
approximate median  body weight  in nivolumab  clinical  trials. Across  the various tumor  types in  the 
clinical  program, nivolumab  has been  shown to  be safe  and well  tolerated up to  a dose  level  of 10 
mg/kg, and the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3  mg/kg  and efficacy and 
safety has been  found to be  relatively  flat. Given  the similarity of  nivolumab  PK across  tumor 
types and the  similar exposures predicted following  administration  of 240  mg flat dose compared 
to 3 mg/kg, it  is expected that the  safety and  efficacy  profile of  240 mg  nivolumab will be  similar to 
that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab.  
In addition,  nivolumab [ADDRESS_663534]  more  convenience to  the target patient populations  and allow 
combination of nivolumab with other agents using alternative  dosing regimens versus  Q2W. 
These nivolumab dosing regimens were  selected using PPK and exposure -response  analyses 
modeling  and simulation approaches  such that they are  predicted to provide approximately 
equivalent  exposures  (Cavgss)  following administration  of nivolumab  3 mg/kg Q2W . The model 
predicted that following administration of  nivolumab 360  mg Q3W  and 480 mg  Q4W,  Cavgss are 
expected  to be similar to  those following nivolumab  3 mg/kg  or 240  mg Q2W,  while Cminss are 
predicted  to be 6% and ~16%  lower, respectively,  and are not  considered  to be clinically  relevant. 
Following  nivolumab 360 mg  Q3W and  480 mg  O4W,  Cmaxss are  predicted to be  approximately  
~23%  and ~43%  greater, respectively,  relative to that following nivolumab  3 mg/kg Q2W  dosing; 
however, the  range of  nivolumab exposures (median and  90% prediction intervals) following 
administration  of 360  mg O3W and  480 mg Q4W regimens across the  35 to 160 kg  weight  range 
are predicted to  be maintained  well below the corresponding exposures observed with  the well 
tolerated 10  mg/kg  nivolumab Q2W  dosing  regimen,  and are not considered  to put participants at 
increased risk. Hence, a  flat dose of [ADDRESS_663535] of care  in 
subjects with  advanced or  metastatic NSCLC  6-8 and in  subjects with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma 9. 
 
Clinical  Safety  
The overall  safety  experience with  nivolumab,  as a monotherapy  or in combination with  other 
therapeutics, is based on  experience  in approximately  8,600 subjects treated  to date.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 17 -180 A(10)  
Approval  date:  07-Sep-[ADDRESS_663536] used 
a 60-minute infusion duration wherein nivolumab  has been safely administered up  to 10 mg/kg 
over long  treatment periods. Infusion reactions including high -grade hypersensitivity  reactions 
have been uncommon  across the  nivolumab  clinical  program. In CA209010,  a dose association 
was observed  for infusion site reactions  and hypersensitivity reactions  (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% 
at 2 mg/kg and  18.5% at 10 mg/kg) . All the events  were Grade 1 -2 and were manageable . An 
infusion duration of  30 minutes for  3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of  the dose provided  at 10  mg/kg) is 
not expected to  present any safety concerns compared  to the  prior experience at 10  mg/kg 
nivolumab dose  infused  over a  60-minute  duration.  The safety  of nivolumab 3  mg/kg  administered 
as a 30 -min infusion was assessed  in CA209153  in patients  (n=322) with previously  treated 
advanced  NSCLC  (see Section 5 .5.1.2). Overall,  there were  no clinically meaningful  differences 
in the frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion -related  reactions (of any cause  or treatment -related) 
in cancer patients administered nivolumab over a  30 min infusion compared  with that reported for 
patients  with the 60 min  infusion.  Thus, it  was shown that nivolumab  can be safely  infused over 
30 min in subjects with cancer.  
3.3 Translational  Science  Background  
3.3.1  Mutational  Burden  and MSlsensor  (Exploratory  Biomarkers)  
As detailed  above, previous studies have shown  that a  count  of the absolute number of somatic 
mutations  can predict  which  tumors are  MSI-H or MMR -D 17, and that the clinical benefit of  PD- 
1/PD -L1 pathway blockade is  enriched  in MMR -D tumors  19. In this trial, pre-treatment  matched 
pairs  of tumor  and normal  DNA  from formalin -fixed  paraffin  embedded  (FFPE)  tissue  will be 
evaluated  by [CONTACT_245412] -IMPACT  under  IRB protocol  #12-245. MSK -IMPACT  is a next  generation 
sequencing  assay of  410 cancer -associated  genes  performed  in a CUA -compliant  
laboratory.  It identifies   somatic  point  mutations,  small  insertions  and deletions,  structural  
rearrangements,  and DNA copy  number alterations  in the  tumors  as compared  to matched  normal 
samples.  Treating the number of somatic mutations in  each  patient's  tumor as  a continuous 
variable,  we will seek  to correlate the patient's tumor's  mutational burden with  clinical benefit  from 
nivolumab, both overall response rate (ORR) and  progression -free survival (PFS)  at 24 weeks . 
 
The MSlsensor  algorithm is  a method  for assessing  MSI,  yielding  a "high"  or "low"  result.  We aim 
to correlate the  MSK -IMPACT  somatic mutation number with  the MSlsensor  score . The 
MSlsensor algorithm  may also be correlated with  the MMR  IHC results from  the tumor . 
We will also  explore the  correlation  of pre-treatment immune phenotype (tumor infiltrating 
lymphocyte and PD -L1 status,)  with best overall response  rate (ORR)  and progression free 
survival rate at 24 weeks . 
 
All patients  on this study  will also be consented  to IRB protocol  #12-[ADDRESS_663537] MSK­ 
IMPACT  sequencing performed.  All of  the questions we  seek  to answer  using MSK -IMPACT 
results in this protocol will use data abstracted  from the EMR.

3.3.2  Analyzing  the Inflammatory  Phenotype in  the Tumor  Microenvironment  (Exploratory 
Biomarker)  
Immune  infiltration  of tumors  has been demonstrated  in multiple  studies  to be both prognostic  and 
predictive of  response to  immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  with tumors exhibiting  inflamed phenotypes  being 
most  responsive.  Assessment of  the immune  subsets in the  tumors will help  to establish 
predictive markers on  the basis  of pre-treatment  phenotype  as well  to determine whether clinical 
efficacy correlates with  the degree of  infiltration  of specific  immune cell subsets . In addition,  both 
PD-L1 and indoleamine -2,3-dioxygenase  (IDO) have been demonstrated to be  up-regulated  in 
tumors  in response to  immune  infiltration  and may  serve  as negative  feedback  mechanisms  24. As 
such,  pre-treatment FFPE will be evaluated  for the presence of Tlls and immune  marker PD -L1. 
Evaluation  of Tlls and PD -L1 will be performed in  the laboratory of [CONTACT_512804]  in 
collaboration  with [CONTACT_512805].  See appendix  4. 
 
3.4 Inclusion of  Women  and Minorities  
Participating institutions will not  exclude potential subjects  from participating  in this or any study 
solely on  the basis of  ethnic origin or  socioeconomic status.  Every attempt will  be made  to enter 
all eligible  patients into this protocol  and therefore address the  study  objectives  in a patient 
population  representative  of the entire  uterine cancer population treated by [CONTACT_512771]. 
4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This is  an MSKCC investigator -initiated,  single -center,  non-randomized, open -label,  phase 2 
study  to evaluate  the activity of nivolumab in  patients  with recurrent or persistent  hypermutated, 
MMR -D, or MSI -H uterine cancer. Activity of  nivolumab will be  assessed  by [CONTACT_512772] -free at 24 weeks (primary  endpoint)  or who have 
objective RECIST response  (co-primary endpoint).  The safety and  tolerability  of single -agent 
nivolumab in  this population  will also  be evaluated.  
Each cycle  will be 28  days (4  weeks) in duration.  Patients will receive study treatment with 
nivolumab until disease  progression,  development  of intolerable  toxicity, elective  withdrawal from 
the study, study  completion, or study  termination . Patients who  demonstrate radiologic 
progression by  [CONTACT_512773] (but not  primary  efficacy 
analysis) if  they are  deemed to  be clinically benefiting,  according to  predetermined  permitted 
criteria (section 12.4).  
 
Safety will  be evaluated through the monitoring of  all serious  and non-serious AEs and  irAE's, 
graded according  to the  current version of National  Cancer lnstitute's  Common  Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v . 4.03). AEs will be  collected from  the time  of study 
enrollment  until [ADDRESS_663538] dose of study drug  dose.  
 
4.2 Intervention  
Eligible  patients will  undergo screening  and baseline  procedures per  the Study Schedule.  Study 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be  applied per section  6.0. Enrolled patients will receive

11.1.2  Immune -Related  Adverse Event  (irAEs) General  Definition,  Monitoring, and 
Management  
 
Guidelines  for the management  of adverse events  and toxicities  are detailed  in Appendix  3. 
 
For the purposes of  this protocol, an  immune -related  adverse reaction irAE is defined as an 
adverse reaction of  unknown etiology associated with  drug exposure and  consistent with  an 
immune  phenomenon.  Efforts should  be made  to rule out  neoplastic,  infectious, metabolic,  toxin 
or other etiologic  causes prior to  labeling  an event an  irAEs.  Serologic, immunologic, and 
histologic (biopsy)  data should be used  to support the diagnosis of an  immune -related  toxicity. 
Suspected immune -related  adverse reactions must  be documented on an  AE or SAE form . 
 
Overall,  immune -related  AEs commanly  start within [ADDRESS_663564]  cases  successfully  managed  by [CONTACT_512778],  discontinuing  dosing, and/or through 
administering symptomatic or immunosuppressive  therapy, including corticosteroids,  as 
mentioned below.  Immune -related  AEs generally  resolved within days to  weeks in  the majority  of 
subjects . 
 
Patients should  be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of  clinically significant 
systemic  immune -mediated  adverse reactions (e.g., systemic  lupus  erythematosus -like diseases)

or organ -specific  immune -mediated  adverse  reaction (e.g ., rash,  colitis,  uveitis, hepatitis  or thyroid 
disease).  If an immune -mediated  adverse  reaction  is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy 
if possible) should be  performed, and steroid therapy may  be considered if  clinically necessary . 
 
It is unknown if  systemic corticosteroid  therapy has  an attenuating  effect on nivolumab activity. 
However, clinical  anti-tumor responses have been maintained in  patients  treated wit h 
corticosteroids  and discontinued  from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If utilized, corticosteroid  therapy should be 
individualized for  each  patient. For example,  prior experience  suggests  that colitis  manifested  as 
grade  [ADDRESS_663565] occurred  after 
a single dose and  after as  many as 48  treatments. The frequency of pulmonary AEs may  be 
greater with  nivolumab combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_512745] . The majority of 
cases reported were  Grade 1  or 2, and  subjects presented with either asymptomatic radiographic 
changes (eg, focal ground glass  opacities and patchy  infiltrates)  or with symptoms of  dyspnea, 
cough, or fever. Subjects with reported Grade [ADDRESS_663566]  been 
reported in  subjects with a variety of  tumor types; however, there  have been numerically more 
cases in  subjects with NSCLC. It is not clear whether the underlying  NSCLC is a  distinct risk 
factor, or  if subjects with  NSCLC are more  likely  to develop  radiographic changes and symptoms 
for which  it is difficult to  distinguish between nivolumab related and  unrelated  causes . At this time, 
no other  underlying  risk factor,  including  prior radiotherapy,  presence  of lung metastases,  or 
underlying  pulmonary medical history, has yet to be  identified.  
 
Asymptomatic subjects were typi[INVESTIGATOR_512746] . Subjects with Grade 2 
pneumonitis  were managed with dose  delay,  treated with corticosteroids,  and had resolution  of 
pneumonitis within days to  weeks. In  cases  where  nivolumab treatment was  restarted, recurrence 
of pneumonitis  was infrequently  reported across the  nivolumab program. Subjects with  more 
severe cases  of pneumonitis  can be difficult  to treat. In a  few cases,  subjects who did not  initially 
respond  to corticosteroids  were  administered  anti-tumor necrosis  factor  therapy (infliximab)  and/or 
cyclophosphamide.  In some  of these cases,  pneumonitis  began to  resolve following the use of 
these additional  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Guidelines  on the  recommended management of  pneumonitis and other pulmonary AEs are 
found in  Appendix  3. Early  recognition and t reatment  of pneumonitis is  critical  to its management. 
Subjects should be  advised to  seek  medical  evaluation  promptly  if they develop  new-onset 
dyspnea, cough, or  fever or  if they have worsening of these baseline symptoms. As  respi[INVESTIGATOR_512747] (eg, NSCLC), it is  important  that an 
evaluation/work -up distinguishes between non -drug-related causes (eg,  infection or  progression 
of disease) and  a possible drug -related  pulmonary toxicity as the  management of these events 
can be quite different. For symptomatic nivolumab -related  pneumonitis,  the principal treatment is 
corticosteroids  (Appendix  3). All subjects with Grade 3 -4 pneumonitis should discontinue  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 17 -180 A(10)  
Approval  date:  07-Sep-[ADDRESS_663567] been observed  following treatment with  nivolumab . l\t1ost cases  of 
diarrhea  were  of low grade (Grade 1 -2). Colitis occurred  less frequently  than diarrhea . High -grade 
cases of diarrhea  and colitis were managed with corticosteroids  and, in all cases,  the events 
resolved.  
 
The recommended management of  GI AEs is provided in  Appendix  3. Early  recognition  and 
treatment of  diarrhea and colitis are  critical to  their management. Subjects should be  advised to 
seek  medical  evaluation  if they develop new -onset diarrhea,  blood in stool,  or severe abdominal 
pain or  if they have worsening of  baseline diarrhea. As GI symptoms  are common  in subjects with 
cancer,  it is important that  an evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between non -drug-related causes 
(eg, infection or  progression of  disease) and  a possible drug -related  AE as the management can 
be quite different. The principal treatment for high -grade GI AEs is  corticosteroids  (Appendix  3). 
Caution should  be taken in  the use of narcotics  in subjects  with diarrhea, colitis, or  abdominal 
pain as  pain medicines may mask  the signs of  colonic perforation . Consultation  with a BMS 
medical monitor should be sought for all  moderate - and high -grade cases of GI AEs.  
 
Diverticular  Perforation  
The prevalence  of diverticulosis  in the general population is  common  and increases with  age from 
10% under 40  years of age  to approximately  50% over 60  years of age.  Approximately  10% to 
25% of subjects with diverticulosis develop diverticulitis. Perforation occurs in  50% to 70% of 
instances of complicated diverticulitis. 27•28 Corticosteroids,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), and opi[INVESTIGATOR_512748].  [ADDRESS_663568] these conditions  concurrently with  their malignancy.  
Cases  of diverticular  perforation  while on  concomitant corticosteroids  (6 cases)  or NSAID (1  case) 
were observed in nivolumab program. While  there is insufficient evidence to  suggest that 
diverticulosis  or diverticulitis is a  predisposing factor for GI perforation following nivolumab 
administration,  clinical caution should be exercised, as appropr iate, for subjects on  concomitant 
medications of corticosteroids,  NSAID, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467].  In addition, be vigilant for signs  and 
symptoms of  potential  perforation,  especially in subjects with  known diverticular  disease.  
 
Hepatic  Adverse  Events  
Hepatic  AEs, including elevated liver function tests  (LFTs)  and, infrequently,  DILi, have been 
observed  following  treatment  with nivolumab . l\t1ost  cases  were  of low or moderate  grade . Higher­ 
grade hepatic AEs, including  DILi,  were managed with  corticosteroids  (with or without 
mycophenolate  mofetil) and, in almost all cases,  the events resolved.  
 
The recommended management of  hepatic  AEs is  provided  in Appendix  3. Early  recognition and 
treatment of  elevated  LFTs  and DILi are  critical  to their management. Subjects  should  be advised 
to seek  medical  evaluation  if they notice  jaundice (yellow appearance  of skin  or sclera) or  if they 
develop  bruising,  bleeding,  or right-sided  abdominal pain. Physicians  should monitor LFTs  prior to 
each nivolumab treatment. As LFT abnormalities  are common  in subjects with cancer,  it is 
important that an  evaluation/work -up distinguishes between non -drug-related causes (eg, 
infection, progression of  disease, concomitant medications, or  alcohol) and  a possible drug­ 
related AE as  the management can  be quite  different.  The principal treatment for high -grade 
hepatic AEs is corticosteroids  (Appendix  3). Consultation  with a BMS  medical monitor should be 
sought for all moderate - and high -grade hepatic AEs . 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 17 -180 A(10)  
Approval  date:  07-Sep-[ADDRESS_663569] been observed following treatment with  nivolumab (Section 5.5).  Most 
cases  were  of low or  moderate grade. The  events have typi[INVESTIGATOR_512749]  (eg, TSH) or  as part of a  work -up for 
associated symptoms (eg, fatigue) . Events may  occur  within weeks of  beginning  treatment, but 
also have  been noted to occur  after many months (while  still on treatment) . More  than 1 
endocrine  organ may  be involved  (eg, hypophysitis [pi[INVESTIGATOR_397704]] may  need to  be 
evaluated  at the time  adrenal insufficiency or thyroid  disorder is  suspected) . Moderate - to high­ 
grade cases were  managed with  hormone replacement therapy  and, in some  cases,  with the 
addition of corticosteroids.  In some  cases,  nivolumab treatment was  held until adequate  hormone 
replacement was provided.  
Guidelines  on the  recommended management of  endocrinopathies are  provided  in Appendix  3. 
Early recognition and treatment of  endocrinopathies are critical to  its management. Subjects 
should  be advised to  seek  medical  evaluation  if they notice  new-onset fatigue, lightheadedness, 
or difficulty  with vision or if baseline fatigue  worsens.  /ls fatigue  is common  in subjects with 
cancer,  it is important  that an evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between  non-drug-related causes 
(eg, progression of  disease, anemia, concomitant medications, or  depression) and a  possible 
drug-related AE as  the management can  be quite different. The  principal management of 
endocrinopathies is hormone replacement therapy . For subjects with moderate - or high -grade 
events, corticosteroids  may also be  used ( Appendix  3). Consultation with a BMS medical  
monitor  should  be sought  for all moderate - and high-grade cases  of endocrinopathies.  
 
Skin Adverse  Events  
Rash  and pruritus  were  the most  common  skin AEs observed  following  treatment  with 
nivolumab.  The rash was typi[INVESTIGATOR_512750]  a maculopapular  appearance  occurring  on the trunk, 
back, or extremities. Most cases have been of low or moderate grade . In some  cases,  rash and 
pruritus resolved without intervention . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_512751]. Anti -histamines have been used  for some  cases of  pruritus . More severe cases responded 
to systemic corticosteroids.  
 
Subjects should be advised to  seek  medical evaluation  if they notice new -onset rash. Early 
consultation with a  dermatology  special ist and a  biopsy should be  considered if there is 
uncertainty  as to the  cause  of the rash, or if  there is any  unusual appearance or clinical feature 
associated  with it. Other  drugs  that may  cause  rash should  be considered in  the differential  and, if 
possible, discontinued.  Three cases of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_512752]+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_512753]/sulfamethoxazole, alternate 
dosing with  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_512754], or  nivolumab monotherapy.  These  cases  highlight the 
possible importance of  discontinuing  suspected  drugs  in the  management of  rash. In addition, 
careful  evaluation  of potential  benefit -risk is  necessary  when considering the  use of nivolumab  or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a  patient who  has previously experienced  a severe or  life-threatening  skin adverse 
reaction on a prior immune -stimulating therapy.  
 
The principal treatment for skin AEs, such  as rash and  pruritus, consists of symptomatic 
management.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_512755] - to moderate -grade focal rash. 
Systemic  corticosteroids  should be  used  for diffuse  and high-grade  rash.  Consultation  with a BMS 
medical monitor should be sought for a ll moderate - and high -grade cases of skin AEs.  
Renal  Adverse  Events  
Elevated creatinine and  biopsy -confirmed  tubulointerstitial nephritis  and allergic nephritis have 
been infrequently  observed  following treatment with  nivolumab.  The frequency  of renal  AEs may 
be greater  with nivolumab  combination  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_512756].  Most  cases

were Grade 2 or 3  and based on creatinine  elevation . subjects with a  history of  RCC  or prior 
nephrectomy did not  appear  to be at  higher risk.  Events were  managed with  corticosteroids  and, 
in all cases, renal function partially  or fully improved.  
The recommended management of  renal AEs is provided in Appendix  3. Physicians should 
monitor  creatinine regularly . As creatinine abnormalit ies are common  in subjects  with cancer and 
other comorbidities,  it is important that an  evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between non -drug­ 
related causes  (eg, dehydration,  concomitant medications, hypotension,  or progression of 
disease)  and a possible  drug-related  AE as  the management can  be quite different.  The principal 
treatment  for renal AEs is  corticosteroids  (Appendix 3). Consultation with  a BMS  medical  monitor 
should be sought for all moderate - and high-grade  cases of  renal AEs.  
Neurologic  Adverse  Events  
Neurologic  AEs have been uncommonly  observed following treatment with  nivolumab.  The 
frequency of  neurologic  AEs may  be greater with nivolumab +  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_512757].  Neurologic  AEs can manifest 
as central  abnormalities  (eg, aseptic meningitis, encephalopathy, or encephalitis)  or peripheral 
sensory/motor neuropathies  (eg, Guillain -Barre Syndrome, myasthenia gravis complicated with 
sepsis and fatality).  
 
The recommended management of  neurologic  AEs is provided in Appendix  3. Early recognition 
and treatment of  neurologic  AEs is  critical to  its management. Subjects  should be  advised to  seek 
medical evaluation  if they notice impairment in  motor function (eg, weakness), changes in 
sensation (eg, numbness), or symptoms suggestive  of possible central nervous system 
abnormalities such  as new headache or mental status changes. As neurologic  symptoms can  be 
common  in subjects with  cancer,  it is important that an  evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between 
non-drug-related  causes  (eg, progression  of disease,  concomitant  medications, or infection) and  a 
possible drug -related AE as  the management can  be quite different. The  principal treatments for 
neurologic  toxicity are  dose  delay, corticosteroids,  and IV immunoglobulin  as outlined in  the safety 
algorithm (Appendix  3). For high-grade related neurological  AEs,  nivolumab  should be 
discontinued.  Consultation with a BMS medical monitor should be sought for  all moderate - and 
high-grade cases of neurologic  AEs. 
 
Lipase/Amylase  Elevations  
Asymptomatic elevations  in lipase  and amylase have been reported. In monotherapy studies, 
lipase  and amylase  levels were  not systematically  monitored, so an  estimate of  the frequency of 
asymptomatic lipase/amylase  elevations  is unknown. In studies  evaluating  the safety of  the 
nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_512758], lipase  and amylase levels were 
systematically  monitored,  and elevations  in any grade  of lipase/amylase  were  consistently  noted 
in approximately  10% to 30% of subjects.  Very  few subjects  reported  associated  symptoms  (eg, 
abdominal pain)  or radiographic findings  (eg, stranding) consistent  with pancreatitis.  Thus, there 
does not seem  to be  clinical significance to  the elevated laboratory  values . 
 
As lipase/amylase  abnormalities  are not uncommon  in subjects  with cancer,  it is important that  an 
evaluation/work -up distinguishes between non -drug-related causes (eg, progression of  disease, 
concomitant medications, or alcohol) and a  possible drug -related cause  as the management can 
be quite different. The recommended management  of nivolumab -related elevated  lipase/amylase 
values centers around close  observation. Physicians should ensure that subjects  have no 
associated  symptoms  consistent  with pancreatitis,  such  as abdominal  pain.  Corticosteroids  do not 
seem  to alter the  natural history of  lipase/amylase  elevations . Laboratory  values tend to  fluctuate 
on a day -to-day basis  and eventually  return  to baseline or low grade over  the course of  weeks, 
whether or not subjects receive corticosteroids.  Asymptomatic elevations  should be  monitored  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

approximately  on a biweekly basis, and  nivolumab  should be  held per protocol instructions.  For 
sustained asymptomatic Grade  4 elevations,  nivolumab should  be discontinued  per protocol 
instructions. For subjects with elevated lipase/amylase  and symptoms consistent with  possible 
pancreatitis,  nivolumab should  be discontinued, and  consultation with  a gastroenterologist  should 
be considered . Consultation  with a BMS medical monitor should be sought for all high -grade 
cases of elevated lipase/amylase . 
 
Uveitis  and Visual  Com aints  
Immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_512759] . Inflammation  of 
components within the  eye (eg,  uveitis)  is an uncommon,  but clinically important, event. Uveitis 
may occur  more  frequently  with nivolumab +  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_512760]. An ophthalmologist should 
evaluate  visual  complaints with examination of  the conjunctiva, anterior and  posterior  chambers, 
and retina. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_512761] -grade events.  Low-grade events 
that do  not resolve and high -grade  events should be managed with systemic corticosteroids.  
Consultation with  a BMS medical monitor should be  sought for a ll cases  of ocular inflammatory 
events.  Complaints of  double vision should  also prompt  medical  evaluation.  In addition to  ocular 
inflammatory events, a work -up should also consider pi[INVESTIGATOR_512762] a cause . 
 
Infusion  Reactions  
Infusion reactions, including high -grade hypersensitivity reactions,  following  administration  of 
nivolumab are  uncommon.  Investigators  are advised  to monitor  for fever,  chills,  shakes,  itching, 
rash,  hypertension or hypotension, or  difficulty in  breathing during and immediately after 
administration of nivolumab.  
Dose  Modifications : dose  reductions or  dose  escalations are  not permitted. 
Dose Delay Criteria  
Because  of the potential  for clinically  meaningful  nivolumab -related  AEs requiring early  
recognition and  prompt  intervention,  management  algorithms have  been  developed  for suspected 
AEs of  selected categories. [see  current  Investigator  Brochure and Appendix  for citation 
examples) . 
 
Dose  delay criteria apply for  all drug-related  adverse events  (regardless  of whether  or not the 
event  is attributed  to nivolumab).  All study  drugs  must  be delayed until  treatment  can resume.  
 
Dose  delay  criteria apply for  all drug-related AEs . Nivolumab must  be delayed until  treatment can 
resume . 
 
Nivolumab  administration  should  be delayed  for the following:  
Any Grade  2 non-skin,  drug -related  AE, with the following  exceptions:  
• Grade  2 drug-related  fatigue  or laboratory  abnormalities  do not require  a treatment  delay  
• Any Grade  [ADDRESS_663570], ALT, total bilirubin,  or asymptomatic amylase  or lipase:  
• Grade  3 lymphopenia  or leukopenia  does  not require  dose  delay.  
• If a subject  enrolled  with a baseline AST,  ALT, or total  bilirubin  that was within  normal  limits,  and 
develops  new Grade [ADDRESS_663571],  ALT, or bilirubin  toxicity delay  dosing until less  than or equal to 
grade 1 .

• If a subject  enrolled  with a baseline AST,  ALT, or total  bilirubin  greater than  normal  but less  than 
or equal to  Grade [ADDRESS_663572], ALT, or bilirubin  toxicity, 
delay dosing until less than equal to grade 1.  
• Any Grade  3 drug-related  amylase  or lipase  abnormality  that is not associated  with symptoms 
or clinical manifestations  of pancreatitis  does  not require  dose delay.  The Investigator  should  be 
consulted  for such  Grade  3 amylase  or lipase  abnormalities . 
Any AE, laboratory  abnormality,  or intercurrent  illness  which,  in the judgment of  the investigator 
warrants delaying  the dose  of study medication.  
 
Subjects  who require delay of nivolumab should  be re-evaluated  weekly or  more  frequently  if 
clinically indicated and  resume  nivolumab dosing when re -treatment criteria are met.  
Criteria  to Resume  Treatment  
Subjects  may resume  treatment  with study drug  when  the drug-related  AE(s)  resolve  to Grade  :51 
or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
• Subjects  may resume  treatment  in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue  
• Subjects who  have  not experienced  a Grade 3  drug-related skin AE  may resume  treatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.  
11.1.3  Overdose,  Warnings,  and Precautions  
There is no  available  information concerning overdose with nivolumab.  Depending on  the 
symptoms  and/or  signs  leading to  the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_318520], supportive medical  management 
should be provided.  There is  no specific antidote.  
 
Overdose  
 
An overdose is defined as the  accidental or intentional  administration  of any dose  of a product 
that is considered both excessive  and medically  important. All occurrences of  overdose  must  be 
reported  as an SAE.  
Other  Safety  Considerations  
Any significant worsening  noted  during interim or  final physical  examinations, electrocardiograms, 
x rays,  and any other potential  safety  assessments, whether  or not these  procedures are  required 
by [CONTACT_93865], should also  be recorded as a  nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate,  and 
reported accordingly.  
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
Antitumor  Effect  
Response  and progression will be  evaluated  in this  study using  the new international  criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_512779] (RECIST)  guideline 
(version 1.1) [22] . Changes in the  largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of  the tumor 
lesions  and the shortest  diameter in  the case  of malignant lymph nodes are  used  in the RECIST 
criteria.

according to  the definitions  stated  below . (Note: Patients who  exhibit  objective disease 
progression prior to  the end of cycle  1 will also be  considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable  Non-Target  Disease  Response . Patients who  have lesions  present  at baseline that are 
evaluable  but do not  meet  the definitions  of measurable disease,  have received  at least  one dose 
of therapy, and have had  their disease reevaluated will be  considered evaluable  for non -target

progression of the lesions.

Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites  of disease),  including  small  lesions (longest 
diameter <10  mm or pathological  lymph nodes with;:::  10 to <15 mm  short axis), are  considered 
non-measurable  disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal  disease, ascites,  pleural/pericardia! 
effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  and abdominal masses  (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]),  are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note : Cystic  lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  
not be considered  as malignant lesions (neither measurable  nor non -measurable)  since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108],  simple cysts.  
 
'Cystic lesions' thought  to represent cystic metastases can  be considered as  measurable 
lesions,  if they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above. However,  if non-cystic 
lesions are  present in the  same  patient, these  are preferred for selection as target  lesions.

Target lesions. All  measurable  lesions up to  a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5  lesions in 
total, representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified as  target lesions  and recorded and 
measured  at baseline. Target  lesions  should be  selected on  the basis  of their size  (lesions  with 
the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs, but in  addition  should be those 
that lend themselves to  reproducible  repeated measurements . It may be the case  that, on 
occasion,  the largest lesion does not lend itself to  reproducible  measurement in  which 
circumstance the  next largest lesion which can be  measured  reproducibly  should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short  axis for nodal lesions)  for all  target 
lesions will  be calculated and  reported as the baseline su m diameters . If lymph nodes are  to be 
included  in the sum,  then only the short  axis is added  into the sum . The baseline sum diameters 
will be used  as reference to  further  characterize any  objective  tumor  regression  in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target  lesions . All other  lesions (or sites  of disease) including any measurable  lesions over 
and above the 5  target lesions should be  identified  as non -target  lesions and  should also  be 
recorded at  baseline . Measurements  of these lesions  are not required,  but the  presence, 
absence, or  in rare cases  unequivocal  progression of  each  should be  noted throughout  follow -up. 
12.3 Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  Disease  
All measurements should be  taken and recorded in  metric  notation  using a  ruler or calipers . All 
baseline evaluations  should be performed as  closely as possible  to the beginning of treatment 
and never more than 4 weeks  before the beginning of the  treatment.  The same  method of 
assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used  to characterize  each  identified  and reported 
lesion  at baseline  and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation  is preferred to evaluation by 
[CONTACT_512780](s) being followed cannot be  imaged but are  assessable  by 
[CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical  lesions : Clinical  lesions  will only  be considered  measurable  when  they are 
superficial (e.g ., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and  10 mm diameter  as assessed 
using calipers  (e.g., skin  nodules). In the case  of skin  lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977],  including  a ruler to estimate  the size  of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest  x-ray: Lesions on  chest  x-ray are  acceptable  as measurable lesions  when they  are 
clearly defined  and surrounded by  [CONTACT_6776]. However,  CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional  CT and MRI: This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions on  CT scan  
based  on the assumption  that CT  slice thickness is [ADDRESS_663580] slice  thickness 
greater  than 5 mm, the minimum size  for a measurable  lesion should be twice  the slice  thickness . 
MRI is also acceptable in  certain situations (e.g. for body scans),  but NOT  lung.  
CA125 : CA125 alone cannot  be used  to assess  response . If CA125 is  initially  above the  upper 
normal limit, it must  normalize  for a patient to be  considered in complete  clinical response . 
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
Com  ete Response  (CR) : Disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non -target)  must  have reduction in  short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response  (PR) : At least  a 30% decrease  in the  sum of the diameters of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Progressive Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the  sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest  sum on study (this  includes  the baseline  sum if that is the 
smallest  on study) . In addition  to the  relative increase of  20%, the  sum must  also demonstrate an 
absolute increase  of at least 5  mm. (Note: the appearance  of one or more  new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease  (SD) : Neither  sufficient shrinkage to  qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD,  taking as reference the smallest sum  diameters while on study.  
Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
Com  ete Response (CR) : Disappearance of  all non -target  lesions and  normalization  of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must  be non-pathological in  size (<10 mm  short axis). Note:  If 
CA125 is  initially  above the  upper normal  limit,  it must  normalize  for a patient  to be considered in 
complete clinical response . 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or  more  non-target lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance of  CA125 
level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease  (PD) : Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or unequivocal 
progression of  existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal  progression  should not  normally trump 
target lesion  status . It must  be representative  of overall  disease  status  change,  not a single lesion 
increase.  
 
Although  a clear  progression  of "non -target"  lesions  only is exceptional,  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_512763],  and the progression  status should  be confirmed 
at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of  Best  Overall  Response  
The best overall response is the best response  recorded from the  start of  the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence  (taking as reference  for progressive disease  the smallest 
measurements recorded  since  the treatment started).  The patient's  best response assignment  will 
depend on  the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria .

Duration  of Response  
Duration  of overall response : The  duration of  overall  response  is measured  from the  time 
measurement criteria are met for CR  or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  date that 
recurrent or progressive disease  is objectively  documented (taking as  reference for  progressive 
disease  the smallest  measurements recorded  since  the treatment started) . The duration of overall 
CR is measured  from the time measurement criteria are first met  for CR until the first date that 
progressive disease is objectively  documented.  
 
Duration  of stable disease : Stable disease  is measured from the  start of the  treatment  until the 
criteria  for progression are  met, taking as reference the  smallest  measurements  recorded  since 
the treatment  started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
Progression -Free  Survival  
Progression -Free  Survival  (PFS)  is defined as the  duration of  time from start  of treatment to  time 
of recurrence, progression (as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Survival  
Survival is  defined as the  duration of time  from start  of treatment to  time of death or  the date  of

as delayed responses.  
 
lv1odification of RECIST  as described  may discourage  the early  discontinuation  of Nivolumab  and 
provide a  more  complete  evaluation  of its anti-tumor activity than  would be  seen  with conventional

The null hypothesis  relating to  uninteresting levels  of activity was  chosen in  accordance with 
previously published reports of  cytotoxic and biologic and  anti-vascular agent activity in 
endometrial cancers.  Further details are outlined in  Aghajanian,  et al. Phase  II trial of 
bevacizumab in  recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer:  A Gynecologic  Oncology Group 
Study.  J Clin Oncol  29: 2259 -2265,  2011.  In that study, bevacizumab  was considered to  be an

patients (40.4%) surviving progression free for at least 6  months.  
 
Evaluation  of overall response  rate (ORR)  
ORR  (defined as  complete response  (CR)+  partial response (PR))  will be the primary  endpoint.  A

• The rate of ORR  and duration  of overall  objective  response  (ORR=  CR+  PR). 
• The frequency  and severity  of observed  adverse  effects.  
• Progression -free survival  rate at 24 weeks  for all patients  evaluable  for this endpoint.  
 
Evaluable  for efficacy (response  and PFS):  those  who have measurable  disease  at baseline and 
have received at least one  dose of therapy and had  at least one  post-baseline efficacy 
assessment.  Patients who  are evaluable  for response  and are lost to follow up  or die before the 
24 week PFS assessment will  be considered as  events  (failures). The primary analysis for 
efficacy  will include only patients who  are evaluable for response . A sensitivity analysis will 
include all patients who  have measurable disease  at baseline and have received at least one 
dose of  therapy, but do  not hav e a post baseline assessment of  response, considering them as 
non responders for ORR and events for PFS.  
For safety  patients  who received  at least one  dose  of therapy  will be included . 
 
Definitions  of Statistics  to be Reported  
• Disease  Control Rate  (OCR),  defined as the percentage of patients  with complete response 
(CR)+ partial  response  (PR)+ stable disease  (SD)  12 weeks from the start of treatment will  
be reported and the  90% confidence interval will  be estimated  using  exact  binomial 
proportions.  This will be  done following RECIST criteria.  
• Progression free survival  (PFS),  defined as the  duration of time  from start of treatment to 
time of recurrence,  progression, or  death due to  any cause,  whichever occurs  first. Patients  
will be censored  at last  follow up date . The Kaplan  Meier  estimate  of median  PFS will  be 
reported as well as  the PFS  rate at 24 weeks  
• Overall survival  (OS),  defined  as the duration of  time from start of treatment until the date of 
death due  to any  cause. Patients will  be censored  at last follow  up date. The Kaplan Meier  
estimate  of median  OS will be reported.  
• Duration of  response  (DOR),  defined as the  time from which  measurement criteria are  met 
for CR  or PR  (whichever status is recorded first using RECIST} until the  first date of  
documented  disease  progression, will be  estimated  using  the Kaplan Meier  method.  Patients 
without documented progression will be  censored  at last follow up.  
• Adverse events  by [CONTACT_512783]  4 (CTCAE  v4.03) will  be tabulated in  order  to assess  the safety  profile and tolerability  
therapy  in treated  patients.  
 
Safety  Analysis  
 
The rates  of irAE,  SAE,  therapy  completion  rate, and protocol  completion  will be reported.  
 
Safety will  be measured  by [CONTACT_512784] 3 or 4  treatment -related clinically significant 
toxicities (NCI Common  Terminology Criteria  for Adverse  Events version 4.0),  aside  from Grade 3 
or 4 hematologic  or laboratory abnormalities,  unless they are  deemed unexpected or clinically 
significant.  
Frequencies  of toxicities  will be  tabulated.  The grade 3  or 4 treatment -related non­ 
hematologic/non -laboratory toxicity will  be estimated  at the  end of  the trial  along with  the 95% 
confidence interval.  With 40 patients,  these rates can  be estimated  within ±16%.  
 
AEs will  be collected from  the time  of study  enrollment  until [ADDRESS_663591]  dose  of study  drug 
delivered.

Exploratory  Objectives:  
Objective 1: Correlate mutational burden with  clinical  benefit from  nivolumab, both overall 
response  rate (ORR)  and progression -free survival (PFS)  rate at [ADDRESS_663592]  (continuous number). Two separate analyses will be  done for each  efficacy 
outcome:  ORR or  PFS at [ADDRESS_663593] differences  in 
the distribution  of somatic mutations in  the 2 groups (responders vs  non responders)  such 
as Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
Objective 2:  Correlate the somatic mutational burden identified  by [CONTACT_245412] -IMPACT  with the 
MSlsensor  algorithm  score.  The MSK -IMPACT  data will  also be analyzed by  [CONTACT_512785].  We will  assess  the relationship  between MSlsensor  score  and the 
number of  somatic mutations . MSlsensor  score  is a binary variable; any score  <[ADDRESS_663594]  whether  the median mutational 
burden (continuous variable) is different among  patients with  MSlsensor  score<  10 (MSI 
stable)  or MSlsensor  score  10 or  higher (MSI high). Wilcoxon  rank sum  test will be  used  to 
test differences  in 2 groups.  
Objective 3: Correlate the  MSlsensor  score  with the MMR  IHC status (immunohistochemical 
staining for mismatch  repair  enzyme proteins). We  will test  for agreement  between the 
MSlsensor  score  (binary)  with MMR  status by  [CONTACT_512786]  (binary). The  goal of  the above aims  is to explore the agreement between "MMR 
IHC absent",  and "MSlsensor  score  high" and  "mutational burden high" . McNemar's test 
will be used to  test agreement between  MSI sensor and  MMR  status.  
Objective 4: Test  for association between pre -treatment  immune  phenotype (tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes  and PD -L1) and best overall response rate (ORR)  and progression free 
survival  rate at 24  weeks . Tlls and  PD-L1 are both biomarkers  without  a specific cutoff 
that defines positive  and negative . For these reasons  these will be  analyzed  as 
continuous variables.  Two separate analysis will  be done for  each  efficacy  outcome: ORR 
or PFS at [ADDRESS_663595] differences  in 2 groups.

N/A 
16.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
A research study assistant (RSA) will be assigned to  study. The responsibilities of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  extraction and  data entry,  data reporting,  coordination 
of the activities of the protocol study team and, and  of the  flow of regulatory paperwork . 
The data collected for the study will  be entered into  a secure database (CRDB) . All routine blood 
test results required per the protocol will  be captured in CRDB  in addition to  baseline medical 
conditions  and disease  information,  response  assessments,  off-study documentation,  and toxicity 
grade  and attribution.  Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient 
record.  
MSK will  hold the IND.  MSK will  be responsible for  all safety  monitoring. All  SAEs will  be reported 
to the MSKCC IRB. The safety of the study will  be monitored by [CONTACT_512788].  
Weekly  registration  reports will  be generated  by [CONTACT_512789]. Routine data quality  reports  will be 
generated  to assess missing data and inconsistencies.  
Accrual  rates  and extent and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow  up will be monitored  periodically 
throughout  the study.  Recurrent  lapses in  data collection, deviations  or violations  will be 
discussed  with the study  team and  a corrective  plan will be  generated.  Accrual goals and factors 
impacting accrual  goals will be discussed  at the weekly New Patient/Protocol  meetings.  
If accrual  proceeds  more  quickly  than anticipated,  it may be slowed  or staggered  at the  discretion 
of the Principal  Investigator,  to account  for safety  concerns  or data management  resources.  
16.1 Quality  Assurance  
The data and safety  monitoring  plan at  Memorial Sloan Kettering  Cancer  Center  was approved by 
[CONTACT_28642]  2001. The  plan addressed  the new policies  set forth 
by [CONTACT_512790] "Policy of  the National Cancer Institute for data and safety 
monitoring  of clinical trials" which can be found at 
http://grants .nih.gov/grants/guide/noticefiles/not98 -084.html.  The DSM  plans at MSKCC were 
established and are  monitored by [CONTACT_28644].  The MSKCC data and  safety 
monitoring  plan can  be found on the  MSKCC Internet  at 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC  Data and Safety Monitoring  Plans.pdf . There are 
several different mechanisms by  [CONTACT_512791], safety and quality.

safety monitoring.  These are  joint sub -committees with  dual-reporting respon sibilities. The Data 
and Safety rvlonitoring  Committee  (DSMC) is  the sub-committee responsible  for monitoring all 
Phase  1, 2, 1/2, pi[INVESTIGATOR_512766]-phase clinical  trials.  The Data and  Safety rvlonitoring  Board (DSMB) 
is the sub -committee responsible for monitoring Phase 3 randomized clinical trials.  
The DSMC  convenes once  per quarter and monitors  the risk  participants are  exposed to,  the 
progress of  the study, the adequacy of the  data storage and whether  sufficient data  are being 
entered into the  CRDB.  The DSMC monitors phase 1,  2, 1/2, pi[INVESTIGATOR_512767] -phase trials that are 
not being monitored by  [CONTACT_512792],  and which  meet  the NCI definition of a  Clinical  Trial. 
This trial will qualify for monitoring by [CONTACT_512793].  
During the  protocol development  and review process,  each  protocol will  be assessed  for its level 
of risk and degree of  monitoring required,  and the monitoring procedures  will be established  at the

17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY  of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154073]  
• A persistent or  significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the  ability  to conduct normal  life 
functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important 1 \/ledical  Events (IME)  that may not result  in death, be  life threatening,  or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512768], based upon medical  judgment,  they may 
jeopardize  the patient or subject  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment is  not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is  required as  soon  as the participant signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is required for  30- 
days after the  participant's last  investigational treatment or intervention.  Any events that occur  after 
the 30-day period and that are at  least possibly related to  protoc ol treatment must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 'Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events', the SAE report  must  be sent to  the IRB within 5  calendar days of the  event. The  IRB 
requires a  Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted electronically to the SAE 
Office as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports that  include a  Grade 5  SAE should be  sent to  [EMAIL_440] . 
All other reports should be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other  trials: Reports  that include  a Grade 5  SAE should be sent  to  saegrade5@mskcc .org. 
All other reports should be sent to [EMAIL_203] . 
The report  should  contain  the following information:

The CRDB  SAE report should  be completed  as per  above instructions.  If appropriate, the report will 
be forwarded to  the FDA  by [CONTACT_512797].  
Serious Adverse Event  Collection and  Reporting  -All Serious Adverse Events must  be reported to  
BMS  Worldwide Safety.  
Site specific  forms  will be requested  for review.  
The sponsor/investigator will be required to  reconcile SAEs reported in  the clinical database with 
SAE cases  transmitted to  BMS Global Pharmacovigilance  (GPV&E);   worldwide.safety@bms.c om. 
BMS requests  this is initiated by [CONTACT_512798].  The process will  be further defined. During reconciliation, any events 
found to  not be  reported  previously  to BMS must  be sent to  [EMAIL_176] . 
For studies conducted  under an  Investigator  IND in the US,  any event that is both serious  and 
unexpected must  be reported to  the Food  and Drug  Administration (FDA)  as soon  as possible  and 
no later than 7  days (for  a death or  life-threatening event) or  15 days (for all other SAEs) after the 
investigator's or institution's  initial receipt of the information . BMS will  be provided  with a 
simultaneous  copy of  all adverse events filed with the FDA.

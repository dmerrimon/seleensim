AIMS:
1.      To evaluate the efficiency of vaginal estriol, as a treatment for urogenital symptoms in female 
          patients with RRMS.
2.      To evaluate the potential role of vaginal estriol in re-myelination in RRMS patients.
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_824722] 1 mg transvaginal estriol, as an 
adjunctive therapy for female MS patients. Our goal is to recruit 20 patients from our MS clinic in the 
neurology department of [LOCATION_007] Tech University Health Sciences Center. This study has been planned in 
collaboration with reproductive endocrinology, endocrinology, gynecology and basic science. The 1mg 
transvaginal dose was chosen after careful search of the literature and consultation with our collaborators.
OBJECTIVES:
Aim 1: Define if transvaginal estriol improves urogenital symptoms (urgency, frequency, intermittent   
incontinence), in female patients with Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS). Bladder control scale, 
will be given at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months after starting transvaginal estriol. Quality of life 
questionnaire will be given at baseline and at 9 months after starting vaginal estriol.
Aim 2: Assess for evidence of re-myelination associated to the use of transvaginal estriol in woman with 
MS. Objective measurements for re-myelination will be quantified with brain MRI 3T, Optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) and Visual evoked potentials (VEP). 
INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND / SIGNIFICANCE:
More than 2.3 million persons suffer from MS worldwide.   Demyelination and axonal loss are the main 
pathological process in MS. Unfortunately remyelination occurs an incomplete fashion (Mallik, Samson, 
Wheeler-Kingshott, & Miller, 2014).  Experimental models of MS have shown that preservation of 
myelin and remyelination of axons can increase neuronal survival.  Until now, treatment for MS may 
decrease the relapse rate and progression, without any significant effect on remyelination.
Urinary issues in MS
Urinary dysfunction includes frequency, incontinence, frequent infections, occurs in about 80-90% of MS 
patients. It causes a major disruption in daily life, imposing economic burdens for patients and their 
families.  Direct costs and indirect costs as psychological distress, loss of productivity are a significant 
burden for the patient, and increase the risk of unemployment.(Moore, 2001)  Besides interfering with 
quality of life, urinary dysfunctions leads commonly to urinary tract infections which can have a direct 
impact on MS, worsening neurologic symptoms, and increasing in the number of relapses, which may 
lead to disability.

Estriol for urogenital health
Urinary dysfunction is frequently treated with antimuscarinic agents; side effects from these drugs (dry 
mouth, blurred vision, constipation and difficulty with micturition) make compliance an issue (David 
et.al). Transvaginal estriol decreases urinary symptoms and prevents urinary tract infections.(Rahn et al., 
2014) There is less risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer with estriol treatment 
compared with estradiol treatment (Cody, Jacobs, Richardson, Moehrer, & Hextall, 2012).  Furthermore, 
vaginal delivery offers regional benefits to the lower urogenital tract, it is well absorbed and it is not 
associated with entero-hepatic recirculation as oral estriol, as some of the adverse effects of oral estrogens 
are to produce an increase in thromboembolic events. (Rahn et al., 2014)
Estriol in MS, role in remyelination
Estriol is one of the three main estrogens, produced by [CONTACT_824726]. Levels increase significantly in the 
third trimester of pregnancy.  It has been postulated as a possible neuromodulator and neuroprotective 
therapy in multiple sclerosis. (Tiwari-Woodruff & Voskuhl, 2009). Estriol has been studied in animal 
models and has been demonstrated to have distinctly different modulatory actions on the immune system 
than estradiol. Moreover, in 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) induced contact [CONTACT_8748], estriol 
(Cody, Jacobs, Richardson, Moehrer, & Hextall, 2012)had the strongest suppressive effect when 
compared to estrone and estradiol (Cody et al., 2012). It has been reported that MS patients have a 
decreased annualized relapse rate during pregnancy, with a statistically significant decrease in the third 
trimester.  Additionally, in the 3 months postpartum, the rate of relapse increases significantly. (Avila-
Ornelas, Avila, Stosic, & Robles, 2011)This effect may be mediated at least in part by [CONTACT_824727], which rises 
during the third trimester of pregnancy and then falls precipi[INVESTIGATOR_824723]. Furthermore, Estriol has 
been shown to have a positive effect reducing active brain lesions in multiple sclerosis. Estriol may have a 
role in remyelination.(Harlow, Honce, & Miravalle, 2015) Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of 
the CNS.  The process of re- myelination represents a major form of plasticity in the brain, unfortunately 
this process is not complete, leading to partial remyelination in patients with MS.  (Mallik et al., 2014) 
Previous studies have shown that pregnancy leads to an increase in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) 
proliferation, oligodendrocyte generation and the number of myelinated axons in the maternal 
CNS.  (Tiwari-Woodruff & Voskuhl, 2009) . If estriol favors remyelination, this could revolutionize 
current treatment options for MS patients.
                                                                                                     
Benefit of vaginal estriol
Oral estriol has been shown to produce a significant decrease in the relapse rate in MS patients(Voskuhl 
et al., 2016) . One of the reasons why vaginal estriol has a better absorption is that oral estriol is 
associated with entero-hepatic recirculation, which prolongs exposure due to recycling. Furthermore, 
vaginal estrogen delivery has a regional benefit to the lower urogenital tract, and is well absorbed at a 
dose of 0.5 mg to 1 mg. In a systematic review of randomized trials comparing vaginal estrogens, it was 
concluded that the 1mg vaginal estriol, was superior to lower doses for the treatment of urogenital 
symptoms.  (Rahn et al., 2014) In animal models, estriol demonstrated to have distinctly different 
modulatory actions on the immune system than other form of estrogens, such as estradiol. Vaginal estriol 
does not increased the risk for heart disease, stroke, or cancer. (Rahn et al., 2014) In summary, patients 
with RRMS may significantly benefit from estriol as an adjunctive therapy to MS, improving quality of 
life and restoring myelin 
HYPOTHESIS:
Transvaginal estriol offers a safe adjunctive therapy for female MS patients, it improves urogenital 
symptoms as well as promotes remyelination.

Materials, instruments or measurements:
Urogenital measurements:
-         Bladder control scale (BLCS) questionnaire (validated and used for evaluation of MS 
bladder symptoms. {Turnbull et al, 1992}). Raw scores on the 4 items are summed to create a 
Bladder Control Scale (BLCS) total score. Scores can range from 0-22, with higher scores 
indicating greater bladder control problems. See attached document.

IRB NUMBER: L19-020
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/13/2019
Protocol version: 11.11.[ZIP_CODE]
Quality of life:
-         Quality of life questionnaire (Multple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 {MSQOL-54}. Validated and 
widely used for MS patients. (Vickrey et al, 1995) (Vickrey et al, 1997). The questionnaire includes 54 
questions that provide scores on physical and mental health status. Both scores can range 0-100. See 
attached document.
Blood work:  
Levels of estriol, FSH, LH will be performed in [LOCATION_007] Tech Health Science Laboratory ([CONTACT_824735]’s 
certified lab). The assay used will be the Beckman Coulter Access 2 immunoassay system analyzer. This 
will be run by [CONTACT_824732]/GYN hormone laboratory under the supervision of [CONTACT_824735] and [CONTACT_824736].
Re-myelinating measurements:
·         Visual evoked potential (VEP) (measurement of the electrical signal recorded at the scalp over the 
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_824724]) VEP/Prolongation of the P100 latency, is an indirect tool for 
remyelination in MS. (The test is non-invasive, patients will be looking at a checkboard pattern while the 
technician is measuring the time it takes to register the image to the brain cortex. This is achieved with 
scalp electrode in the posterior region.)
·         3Tesla brain MRI (performed as standard of care with no extra cost) will be evaluated for possible 
changes in white matter lesions, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). This will be read by [CONTACT_824733].
·         Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (noninvasive scan of the retinal layer which provides 
morphology imagery of the ganglion cell layer which is frequently affected in MS) (Noninvasive test, 
duration of about 5 to 10 min to perform, patient has to stay still and focus on a small light while we take 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_824725].)
Data Sheet: A spreadsheet is attached. We will be gathering demographic data, MRI information, EDSS 
score,  and electrophysiologic information, for details please see the spreadsheet attached. 
Outcome variables:
1- Urogenital symptoms such as frequency, incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections, and BLCS 
questionnaire scores.
2- Remyelination (measured by [CONTACT_467376] 3 DTI, other measurements include presence of T2 lesions, 
Flair lesions, DWI, T1 black hole, and DTI; Optical coherence tomography (OCT); and visual evoked 
potentials (VEP). 
3- Quality of life, assessed using MSQOL-54 questionnaire.
Analysis:
Patient characteristics will be summarized using frequency (percentage) for categorical variables, and 
mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) for numerical variables as appropriate. Changes in blood work 
variables during the course of the study will be assessed using one-way repeated-measures analysis of 
variance (ANOVA). Compliance assessments will be used as covariate to adjust the differences if 
necessary, using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA). Urinary symptoms, and quality of life data 
will be analyzed using mixed-effects linear or logistic regression models for continuous or binary 
outcomes respectively. These models will account for the effect of estriol over time, compliance with 
treatment, and relevant patient characteristics.
Justification for Sample size: 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We are planning to include 20 patients. Each patient will be their own control in a 
single-group repeated measures design. Assuming a significance level α = 0.05, and power 1-β = 0.80, a

detect statistically significant changes in the main outcome.
Risks
Studies suggest that when the lower-potency estrogen, estriol, is administered transvaginal, it does not 
increase the risk of hormone-dependent cancers of the breast or endometrium (uterine lining) Therefore 
the risk of breast and endometrial cancer is not increased with vaginal estriol.  (Voojis et.al) Another 
safety concern of estrogens is the risk of thromboembolism.  There is a paucity of prospective studies 
specifically looking at estriol and thromboembolism. Studies have shown that transdermal and 
transvaginal estrogen have a lower rate of thromboembolism. (Scarabin, Oger, & Plu-Bureau, 2003).  
Risks associated with venipuncture for blood draws include: discomfort, pain, bleeding, bruising, 
infection where the needle enters the skin; feeling lightheaded or fainting at the site of the needle or 
blood. No physical risk with VEP or OCT, these are noninvasive procedures.
Using the applicator or cream may cause vaginal discomfort or infection.  Patients will be asked during 
their visits about vaginal discomfort or vaginal infections. Patients will also be encouraged to call if they 
are experiencing these. If the patient does experience these symptoms they may be referred to their PCP 
or Gynecologist for appropriate management. 
Benefits:  
Patients may experience improvement of her urogenital symptoms as well as improvement in their MS 
symptoms. Patient may have improved sexual function.  Subjects could share satisfaction from potential 
benefits to other MS patients. May help revolutionize treatment of MS along with urogenital benefits at 
low cost
Confidentiality:
Patient’s information will be de-identified and identifier information will be kept in a safe place. 
Electronic files will be locked by [CONTACT_824734].
Study documents will be kept at least [ADDRESS_1143726] has been enrolled into the study. The succeeding monitoring visits 
will be scheduled periodically, but no less than every 2 months when there is an active study participant, 
at a mutually agreed timeframe by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_289174]. All data collected will be 100% source 
document verified. The study monitor may inspect and audit all study documents, i.e. data collection 
forms, questionnaires, drug accountability, and medical records within the applicable confidentiality 
regulations.

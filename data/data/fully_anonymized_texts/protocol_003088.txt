I. STUDY OVERVIEW   
Behavioral interventions for chronic pain among people living with HIV (PLWH) are an 
understudied area, with great potential to improve pain and function. Chronic pain is 
an important comorbidity that affects between 30% and 85% of PLWH and is 
associated w ith greater odds of functional impairment, increased emergency room 
utilization, suboptimal retention in HIV care, and failure to achieve virologic 
suppression. What is not known is how to optimally address chronic pain in this 
population. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_307533] a co mmonly used treatment for chronic pain, particularly in 
PLWH. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_468744]. In contrast, behavioral  interventions are among the most effective and 
safest treatments for chronic pain in the general population. Pain Self -Management 
(PSM) is a Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) -based behavioral approach that involves 
pain-related skill acquisition and goal sett ing. PSM interventions have been promoted 
by [CONTACT_941] 2016 Department of Health and Human Services National Pain Strategy (DHHS 
NPS) as an effective, scalable approach to chronic pain management. Especially 
given the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562], the DHHS NPS undersco red the urgent need to develop 
and test PSM interventions tailored to the unique needs of vulnerable populations, 
particularly PLWH, that can be implemented and disseminated nationwide. Until an 
effective and scalable PSM intervention for chronic pain in P LWH is developed, 
reducing the burden of chronic pain safely and effectively in this population will not be 
possible.  
II. OBJECTIVES       
 
 
[ADDRESS_600746] achieving that goal is to evaluate a novel theory -based P SM 
intervention, “Skills TO Manage Pain” (STOMP), that we developed for PLWH. We 
conducted a [ADDRESS_600747] on pain and function. Additionally , final analysis of STOMP’s  
cost/QALY was substantially lower than the $50,000 to $100,000/QALY benchmark 
often used to indicate cost -effectiveness.  Although based on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_468745], therefore, 
preliminary, these findings are promising, and suggest the importance of cost 
analyses in future STOMP trials.  
 
For this study, w e will a ccomplish our overall objective by [CONTACT_468761]: 1 ). Evaluate the efficacy of STOMP, a theory -based intervention 
tailored to improving chronic pain in PLWH. Given the rigorous intervention 
development process and promising pi[INVESTIGATOR_468746], our working hypothesis is that 
STOMP will decrease pain severit y and improve function in PLWH. We propose a two -
arm randomized trial of STOMP vs. a usual care comparison condition (N=280).   
We also propose the following secondary aims: 2 ). Conduct exploratory analyses of 
the impact of STOMP on HIV outcomes associated with chronic pain. Our working 
hypothesis is that STOMP will not only decrease pain severity and improve function, 
but increase retention in HIV primary care and virologic suppression rates.  3. 
Investigate proximal outcomes as potential mediators of STOMP’s impact on chronic 
pain. During our formative work, we incorporated the key SCT constructs of self -
 
 
4 
 efficacy, outcome expectations, and self -regulation into the intervention. Our working 
hypothesis is that these constructs are “proximal outcomes” through which the 
intervention’s impact on pain and function is mediated.          
 
This study will be conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and     
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  (UNC ), two sites within the Center for 
AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort. The University 
of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_468747].  
 
III. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
a) STUDY POPULATION   
A total of  280 participants who are patients at UAB and UNC  - enrolled in CNICS, 
experiencing chronic pain (Brief Chronic Pain Screening Questionnaire (BCPQ) = at least 
moderate pain for at least 3 months) and moderately severe and impairing chronic pain 
(PEG pain questionnaire = average of all three times is 4 or g reater).  
 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Enrolled in CNICS  
2. Age ≥ 18 years  
3. English -speaking  
4. Chronic pain (Brief Chronic Pain Screening Questionnaire (BCPQ) = at least 
moderate pain for at least 3 months)  
 
 
5 
 5. Moderately severe and impairing chronic pain (PEG pain questionnaire = average 
of all three items is 4 or greater)  
6. Ability and willingness to attend the group sessions at the date/time specified  
7. No plans for major surgery during the study period that would interfere with study 
procedures.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Do not speak or understand English  
2. Are planning a new pain treatment like surgery  
3. Cannot attend the group sessions  
4. Had previously  participated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (STOMP)   
5. Unwilling to provide informed consent  
 
We will rely heavily on active recruitment using patients identified as having chronic pain 
on the BCPQ and PEG on CNICS pain Patient Reported Outcome measures.   
Additionally, p articipants will be recruited via word -of-mouth by [CONTACT_304554], 
calls generated from flyer tear -offs and other advertisements placed in the clinic .  
 
b) PRE-SCREENING  (phone and then in -person)  
Potential participants will be prescreened over the phone using our prescreening phone 
script  once the participating site . A HIPAA waiver will be submitted with the initial 
submission . If the individual passes the telephone prescreen, he or she will be scheduled 
for an in -person pre -screening visit by a member of the STOMP  recruitment team. The 
date and time of the pre -screening visit along with the participant contact [CONTACT_32431] 
 
 
[ADDRESS_600748] the participant’s eligibility on the Prescreening Visit Appointment Form. If the 
participant is eligible for enrollment, a Screening and Enrol lment Visit will be scheduled 
and recorded on a Screening and Enrollment Visit form. A separate excel log will collect 
data from the screening and enrollment visit form for tracking purposes. The participant 
will also be thanked and given their $25 incentive.  If the participant is not eligible, he or 
she will  also be thanked for their time and given a $ 25 incentive.  
 
 
 
c) SCREENING  AND ENROLLMENT  
The Screening and Enrollment Visit will be scheduled approximately 2 -4 weeks from the 
date of the pre -screen visit and recorded on a Screening and Enrollment Visit form. 
Participants will receive a reminder call at about a week and 48 hours prior to the 
 
 
7 
 scheduled screening and enrollment visit. At the beginning of the screening and 
enrollment visit, the participant will complete the informed consent process , and then they 
will complete a baseline assessment .  
 
Informed Consent Procedures  
Informed consent will be administered by [CONTACT_468762][INVESTIGATOR_9109], the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill ’s Institutional Review Boards ’ guidelines for obtaining informed consent. 
The staff member obtaining consent must verify the following: protocol name, version 
number, dates for use, and institution. The Study team member will also ensure that the 
most recent informed consent is being u sed for the study. Initial infor med consent must 
be completed and documented before any other study related procedures are done.  
Comprehension will be assessed by [CONTACT_468763], can you tell me about how long the study may last, etc. The consent 
process is estimated to take around 30 minutes. Study staff will ensure that the participant 
has signed and dated the consent form including the HIPAA form.  All signed consent 
forms will be stored in locked file cabinets under respective participant files.  
 
Baseline Assessment  
The research staff will then administer the baseline assessment which includes a 
confirmatory set of screening questions via RedCap.  Confirmation of the participant’s 
eligibility will be recorded in RedCap. If a participant is ineligible based on this RedCap 
assessment, they will be given a $[ADDRESS_600749] been enrolled in the study at any point (informed consent is 
asked before this point so that we can use any data generated in published findings).   If 
a participant is eligible, they will also be thanked for coming and given their $50 incentive 
payment for their time.  Completion of Baseline assessment will be recorded in excel logs.  
 
RANDOMIZATION  
Our team will utilize a 1:1 ratio for allocation to the STOMP intervention and Usual Care 
(UC) conditions. Our study statistician, [CONTACT_146200], will use SAS to generate the 
randomization scheme  stratified by [CONTACT_468764] -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] 
(taking prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_208770] 3 months) and whether they have chronic multisite 
pain (pain in at least 3 locations or pain all over) . Importantly, the PIs and outcomes 
assessors will be blinded to intervention vs. comparison allocation. Participants in the 
intervention and compar ison conditions will have full access to all available clinical 
services at their respective sites.  
d) INTERVENTION  
The intervention group will receive “treatment as usual” plus the STOMP behavioral 
intervention.  The “treatment as usual” refers to the standard of care that patients receive 
at the UAB and UNC  clinics. This standard of care is for patients to discuss chronic pain 
with their providers at their discretion. Although highly variable, providers can 
recommend and prescribe pharmacologic (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_304552]), non -
pharmacologic (e.g ., physical therapy, referral to psychology) approaches for pain.  This 
study will not interfere in any way with usual care.  
 
 
 
9 
 The STOMP  behav ioral intervention consists of 12 intervention sessions (6 group and 6 
individual sessions). The sessions will be completed over a period of [ADDRESS_600750] of 
the intervention.  The intervention group will utilize a study manual on pain management 
in which they will use with each session.  
 
Group intervention Sessions  
A total of 6 group sessions will be conducted over a period of 12 -16 weeks from study 
enrollment date. These sessions will be led by a peer. A peer is an HIV -infected patient 
of the UAB or UNC  clinics  living with chronic pain  and is a successful self -manager of 
his/her chronic pain. Peers will receive training that will include being a participant in all 
one-on-one sessions , and additional training to co -facilitate the six group sessions with 
the interventionist . Prior to the beginning of the first group se ssion, participants will sign 
an Agreement of Confidentiality.  
 
Participants will receive a reminder call/text approximately [ADDRESS_600751]  (see Fidelity, below).  
 
Reminder calls  
 
 
[ADDRESS_600752] practices if a participant misses a session. This will 
include contact[CONTACT_468765] a day of the missed session to schedule a make -
up session in -person or by [CONTACT_468766]’s preference; d uring that 
session, engaging in problem -solving as to why they missed the session and what 
barriers they envision going forward, and how those barriers might be addressed; and 
allowing participants to phone into group and individual sessions if needed. If there are 
things we can do to help that are reasonable (e.g., more reminders, more transportation 
assistance, or other things), we will provide them. Additionally, if they miss more than one 
visit, they may receive a call asking about their future participation in the study and 
whether, if they are unwilling to participate in intervention sessions, they would  be willing 
to just complete outcome assessments.  
Assessments  
All participants in the intervention group will also receive a REDCAP assessment at 
baseline, post -intervention ( 0-month , after all sessions are complete d), and then at  3, 6, 
[ADDRESS_600753]-intervention (0 -month) to screen for any unexpected medical incident, the severity 
of the event, its relation to the study, and medical follow -up. Viral load will also be 
 
 
[ADDRESS_600754], that value will be recorded; otherwise, a viral load will 
be drawn. At [ADDRESS_600755], that valu e will be recorded; otherwise, a viral load will be drawn. We will continue 
to conduct assessments every six months until the end of the study for all participants 
who complete the intervention by [CONTACT_468767]  3. Participants who completed 
the baseline assessment by [CONTACT_11712] 30, 2021 will continue to receive outcome assessments 
until April 2023 for a maximum of 41 months or 3 years . These  assessments  may be 
conducted by [CONTACT_648] , if necessary,  or in person. They will also participate in an audio -
recorded in –person qualitative interview at the mid -point and end of the trial which will 
be transcribed using a third party company .   
 
We will also investigate the intervention’s impact on use of prescribed and non -prescribed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Study staff will ask at each baseline and outcome assessment (0,3,6,9,12) the 
name [CONTACT_468776] ’ pharmacies along with the list of their current medications and 
dosage.  Study staff will print out the medication lis ts and review it against the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_468748] . With written consent and a signed 
release of information from participants, a study staff member will contact [CONTACT_3038]’ 
pharmacy (or pharmacies) at the 12- month assessment to verify the self -reported 
information provided by [CONTACT_468768] .  The data will be added 
into an excel spreadsheet for collection and analysis.  Participants will receive up to [ADDRESS_600756] party. Participants will be compensated $50 for each of the qualitative 
interviews.  
 
e) COMPARISON CONDITION  
The comparison group will receive “treatment as usual”  as described above .  The 
comparison group will also be provided with the intervention manual, however, no  
additional treatment will be provided to participants allocated to the control group.  
 
 
 
 
Assessments  
The comparison group  participants will complete the post-intervention  (0-month)  follow -
up at the same timing of the intervention group ( 12 - 16 weeks ) after the 1st intervention 
session. , and then will complete the outcome  assessments  (3,6,9,12)  as the intervention  
group as described above including the base line and the [ADDRESS_600757] assessments every six months until the end of the study for all 
participants who complete the baseline assessment by [CONTACT_468767] 3. 
Participants who completed the baseline assessment by [CONTACT_11712] 30, 2021 will continue to 
 
 
14 
 receive outcome assessments until April 2023 for a maximum of 41 months or 3 years. 
These assessments may be conducted by [CONTACT_648], if necessary, or in person.  
We will also investigate the intervention’s impact on use of prescribed and non -prescribed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Study staff will ask at each outcome assessment (3,6,9,12) the name [CONTACT_468777]’ pharmacies along with the list of their current medications and dosage. Study 
staff will print out the medication lists and review it against the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_468749]. With  written consent and a signed release of 
information from participants, a study staff member will contact [CONTACT_3038]’ pharmacy 
(or pharmacies) at the12 - month assessment to verify the self -reported information 
provided by [CONTACT_468768].  The data will be added into an 
excel spreadsheet for collection and analysis.    Participants will receive up to 3 reminder 
calls at about a week and 48 hours prior to the next outcome assessment.  
 
 
f) PEER  INTERVENTIONISTS  
As a peer interventionist, they will lead the intervention groups.  Having peers 
facilitate the intervention groups fosters relationships with the participants since both 
groups share similar experiences. Peer interventionists will be compensated $500 for 
the initial training time and an additional $1,[ADDRESS_600758] and will 
co-facilitate  (along with the staff interventio nist) a group of ten participants; the other 
two (at sites when more than one peer is hired)  will serve as first and second backup.  
The lead and first (active)  back -up should attend  all [ADDRESS_600759] periodic check -ins to the active 
and (inactive) back -up to ensure he/she remain s engaged  in the study . 
Peers will be responsible for  the following activities.   
Lead peer  
1. Complete IRB and Good Clinical Practice certification  
 
2. Participate in a 2 day STOMP training on pain self -management on an annual basis  
 
3. Participate in 2 – 5 individual training sessions and 2 mock group sessions with staff 
intervention prior to start of intervention  
4. Co-lead 6 one hour group sessions over a 12 - 16 week period for three years (arrive 
30 minutes before and stay 30 minutes after) and attend weekly debriefing calls  
5. Conduct reminder calls for the group sessions and p rovide phone -based peer support 
to intervention participants  (as needed, during scheduled time)   
6. Lead peer interventionist could work approximately [ADDRESS_600760] Backup peer  
1. Complete IRB and Good Clinical Practice certification  
 
 
16 
  
2. Participate in a 2 day STOMP training on pain self -management on an annual basis  
 
3. Participate in 2 – [ADDRESS_600761] back -ups will listen to and debrief about audio from group sessions as part of 
their continuous training which will occur monthly  
5. Attend all 6 group sessions  (arrive 30 minutes before and stay 30 minutes after)  
6. First back -ups could work approximately 2 hour per week or less  during each 
intervention cycle  
Second Backup peer  
1. Complete IRB and Good Clinical Practice certification  
 
2. Participate in a 2 day STOMP training on pain self -management on an annual basis  
3. Participate in 2 – 5 individual training sessions and 2 mock group sessions with staff 
intervention prior to start of intervention  
4. Second back -ups will listen to and debrief about audio from group sessions as part of 
their continuous training which will occur twice during each 12 – 16 week period  
5. Second back -ups could work approximately 1 hour per week or less  during each 
intervention cycle  
Payment Schedule  
1. All peers will be compensated $500 for each annual 2 day STOMP training  
2. The Lead peer will be paid $1,[ADDRESS_600762] and Second backup peers will be compensated at an hourly rate for study 
activities  
 
 
17 
  
RETENTION PROCEDURES  
Several procedures will be implemented to optimize retention and ensure participant 
comfort while participating in both study arms. At all study visits, both intervention and 
follow -up, participants will be offered a beverage and snacks. In addition, for i nterven tion 
group participants only, participants who are in need of transportation will be provided 
transit vouchers to attend intervention  group and one -on-one sessions.   (but not outcome  
assessments).  In addition, we will have  mid-study calls to confirm contact [CONTACT_468769] .  
If a participant misses a session, study staff will contact [CONTACT_468770] a make -up session either in -person or by [CONTACT_468771]’s preference.  During the make -up session, study staff will  engage in 
problem solving skills to address barriers that limited participant’s attendance.  
 
g) FIDELITY ASSESSMENTS  
We will use a structured fidelity assessment tool developed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_468750]. William Demonte. To assess one -on-one session fidelity 
across interventionists, time, and sites, we will audio  record sessions. Initially, we will 
listen to and rate all one -on-one sessions. Once an interventionist completes five 
consecutive sessions with 80% fidelity, we will “certify” the interventionist as having the 
competence necessary to continue to conduct t he intervention. Thereafter, a blinded 
assessor with intervention delivery experience t rained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Demonte will review a 10% 
random sample. We will also provide ongoing supervision to prevent interventionist drift. 
We will monitor treatment receipt by [CONTACT_2329] a checklist, which will capture whether 
 
 
[ADDRESS_600763] used their tracking logs (which will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_468751]). Given the less structured format of the group sessions, they 
will be assessed for knowledge sharing between the peers and participants and  among 
participants, reflection on one -on-one session content, and fostering social support.  
 
h) COLLECTION OF COST DATA  
Each site will be responsible for tracking the following items in real -time: up -front training  
hours, cost of snacks, travel vouchers and participant manuals.  Individual and group 
sessions will be tracked using the audio -record capability.  
 
i) COLLECTION OF CNICS DATA  
Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems  (CNICS) Data:  
CNICS data will be collected from abstractions from site medical record databases in 
collaboration with the CNICS data collection and patient reported outcomes infrastructure. 
Clinical and medical history data will include HIV viral load, CD4+ T -cell counts, co -morbid 
conditions, HIV primary care visit adherence, and  medications.   HIV primary care visit 
adherence will be extracted on all HIV care visits from the date of enrollment until the end 
of the study.  Data from CNICS Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) q uestionnaires 
including assessments of pain will be identified by [CONTACT_468772].  
 
j) TRACKING OF STUDY PATIENTS  
Study staff will use the study’s RedCap database to capture reminder calls, study visits, 
assessments, and intervention activities.  Study staff will use excel logs to capture 
 
 
19 
 prescreening, enrollment, randomization, timeline/window of outcome assessments, 
status of assessments, reminder call status for assessments and pharmacy data. . All 
study staff will be trained in Human Subjects Protections, and this data will be handled 
in accordance with CNICS electronic storage and data transfer guidelines.  
 
Study staff will also review data entered in RedCap on a weekly  basis as a quality 
assurance  measure. The program manager at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_468752].  
 
k) MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRATION OF UAB AND UNC  SITES  
Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Merlin and Program Director Alissa Eugeni will conduct regular in -person 
visits  to each site. Additionally, there will be a weekly video Skype meeting with [CONTACT_175125], 
[CONTACT_468778], and local study staff and site PIs at UAB and UNC . The purpose of these 
weekly meetings will be to track progress with study milestones, troubleshoot issues that 
may arise, and discuss any adverse events.

IV. DATA  COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
All study documentation will be kept in locked file cabinets in in study personnel’s offices 
at UAB and UNC . RedCap database can only be accessed by [CONTACT_468774] s or encrypted laptop s. 
 
V. DATA ANALYSIS  
A separate document will be submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_468753].  
 
VI. CRISIS PROTOCOL  
As a general note, referrals can be made for crisis consultation at any time.  The research 
staff will document the findings of his/her evaluation and the course of action taken.  
 
 
23 
 Providers for the patient may be informed about the same . If it becomes apparent during 
data collection that a patient is in danger, is suffering, or is at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a clinically 
relevant physical or mental health condition (e.g., depression, suicide, self -injurious 
behaviors), relevant  staff in the local clinic (e.g., professional mental health counselors, 
social workers, and nurses/providers) will be notified and standard procedures already in 
places in each clinic for ensuring the physical and mental wee -being of patients will be 
followed (e. g., intervening and/or providing appropriate referral, as indicated).  
 
VII. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Our team has devised a comprehensive plan for ensuring protection of human subjects 
throughout the course of the proposed study. We will utilize an English -language consent 
form with common phrasing that describes that no special privileges or consideratio ns will 
be conferred as a result of study participation, and that access to medical care will not be 
affected by [CONTACT_52764]’s decision to enroll in the study. The procedures listed 
in the following sections detail procedures that have been a pproved and utilized during 
recent years of clinical and behavioral trials at each site for collaborative research that 
utilizes sensitive information from participants. Our team will make every effort to protect 
all participants’ confidential and private information in order to minimize possible study -
associated risks.  
 
All findings related to this research will be available and provided to study participants in 
accordance with standard practices. Clinical and measurement data used for research 
studies will be released only in de -identified fashion . 
 
 
 
24 
 In addition, all study personnel are required to renew Human Subjects trainings annually, 
or in accordance with their site regulatory mandates.

Study Design & Objectives.  Our overall objective is to evaluate a novel theory-based PSM 
intervention,
 “Skills TO Manage Pain” (STOMP) developed for people with HIV (PWH). The 
design of the proposed study is a multicenter parallel-group individually randomized group 
clinical trial.
 The primate outcome is to evaluate the efficacy of STOMP, a theory-based 
intervention tailored to improving chronic pain in PWH immediately post intervention. The 
secondary outcomes are to investigate additional pain outcomes and proximal outcomes as 
potential mediators of STOMP’s impact on chronic pain immediately post intervention and at 3 
months.  
The study will be
 conducted at 2 institutions in the [LOCATION_002] (University of Alabama at 
Birmingham (UAB) and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)), and we will enroll 
adult patients, ages >18 years of age, consented to participate in the CFAR Network of 
Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), English-speaking, having at least moderate chronic pain, 
ability and willingness to attend the group sessions at the date/time specified, and no plans for 
major surgery during the study period that would interfere with study procedures. 
The primary hypothesis is STOMP will decrease
 pain severity and improve function (as 
measured by [CONTACT_32028]-total) in PWH.
 To test this hypothesis, we propose a two-arm randomized trial 
of STOMP vs. an enhanced usual care comparison condition.  Our primary outcome will be Brief 
Pain Inventory (BPI)-Total score and will be measured at baseline and immediately post-
intervention (~[ADDRESS_600770] interventi on session). Our secondary outcomes will be 
changes in additional pain scales (PEG and BPI [INVESTIGATOR_468756]-pain severity and BPI- 
interference), pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), 
and pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) between  groups immediately pos t intervention. We will 
examine sustained differences in primary and sec ondary outcomes at [ADDRESS_600771] intervention.  
Sample Size Calculation. Our primary outcome is the BPI- Total score as described above. 
Given that 20 participants progress through the study at a time, our tota l sample size should be 
divisible by 20. A sample size of 210 will provide 85% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_600772] that a change  of 1 on the BPI [CONTACT_832] a minimum clinically 
significant difference. Additionally, the difference  we found in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_468757] 1 (SD=2.4). 
Therefore, a sample size of [ADDRESS_600773] size. To become divisible by 20 
and allow for 25% dropout (slightly more than in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]) we will recruit 280 participants 
With our anticipated sample size, we will be able to estimate a margin-of-error of 1.5 percentage 
points for 95% intervals. For sec ondary outcomes, we can detect an effect size of 0.4, a medium 
effect, for continuous measures  and a difference of proportio ns between 7.5% and 17% for 
binary measures, each with 85% power.  
Interim & Final Analyses.   We will not have any planne d interim looks for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_377063], although safety and tolerability data will be monitored by [CONTACT_468775]. The final analyses will be conducted once study follow-up is complete, after all data is

[CONTACT_30097] 2024 with completion of primary anal yses occurring by [INVESTIGATOR_309732] h of the same year. 
 
 
Analysis Sets. The full analysis set will be based on an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with a 
per-protocol (PP) sensitivity analyses. The ITT analysis set will comprise  all participants who 
have been randomized to either study arm, regardless of length of  follow-up or actual 
intervention received.  
 Endpoint and Covariates  
 Our primary outcome will be the Brief Pain In ventory (BPI)-Total score, a commonly used 
composite measure of pain severity and the impact of pain on an individual’s function. The BPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_468758] 11 questions about pain severity (pain at it s worst, least, average, and right now) and the 
interference of pain in several aspects of patients’ lives (ac tivity, mood, walking ability, work, 
relations with other people, sl eep, and enjoyment of life) on a scale of 0 (no pain/does not 
interfere) to 10 (pain as bad as you imagine/comple tely interferes). The BPI-Total score is the 
average score across all [ADDRESS_600774]-to-follow-up (LTF) between 
study arms. 
 Our general assumption will be that missing da ta is of the Missing at Random (MAR) 
mechanism. In this case, the use of linear mixed models fo r the primary analysis will be 
sufficient in reducing the impact that missing data has on biasing the primary results. 
Additionally, we will conduct a sensitivity anal ysis using multiple imputation via chained 
equations (MICE) to see how robus t the overall inferences are.  
  Statistical Analyses.  The primary outcome – BPI-Total score – and the other secondary outcomes will be assessed as 
continuous variables. Linear mixe d effects models will be perform ed to test differences between 
intervention and control conditions  at the immediate post intervention and at [ADDRESS_600775] squared means of each group at  each time.  We w ill check distributional

individual observations, PRESS re siduals which are composite resi duals across an individual in 
longitudinal analysis, and Cook’s distance. In compi[INVESTIGATOR_468759], we will use an 
Intention to Treat (ITT) approach. We chose ITT for two reasons: 1) it fully exploits the benefits 
of balancing through randomization by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a ll patients who are rando mized in the analysis; 
2) it is a more “real-world” assessment of the in tervention’s impact as it allows for incomplete 
adherence and includes participan ts who may unintentionally cross over from the control to the 
intervention condition. Each of these issues can be handled well within the linear mixed models 
that will allow investigators to plot model-predic ted trajectories for individuals with incomplete 
data. An additional advantage of linear mixed mode ls is that they do not assume that the time 
between assessments is fixed and da ta for individuals who miss a time point can still be included. 
However, as this is the first efficacy trial to inve stigate STOMP, we will also conduct a per-
protocol/as treated sensit ivity analysis to understa nd the impact of the in tervention without these 
complicating factors and adjust for differences by [CONTACT_3725]. As a sensitiv ity analysis, missing data will 
be examined using multiple imputation methods. Specifically, multiple im putation using chained 
equations will be performed using previous baseline outcome data.  Data will be imputed 
separately for each treatment group to improve efficiency and reduce bias in the treatment effect 
estimate.[ADDRESS_600776] 30% BPI [INVESTIGATOR_468760] r mixed models with bi nary outcome using the

3.0 SHORT STUDY  SUMMARY  
Study Title:   A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_860662] 
(VNS) During Rehab ilitation for Improved Upper Limb Motor 
Function After Stroke  (VNS -REHAB)  
Summary:  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_860663] [ADDRESS_1199740] s and 15 clinical 
sites.  All subjects are implanted with the Vivistim System® and then 
randomized to either study treatment or  active -control treatment.  
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] ( <30, >30) and baseline 
FMA UE (20 to <35; >35 to 50).  Study treatment is vagus nerve 
stimulation (VNS) delivered during rehabilitation.  Active control 
treatment is rehabilitation (standard -of-care treatment) with only a 
minimal amount of VNS  at the start of each session intended to 
support blinding . 
This study has three  distinct stages :  Stage  I, an acute blinded stage , 
Stage  II, an unblinded stage  through one year of standard VNS, and 
Stage  III, an unblinded stage  for yearly follow -up after one year of 
VNS.    The Control group cross es over to VNS treatment at Stage  
II. 
For Stage  I, subjects have :  
 consent and  evaluation  (screening) ,  
 one pre-implant evaluation,  
 surgical implant of the device system  and randomization into 
one of the treatment arms ,  
 one baseline evaluation after device implant surgery but 
before initiation of treatment,  
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 6  6 weeks of treatment ( standard -of-care rehabilitation + 
standard VNS or standard -of-care rehabili tation  + active 
control VNS ), and then  
 post-acute therapy evaluations at 1, 30 and 90 days after the 
6 weeks of treatment.    
 Between Day 1 (V5) and Day 30  (V6) post -acute therapy , both 
groups will receive in -home, self -directed rehabilitation ([ADDRESS_1199741]) 
with either in-home activated VNS  (VNS group) or no VNS 
(Control group).  This means that the control subjects will not 
have the in-home activated VNS until they complete the 
second 6 -week  session  of in-clinic rehabilitation with follow -
up assessments  as described below  in Stage II .  At this point 
(Day 30) subject s start scheduling  for their continuing long-
term follow -up. 
 Between Day [ADDRESS_1199742]-acute therapy , both groups 
continue in -home, self -directed rehabilitation ([ADDRESS_1199743]).  The VNS 
group continues to receive in-home VNS with magnet use; the 
Control group continues to use the magnet but does not 
receive any VNS .  The Day [ADDRESS_1199744]-acute the rapy visit  is V7 ; 
it is the first quarterly visit (3 months after study therapy)  for 
the VNS group  and is the re -baseline visit (visit just prior to 
the initiation of standard VNS therapy) for the Control group . 
Stage  II: 
 VNS subjects will continue to have  quarterly assessments 
through the end of the first year  (6m, 9m, 12m) .   
 Subjects in the control group will crossover  for a second  6-
week in -clinic rehabilitation period where they will now receive 
rehabilitation with standard VNS.   
 Control subjects  will then have the three  post therapy 
assessments (1, 30 and 90 days after therapy ends) ; in-home 
VNS initiated by a magnet swipe starts at the Post -1 visit  
(LT1) .  Thereafter , control subjects will follow the same 
schedule as VNS subjects for the remainder of  the study  (6m, 
9m, 12m follow -ups, plus yearly visits thereafter ).   
 Subjects in both groups will receive “booster” in -clinic 
rehabilitation plus VNS therapy sessions one month prior to 
their 6 - and 12 -month assessment visits.  These sessions 
occur on thr ee days over a one -week period (typi[INVESTIGATOR_860664], 
Wed, Fri).  
 
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 7 Stage  III: 
 After one year of standard VNS therapy (~13.5 months after 
implant for VNS group subjects and ~18 months after implant 
for Control group subjects) , subjects who wish to keep their 
device  for further use will have  annual follow -up assessments 
until commercial approval .  
 
Main Objectives:   The primary objectives  are to assess the efficacy and safety of the 
therapy.  The study is intended to provide evidence that VNS paired  
with rehabilitati on, in subjects suffering from upper extremity paresis 
after stroke , is a safe and effective treatment for recovery of upper 
limb motor function after stroke.  It is the intent that this data support 
a PMA application to FDA.  
The primary endpoint  is the difference in the Fugl-Meyer 
Assessment, Upper Extremity portion ( FMA -UE) score after 6  weeks 
of treatment in the paired VNS group compared to the Control  group 
(difference at Visit 5 compared to V4) .  The study population  
includes subjects [ADDRESS_1199745] between a 20 and 50 Fugl -Meyer Upper Extremity (FMA -UE) 
score.  More detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are included in 
Section 9.1. 
   
Study Design : Multicenter, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized, blinded, controlled trial of VN S + 
Rehabilitation  versus Control VNS + Rehabilitation

6.0 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIO NALE  
 
6.1 Background – Disease and Treatment  
  
In the [LOCATION_002], there are about 800,000 cases of  stroke each year  (Parker, et al. 
1986 ). Subject s with hemiplegia or hemiparesis generally regain walking without the use 
of an assistive device while only one-third to one-half of subject s regain some degree of 
use of their upper extremity, even after int ensive rehabilitation therapy.  Upper limb 
impairment is one of the best predictors of long -term disability after stroke  (Krakauer et 
al. 2005 ), and u pper limb motor disabilities from stroke have an unfavorable effect on 
the activities of daily living, crit ically impacting the quality of life for the stroke victim and 
their family members and caregivers.   
 
Post-stroke r ehabilitation interventions have been shown to produce functional gains as 
well as facilitate a range of neuroplastic brain events (Carey et al., 2002; Kimberley et 
al., 2004; Takahashi et al. , 2008 ; Sawaki et al. , 2008).   Overarching neuroplasticity 
principles (Kleim and Jones, 2008) have had great influence on recent rehabilitation 
research (Wolf, 2007; Wolf et al. , 2006 and 2010; Dobkin et al., 2006; Lang et al. , 
2009). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_860666] -related research, there has not been a 
concomitant widespread reduction in disability after stroke. It may be that additional 
facilitation of neuroplastic change is required to achieve a drastic shift in the 
rehabilitation status quo (Cramer et al. , 2011). Pairing rehabilitation with release of 
neuromodulators may be what is required for true meaningful change in people with 
stroke.  
 
To enhance recovery further, adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_159358] b een tried. For example, 
amphetamines can be effective at enhancing recovery of motor abilities beyond that 
seen with physical rehabilitation alone (Walker -Batson et al. , 2001; Walker -Batson  et 
al., 1995 ; Crisostomo et al., 1988 ); however, even the positive  results for motor 
outcomes are only incremental , and amphetamine use has many well -known side 
effects (Gladstone, et al. , 2006; Barbay and Nudo, 2009; Sprigg and Bath, 2009; Adkins 
et al. , 2008). Several small, randomized controlled trials have shown that  epi[INVESTIGATOR_860667] (Adkins et al. , 2008; Brown et al. , 2006).  Unfortunately, the method requires 
brain surgery with the potential for significant complications; hence , it is not likely to 
reach widespread clinical use in stroke patients. Moreover, a recent Phase III 
randomized controlled trial showed no advantage of using cortical stimulation combined 
with rehabilitation , compared to rehabilitation alone. The failure wa s partially attributed 
to a discrepancy between the site of motor cortex stimulation (distal) and the 
rehabilitation training and also due to a loss of corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_860668] (Plow et al. , 2009).  
 
Less invasive methods for cortical stimulation , including repetitive transmagnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) and trans -cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) , have also been 
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 17 combined with physical rehabilitation (Bolognini et al. , 2009; Schlaug et al. , 2008).  
While improvements in upper extrem ity function have been reported in some  subjects , 
larger randomized controlled studies will be needed to determine its true efficacy  (Hao, 
et al., 2013; Elsner, et al., 2013 ) . Also, stimulation parameters still need to be 
optimized , and it is unknown how best to induce the desirable plastic changes.  
 
To address this unmet medical need, MicroTransponder has developed  a VNS-based  
rehabilitation therapy; VNS therapy (with no rehabilitation) has already received market 
clearance in the US and Europe for refra ctory epi[INVESTIGATOR_860669] 100,000 people for the treatment of these conditions.   However, in both of 
these indications , VNS is used throughout the day without any pairing, with automatic 
and continuously cycling stimulation (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 30 seconds of stimulation every 5 minutes 
for 24  hours a day , totaling about 130  minutes per day).  Although clinical VNS has 
been used in this way, recent animal research has shown that VNS can reverse 
maladaptive plasticity when given during some learning phenomena (either tones for 
tinnitus or movement for motor rehabilitation) (Engineer et al. , 2011 ; Porter et al. , 2011).  
 
 
6.2 Scientific Rationale  
 
Upper limb hemiparesis typi[INVESTIGATOR_860670] i schemic stroke that damages areas in the 
brain th at control movement. While the ischemic core might be permanently damaged, 
the surrounding penumbra and connected areas  (including contralesional areas)  can be 
salvaged and recruited to drive functional plasticity and recovery. Improvements in 
motor functi on that have been observed in clinical stroke research are considered to be 
inextricably tied to neuroplastic change within the brain.  Unfortunately, even with 
spontaneous recovery following stroke, the brain’s ability to recover from injury is often 
slow and incomplete , and rehabilitation alone is likely to be insufficient to drive plasticity 
in these surrounding regions.   
 
It is possible that VNS may exert these effects on neuroplasticity at least partially via 
indirect activation of nucleus basalis (NB)  and locus ceruleus (LC) neurons, which 
release acetylcholine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_860671]. These neuromodulators likely 
enhance neural plasticity.   
 
We have previously shown that p airing sensory events with direct stimulation of the 
nucleus basalis  (NB) result ed in rapid and robust cortical plasticity, including spatial 
(i.e., map), temporal, or spatiotemporal plasticity (Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998 a, b, and 
2002; Kilgard et al. , 2007). Direct stimulation of neuromodulatory nuclei located deep in 
the basal forebrain is not clinically desirable. Cells in the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius 
(NTS)  project to NB and LC, which regulate the release of acetylcholine and 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] , respectively. Therefore, an alternative method of inducing rapid, robust, 
and long lasting neuroplasticity was used by [CONTACT_860721].  
 
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 18 We showed that VNS paired with a tone resulted in plasticity to nucleus basalis  
stimulation (VNS in significantly less invasiv e than DBS, projects to NB and other deep 
brain nuclei), thereby [CONTACT_860722] (and also 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) (Engineer et al., 2011) . VNS paired with specific tones (excluding the 
tinnitus frequency) resulted in improvement of t he tinnitus percept in a rat model of 
tinnitus along with a reversal of the abnormal plasticity associated with it (restoring 
abnormal map expansion and decreasing the enhanced spontaneous and synchronous 
activity associated with tinnitus). In this report , we also demonstrated that pairing tones 
with trigeminal nerve stimulation (another cranial nerve) does not result in map 
plasticity. Finally, we showed th at VNS alone or tones alone do  not reverse the 
pathological plasticity . 
 
Next, it was  demonstrate d that movement  pairing during VNS wa s able to enhance 
plasticity in rat motor cortex . This study demonstrated that pairing VNS with specific 
forelimb movements in rat’s results in specific plasticity in motor cortex – VNS pairing 
with movements of digits resu lts in motor map expansion of the distal digit 
representation in motor cortex while VNS pairing with proximal shoulder and elbow 
movements results in map expansion of the shoulder and elbow regions of motor cortex  
(Khodaprast et al., 2013) . Next, we  demons trated in a rat model of cortical ischemic 
stroke that pairing VNS with upper limb movements significantly improved forelimb 
recovery compared to rats that did only motor training without VNS  (Khodaparast et a l., 
2013).  Thereafter,  several studies in diff erent rat stroke models ( Hays et al.  2014 ) 
demonstrating the efficacy of VNS combined with motor rehabilitation.  
To more closely mimic the clinical population  (STAIR criteria) , we stimulated rats with 
Paired VNS one month after VNS implant  (chronic) . This study also used a  rat model of 
chronic cortical  and subcortical ischemic stroke . The pairing significantly improved 
forelimb recovery comp ared to rats that received  only motor training without VNS  
(Khodaparast et al. 2016 ).   Again, t o more closely mimic t he clinical population, we 
stimulated older (aged) rats with Paired VNS. Pairing VNS with upper limb movements 
significantly improved forelimb recovery compared to aged rats that did only motor 
training without VNS  (Hays et al. , 2016 ). 
 
Therefore, this  current study is being undertaken to assess the s afety and efficacy of 
simultaneous delivery of VNS with rehabilitation movement therapy  in order to reduce 
arm impairment and enhance arm function after  stroke .

Human Feasibility Stroke Study – [LOCATION_006] 
A 20-subject (9 implant, 11 non -implant Control ) study has been completed in the [LOCATION_006]  
(2014) .    The surgery, device s, and therapy are similar to those  used  in the US pi[INVESTIGATOR_860672].  All 9 implanted subjects tolerated surgery well; no 
significant adverse device effects were reported.  One subject had mild nausea toward 
the end of several therapy sessions, but modification of her device set tings was not 
required .  The VNS group had a 9.3 - point improvement in FMA -UE score , while the 
Control group had a 3.0 -point improvement.  Study results justified a  second small study 
using an implanted Control group was justified.

events have been reported; all were anticipated  based on experience s noted with  VNS 
in epi[INVESTIGATOR_860675] m the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Three subjects 
had serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with surgery – infection, hoarseness, 
and laryngeal injury due to intubation.  The infection and laryngeal injury both recovered 
with treatment within several weeks.  An injection to treat the  hoarseness lead to an 
improved voice but not full recovery; speech therapy has been  initiated to determine  if 
full recovery is possible .  Researchers reported n o signi ficant events due to stimulation , 
nor any  new or unexpected ser ious adverse event types.   Response, defined as a 6 -
point or greater FMA -UE change, occurred  in 75% of VNS subjects but in only 25% of 
Control subjects (per protocol analysis).  Average change [Avg (StDev ])] was 7.6 (4. 8) 
for VNS and 4.9 (3.1) for Control.   Wolf Motor Function Test results are similar to FMA -

9.1 Device description  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_860678] (Model 1001 Implantable Pulse Gene rator or IPG) and an implantable 
lead and electrode (Model 3000 VNS Lead).  An external system consisting of an 
external controller (Model 2000 Wireless Transmitter) and external software system 
(computer and Model 4001  MicroTransponder  SAPS® software) will provide clinician 
control of settings for the IPG.  The clinicians and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860679] a rehabilitation session.  The complete device system, call ed the Vivis tim 
System®, is shown in Figure 9.1-1. 
 
The system will operate in such a way that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860680] a 
push -button or keyboard stroke to initiate VNS during movements during the 
rehabilitation session (approximately 90 min utes to 2 hours ).  The device settings will be 
programmed to stimulate for one half second on each button push (with one half  second 
“no stimulation” period as a safety feature, so that stimulation cannot be given too 
often).  The stimulation pulse will be  set to 0.8 mA output current, with 100 µS pulse 
width  and will stimulate at a frequency of 30 Hertz .  Protocol procedures will allow  
output current to be adjusted up or down in 0.1 mA steps for tolerance, although if 
necessary, any portion of stimulation may be modified during the study to accommodate 
individual tolerance.  Stimulation parameters were chosen based on the preclinic al 
studies and the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_860681]  (see above ). The maximum expected amount 
of stimulation of 12  minutes per day (during  a 120 -minute long therapy session) 
possible in the acute portion of this  study is well below the 130 minutes of stimulation 
the person living with epi[INVESTIGATOR_860682].    
 
For subjects in both groups, the software initi ates a descending level of stimulation (0.8 
mA and then lower) for the first four rehabilitation movements.  For those in the 
investigational treatment group (VNS), when the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860683] a 
push -button  during the rehabilitation se ssion, a brief 1/[ADDRESS_1199758] VNS only at the start of each session (during the 
first four movements) and there after will receive no VNS during rehabilitation (i.e., when 
the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860684] -button , no stimulation occurs). The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860685] -button  on each movement, and the Control subjects will be treated the same as 
the VNS subjects, bu t no stimulation will be delivered.  This is for the acute portion of 
the study through Stage  I.  During Stage  II, both groups will receive standard VNS 
during the entire in-clinic rehabilitation  session , according to the study schedule.    
 
Note: In order  to maintain the blind, only the unblinded device programmer will set the 
device parameters prior to the first therapy session.  Many subjects do not feel 
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 24 stimulation at 0.8 mA  (only 25% of the IDE pi[INVESTIGATOR_860686] ), so subjects in 
both groups may or may not feel stimulation; this also helps maintain the blind, since all 
subjects will be told that even when in the active treatment group (VNS), they often 
don’t feel stimulation.  
 
After the first 6  weeks of treatment , subjects will use a specializ ed magnet provided for 
them to initiate a 30 minute VNS therapy session while performing at -home tasks ; 
however , this is expected to be around 90 seconds of actual stimulation ( one half  
second of stimulation every 10 seconds for 30 minutes).  This is still  well below the total 
amount of stimulation typi[INVESTIGATOR_860687] (30 seconds of stimulation every 5 
minutes for 24 hours a day – or 130 minutes of total stimulation time per day).   Even if a 
subject were to use the magnet several times a day  (limited to 4 hours per day for 
safety) , this amount of stimulation would still be well within established safety limits.   
NOTE: The magnet will activate stimulation at 0.[ADDRESS_1199759] VNS 
during Stage  II.  However, magnet use is documented and can be used as a proxy for 
doing home rehabilitation in either group.  
 
Device Changes  
 
The Sponsor does not anticipate any  changes to the device system during the

Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 25 9.2 Device Implantation   
Device Implantation  (Reid, 1990; Landy, 1993)  
Device implantation (V3) will take place after consent (V1) and the pre-implant visit (V2) 
have occurred.  If for some reason the implantation procedure cannot take place within [ADDRESS_1199760] the initial pre-implant (V2) assessment .  
Subjects implanted are considered fully enrolled into the study.  
 
A short description of implantation follows . It is important to note that although this is a 
guideline, each surgery is unique, and different surgeons use different techniques  (e.g., 
a surgeon may prefer to make the chest pocket first, etc.) .  Expectations are that g eneral 
anesthesia will be used.  For implantation of the electrode lead, the subject  is 
anesthetized , and the neck is slightly extended and turned [ADDRESS_1199761] down the anterior border 
of the sterno cleido mastoid muscle.   The platysma is divided or split , and the dissection is 
continued deep to the anterior border of the sterno cleido mastoid .  The carotid sheath is 
defined and opened, exposing the common carotid artery and the internal jugular 
vein.   The vagus nerve usually lies in the groove between the artery and the vein.   The 
vagus nerve is dissected free from the surrounding tissue and g ently elevated with vessel 
loops.  Next, the I PG placement incision is made. The IPG placement incision is made 
below the left clavicle  (an axillary incision may be used) . A subcutaneous pocket is 
fashioned inferiorly by [CONTACT_860723].    
 
At this stage , the lead connector is tunneled between the cervical and infraclavicular 
incisions , and t he electrodes are then attached to the nerve, starting with the inferior 
anchor helix over the nerve.   Forceps or the surgeon’s preferred manipulation tool is then 
used to coil the remainder of the electrode around the nerve.   The nerve is then placed 
back in its normal anatomical position.  The lead is looped in a gentle curve and suture d 
through a silicon e retainer adjacent to soft  tissue to avoid tension on the lead.   A second 
loop is made superficially and sutured to the fascia of the sterno cleido mastoid.   The distal 
terminals of the tunneled bipolar leads are connected to the IPG.   The system is then 
tested to confirm good electrical connection , and the  IPG is placed in its pocket with 
excess lead coils positioned posterior ly in order to minimize the possibility of damage if 
the incision is reopened for device  replacement . 
 
Operative times for primary VN S implantation vary but are  typi[INVESTIGATOR_860688] [ADDRESS_1199762] will return home following a n expected  recovery 
period of 1 to 24 hours (same day surgery).  The subject will be released after medical 
clearance  only if there is a person to drive the subject home.  Subjects will recover for 
approximately 3 to 7 days before testing begins , depending on the Investigator ’s medical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_860689] . 
 
 
Mar.[ADDRESS_1199763] participation status as  completely 
discontinued at that time.  
It is ultimately the surgeon’s decision about complete or partial lead and electrode 
removal .  If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_43693] , after viewing the electrode and nerve, removal 
of the electrode is appropriate, the electrode may be removed from around the nerve .  
Previous studies have shown that safe removal of electrodes can even be accomplished 
with subject s who have been implanted for several years a nd have thus accumulated 
considerable tissue overgrowth around the electrodes (Espi[INVESTIGATOR_222014]., 1999; MacDonald 
and Couldwell, 2004, Waseem H, et al., 2014 , Dlouhy et al., 2012 ).   
The device i s expec ted to last at least [ADDRESS_1199764] implant.  Training will include a review of manuals and actual use 
of the SAPS® software.  Expectations for  training include bo th a phone conference review 
and an in -person review.   
 
Study devices will be stored in a location under the supervision of the study Investigator s.  
Specifically, the room must be able to be locked with limited access, and the devices must 
be stored in a  locked cabinet within the locked room, with appropriate labeling indicating 
they are study devices for use on this specific study only.  Study personnel can then 
transport the devices to the surgery location.   
 
A study storage and disposition log will be  provided to the site. All implantable devices 
(IPG & lead) must be indicated on the log.  When devices are implanted or used with 
specific subjects, the site staff must update the log to indicate the receiving subject , using 
the study ID number  and not the subject’s actual  name.  
 
 
 
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 27 9.5 VNS Pairing Paradig m/Stimulation  
 
The aim of the study is to pair vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with rehabilitation motor 
tasks in subjects  with upper extremity ischemic stroke deficits and to compare this to 
individuals who undergo motor rehabilitation therapy without VNS pairing.  Our 
preclinical studies have demonstrated that VNS during  a motor task induces significant 
reorganization of the rat motor cortex (Porter et al., 2011).  In addition, our ongoing 
animal studies  demonstrate that VNS during  movement improves the motor deficit in at 
least two stroke models  (see above in Preclinical Studies) ; two pi[INVESTIGATOR_860690] .    
 
In the VNS group, subjects  will perform motor rehabilitation tasks (see Append ix 1) 
while receiving  VNS (0.8 mA, 100 µSec pulse width at 30 Hz ) for 0.[ADDRESS_1199765] 90 
minutes to 2 hours in duration.  Subjects will receive  magnets and training in their use at 
Visit 5  (end of 6 -weeks of rehabilitation); magnets will initiate 30 minutes of stimulation 
at 0.8 mA in the VNS group but will initiate no stimulation (0 mA) for the Control  group . 
 
These stimulation settings are lower in strength than standard VNS settings used for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5605] ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1.0  to 2.0 mA , 250 µSec  to 500 µSec  pulse width, 30 
Hz frequency ) and shorter in duration (1/2 second (s) vs. 30 s) but are somewhat more 
often (1/[ADDRESS_1199766] VNS Therapy for epi[INVESTIGATOR_5605]) .  The 
settings are well within the established safety guidelines of less than a 50% duty cycle 
(Agnew , 1989).  Therefore, we expect a maximum of about 12 minutes of actual 
stimulation during a study therapy session (1/2 second every 5 s = 12 movements a 
minute = 6 seconds of stimulation each minute = 360 s every hour = 720 s maximum 
over 2  hours = 12 minutes over 2  hours).  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_860691].  
 
As an additional safety feature, the device does not allow more than 4 hours of therapy 
per 24 -hour period.  As explaine d above, this study’s VNS has less total stimulation 
than what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_860692] .  If necessary, site personnel may reduce the 
output current (0.8 mA) in 0. 1 mA steps for comfort; this determination will be subject -
dependent.   The Control gro up will receive  the same rehabilitation therapy , but with the 
daily VNS for only the first four rehabilitation movements ( during the first 1 or 2 minutes 
of the 90 -120 minute rehabilitation session).  
 
In-office rehabilitation therapy  sessions will occur [ADDRESS_1199767]  programmin g training . After being trained 
in the technique, c linicians at the site will be able to implement the rehabilitation and 
stimulation themselves.  
 
Mar.23 Ver 1. 1  Page 28 10.0 STUDY SYNOPSIS AND PROCEDURES  
 
10.1 Synopsis  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_860693] (VNS)  during upper limb motor  rehabilitation (standard of care) for the 
treatment of upper limb deficits associated with stroke. The study is proposed as 
primary support for US market approval; it is expected to  give safety and efficacy 
information . 
 
Subjects  will be screened and assessed for upper limb paresis associated with stroke 
using a detailed stroke history evaluation  (including type, location, onset, neurological 
evaluation, etc.) and  various assessment scores  to determine the level of disability in 
performing everyday tasks .  Aphasia and other cognitive deficits may be present as long  
as subjects are sufficiently able to understand the potential risks and benefits of the 
study , to p ersonally provide info rmed consent, and to understand and cooperate with 
the treatment.  Subjects must be able to give their own consent.  Clinical evaluations by 
a stroke expert will confirm s ubjects entering the study exhibit a moderate to severe  
motor impairment in the upper  extremity ( UE) (as indicated by a FMA -UE score of 20 to 
50) and have at least a nine-month history of the disorder.  After informed consent 
signature , repeat assessments and other measurements  will be re corded prior to 
randomization .  All subjects will be  implanted and then randomized to either a n active -
control group (rehabilitation with Control VNS ) or the device therapy group (standard 
VNS Therapy during rehabilitation).  Subjects will maintain their group assignments 
through Visit 7 (end of Stage  I, assessment follow -up), and then all subjects will receive  
standard  VNS + rehabilitation during the long -term portion of the study ( Stage  II).   
 
It is unknown if any medications significantly influence VNS; however , based on basic 
science studie s, some medic ations may possibl y impact VNS.  Therefore , a list of 
excluded medications will be provided to Investigator s.  
 
Continuing s ubjects  will be implanted and then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the 
VNS+rehabilitation (VNS  group ) or rehabilitation with Control VNS  (Control  group ).  All 
subjects will be implanted with the Vivistim System® (including the Model 1001 IPG and 
Model 3000 VNS lead).  Control group subjects will follow the same visit schedule  and 
experience the same therapy procedures, except they will receive rehabilitation therapy  
with Control VNS  through Visit [ADDRESS_1199768]-therapy follow -up (V7) while VNS 
group subjects receive standard VNS with rehabilitation .  Control  group subjects have 
90 days of at -home rehabilitation only ( with no VNS ) between V5 and V7 and then 
receive rehabilitation plus standard VNS during the long -term portion of the study 
(Stage  II). 
 
After surgical recovery , all subjects will start treatment.  Subjects in  both groups  will 
undergo  repeat assessments after surgery but before the start of treatment.  This 
baseline assessment serves as a check that upper limb motor function did not 
Mar.[ADDRESS_1199769] recovery 
times  and may be extended due to surgical complications ; the intent is to allow 
adequate recovery such that surgery does not impact upper limb movement.  After 
recovery and post -surgery assessment, rehabilitation and study therapy  will be initiated.   
Subjects will be seen by a study investigator at least once during the first week of 
rehabilitation to verify toleration of therapy and rehabilitation. Subjects in both groups 
will have in-clinic rehabilitation  therapy approximately [ADDRESS_1199770] VNS only at the start of each session (for 
the first 4 movements), although  they will be treated similarly.  This will help maintain 
the blind.  
 
Each in -clinic rehabilitation session is expected to last [ADDRESS_1199771]-acute therapy ([ADDRESS_1199772] = V5; [ADDRESS_1199773]  = V6, [ADDRESS_1199774] = V7 ).  
Subjects in both groups will receive  magnets at V5  to initiate VNS therapy while 
performing at -home tasks; the magnet will not actually activate VNS in the Control 
group  until Stage  II.  Subjects will be scheduled for their Stage II treatment (ongoing 
VNS or control group crossover to VNS) between V6 and V7 . 
 
After the [ADDRESS_1199775] -acute time  point (V 7), participants in the VNS + rehabilitation 
group will continue  to initiate stimulat ion at home, using the magnet provided.  Control 
group subjects will crossover to 6 weeks of in -clinic rehabilitation plus VNS (their first 
VNS + rehabilitation session).    All subjects will be encouraged to return for therapy 
through at least one year of  VNS use.   Subject s who continue  after one  year of VNS 
use can continue to keep their implant and receive at-home VNS by [CONTACT_860724] -up. 
 
This study has three distinct stage s: 
Stage  I – Consent , assessment , implant, baseline assessment, acute ther apy, 
and follow -up assessment period (Day s 1, [ADDRESS_1199776]-acute therapy)  
Stage  II – Unblinded  follow -up, including additional therapy sessions and 
quarterly assessments through one year after implant  (Control group subjects 
crossover to VNS)  
Stage  III – Annual (yearly) follow -up through commercial approval to allow the 
device to remain implanted and the subject to continue at -home use.  Additional 
rehabilitation sessions are allowed at the investigator’s discretion.

 10.2 Tests/Assessments  
 
The followin g tests will be used to measure therapeutic improvement and were selected 
to measure impact of stroke in several areas , such as degree of impairment, function al 
levels,  and quality of life .  The tests have demonstrated reliability, were selected to 
sample functional arm and hand movements, and have been shown to be sensitive to 
rehabilitation. The outcome evaluator  will administer all tests . 
 
Note: Not all tests are performed at each visit.  See visit schedule for more details .    
 
Activity -Based Tests  
 
A - Fugl-Meyer Arm Motor Score  (Fugl -Meyer  Assessment (Upper Extremity) ) [Primary 
Outcome Variable] :  This is  a stroke -specific, performance based impairment index. It 
quantitatively measures impairment, based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom’s concept of 
sequenti al stages of motor return in hemiplegic stroke subject s (Fugl -Meyer , 1975). It 
uses an ordinal scale for scoring [ADDRESS_1199777] “cannot perform,” scores of 1 mean “can perform 
partially,” and scores of [ADDRESS_1199778] “can perform fully.”  Excellent inter -rater and intra -rater 
reliability and construct validity have been demonstrated, and preliminary evidence 
suggests that the Fugl -Meyer Assessment is responsive to change.  
  
B - Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) :  The WMFT is a timed test of upper extremity 
function commonly used in chronic stroke rehabilitation studies (Wolf et al., 2006; Wolf 
et al., 2010). The test consists of  15 timed  tasks and 2 strength tasks  that are 
administered  sequentially to each upper extremity  (17 items total). Q uality of  movement 
is recorded using a 6 -point functional  ability scale (0 = does not attempt; 5 = normal 
movement). The maxi mum score is 75. Strength  (as measured by a dynamometer)  and 
performance time are recorded by [CONTACT_860725] ; each of the [ADDRESS_1199779]  Scale (SIS)  [Health -Related Quality of Life ]:  The SIS has been 
developed to assess eight different  domains of health related quality of life , such as 
emotion, communication, memory , and thinking, and s ocial role function. Each item is 
rated on a 5-point Likert scale in terms of the d ifficulty the person has experie nced in 
completing each item. Scores for each domain  range from 0 -100 (Duncan , 1999) .    
 
D - Stroke Specific QOL (SS -QOL) : The SS -QOL is a self -report questionnaire 
consisting of 49 items in th e 12 domains of energy, family roles, language, mobility, 
mood, personality, self -care, social roles, thinking, upper extremity (UE) function, vision, 
and work/productivity.   
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 31 E – 5Q-5D QOL (general QOL)  – EQ-5D™ is a standardized  instrument for use as a 
general measure of health outcome.  It  provides a simple descriptive profile and a single 
index value for health status.  
 
F - Motor Activity Log (MAL)  - The MAL consists of 14 activities of daily living (ADLs) 
such as using a towel, brushing teeth, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_860694] a glass. For a specified time 
period post -stroke, the individual is asked about the extent of the activity performed and 
how well it was performed by [CONTACT_860726]. The response scale ranges from 0 
(never used) to 5 (same as pre -stroke).  
 
 
10.3 Study Population  
 
The study plan includes a  goal of up to 120 subjects enrolled and implanted , such that 
approximately  100 subjects complete the study.  This allows approximately 50 subjects 
for each group (VNS or Control)  and allows for up to [ADDRESS_1199780] s. 
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, standards of 
Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP) in Europe and EN ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Clinical 
Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects).  This study is intended to provid e 
data for a PMA application.  
 
Since this study will use experienced stroke Investigator s and will randomize subjects 
such that a comparison can be made between treatment and control, this is a 
scientifically sound study.  MicroTransponder has named the va gus nerve stimulation 
(VNS) device, for improved upper limb motor function after stroke, the Vivistim System®. 
 
10.4 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI)  
 
MRI Imaging  
As appropriate, study subjects will undergo MRI imaging prior to implantation .  Subjects 
who meet entry criteria but who are excluded from MRI imaging for medical reasons 
may still continue in the study.  The MRI scan will involve a standardized protocol , which 
includes T1 - and T2 -weighted imaging, diffusion -weighted imaging, susceptibility -
weight ed imaging , and arterial spin labeling.  Corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_860695] (DTI).  
 
T1- and T2 -weighted imaging provides a structural template to assist with post 
processing. In addition, T2 -weighted imaging will highlight regions of old stroke. 
Diffusion -weighted imaging allows identification of  areas of recent stroke. Susceptibility - 
weighted imaging will be performed to identify regions of intra -cerebral hemorrhage. In 
Mar [ADDRESS_1199781] (Nouri and Cramer, Neurology, 
2011 ). 
 
It is possible the MRI scans may reveal findings that were not detected or present on 
previous imaging. This c ould lead to a change in subject management. The most likely 
finding will be an area of cerebral ischemia , but in theory, incidental findings on brain 
scans can include disorders such as brain tumor. In the event of any abnormal 
observations  that require a  change in subject management, the clinical team will 
schedule an appointment in the cerebrovascular clinic for these participants and will 
implement appropriate management.  
 
10.5 Detailed Study Process  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_534320] a controlled  study of approxim ately five months  acute duration, with 
designated follow -up through one -year of VNS use  and ongoing annual follow -up 
thereafter , comprising:  
a) A screening (V1) and pre-implant assessment period during which a detailed 
stroke history (including type, location , onset, neurologic evaluation, etc.) is 
obtained, inclusion/exclusi on criteria are assessed, and structural brain MRI 
(including white matter tract imaging using Diffusion Tensor Imaging) is 
performed . Consented subjects have their symptoms confirmed at a  second 
assessment ( V2), which occurs approximately 2 weeks after consent ; V2 may 
occur up to 6 weeks  before surgery to allow for surgical scheduling . 
b) Randomization of all continuing subjects will occur at surgical implantation (V3) 
of the MicroTransponder  IPG and lead.  Implant subjects have an approximate 
one-week recovery  period , after which  all assessments will  again be performed 
(per Study Timeline and Procedures, above ) prior to treatment initiation ( V4, 
pre-therapy baseline ) for all subjects .  Implan ted subjects are fully enrolled.    
See Section [ADDRESS_1199782]; they will treat 
the device and subject s the same for both groups.  Both groups will receive 5 
VNS stimulations in reducing strengths (0.8 mA and then lower)  at the start of 
each rehabilitation  session on push -button  activation .  Then the device will 
allow push -button  stimulation at 0 mA for the active -control group (no 
stimulation) a nd at 0.8 mA for the VNS treatment group.  The  software 
automates  this process .   
c) The exact length of each rehabilitation session will vary, although the typi[INVESTIGATOR_860696] 90 minutes to 2 hours, excluding stretching 
(subject s will typ ically do 10 minutes of stretching prior to rehabilitation) and 
Mar [ADDRESS_1199783] VNS during the acute stage . 
d) Subject s come to the site  approximately [ADDRESS_1199784] of tasks specified 
in the Tasks section below (10.6) and in Appendix 1.  Task difficulty may 
change, and tasks may vary over the study duration, as appropriate and based 
on subject pr ogress . 
e) During the first week of in -office rehabilitation all subject s will be seen by a 
study Investigator  to verify that study therapy is tolerable . 
f) Assessments are performed at consent (V1), prior to implant ( V2), after surgery 
but before therapy initiation (pre -therapy baseline  - V4), and after 6  weeks of 
study treatment (Days 1 (V5), 30 (V6), and 90 (V7)  after treatment) , according 
to the schedule in the Timeline and Procedures Section above . V5 should be 
performed the day after the 18th therapy session, but it can extend up to the 
third day  after concluding therapy  for scheduling purposes ; however , the 
Sponsor must approve any extension prior to the visit.  V6 should be performed 
[ADDRESS_1199785] day 
after the end of acute study therapy .  V7 should be performed 90 days after 
therapy, but it may be performed between the 80th and 100th day after the end 
of acute study therapy.  
g) After the [ADDRESS_1199786] s ubjects approximately every two 
week s, via text message , email , or phone call  (depending on subject  
preference)  to remind them to perform their at -home therapy  and to check on 
their progress .  
h) During the 90-day period after the 6  weeks of rehabilitat ion and therapy, when 
the Day 1, Day 30, and Day 90  assessments are performed  (V5, V6 & V7 ), 
subjects will not receive in -clinic rehabilitation , but are given a magnet to swipe  
just prior to performing their in-home rehabilitation  for [ADDRESS_1199787] s.  However the magnet does allow the device to track use 
and can therefore be used to assess at -home rehabilitation for both groups as 
well as provide VNS for the VNS group.  
i) Between  the [ADDRESS_1199788]-therapy assessment visit ( V6) and the [ADDRESS_1199789] 
therapy visit (V7) , all implanted subjects will be scheduled for their ongoing 
follow -up (control group crossover or ongoing quarterly follow -up for the VNS 
group) .  Stage II starts after V7.  All origin al VNS group subject s continue at-
home rehabilitation and home -initiated stimulation for 30 minutes daily.  After 
V7 assessments (which establish a new comparison period – a new baseline), 
all original Control group subjects start a [ADDRESS_1199790].   
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 34 j) It will be the Investigator ’s and subject’s decision to continue treatment during 
the unblinded  follow -up stage  (Stage  II).  Although unlikely , some individuals 
may decide to have the device explanted at V7; some may keep the implant 
but not receive further therapy; and some will keep the device and have other 
VNS + rehabilitation sessions during the unblinded continuation stage  and then 
on into  long-term follow -up (Stage  III, after one year of VNS) .  The intent is that 
all subjects will be followed through at least [ADDRESS_1199791]-acute study  
(LT6) , and hopefully longer.  Different stimulation settings may be tried during 
the long -term therapy , especially in non -responders  (those with less than a 6-
point FMA -UE change) .  Study guidelines  allow subjects  to continue at -home 
stimulation for [ADDRESS_1199792] two more in-clinic rehabilitation sessions with 
VNS for one week  (“booster sessions”) , approximately one month prior to the 
6-, and [ADDRESS_1199793] their device systems explanted.  
 
This study intends to deliver VNS during upper extremity rehabilitation;  subjects  will be 
in a doctor’s office, research laboratory, outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or rehabilitation clinic 
setting for their initial therapy, but will be allowed to initiate 30 minutes of d aily 
stimulation during at -home rehabilitation  after their 6 -week in -clinic therapy ends .  The 
Investigator s in this trial will be experienced in the treatment, diagnosis , and movement 
rehabilitation of stroke.  The study will enroll and implant up to 120 individuals such that 
approximately  100 subjects  complete the acute study (V 7), with 50 subjects receiv ing 
acute device treatment (VNS + rehabilitation) and 50 will receiv ing active -Control 
(rehabilitation with Control VNS ).  After V7, subjects enter Stage  II (long -term 
treatment) , and all continuing subjects receive VNS plus rehabilitation  through one -year 
of VNS Therapy .  Subjects who wish to continue to receive VNS thereafter must have at 
least annual follow -up visits . 
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1199794] stroke.   Information on the rehabilitation tasks follows.    
 
a) The tasks are standardized  so that all subjects will perform  similar tasks for the 
study.  However, each task may be modified as appropriate to the subject ’s 
abilities and functional preferences  (graded in difficulty) .  The tasks include  
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 35 “Reach and Grasp Objects ,” “Gross Movement Task ,” “Flip Objects ,” “Eating ,” 
“Insert Objects into Wells,” and “ Open and Close a Bottle or Jar.” 
b) For each therapy session, th e therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860697] a list of tasks within the software (Appendix 1), and the subject will perform 
repetitions of the selected tasks during a [ADDRESS_1199795] number of repetitions and tasks per session will vary.  
However , it is expected that 7 tasks will typi[INVESTIGATOR_860698]  50 repetitions will be performed on each task.  Tasks can 
be modified over the duration of the study (such as upgraded in difficulty as the 
subject  improves, or modi fying the positioning or angle of objects to keep the 
subjects  interest). Selection of any new tasks and progression of tasks will be 
discussed with the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_860699].  
c) For a given task with in each session (e.g., “Reach and Grasp an Object” ), the 
object and/or environment factors may be adapted  in order to maintain difficulty 
and subject interest. Study personnel may determine that a task requires 
modification  (changing  to an easier or harder  task or changing objects or 
environment). Although the task types will be standardized across all subjects as 
mentioned above (e.g., “Reach and Grasp ,” “Flip Objects,”  etc), it is not possible 
to have a “formula” or a rigorous protocol since each subject and specific 
instance is different.   After each session , the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860700] a Case Report Form (CRF) designed specifically for this 
purpose.   
d) In consultation with MicroTransponder, sites may add one or two subject -specific  
tasks (e.g., practice fishing or practice pi[INVESTIGATOR_582277]) as part of therapy.  
 
 
10.7 Randomization and Blinding  
 
Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized  at implant surgery to either the device treatment 
(rehabilitation and VNS) or control (rehabilitation  and Control VNS ) groups .  An approved, 
unblinded person at each site accesses the subject’s group assignment  via a n electronic 
(web -based) system . 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_860727] -UE score  and age , such that relatively equal 
numbers of subjects with scores at 35 or below (20 -35) versus above 36 (36 -50), and age 
[ADDRESS_1199796] their therapy given 
at the lower tolerated level (for example 0.6 mA), although they can be assessed 
throughout the study to see if the output current can be increased to 0.[ADDRESS_1199797] their perception tested at increasing levels in 0.1 mA 
steps , up to a maximum of 3.5 mA ; this process helps confirm that the device is working 
correctly by [CONTACT_860728] .  Subject s who only 
perceive currents above 0.[ADDRESS_1199798] study settings are below their perception level .  The higher level (above 0.8 mA) 
will not be used dur ing the rehabilitation therapy during the randomized study.  
At each visit, subjects in both groups will receive stimulation via a push -button  press for 
their first 4 rehabilitation movements (4 stimulations) , starting at 0.8 mA and reducing in 
0.2 mA steps  (depending on perception) , such that subjects barely perceive or do not 
perceive the fourth stimulation.   This is done to help facilitate blinding.  
Thereafter, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860701] a push -button  to initiate stimulation for both 
groups throughou t the therapy sessions; however, only the VNS group  receives 
stimulation .  All subject s will be told that they may or may not feel the stimulation during 
therapy  - only about one half of the [LOCATION_006] pi[INVESTIGATOR_860702] 0.8 mA and 
only about  25% of the subjects in the US IDE  study felt 0.[ADDRESS_1199799] s in both groups will be told that they may initially feel the stimulation , but that it is 
possible that they may acclimate  to the stimulation  (as also occurred in the [LOCATION_006] study  and 
occurs in epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ).  These efforts , along with the fact that all subjects will receive the 
same type of rehabilitation and be treated similarly,  will help to maintain the blind.    
Assessments are performed by a blinded assessor who does not pe rform therapy on the 
same  subject . A blinded assessor  may perform therapy on some subject s and perform 
assessment s on other subject s, but should not perform assessments and therapy on the 
same subject .  Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform t he V4, V5, V6  
and V7  assessments for a single subject .  Sponsor approval is necessary if a different 
assessor will be used for the same subject  at V4 and V5.  This separates treatment from 
assessment and reduces the possibility of an assessor guessing info rmation on group 
assignment (based on adverse event or subject  comment).  
Subjects will be asked at V5, the primary endpoint time , if they believe they know to 
which group the subject was assigned, and if so, to guess the group.  In this way , the 
study blin ding will be assessed.  
 
10.8 VNS Timing  
 
VNS will be delivered duri ng the rehabilitation sessions, throughout the session , at 1/[ADDRESS_1199800] activates stimulation by [CONTACT_2329]  a push -button .  
The push -button (and VNS)  is expec ted to be activated every [ADDRESS_1199801] videotape t he main comparison assessment time  points – V4, V 5, and V7  - for 
all subjects .  Assessments may be videotaped at other time points (V1, V2, and long -
term).  Additionally, at least the first week of therapy rehabilitation will also be videotaped.  
This will allow the PI [INVESTIGATOR_860703], tasks, difficulty, etc.  for 
impact on future studies and for device/software modifications . 
  
10.[ADDRESS_1199802] been educated on 
initiating stimulation at  home ; during this part of the stud y, the original Control group 
subjects will have their magnet activated .  Original VNS group subjects will continue  
their at-home use.  
 
Subjects will receive appropriate training at the site before rec eiving their magnet s.  
When subjects return at subsequent rehabilitation visits during  this unblinded one -year 
follow -up, the site will verify that the subject is delivering stimulation appropriately.  This 
is done (through subject query  and acquisition of  the device settings and history files, 
which are stored in the subject’s IPG device and accessed by [CONTACT_860729] -up visits.    
If additional educational sessions are necessary, site personnel will document them .   
 
After the [ADDRESS_1199803] s (LT1 during unblinded follow -up), the 
following options  may be considered for  subject s who are responding : (Note: Response 
is defined as a 6-point or greater FMA -UE change .) 
 
a) Responders may c ontinue at -home , 30-minute rehabilitation sessions  (as 
directed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541], which may include use during activities such as 
cooking, gardening, etc.) with stimulation , but reduce the frequency  of at-home 
use ( e.g., every  other day, etc.) .   
b) Subjects may return for a “booster” week of therapy , at one month prior to their [ADDRESS_1199804] s typi[INVESTIGATOR_860704] a 
Monday, Wed nesda y, and Friday in -clinic session of approximately 90  minutes; 
however , some leeway is allowed for scheduling purposes such that up to 3 days 
are allowed between sessions over a period  not to exceed 10 days ). 
 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 38 Non-responders (subjects with less than a 6-point FMA -UE improvement , compared to 
pre-therapy baseline) who wish to continue ongoing stimulation may have modified 
stimulation settings and /or modified frequency of stimulation  (for example, they may try 
a higher output current, such  as 1.2 mA) .  They may also continue at -home 
rehabilitation , with up to four 30 -minute sessions per day permitted .  Additionally, these 
sessions may be conducted  at modified stimulation settings.  A sequence of stimulation 
setting modifications will be pro vided to the sites as a guide.  
 
In order to minimize any risk associated with “over -stimulation ,” the device has a 
feature that allows only 4 hours of total stimulation per day , which translates to eight 
magnet swipes .  Additionally, the device  does not al low stimulation at on/off cycles 
of greater than 50% .  Therefore th e OFF time must be equal or greater than the ON 
time (e.g., if the device ON time is [ADDRESS_1199805] be 1 second or 
greater ).  Finally , the stimulation frequency is limited to [ADDRESS_1199806]  would be 4  hours of stimulation at 30 Hz 
and a 50% or less duty cycle .  The acute study limits at -home use to 30 minutes per 
day.  This is well within the safe limits indicated by [CONTACT_860730] 
(Agnew , 1989).  Site personnel will verify t he subject’s stimulation at return visits 
through use of the programming software.  As a safety precaution, subjects are 
instructed not to eat while performing rehabilitation tasks at home . 
 
Although it is preferred that only stimulation - or device -related changes be made, 
during the long -term portion of the study, site personnel may initiate other changes 
(e.g., medication, etc.) after the first 6  weeks of VNS treatment and 90-day 
assessme nt follow -up (after V 7). 
 
After one year of VNS Therapy ( LT6, 13.5 months after implant for the VNS group 
and 18 months after implant for the Control group), continuing subject s will have  
longer term follow -up.  Subjects who do not wish to continue VNS use  will be 
explanted.  Subjects who wish to continue VNS use will have annual follow -up.  In 
order to keep the implant and continue VNS use subjects must agree to the annual 
visits.  This study will end after commercial approval is received.  Subjects can th en 
continue VNS under commercial follow -up. 
 
11.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
11.1 Safety Introduction  
 
The site study Investigator s, Sponsor Physician (Navzer Engineer, MD, Ph.D.), and Study 
Director (Brent Tarver) will review all adverse events, device complic ations, and 
unanticipated adverse device effects and take appropriate action  (including study 
termination, if necessary).  An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be 
established to review adverse events and safety information, and will desc ribe and 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 39 compare these events relative to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_860705].   The review of events will be immediate for any unusual or unexpected 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and at least yearly for all other events.  The DSMB will be 
comprised of at least three members, including one surgeon with significant VNS surgery 
experience, one physician with significant VNS therapy experience, and one physician 
with significant stroke experience.  The DSMB  will also consider and recommend 
suspension or termination of the study to the Sponsor .  Any recommendation for 
suspension or termination of the study will be communicated to both the FDA and the 
study Site Investigator s and IRBs.  
 
Adverse events are expected to be minimal a nd somewhat similar to those seen during 
vagus nerve stimulation when used for epi[INVESTIGATOR_5605].  However , the treatment 
in this study is for a much shorter total duration ( approximately 12 minutes over a 120 
minute session  vs. 24 hours per day), a shorter stimulation cycle (1/2 second vs. 30 
seconds), at a low er magnitude (0.8 mA vs. typi[INVESTIGATOR_860706] 1.5 mA or greater), 
and at shorter pulse widths (100 µSec  vs. 250 or 500 µSec , typi[INVESTIGATOR_183812]).  If necessary, when 
events are reported, the site may modify device settings or frequency of delivery to 
accommodate subject tolerance.  
 
Adverse events reported during the study will be listed, documenting course, severity, 
and possible relationship to the study.  All unanticipated serious adverse device effects 
will be documented and reported to MicroTransponder and all applicable regulatory 
authorities.  
 
Since this is a relatively new device, no significant long -term experience with device 
longevity or malfunctions is available , other than from the previ ous two pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] ([ADDRESS_1199807] s implanted) .  Although malfunctions are not expected, malfunctions occur 
with devices and are possible during this study.  All device malfunctions , with the lead, 
the IPG, or both , will be evaluated.  Any serious inj uries and/or deaths occurring during 
the procedure will also be evaluated to determine if the device system might have 
malfunctioned.  The evaluation will be done by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Engineer in conjunction with [CONTACT_860747] 
and then reviewed by [CONTACT_779] ’s Investigator s and DSMB . 
 
The primary safety analysis will assess the occurrence of serious adverse events through 
the 6 -week randomized portion (through V5).  A serious adverse event is defined as a (1) 
death ; (2) medical morbidity, including myocardial infarction, pneu monia, wound infection, 
or deep venous thrombosis ; (3) decrement in neurological status ; and (4) any significant 
increase in stroke  severity  as determined by [CONTACT_737] .  The Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI)  will be collected prior to implant  and end -of-acute study to assess any 
changes in depression.  Vagus nerve stimulation can modify depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_860707]; similar to other depression therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], mania has been reported 
rarely, especially in those with bipolar disorder.  
 
11.1.1  Adverse Events  
 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 40 Each Investigator has the responsibility for the safety of the Subjects under his/her care. 
For purposes of understanding data and relevant confounders, assessment of clinical 
outcomes and/or SAEs possibly related or pr obably related to  the condition or 
complications thereof will be recorded.   
An Adverse  Event  (AE) is any untoward  medical  occurrence,  unintended  disease  or 
injury,  or untoward  clinical  signs  (including abnormal  laboratory  findings)  in subjects,  
users  or other  persons,  whet her or not related to  the investigational  medical  device  (ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011  3.2). 
 This definition includes  events  related to  the investigational  medical  device  or the 
comparator.  
 This definition includes  events  related to  the procedures  involved implanting th e 
device but not those inherent to general surgery such as anesthesia related events , 
IV infiltrate  issues, or pain, bruising, swelling, scar recovery issues associated with 
surgical scars.  
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to study parti cipati on are not considered 
AEs unless the condition recurs after the subject has recovered from  a pre-existing 
condition or the  condition worsens in intensity or frequency during the study.  
 
Collection of adverse events will start after the time of implant.  
 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Screen failed subjects (i.e. 
those who have signed consent and have been excluded from implant surgery ) will be  
followed for [ADDRESS_1199808] 
obtai n all inf ormation available to determine  the causality and outcome of the AE and to 
assess whether it meets the criteria for cla ssification  as a serious adverse event 
requiring immediate notification t o the Sponsor or its designated  representative. All 
reported AEs will be documented on the appropriate eCRF and will include the  event  
description (sign, symptom, or diagnosis), onset, resolution, s eriousness, severity, 
cause and  action taken. The Investigator must assess causality and severity for all AEs.  
All AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_422208] [ADDRESS_1199809] (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical 
device.  (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.1)  
 This definiti on includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate  
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or o peration, or any 
malfunction of  the investigational medical device.  
 This definition also includes any event from use erro r or from intentional misuse of 
the investigational medical device (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.1) . 
 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 41  
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
 
An SAE is an AE that:  
• Led to death,  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in  
o a life -threatening ill ness or injury, or  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
o in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent life -threatening 
illness or  injury or permanent impairment to a body stru cture or a body 
function.  
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Note: Examples of such medical events include but are not li mited to: allergic 
bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an ED or at home, blood dyscr asia or 
convulsions that do not  result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependen cy or drug abuse (ISO  [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.37) . 
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an adverse device effect that has resulte d in 
any of the  consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 
3.36).  
 
Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An anticipated serious  adverse  device  effect  (ASADE)  is an effect  which by  [CONTACT_5942],  
incidence,  severity or outcome  has been identified in  the risk analysis  report  (ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011  3.42).  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1199810] (UADE) means any seri ous adverse effect on 
health or  safety or any life -threatening problem or death ca used by, or ass ociated with, 
a device, if that  effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence  in the study protocol or application (including a 
supplementary pla n or application), or any other  unanticipa ted serious problem 
associated with a device that re lates to the rights, safety, or  welfare of Subjects. (21 
CFR 812.3 (s))  Similarly, according to ISO [ZIP_CODE] :2011, an unanticipated serious 
adverse device ef fect ([LOCATION_003]DE) is  a serious adverse effect which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, s everity or outcome has not been  identified in the current version of the risk 
analysis report (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.42).  
Mar [ADDRESS_1199811] (IRB) , within 10 days of awareness or per the site’s reporting 
requirements , whichever is sooner . 
The Sponsor is responsible for providing SAE, UADE, and SUADE information to the 
DSMB for review, comment, and recommendation, as well as to the FDA per IDE 
regulations.  
All device malfunctions will be evaluated.  Any serious injuries and/or deaths occurring 
during the  procedure will also be evaluated to determine if the device system might 
have malfunctioned.  [CONTACT_860748] , in conjunction with [CONTACT_860747] and other 
MicroTransponder engineering personnel , will perform the evaluation, with 
subsequent review by [CONTACT_860731].  
11.1.4 Severity & Relationship  
Event Severity  
The severity of an adverse event is a qualitative judgment of the degree of intensity, as  
determined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_860708]. The severity of 
the adverse  event sho uld be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild: No limitation of usual activities, no therapy or only symptomatic therapy 
required to treat the injury or illness.  
• Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities or specific therapy is required.  
• Sever e: Inability to carry out usual activities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency 
treatment, life  threatening events, or death.  
The assessment of severity should be made independent of the rela tionship to the 
investigational  device and therapy or the seriousness of t he event.  
 
 
Event Relationship  
The Investigator will categorize the relationship of the adverse event as follows:  
• Study Disease -related: Event is clearly attributable to underlying disease state 
with no temporal relationship to the device or device treatme nt. 
• Concomitant Disease -related: Event is attributable to disease other than the 
study disease with no temporal relationship to the device or device treatment.  
• Procedure -related: Event has a strong temporal relationship to the procedure or 
treatment of the  device implantation or any user handling.  
• Device -related: Event has a strong temporal relationship to the device and 
alternative  etiology is less likely.  
 Primary : Related to the device treatment  
 Device  Unknown:  Device -related but  unable  to attribute  a specific device  
relationship.  
 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 43 11.1.5 Reporting  
The following adverse events will be collected during the course of the study on the 
eCRFs.  
• All adverse events (AE) with an underlying neurological cause (Neurological Adverse 
Events)  
• All device related adverse events  
• All procedure related adverse events  
• All serious adverse events (SAE’s)  
Adverse event status will be evaluated throughout the study. These will include new 
events occurring  after the point of implant in the study until a subject exits the st udy. 
Investigators must  obtain all information available to determine the causality and 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether  it meets the criteria for classification as a 
serious and/or unexpected event requiring notification to the  Sponsor, regulatory 
agency, and as applicable, IRB, within the specified reporting timeframe . 
 
 
11.1.6 Device Malfunction/Failure/Deficiency  
 
Device deficiency is the inadequacy of a medical device with re spect to its identity, 
quality,  durability, reliability, safety or perf ormance (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.15) . 
Note: Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Device malfunction means the failure of an investigation al medical device to perform in 
accordance with its intended purpose when used in ac cordance w ith the Instructions 
For Use or  Clinical Investigational Plan (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.27).  
 
Device malfunction may or may not result in the subject experienci ng harmful effect. All 
AEs/SAEs  associated with a device failure are by [CONTACT_75695] -related. Device 
malfunction/failure will  be tabulated and reported overall.  
 
 
 
11.2 Possible Adverse Events  
 
11.2.1 Possible Adverse Events Related to the Surgery   
 
General surgery -related events:  
 
 Side effects from the anesthesia  
 Blood clot 
 Inflammation (swe lling)  
 Formation of cysts   
 Infection  (minor, no explant)  
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 44  Local pain after the operation  (including incision pain)  
 Nausea /vomiting  
 Edema  
 Paresthesia (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_860709])  
 Hematoma (clot in tissue)  
 Formation of scar tissue  
 Histotoxicological reaction  
 Irritation  of the skin  
 Tissue reaction   
 
VNS surgery - or implant -specific events:  
 
 Nerve damage (which may lead to hoarseness, pain, facial weakness, swallowing 
difficulties, and other effects)  
 Infection leading to IV antibiotics or device explant  
 Numbed facial sens ation  
 Facial paralys is 
 Hoarseness /vocal cord paresis/paralysis (due to surgery)  
 
Although very uncommon, bradycardia (slowing of the heart  rate) has been reported 
during the first stimulation trials during surgery; this effect has not continued after 
surge ry.  Some of the above events may require device explants (such as infection or 
nerve damage); to continue in the study, a new device and additional surgery would be 
required.  
 
11.2.2 Possible Adverse Events Related to the Stimulation  
 
 Diarrhea  
 Dyspepsia ( indigestion)  
 Dysphagia (swallowing problems)  
 Dyspnea (problems with breathing)  
 Ear ache  
 Hoarseness (due to stimulation)  
 Hiccup  
 Cough  
 Laryngospasm  
 Muscle twitching during stimulation  
 Nausea and vomiting  
 Pain (especially in the throat or neck)  
 Paresthesia ( numbness or tingling sensation of the skin)  
 Pharyngitis (infection of the throat)  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_860710])  
Mar [ADDRESS_1199812] of the above events are associated with hig her levels of stimulation from VNS 
studies of epi[INVESTIGATOR_5605], rather than settings used for paired VNS for stroke.  
Nevertheless, they are possible events.   
 
Stimulation can change heart rate variability ; however , clinically relevant cardiac effe cts 
have not been seen when studied .  Additionally, although not shown to be definitely 
related to stimulation, a small number of subject s have reported cardiac abnormalities 
after stimulation has started.    
 
Although intended as a treatment for improving upper limb movement after stroke, and 
although significant worsening of symptoms is not expected and has not been reported, 
it is at least theoretically possible that treatment could worsen symptoms.  Any of the  
events discussed could be temporary or perma nent.  Additionally, if benefit has been 
received from therapy, this benefit could diminish or cease  if the device malfunctions  or 
stops altogether . 
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1199813] already had a stroke prior to study  entry, a recurrence of stroke is 
not unexpected and will be handled as a serious adverse event (SAE) during the study.   
If the recurrence  occurs during the acute study while VNS Therapy is being delivered, 
the subject will discontinue therapy for at least  the period directly after the stroke and 
during acute stroke recovery.  The subject will then be assessed for continuation of VNS 
and rehabilitation therapy by [CONTACT_860732].  If the recurrence manifests 
during the acute study while VNS therap y is not being delivered, the subject will be 
assessed for starting VNS and rehabilitation therapy by [CONTACT_860733] .  In either instance, no further acute study data will be utilized  for 
analysis purposes ; any appropriate available  data will be utilized under a last -visit-
carried -forward observation.  If the recurrence occurs during the long -term portion of the 
study, VNS Therapy will be discontinued during the stroke recovery phase; subject 
continuation and VNS Therapy re -initiation  will be assessed by [CONTACT_860734] a case -by-case basis.    
 
Additionally, due to the general condition (after stroke)  of subjects’ health , older age, 
and length of study, it would not be unexpected for  a few subjects  to die du ring the 
study.  The DSMB will review each occurrence and determine any and all appropriate 
actions.  
 
Any effects due to stroke  or stroke rehabilitation therapy , such as fatigue, muscle 
weakness, etc. , may also occur during the study  and will be documented .  The study 
site will document these effects as they arise.  
 
Mar [ADDRESS_1199814] improvements in function.  This therapy (VNS) 
gives  post-stroke individuals  with upper limb deficits a chance at more significant 
improvement . 
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a well -documented surgical procedure and therapy, 
with known and well -docum ented risks and side effects , which  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_14105].  The use 
of experienced surgeons familiar with VNS surgery or familiar with neck surgery will help 
minimize surgical risks.  Stimulat ion-related  risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_860735][INVESTIGATOR_5605], for significantly shorter periods of 
time (at most 2 hours per day for stroke vs. 24 hours per day for epi[INVESTIGATOR_5605] ).  
Also, risks will minimized by [CONTACT_860736] , such as 
excluding subjects who are poor surgical risks, who have dysphagia, who are t oo young 
(<22) or too old (>80) , who have other disorders or who are taking medications that might 
interfere with treatment.  
Additionally, this study is not the first use of this therapy ; in fact,  more than [ADDRESS_1199815] ing to verify proper operation.  The 
proposed  study will limit the use of VNS in the target  population (subjects with stroke) to 
a maximum of [ADDRESS_1199816]’s ongoing condition.   Additionall y, these subjects  will have the possible risks and 
safety profile explained in an appropriate informed consent procedure.  
The possible benefit of the system will be an improvement in upper extremity function 
over and above benefits associated with standard  rehabilitation.  Because stroke deficits 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_860711], this therapy and its 
assessments will continue for as long as the device is implanted through commercial 
(PMA) approval . 
Because the risks assoc iated with VNS surgery and therapy are well -described and are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_860712], because the study stimulation 
regimen is at lower settings and for less time than the commercially -approved therapy, 
and because the st udy population has been appropriately set via inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, the potential benefit of having fewer upper extremity deficits and being able to do 
more everyday tasks outweighs the potential risks.  Therefore, use of the device system 
in this population is justified; the risk -to-benefit assessment of this therapy is at an 
appropriate level , and it is appropriate for this  study to proceed.  
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 47  
12.0 STUDY DESIGN AND END POINTS  
 
12.1 Short  Description of Study Design  
 
This is a blinded, randomized, co ntrolled, two -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  After consent  and 
assessments , all continuing subjects are implanted (enrolled) and randomized to either 
VNS or Control.  Subject s in both groups will receive standard rehabilitation . VNS 
subjects will receive believed -therapeutic VNS , while Control subjects will receive 
Control VNS  (approximately 1% of the number of stimulations received by [CONTACT_860737]).  Up to 120 subjects will be recruit ed, enrolled, and implanted , such that 100 
subjects will complete the randomized po rtion of the study , with 50 subjects per group .  
 
The main outcome measure is the Fugl -Meyer  Assessment ( Upper Extremity ), or FMA-
UE.  The primary outcome will compare the change between groups in FM A-UE scores 
after treatment ( V5) compared to pre -treatmen t (V4).  The secondary outcomes will be 
FMA -UE change at V7 (90 days after therapy ends), FMA -UE response ( subject s with a 
6 point or greater change)  at V5 , and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) functional 
improvement at V5.  Tertiary analyses will assess re peated measures between groups  
(FMA -UE, WMFT FA, WMFT time) and more fully assess WMFT, SIS, SS -QOL, EQ -5D.  
Changes in SIS, SS -QOL, and EQ -5D are not expected until after several months of 
treatment.  
 
 
12.2 Study Endpoints  
 
Safety Endpoints  
Adverse events  (serious and non -serious) will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_860738].  Events will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_860713]; events will be compared with respect to those observed in VNS Therapy 
for epi[INVESTIGATOR_5605].  
 
Functional  Endpoints  
The efficacy objective of the study is to determine whether VNS during rehabilitation is 
effective in  improving motor recovery and function in the more involved upper extremity 
in persons post stroke (improvement in so me measure(s)) .  Site personnel record t est 
results from assessments upon  entry ( V1), once prior to implant ( V2), after implant 
surgery but before treatment ( V4), and  as part of  one-day ( V5), thirty -day ( V6), and 
ninety -day (V7)  post-treatment follow -up ev aluations.  Specific assessments will be 
performed according to the schedule shown above .  Changes during and after therapy 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 48 will use V4 as the main comparison timepoint; a comparison between the VNS Therapy 
group ( Treatment) and rehabilitation -only group ( Control) will also be made .  A 
comparison will also be made for the control group after switching to VNS (during the 
long-term stage ).  The change in FMA -UE at V5 compared to V4 will be the primary 
outcome measure.  
 
Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_47554] t using the following assessments:  
 
 Fugl-Meyer Assessment  (Upper Extremity)  (Fugl -Meyer et al., 1975)  
 Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT ) (Wolf et al. , 2006 )  
 
Quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_562928] (SIS) , Stroke Specific Quality 
of Life (SS-QOL), and the EQ-5D (general QOL).   
 
Clinicians at each site will be appropriately trained in all test measures prior to study 
commencement.  
 
 
13.0 CLINICAL MONITORING  
  
The Clinical Monitor(s) assigned to the study will fulfill all required Sponsor and Monitor  
responsibilities. Monitors will be responsible for ensuring that sites maintain  up to date  
device accountability log s and subject Case Report Forms and assuring that the 
Investigational Plan has been approved by [CONTACT_860739] , and that sites 
adhere  to the Investigational Plan as approved . 
Regular clinical monitoring vi sits will be conducted by [CONTACT_860740] , 
designated consultants,  and/or by a CRO . 
To ensure that Investigator s and their staff understand and accept their def ined 
responsibilities, the Clinical Monitor will maintain regular correspondence and perform 
periodic site visits during the course of the study to verify :  
 continued acceptability of the facilities,  
 compliance with the Investigational Plan,  
 integrity  of collected data ,  
 detailed complete documentation and reporting of any adverse events and 
unanticipated adverse device effects, and  
 maintenance of complete records.  
Clinical monitoring will include review of the Case Report Forms , and resolution of 
missi ng or inconsistent results , and source document checks (i.e., comparison of 
submitted study results to original reports) to assure the accuracy of the reported data.  
Mar [ADDRESS_1199817] and monitoring of the clinical investigation will be in 
accordance with Micro Transponder’s inte rnal procedures. This includes obtaining and 
maintaining all required Investigator  and Ethics/IRB Committee  documentation, site 
visits and monitoring, control of device shipment and disposition, review and 
maintenance of Case Report Forms and investigation al files, compliance with reporting 
requirements , and monitoring of the Investigator s' adherence to the protocol.  
Standardized Case Report Forms will be provided for use at the investigational sites. 
Investigator s are responsible for completion and timely submission of the data to 
Micro Transponder for data processing.  
Quality assurance procedures are designed to ensure that complete, accurate , and 
timely data are submitted, that protocol requirements are followed, and that 
complications and adverse device e ffects are reported.   Missing data impacts trial 
integrity and credibility; sites will make significant attempts to ensure there is limited 
missing data for the trial.  
Incoming data are reviewed to identify inconsistent or missing data and adverse events . 
Data problems will be addressed in calls and/or emails to the investigational site and 
during site visits. All hard copy forms and data files will be secured to ensure 
confidentiality.  
Investigator s are to maintain Case Report Forms and all source document s as required 
by [CONTACT_760], including laboratory results, supporting medical records, Informed 
Consent forms , and applicable files. The source documents will be used at the regular 
monitoring visits to verify information submitted on the Case Report For ms. 
Monitors for this study are expected to be Reema Ca savant ( Micro Transponder , 2802 
Flint Rock Trace, #226 , Austin, TX  [ZIP_CODE] ), Lisa Jones ([ADDRESS_1199818]., Bellaire, 
[ZIP_CODE])  and Sue Lesly ([ADDRESS_1199819], Houston, TX [ZIP_CODE]).  
14.0 STATISTICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be completed prior to the last subject  
completing the randomized portion of the study.  The following information is a guideline 
developed prior to the first subject  enrollment.  
Sample Size  
Data fr om this pi[INVESTIGATOR_860714] a PMA Application and ultimately, US 
market clearance.  A sample  size of 100 subjects total (50 per group)  will have 80% power 
with 0.[ADDRESS_1199820] a difference of 2. 3 with SD= 4.[ADDRESS_1199821] over 95% power at 0.05 alpha to s how 
a difference in responders, assuming 75% response in the VNS group and 33% in the 
control group.   With respect to safety, a sample of at least [ADDRESS_1199822] s yields 95% probability that the study will reveal at least one 
occurrence of all events or complications that occur in subject s at a rate of 3 % or greater.   
In addition, implantation  and follow -up of [ADDRESS_1199823] -
days (600 weeks or over 11 years) of total exposure.   
A futility analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_489081] [ADDRESS_1199824] comparison between the two treatment groups be calculated to determine 
the futility index (1 – conditional power).   The study will be stopped if the futility index is 
greater than 0.90 (at approximately t< -1.25).   
 
Data Handling  
Data will be collected  using Case Report Forms designed specifically for this study. Each 
specific test (FMA -UE, etc.) will have a specific form or portion of a form designated to 
collect appropriate information.  Upon completion, data will be entered as it is obtained 
into a c entral database maintained by [CONTACT_860741] . 
Clinicians will record data on standardized, validated outcome variables and 
complications , should they occur. Subject confidentiality will be maintained , and each 
subject will be identified o nly by [CONTACT_860742]. Subject names will not be 
published.  
 
Analysis Populations  
All efficacy and safety summaries  will be performed on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
population , defined as all subject s who have any surgical portion of the implant procedure 
attempted, regardless of the treatment  to which  they are assigned.  In addition to the 
Intent -to-Treat population, efficacy analyses will be performed on a Per Protocol (PP)  
population  as defined  as subject s considered  to be compliant with treatment ( defined as 
completing at least two-thirds of  therapy sessions) and be  without major protocol 
violations that could impact and/or compromise the safety or efficacy of the treatment. 
Exclusion from the PP population will be finali zed prior to data base lock .   
All subjects who undergo surgery will be included in the safety population, with all adverse 
event and safety information reported.   
 
Study Endpoint s 
 
The Primary Efficacy endpoint is the Fugl-Meyer Assessment  (Upper Extremit y) (Fugl -
Meyer et al. , 1975) .    
Secondary efficacy and QOL endpoints include the following:   
 Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) Wolf et al. , 2006 )  
 Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) [Health -Related Quality of Life]  (Duncan, 1999).    
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 51  Stroke Specific QOL (SS -QOL)  
 5Q-5D QOL (general QOL) – EQ-5D™  
 Motor Activity Log (MAL)  
 
The safety endpoints to be summarized in this study include tabulations of adverse 
events and device complications.  Adverse events will be translated from investigator 
verbatim terms into a stand ard nomenclature using MedDRA.   BDI will also be 
assessed.  
 
Statistical  Analysis  
All data will be summarized by [CONTACT_198094], with means and 
SD for continuous data, and counts and % for categorical data.   Confidence interval s will 
also be provided for the efficacy endpoints.  All unscheduled assessments will be 
excluded from summary tables.  Data from unscheduled assessments will be displayed 
in listings.  
All data analyses and statistical testing will be  conducted using SAS V ersion 9.[ADDRESS_1199825], a significance level of α = 0.05  will be used . 
Analyses outside of this protocol may be perfo rmed to supplement results or for research 
purposes at the discretion of MicroTransponder .   
 
Efficacy  
The primary analysis will be based on the change in the FMA UE score from baseline 
(Visit 4 ) to Visit 5 (post therapy day 1) .    An analysis of variance model will be used, with 
the change from baseline as the dependent variable, and treatment and the 
randomization strata ( region, age and baseline FMA UE score) as factors.   The sample 
size for this study is based on an expected between group difference of 2.3 points in 
change from baseline.   Three secondary endpoints will be analyzed to determine 
treatment difference .   
 
Responder Analysis  at 90 -days (V7) (1st secondary analysis)  
A response, defined as a 6 -point or greater improvement in the FMA UE score from 
baseline (V4) to V [ADDRESS_1199826] (WMFT) Change at 90 -days (V7) Analysis ( 2nd secondary 
analysis)  
This analysis will be based on the change in the WMFT score from baselin e (Visit 4) to 
Visit 7 (post therapy day 90).    An analysis of variance model will be used, with the change 
from baseline as the dependent variable, and treatment and the randomization strata as 
factors.  
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 52  
UEFM Change at 90 -days (V7)  Analysis  (3rd secondary analy sis) 
This analysis will be based on the change in the FMA UE score from baseline (Visit 4) to 
Visit 7 (post therapy day 90).    An analysis of variance model will be used, with the change 
from baseline as the dependent variable, and treatment and the rando mization strata as 
factors.  
 
The three secondary endpoints will each be tested for significance with 0.05 Type I error 
(two sided) in a hierarchical manner in the order as listed above.  Significance will be 
declared fo r the first secondary endpoint at 0.05, and each subsequent endpoint only if 
all higher ranked endpoints were significant at 0.05.  
   
Safety  
The safety endpoints will be analyzed as specified below.  
a) Adverse events with an onset during the course of study, including during the surgical 
procedure , will be recorded and tabulated.  All adverse events will be tabulated, by 
[CONTACT_6764], first occurrence of the event, maximum severity, and strongest 
relationship to study treatment and implant surgery.  Results will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Fu rthermore, any adverse events considered serious and any 
adverse events resulting in discontinuation of stimulation or explantation of the device 
will be listed.  
b) Device complications will be tabulated in a manner similar to the adverse event 
summaries , with an emphasis on any UADE or SUADE.  
Long -Term Follow -Up 
Long -term analyses will also be performed.  Analyses comparing control after treatment 
can be compared to the group who started in treatment.  Additionally, maintenance of 
response, changes over time,  and after -treatment modification will also be assessed.   
 
Missing Data and Imputation  
For the analysis of study endpoints, a Last Observation Carried Forward approach will 
be used if an assessment is missing post -baseline.  
 
To evaluate the effect of miss ing data, as a sensitivity analysis, a Mixed Model 
Repeated Measures (SAS PROC MIXED) which will allow for missing data, will also be 
performed to evaluate the full data set.   Multiple imputation, with missing at random 
assumptions using SAS PROC MI will also be performed.   For the responder analysis, 
subjects with missing results will be imputed as non -responders.    
 
For the analysis of safety, sites will be contact[CONTACT_860743].   Ons et and resolution dates will not be 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 53 imputed.   For severity and relationship, if there is no other information available, 
relationship will be assessed as “possible ,” and severity will be assessed as “severe” for 
summary purposes, unless there is specific justification presented to impute other 
values.  
 
 
15.0 DEVIATIONS / AMENDME NTS / END OF TRIAL  
Investigator s will not deviate from the protocol without prior approval from the Sponsor , 
except in emergency situations.  All deviations to the protocol will be documented and 
reported in the final study report.  Any serious deviations that could possibly impact 
subject safety or study outcomes will be reported to the IRBs and FDA once they become 
known.   
Any planned protocol modifications will be submitted to th e FDA and will be sent to the 
site IRBs for implementation only after appropriate approval or notification has been 
received.  Typographical corrections or minor protocol corrections will not be submitted 
for approval, but will be notified to the IRBs at a ppropriate intervals or at the time a 
planned protocol modification is submitted.  
For the purposes of regulatory requirements , the end of the trial is defined as the date of 
the last investigational visit for the last subject  undergoing protocol treatment .  For the 
purposes of the acute study analysis, the end of the acute trial is when the last subject 
completes Visit 7 ([ADDRESS_1199827] rehabilitation visit) ; however, note that the main 
efficacy endpoint is at Visit 5 ([ADDRESS_1199828] rehabilitation vi sit). 
 
16.0 QA/QC/SOURCE DOCU MENTS  
Site personnel will utilize a n electronic case report form and database will be utilized for 
this study.  Data will be collected from standard source  documents  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinic/office charts, diaries, recorded da ta from automated instruments, etc.) and from 
sponsor provided source documents (for documenting assessments and surveys). Data 
from source documents will be utilized for entry into the electronic CRF at the site.  
Sponsor monitors will assess and check th e database remotely first and then again at site 
visits compared to the source documents.  The database will also have range checks and 
limits at the time of entry.  Ongoing verification will occur through database lock.  
 
17.0 ETHICS/IRB/CONSEN T

Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 60 Appendix 2  – Short Study Overview and Subject  Instructions  
General Study Overview for Researchers  
All subjects will be implanted with the Vivistim® device  and random ized into one of two therapy 
groups.  After approximately one -week to recover from surgery, subject s will receive therapy.  
Both groups will have their VNS intensity tolerance established at this time .  During a pre -therapy 
session, both groups will initia lly receive VNS at the same intensity (1/2 second of VNS at 0.8 mA 
and 100 uSec pulse width at 30 Hz frequency).  Intensity perception will be established by [CONTACT_860744] , starting at 0.[ADDRESS_1199853] tolerated level (0.7 , 0.6, 0.5 mA, etc.).  Subjects who do not perceive 
stimulation at 0.[ADDRESS_1199854] their perception level identified (likely 0.9 to 1.5 mA, although it 
can be tested up to 3.5 mA ); however , their start level will remain at 0.8 mA.   Therefore , it is likely  
that many people in both groups won’t feel VNS during the study, so not feeling stimulation doesn’t 
mean you are in one group or the other.  
Once a subject’s start -level is established, it will be used as the starting point for stimulation during 
the first  [ADDRESS_1199855] will be given a total of 5 stimulations (initiated 
by [CONTACT_860745] -button  by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541]) during movement trials.  The stimulations will decrease over the 
[ADDRESS_1199856] setting (0.8 mA or below) t o below perception.  For example, a 
subject starting at 0.[ADDRESS_1199857] about one minute.  
Subsequently, subjects randomized into the Control  group  will receive 0 mA of stimulation for the 
duration of their session.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860716] -button  at the start of each 
movement, but no stimulation (0 mA)  will occur.  Subjects randomized into the VNS group will 
receive 0.8 mA of stimulation (or less, if they can only tolerate less current) for the duration of 
their session.  Subjects who can tolerate higher output current levels will still only receive 0.8  mA 
of stimulation.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860716] -button  at the start of each movement , and 
stimulation at 0.8 mA of current will occur.  
This process will be repeated at each of the 18 sessions (both the ramp -down sequence and 
ongoing group sti mulation).  In other words, at each rehabilitation session during the study, 
subject s will have the 5-stimulation ramp -down sequence performed and then have their group 
specific push -button  stimulation performed.   You may schedule subjects for their long t erm visits 
between Visit 6 (about 1 1 weeks after surgery) and Visit 7 (about 19 weeks after surgery), in order 
to appropriately schedule return visits after Visit 7.   You may confirm patient group assignments 
(tell subjects which group they were in) at or after Visit 7.  
Note: No at -home stimulation (magnet use) will be performed during the acute study.  The at -
home, patient -activated stimulation will be allowed after the acute therapy and follow -up is 
finished.  Subjects are allowed to do standard at -home r ehabilitation movements as prescribed 
and directed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541], but they will not perform at -home stimulation until the long -term 
follow -up portion of the study.  Subjects will receive appropriate training prior to initiation of the 
at-home device use. 
 
Mar 23 Ver 1. 1  Page 61  
PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS:  
All subject s will receive VNS (stimulation), but there will be differing patterns of 
administration of VNS.  Only about ¼ of the stroke pi[INVESTIGATOR_860717] y.  So again, you may or may not feel 
stimulation  no matter the group to which you are assigned .  Just because you feel 
stimulation, it doesn’t mean it will benefit you.  Just because you don’t feel stimulation, it 
doesn’t mean it isn’t on and working prop erly and might benefit you.   Also, know that even 
subject s who feel stimulation may accommodate to stimulation over time, so you may 
only feel stimulation at the start of a session or may only feel stimulation at the first few 
sessions.  
In order to make su re the device system is operating properly, it is expected that a 
technical person (device programmer) will be in the room at the start of the first  session, 
making sure your device operates properly.  Once your system is checked, this person 
will likely n ot stay in the room, although they will be available to return or come to other 
sessions if necessary.  Therefore , a device programmer  is expected to be in the room 
only for  the first [ADDRESS_1199858] will be in the room 
throughout your therapy session.  
One group gets VNS throughout thei r session , while another group only gets VNS at the 
very start of each session.  We think the group that gets VNS throughout their session 
will do better, but this is not yet proven , so we don’t know if the VNS group will actually 
see more improvement .  In order to test this, neither you nor the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860718].  It helps scientifically if you don’t know and don’t try to guess 
which group you are in.  No matter which group you are in , you will get standard 
rehabilitation , so you should see some benefit since  we know that  standard rehabilitation 
improves arm movements.   Whichever group you are in , if you feel any discomfort at any 
time, you should let your study personnel (the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_860719]) know.  
And remember, if yo u were not in the group that is expected to show more improvement 
than the other , you will have the opportunity to come back in for another [ADDRESS_1199859] effective.  
You will be  told which group you are in by [CONTACT_860746] 
(Visit 7, approximately 1 9 weeks after your surgery).

Discontinued subjects will not be replaced ( i.e., their subject numbers will not be 
re-assigned/re -used).  
Should a subject exhibit any clinically relevant signs, symptoms, or other clinical 
observations that possibly could be associated with suspected sensitivity or intolerance  to one 
of the study treatments, the Investigator must document those observations on an AE Form.  
Any subject who exits early from the study (excluding screen failures) must undergo all 
procedures outlined at Visit 4, as applicable . 
The Investigator must document the reason for study or treatment discontinuation in the 
subject ’s case history source documents.  
To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue early, Investigators must  assess each 
subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93809] d/or medical procedures that may be 
needed to maintain their health.

The Study Sponsor  reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study in 
its entirety at any time, for reasonable cause.  
If the clinical  study is prematurely terminated or suspended  by [CONTACT_120776]:   
• The Study Sponsor  must : 
o Immediately notify the Investigator (s) and subsequently provide 
instructions for study termination.  
o Inform the Investigator  and the regulatory authorities of the 
termination/suspension and the reason(s) for the termination/suspension , 
as applicable.   
• The Investigator  must:  
o Promptly notify the IRB of the termination or suspension and of the 
reasons.  
o Provide subjects with recommendations for post -study treatment opti ons 
as needed.  
The Investigator may terminate a site ’s participation in the study for reasonable cause.

6.2.1 Safety Analysis Set  
Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set on a treatment -emergent basis. 
As such, t he Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any study lens , 
whether or not presoaked in the  study MPDS . For treatment -emergent safety analyses, 
subjects/eyes will be categorized under the actual study lenses /regimen  exposed  in the 
corresponding regimen sequence .  
6.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity, race) will be summarized on the Safety 
Analysis Set. Baseline data pertaining to habitual lens (lens brand, lens care brand) will be 
summarized on the Safety Analysis Set as well .

No inferences are to be made on the primary effectiveness endpoint; therefore, no hypotheses 
are formulated.

test product , the control product , or the procedures involved. For 
users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related 
to the test product . 
Adverse Device 
Effect (ADE)  Adverse event  related to the use of an investigational medical 
device (test product ) or control product .

Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm ( i.e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the

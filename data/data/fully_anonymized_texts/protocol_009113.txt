 PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
Name [CONTACT_790]/Company: Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc . 
Name [CONTACT_2756]: Brilacidin  
Name [CONTACT_3261]: Brilacidin tetrahydrochloride  
Study Number : IPI-BRIc-201 
Title of Study:   
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy  and Safety of Brilacidin in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95207] w ith COVID -19 
Study Centers: Approximately 15 
Number of Subjects Planned : 
Approximately [ADDRESS_105307] :  
Each subject  will complete the study in about 60 days, from screening at D ay -1 or 1 to 
follow-up on D ay 60 ±10 days 
Phase of Development:  Phase 2 
Purpose and rationale :  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Brilacidin intravenous ( IV) 
treatment in addition to current standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC alone in participants with moderate to severe COVID -19 
Primary Objective( s): 
• To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Brilacidin IV treatment in addition to SoC, 
compared with SoC alone, in subjects with COVID -19 
Secondary Objective(s):  
• To assess multiple clinical measures of disease severity and disease burden  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of Brilacidin IV treatment in subjects with COVID -
19 
Exploratory / Other  Objective(s):  
• In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209] 
• To measure biological and immunological markers of illness /inflammation  
• To explore the change in the SARS -CoV-2 vir al load  
• To estimate plasma pharmacokinetics of Brilacidin  
Design and Methodology:  
This Phase [ADDRESS_105308] polymer ase chain reaction (PCR) test (or 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 9 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 equivalent / other approved  diagnostic test) within 4 days prior to starting study treatmen t, 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95210]-level respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] 
(as def ined in exclusion criterion #2).  
The study is comprised  of three parts:  
Screening/ Baseline visit (Day -1 to 1): Lasts up to 24-48 hours and comprises screening/ 
baseline assessment s. This visit will confirm that study inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
met by [CONTACT_95267]. 
Treatment period (Day 1-3 with potential to expand to Day 4-5):  Randomized subjects will 
receive blinded study treatment once daily for 3 days by [CONTACT_16228], in addition to SoC.  
Follow-up period (Day 4-6 through Day 60):  Subjects will be assessed daily while 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] . Discharged  patients will be asked to attend study visits  at Days 15 and 29. All 
subjects will undergo a series of efficacy and safety assessments, including laboratory assays. Blood samples and naso pharyngeal (NP) swabs will be obtained on D ays 1 , 3, 5, 8, 
11 (while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and/or on day of discharge ; and  Days 15 and 29 (by [CONTACT_95268]/ remote visit or if still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]). Note: NP swab s are to be collected .  
If subjects are discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] 15, or Day 29, and a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95211], then visiting  nursing services and mobile phlebotomy may support that  visit 
remotely where these are available in accordance with local guidelines and should include 
all possible assessments (e.g., oxygen saturation with portable monitors). Every effort should be made to ensure discharged patient follow-up at Days 15 and 29, via a healthcare interaction  (minimally by [CONTACT_65859]) . A follow -up visit at Day 60(±10), by [CONTACT_95269], is also included to confirm patient status.  
Study Treatments  
All subjects  receive local SoC, plus allocated study treatment in addition. T wo IV study 
treatment arms  are planned : 
• SoC + Brilacidin IV 0.6 mg/kg (D1), 0.3 mg/kg (D2 and D3) with potential to expand 
dosing
a of 0.3 mg/kg on D4 and D5 
• SoC + Saline IV infusion (D1, D2, and D 3) with potential to expand dosinga on D4 and 
D5 
a Note: Dependent on safety review  and recommendation by [CONTACT_1578] ( DMC). 
D1, D2, and D3 (above) refer to Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 of study treatment. Similarly, D4 and D5 are Day 4 
and Day 5.  
Treatment randomization is 1:1 (n=60 per arm).  Randomization will als o be stratified by 
(1) Age (≤65 years , >65 years), (2) Severity of disease (moderate, severe) , and (3) Country. 
Interim Analys es and Data Monitoring Committee Oversight  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to conduct periodic 
safety reviews. An initial safety review  is planned to occur after approximately [ADDRESS_105309] completed up to Day 15, and a further safety review by [CONTACT_95270] 50% of subjects have completed up to Day 29. The DMC may 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 10 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 recommend expanding dosing to Days 4 and 5  (at the same doses as on Days 2 and 3 ), 
continuation of the Days 1 -3 study dosing unchanged, or that the trial be interrupted or 
stopped for safety reasons. D etails of the D MC will be prepared separately from this protocol 
in a D MC Charter ; the charter may super sede the summary details presented here in the 
protocol.

Proof of concept will be established by a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint or a positive direction  of effect amongst multiple efficacy endpoints. Comparisons will be 
performed against placebo plus SoC at a one-sided type I error rate of 0.05 which will not be adjusted for multiple testing.  
The selected primary efficacy endpoint is time to sustained recovery, where recovery is defined as the participant being well enough for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], meaning the participant either no longer requires supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or is no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (with or without some limitation on activities) . 
Tabulations will be produced for appropriate demographic, baseline, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters. For categorical variables, summary tables with number and percentage of subjects within each category will be presented. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics including the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values will be presented. Kaplan- Meier methods will be 
used to summarize time to event endpoints, including the 25
th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles with associated 90% confidence intervals, as well as percentage of events and censored observations.

Sample Size 
This study is exploratory in nature and the sample size (up to 60 per treatment arm) was 
selected to provide sufficient power under a range of alternative hypotheses to support PoC of Brilacidin versus SoC. The type I error will not be adjusted to account for multiple comparisons. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint of time to recovery , assuming a total of 100 subjects (50 
per treatment arm included in analys is), if a total of [ADDRESS_105320] 90% power with a one-sided 
type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_105321] ratio of 2.0 [equivalent to median time to recovery of 5 days on Brilacidin versus 10 days on SoC].  If instead the hazard ratio is 1.67 (time to recovery on Brilacidin of 6 days versus 10 days on SoC) and [ADDRESS_105322] 70% power.  The assumptions for sample 
estimation are adapted from the median time to recovery data reported for the rem desivir 
(11 days) treatment group in Beigel et al 2020 ; remdesivir has Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) in multiple countries and has become SoC where available. 
Interim Analys es/ Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to conduct periodic safety reviews. Details of the DMC will be prepared separately from this protocol in a DMC Charter. The charter may super sede the summary details presented here in the p rotocol. 
Safety data summaries and listings will be produced for DMC safety monitoring when needed . 
An initial safety review  is planned to occur after approximately [ADDRESS_105323] occurred in the approximately 20 subjects to receive Days 1 -3 of study treatment. A further safety review by [CONTACT_95278] 50% of subjects have completed up to Day 29, to allow for unblinded 
monitoring of safety data around the study mid-point. T he DMC may recommend expanding 
dosing to Days 4 and 5 (at the same doses as on Days 2 and 3), continuation of the Days 1-3 study dosing unchanged, or that the trial be interrupted or stopped for safety reasons. The DMC will be guided by [CONTACT_95279]/ events observed in 
the ongoing study which should not exceed the number and/or severity of those observed in previous studies with Bril acidin IV treatment for expansion of dosing to occur as planned. 
The primary efficacy analysis will occur once all subjects complete  the Day 29 visit (or 
discontinue from study, if before Day 29). Final database lock and updated safety reporting will follow the completion of Day 60 follow-up telephone visits. 
Analysis Population 
Efficacy analyses performed on the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population will be considered 
primary, with the ITT population including all subjects who are randomized and receive at 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105324] one dose of study drug. Subjects in this population will be analyzed acco rding to the 
treatment group to which they were randomized. 
The Safety population includes all subjects in the ITT population. Subjects in this population 
will be analyzed according to treatment received. All safety analyses will be based on this population. 
The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the ITT population and includes subjects 
who meet particular study completion criteria with no major protocol deviations; these 
criteria will be described in the SAP and will be approved prior to database lock and study unblinding. Efficacy analyses performed using the PP population will be considered supportive. 
All subjects in the ITT population who provide at least one PK sample and have at least one 
valid concentration measurement will be included in the PK population. 
Statistical Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to sustained recovery which will be analyzed with the 
log-rank test for treatment difference, stratified by [CONTACT_551], disease severity  and country, 
with dose regimen as covariate (if expanded after DMC recommendation), and summarized 
using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Secondary and exploratory/ other endpoints will be 
presented with summary statistics. Between treatment group comparisons for secondary and exploratory/ other endpoints will be performed via logistic regression, including proportional odds logistic regression for changes in the ordinal scale, and analysis of covariance models, stratified by [CONTACT_551], disease severi ty and country, for categorical and continuous 
endpoints, respectively. Sensitivity analyses may include longitudinal models and models adjusted for additional covariates. 
All s afety data, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively 
through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, and categorical summaries on the 
Safety Population.

are available in accordance with local guidelines and should include all possible assessments . Every effort should be made to ensure discharged patient follow -up via 
a healthcare interaction. Visit windows for Day 15/[ADDRESS_105329].  
6 Complete physical examination to be performed at Screening/Baseline, including review of the following body systems: skin, neck (including thyroid),  HEENT 
(head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurologic function. Subsequent examinations may be abbreviated 
including, at a minimum: HEENT, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities and examination of any body system where there are symptoms reported by [CONTACT_423].  
7 Vital signs include heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure s and body temperature. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219] (r espi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , oxygenation and any oxygen 
supplementation) should be measured at the same time as the vital sign measurements , if possible . 
 All parameters  of the NEWS2  – including the vital sign parameters and oxygen saturation – should be recorded together in the morning, and the n between noon and 
midnight,  for the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95216]. Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95217] (Days 15 and 29) . 
8 Results confirming positive SARS -CoV -2 virus by [CONTACT_95280] / other approved diagnostic testing  within [ADDRESS_105330] (serum hCG) will be performed by l ocal laboratory. For enrollment a 
negative urine test is sufficient.  
10 Blood samples ( for Brilacidin plasma concentration analysis ) will be collected  at the following timepoints: 
• Day 1: pre -dose, within 30 mins after the end of infusion, and between 8 -12 hours from start of the Day 1 infusion.  
• Day 2: pre -dose (approximately 24 hours from start of the Day 1 infusion)  
• Day 3: pre -dose (approximately 24 hours from the start of the Day 2 infusion)  
• Day 4: at approximately [ADDRESS_105331] preparation at the study site. Brilacidin for Injection concentrated solution is diluted in sterile 0.9% w/v sodium 
chloride (normal saline) to provide the desired final dose  within 8 hours of administrat ion; diluted Brilacidin drug product  is then stored at room temperature  not 
above 25°C, 77°F, prior to use. Placebo IV infusion will be sterile saline.  
 Since pharmacist preparation ahead of dosing is required, randomization using IRT may be performed prior of full confirmation of subject eligibility. Full 
confirmation of eligibility must then be confirmed pre -dose on Day 1.  
12 Brilacidin IV infusion is filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane when administered intravenously over 60 minutes.  On study treatment da ys, assessments should be 
performed pre -dose unless otherwise specified.  
13 Brilacidin treatment may be expanding to Day 4 and Day 5 following an initial interim safety analysis; additional assessments then needed on Day 4 and Day 5 . 
14 Blood pressure and pulse rate measured at additional timepoints during study treatment, around the timing of the study IV infusion; pre -dose, within no more than 30 
mins after the end of infusion, and 3 hours (±30 mins) post -start of infusion (i.e., ~[ADDRESS_105332] -end of infusion) . Additional assessments to be made as appropriate 
based on the systolic and dia stolic blood pressure value s recorded . 
15 Adverse events (AEs)  with onset after a subject has provided informed consent are to be recorded.  At follow -up through Day 29, o ngoing AEs assessed as related 
and all ongoing Serious AEs are to be further followed up to appropriate resolution .

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1.  Disease Overview  
Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 ( SARS -CoV-2) was identified as the 
cause of an outbreak of respi[INVESTIGATOR_95219] 2019 (COVID -19) that 
was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_95220]. Common signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. Gastrointestinal symptoms  (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) also appear to be common clinical 
manifestations of  COVID -19. In severe cases,  SARS -CoV- 2 can cause pneumonia, severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686], kidney failure, and death ( WHO 2020a ). On 30 January 2020, the 
International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the WHO declared the COVID -19 
outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( WHO 2020b). Further to the 
WHO declaration, on 31 January 2020, Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in the [LOCATION_002] (US) ( DHHS 2020 ). 
As of November 3, 2020, over 47.[ADDRESS_105337] 233,000 fatalities in the United State s (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource 
Center 2020). While COVID -19 mortality rates can vary greatly by [CONTACT_1617], with 
differences in how rates are calculated, it is generally accepted that, for COVID -19, the 
overall mortality rate is many times higher than that seen with seasonal influenza; moreover, it has been observed that up to 15% of COVID-19 patients develop lung injury, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_95221] (ARDS) requiring prolonged ventilator support over weeks ( Zhou et al 2020). This can result in intensive care 
units, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95222]. Presently, there are no approved vaccines and few mini mally effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95223] -19. According to a 
May 1, 2020, Congressional Research Service report, worldwide economic growth could be reduced by [ADDRESS_105338], with global trade falling by 13 percent to 32 percent, with the economic downturn attributable to the COVID-19 crisis could vastly exceed that of the Great Recession (2007-2009) (Congressional Research Service 2020). The Congressional Budget Office estimates the novel coronavirus pandemic will cost the U.S. economy $8 trillion through 2030 ( Stein 2020).  
ARDS is characterized by [CONTACT_23131] -inflammatory cytokine release, inflammatory cellular 
infiltration and cell death, resulting in severe pulmonary damage and the development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_95224]-expi[INVESTIGATOR_65168] (PEEP) to maintain life. In patients with a prior history of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (common comorbid conditions), poor health outcomes have been reported that may be a result of poor underlying cardiac reserve—meaning that patients develop cardiac failure in response to ventilation, with pulmonary edema further exacerbating respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] ( Zhou et al 2020).  
ARDS is an important contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID -19. 
ARDS manifestation is connected to heightened inflammatory responses resulting from 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105339] defense proteins (HDPs), having one surface with positively charged groups (cationic) and the opposite surface consisting of hydrophobic groups. With this general synthetic form, there is no need for an agent to be of the size or composition of naturally-occurring proteins to effectively function as a HDP, as the ability to act as a HDP is retained by [CONTACT_95281].  
Brilacidin has  anti-inflammatory activity – the mechanism of which is proposed to be based 
largely on inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE4 and PDE3) and subsequent down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF- α, IL -1β, IL -6, IL -8). Like natural 
HDPs, Brilacidin has antibacterial activity (with a predominantly  gram -positive spectrum). 
New in vitro  research has demonstrated robust and consistent antiviral activity of Brilacidin 
against SARS -CoV-2, as summarized below. 
1.2.1.  Proposed Therapeutic Properties in COVID -19 
Brilacidin has three complementary anti -COVID -19 therapeutic properties combined in a 
single drug: antiviral; immunomodulatory/anti- inflammatory; and antimicrobial ( Figure 1 ). 
Brilacidin has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARs -CoV-2 in cell -based assays  (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), and the mechanisms for this activity are postulated as being: 
1) Membrane Disruption: disrupting the viral envelope (virucidal) 
2) Entry Inhibition: by [CONTACT_95282]2 receptor, preventing ACE2 receptor binding and viral entry 
3) Intracellular Targets: inhibiting viral replication intracellularly, by [CONTACT_95283] -
CoV- 2 main protease (M
pro) 
4) Anti-inflammatory: suppressing IL-6 and other pro- inflammatory mediators 
implicated in the “cytokine storm”, through inhibition of phosphodiesterase 
The main proposed mechanism of action of Brilacidin involves the disruption of viral membrane integrity. Other direct antiviral mechanisms of action of Brilacidin may include blocking viral entry and interrupting viral replication intracellularly. An in silico  quantum 
mechanical molecular screening study of 11,522 compounds (both FDA-approved and those in testing) identified Brilacidin as one of the most promising potential inhibitors of the novel coronavirus based on the potential of its physico- chemical properties to interfere with the 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 23 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 intracellular replication of SARS -CoV- 2’s main protease (Mpro) (Cavasotto and Filippo 2020). 
An article detailing in  vitro  results a nd proposed mechanisms of action is being submitted for 
peer review publication, with a pre-print ( Bakovic et al 2020) made available.  
Additional nonclinical (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) and clinical data support Brilacidin’s potential to  
function through the cAMP/cGMP pathway, by [CONTACT_95284]. 
Phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) is the predominant phosphodiest erase expressed in 
neutrophils, T cells and macrophages. PDE inhibitors show broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects in almost all inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibitors block the degradative action of PDE4 on cAMP, thereby [CONTACT_95285]. PDE4 inhibitors reduce neutrophil chemotaxis, recruitment and activation; inhibit the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; and inhibit monocytes chemotaxis ( Tamimi et al 2012). Therefore, inhibition of PDEs is expected to have 
a therapeutic effect on the inflammatory state.  
Inhibition of PDE4 and PDE3 has been demonstrated for Bril acidin in vitro  (see Section  
[IP_ADDRESS]). PDE4 and PDE3 inhibition results in subsequent down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (such as TNF -α, IL-6, IL-1β, MMP -9, MCP-1, IL-8, 
CINC -3), which have been identified as central drivers in the worsening prognoses of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]- [ADDRESS_105340] been conducted to confirm such down-
regulation by [CONTACT_95286]- based assays  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), and also from 
clinical biomarker data (Phase 2 retention enema study, Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Brilacidin’s antimicrobial properties, as demonstrated  in a Phase 2b clinical trial of 
intravenous Brilacidin in the treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections 
(ABSSSI), may also help to fight or prevent secondary bacterial infections, which can co -
present in up to 20 percent of COVID- 19 cases ( Cox et al 2020; Kim et al 2020 ; Mirzaei et al 
2020).  
Collective ly, these data support Brilacidin as a highly unique 3- in-1 combination—antiviral, 
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial—novel COVID- 19 therapeutic candidate (Figure 1 ).

1.3.  Nonclinical and Clinical Studies with Brilacidin  
Please refer to  the Investigator ’s Brochure for full background information.  
1.3.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Toxicology and Safety Pharmacology 
Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity studies have been conducted with intravenous ( IV) and oral 
gavage administration of Brilacidin.  
For Brilacidin administered IV for up to [ADDRESS_105341] 
been relatively consistent in both rats and dogs. Salivation, retching, weight loss, and 
diminished feces relate to the gastrointestinal system; tremors and diminished activity to the neurological system; and labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_95225]. Effects on peripheral nerves were observed as well as increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Brilacidin -related microscopic findings in repeat dose IV toxicity 
studies in rat and dog included microvacuolation of the axon hillock of neurons from the dorsal root ganglia, and microscopic changes in the kidney (tubular basophilia). T here were 
no associated degenerative changes in the neuronal bodies or nerves/nervous tracts. The toxicological investigations indicate that the dog is the more sensitive of the species tested by [CONTACT_95287], with a NOAEL dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day and associated mean Day 28 

Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 25 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 AUC(0 -t) of [ZIP_CODE] ng•h/mL (males) or [ZIP_CODE] ng•h/mL (females). The nonclinical findings of 
a mild peripheral sensory axonopathy in rats and dogs administered Brilacidin are consistent 
with the clinical findings of mild transient paresthesia observed clinically. The onset of functional neurological changes has been reported to precede microscopic changes allowing for clinical monitoring, through adverse event reporting, and adjustment of dose and duration of administration if  needed ( Petterson et al 2008 ). 
Brilacidin demonstrated no genotoxic potential in vitro or in vivo.  
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in male and female rats, no effects on 
fertility parameters were observed at doses up to 1.5 mg/kg IV; the NOAEL was considered 0.75 mg/kg based on clinical signs and decreased organ weights (prostate, seminal vesicle) considered adverse in males.  
Safety pharmacology 
In vivo, cardiovascular effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate at the highest dose tested (4 mg/kg IV) were observed without effect on cardiac rhythm or ECG. Decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_95226] (25 mg/kg IV) were observed in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_95227]. Nervous system effects observed were salivation and labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_95228] (25 mg/kg IV). In a nerve conduction study (non-GLP), the highest dose group (10 mg/kg IV) demonstrated slowing down of caudal nerve conduction velocity after 5 days administration and histopathological changes (i ntracytoplasmic granules) in dorsal root ganglion at the end of the recovery phase. 
Sensory and coordination studies (non-GLP) demonstrated marginal effects up to 10 mg/kg IV. 
In vitro, Brilacidin at the highest feasible test concentration (0.3 μM) did not  result in hERG 
inhibition. Results from studies (non-GLP) using patch clamp assays support disturbances in channel function as a potential cause for observed paresthesias associated with high dose Brilacidin treatment when administered IV in the clinic. However, Brilacidin shows little if any accumulation in the CNS so any ion channel interactions would be expected to be localized in the periphery. In evaluating the significance of these interactions on the safety of Brilacidin IV, it can be recognized that several widely used drugs and drug classes target ion channels for therapeutic effects, e.g., repaglinide, nateglinide, disopyramide, and phenytoin and other widely used drugs display off-target activities at ion channels, e.g., haloperidol, fluoxetine, and verapamil. These marketed drugs are used chronically and support the rationale that ion channel effects should be adequately tolerated. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and metabolism 
After  IV single dose administration, the half- life (t½) was approximate ly 8 hours in rats. 
(Human pharmacokinetics have been conducted and t½ ~20 hours after IV administration of 
Brilacidin to healthy subjects [Study PMX63-102, Study PMX63-103]). 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 26 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 Plasma protein binding of Brilacidin in vitro for mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human 
plasma proteins was comparable, ranging from 94.4% to 98.5%. The plasma/blood partitioning studies indicated no preferential accumulation of [14C]-Brilacidin to human blood cells. 
Tissue distribution after IV administration of [14C]- Brilacidin (2 mg/kg) showed that in the 
lung, concentrations were high at the [ADDRESS_105342]-dose; at [ADDRESS_105343]  concentrations of radioactivity were 
subsequently observed in small intestine mucosa at all time points  (24, [ADDRESS_105344]-dose), which would indicate biliary excretion as a possible route of elimination for Brilacidin. Tissues with the lowest concentrations of radioactivity were bone, brain, eye, white fat, seminal vesicles (male rats only), spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and urinary bladder (male rats only) at all time points.  
Rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and human hepatocytes in vitro did not metabolize Brilacidin. In the rat following a single IV dose, in all three matrices (kidney, liver a nd feces) the major 
component detected was Brilacidin. Two additional components/potential metabolites were observed, although it is also possible that both are artifacts formed during the extraction process.  
Using the January 2020 FDA Guidance for in vitro DDI studies, available data indicates there is a potential for Brilacidin to reversibly inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 with a possible although probably not likely time-dependent inhibition of CYP2B6. To further investigate any potential for drug- drug interactions with substrates metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzymes , an in vitro study ( to accurately determine Ki’s ) is planned 
to be performed in parallel with the conduct of this study. Please refer to Section 6.1.1 for details on caution ary monitoring for adverse effects of those drugs which are sensitive 
substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzymes or are substrates with a narrow therapeutic range during study treatment. The likelihood for drug-drug interactions is low and  
will be  further confirm ed through additional study(ies). Of note, t he safety profile of 
Brilacidin has already been established from intravenous dosing of over [ADDRESS_105345] occurred to date.  
In the rat, following a single IV dose in a mass balance study, any radioactivity excreted was largely via the fecal route and i ndicates that possible excretion in the bile (and/or via the gut 
mucosa) is an important route of elimination of Brilacidin.   
These ADME data, demonstrating pulmonary exposure to Brilacidin from IV administration, are reassuring for the indication of COVID-19. As Brilacidin is excreted unchanged in the feces, there is also potential for treatment to address g astrointestinal symptoms  (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea) that also appear to be common clinical manifestations of  COVID -19.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Efficacy  
Pharmacodynamics: Anti -viral activity  
Using a pre-treatment assay, performed in monkey kidney Vero cells and also in human lung 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_95229] -[ADDRESS_105346]-infection in the Vero cell assays,  Brilaci din 
tetrahydrochloride at a concentration of 10 μM showed ~72 % inhibition (p<0.01) ( Figure 2, 
left panel) , and in the Calu- [ADDRESS_105347] 95% inhibition 
(p<0.0001) and at 20 μM  97% inhibition (p<0.0001) ( Figure 2, right panel).  
In the pre-treatment assay method, live virus was pre- treated with Brilacidin (before  virus 
presentation to cells), with cells additionally  pre-treated with  drug and Brilacidin also present 
in the viral inoculum during the process of infection, and present post- infection . Virus was 
incubated with the respective concentrations of Brila cidin tetrahydrochloride tested for one 
hour, and virus treated with vehicle alone (DMSO) maintained alongside as control. The pretreatment virus- Brilacidin mix was then added to cells (which had been pre- treated with 
Brilacidin for two hours) , with Brilacidin maintained in the medium con centration, and cells 
were infected with SARS -CoV-2 at a MOI: 0.1. The infection was allowed to proceed for 1 
hour at 37°C, after which the viral mix overlay was removed and Brilacidin-containing medium was added back to the cells. Cells were maintained at  37°C for [ADDRESS_105348] pre -treatment  of virus, the inhibition achieved in the assay for a concentration 
of Brilacidin was reduced. For example, without pre- treatment of virus, the inhibition 
achieved in the Calu -3 cell assays was 39% inhibi tion with 1 0 μM  and 61% inhibition with 20 
μM Brilacidin tetrahydrochloride, compared to 95% and 97% inhibition, respectively, with 
pre-treatment of virus. The pre-treatment assays, both in Vero and Calu-3 cells, support 
Brilacidin’s ability to prev ent viral entry by, it is proposed, disrupting the viral envelope 
and/or preventing viral attachment to host cells. A maj ority of antiviral agents targeting 
SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_105349]-infection, rather than eliminating or

 Additional testing, using the same pre- treatment assay across a range of Brilacidin 
concentrations, showed Brilacidin tetrahydrochloride achieved ~90% inhibition against 
SARS -CoV- 2 (IC90) at a concentration of 2.63 μM and an IC50 value of 0.565 μM 
(Figure 3 ), both of which are below clinically- achievable concentrations b ased on 
pharmacokinetics observed in a Phase 2b clinical trial of Brilacidin in treatment of ABSSSI: median Cmax in plasma was 7.67 μM Brilacidin (free -base) from a single IV dose of 0.6 
mg/kg.

only the viral inoculum was pre- treated (with 1 0 μM Brilacidin tetrahydrochloride), and the 
treated ino culum used to infect Vero cells. At [ADDRESS_105351]-infection, the infectious virus titer 
in the supernatant was quantified by [CONTACT_95288], which revealed a dramatic 90% reduction of virus titer ( Figure 4, indicated as [entry]). This inhibition was approximately 25% higher 
than that observed when, in comparison, cells were exposed pre- and post-infection to Brilacidin and with no pre-treatment of virus nor drug present during infection. These data support the concept that Brilacidin has a direct inhibitory effect on the virus in a manner 
similar to the neutralization of antibodies, potentially by [CONTACT_95289]’s ability to complete the viral entry process.

Brilacidin has also  undergone in vitro  testing  (in Calu -3 cells) in combination with other 
antiviral agents. Preliminary data  of Brilacidin in combination with r emdesivir  (one of only 
two current COVID -19 treatments that has received Emergency Use Authorization, as well as 
a frontline treatment worldwide), demonstrates a statistically significant synergistic effect 
(Figure 5 ), with a combined overall inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 of ≥ 99%, reducing 
overall viral load to near undetectable levels.  
Brilacidin appears to have primarily an extracellular mechanism of action, by [CONTACT_95290]. In contrast, r emdesivir  has an intracellular mechanism of 
action, affecting viral replication post-infection. Exhibiting different but synergistic antiviral properties, these two drugs may be an especial ly potent drug combination in treating COVID-
19.

vitro  results against SARS -CoV-2 and proposed mechanisms of action is being submitted  for 
peer review publication, with a pre-print ( Bakovic et al 2020) made available.  Future in vivo 
studies are planned . 
Pharmacodynamics: Anti- inflammatory  activity  
As demonstrated in vitro and ex vivo cell -based assays , the anti- inflammatory effect of 
Brilacidin is proposed to be based largely on inhibition of PDE4 and PDE3 with subsequent down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (such as TNF -α, IL -1β, IL -6, IL -
8) and its regulators. Ass ays conducted include LPS- induced cytokine release ELISA (rat 
macrophages  and human monocytic leukemia (THP- 1) cells) and PDE -Glo™ PDE assay . 
Animal anti-inflammatory pharmacology data are available from two animal models. 
In both acute and fractionated ra diation hamster models of oral mucositis, Brilacidin 
administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_95230] (to irradiated left buccal cheek pouch) over 28- or 35-day 
treatment periods, respectively, significantly reduced the number of days animals exhibited ulceration and the daily mean mucositis grades. Experiments in the fractionated radiation-induced OM model clearly identified that a continuous Brilacidin 3 mg/mL TID regimen was most effective and all but eliminated ulcerative OM in experiments conducted, with reductions in the number of animal days with ulcerative OM over 90% relative to the control group responses (46.7% to 56.0% for control groups, and <4% for Brilacidin 3 mg/mL group). 
In a murine DSS-induced colitis model, despi[INVESTIGATOR_95231], after dosing 
with Brilacidin 400 mg/kg solution per rectum compared to DSS- treated controls rectal 
bleeding was significantly decreased and stools were significantly more firm. In addition, IL-6 and IL- 1β levels in colon tissue decreased with Brilacidin treatment and w ere lower than 
that of DSS- treated controls. Efficacy results similar to those for the Brilacidin treatment 
group were obtained with the positive control 5-ASA treated group. 
Pharmacodynamics: Anti- bacterial  activity  
Brilacidin has demonstrated potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococci, beta- hemolytic streptococci and E. faecium , and several Gram -negative 
bacteria. Minimal propensity for the development of resistance has been demonstrated and broad- spectrum activity against multi-drug resistant strains of S. aureus , S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_95232] S. 
hemolyticus , including organisms resistant to two or more of the antibiotics methicillin, 
daptomycin, linezolid and vancomycin. Brilacidin has shown rapid bactericidal activity versus S. aureus  and E. coli , plus significant antimicrobial activity against MSSA and MRSA at sub -
MIC levels for up to [ADDRESS_105353] stationary cultures of MSSA and MRSA.

 Importantly for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), 
Brilacidin was potent against m ulti-drug resistant  staphylococci. 
1.3.2.  Clinical Studies  
The clinical development program for Brilacidin includes healthy volunteers and patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSI), head and neck cancer (HNC), and ulcerative proctitis (UP)/ ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS) . 
As of December 2020, e ight clinical trials have been completed;  
• 5 clinical trials wit h Brilacidin administered intravenously (3 in healthy volunteers and 
2 in patients with ABSSSI; total n treated with Brilacidin = 412 ); and 
• 2 clinical trials with Brilacidin administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (1 in HNC patients, by [CONTACT_95291], in attenuating oral mucositis  [n treated with Brilacidin = 29 ]; and 1 in patients, 
by [CONTACT_95292], for mild to moderate UP or UPS [ n treated with Brilacidin = 
17]); and  
• 1 with Brilacidin administered orally (1 in healthy volunteers, by [CONTACT_95293]  [n treated with Brilacidin = 6] ). 
Please refer to  the Investigator’s Brochure for details on the studies conducted with 
administration other than intravenous; a summary of intravenous experience is presented here. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Safety  
The safety profile of Brilacidin has already been established from intravenous dosing of over 
400 subjects in the Brilacidin program. Intravenous administration of Brilacidin has identified 
transient, dose- limiting (non -serious) side effects of paresthesias and hypoesthesias, and 
elevation of blood pressure and heart rate at higher doses that normalized with treatment or discontinuation of study treatment. 
The most prominent neurological symptoms related to B rilacidin dosed intravenously 
included tingling and or numbness of the following body regions: lips/mouth/throat (lips), 
face/head/neck (face), fingers/hands (fingers), toes/feet (toes), and torso or perineal sites. These symptoms and signs were transient in nature and resolved after drug discontinuation. There did not appear to be any gender differences.  In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_95233], the neurological adverse events related to B rilacidin likely represent a 
pharmacologic effect and are unlik ely explained by [CONTACT_95294]. 
Transient i ncreases in blood pressure and heart rate have been noted in all IV- dosed clinical 
trials. While tachycardia is of concern, such adverse events are uncommon (i.e., 0, 1 or 2 non-serious AEs per Brilacidin treatment group in Phase 2 studies; total patients treated = 319). Resolution of the observed blood pressure in creases is accompanied by [CONTACT_95295]. Therefore, blood pressure increase has been the focus of safety management for IV dosing with Brilacidin . Data across clinical trials indicate that blood pressure increases are 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 32 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 unlikely to be >180/110 mmHg or be associated with progressive target organ involvement 
resulting in neurological, cardiac or renal complicati ons. However, there were three patients 
treated with Brilacidin in Study PMX63 -203 (5 -day treatment regimen)  who developed 
hypertension near 220/120 mmHg. When study drug was discontinued and patients were treated with anti-hypertensive medications, their blood pressure decreased ; in all cases, blood 
pressure increases were observed as gradual over hours or days allowing for prompt medical intervention. For the Phase 2b study CTIX -BRI-204, which included the initial 3 -day 
treatment  regimen to be tested in this  Phase 2 study for COVID-19, none of the reported 
blood pressure events were considered serious or severe in any treatment arm.  
In the IV program, 13 treatment- emergent  serious adverse event s (SAEs) have been observed 
(Table 2). Of these SAEs, none led to death, and 3/13 are considered treatment-related (10/13 
are considered not treatment -related).  
The three SAEs considered treatment -related occurred in the Phase 2a study (PMX63 -203), 
on the treatment arm indicated;  
• Thrombocytosis ( 0.4 mg/kg Day 1, followed by 0.3 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5) 
• Hypertensive crisis ( 0.75 mg/kg Day 1, followed by 0.35 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5) 
• Hypertensive crisis (1.0  mg/kg Day 1, followed by 0.3 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5) 
All SAEs were followed to resolution.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
In Phase [ADDRESS_105355] given the little (<1%) unchanged drug 
recovered in urine (Study PMX63-103). 
Given the relatively sparse PK sampling scheme employed in the Phase 2 studies, a 
population PK model was used to describe the time-course of Brilacidin using data pooled from the three studies conducted in healthy subjects and two Phase 2 studies conducted in patients with ABSSSI. The resultant predicted concentration- time profiles were used to 
estimate exposure to Brilacidin in the Phase 2 patients. Summary statistics for the resultant PK parameters and PK exposure estimates are provided in  Table 3 for Study PMX63-203 and 
Table 4 for Study CTIX- BRI-204. 
The three -compartment population PK model results in different  estimates of half -life from 
the Phase 1 studies as  the estimates from those studies are derived  using non- compartmental 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 34

 methods. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95234], the median values for half -life of the 
distribution phase t1/2,β (~10 h) and the terminal elimination phase  t1/2,γ (~ 60-70 h) are in 
the expected range given the half -life estimates from the non- compartmental analyses of 
Phase 1 studies, with mean values ranged from 16.9 to 23.0 h (multiple dose study PMX63-
102).

clinical trials. In a Phase 2a clinical study involving 215 patients with ABSSSI, clinical success in treating the infections was found in approximately 90% of patients in each of three Brilacidin treatment groups, varying slightly by [CONTACT_95298], compared with daptomycin as active control (SLD = single loading dose; dose in mg/kg): (1) 1.0 SLD + 0.35 qd x 4 days, (2) 0.75 SLD + 0.35 qd x 4 days, (3) 0.40 SLD + 0.30 qd x 4 days, and (4) daptomycin 4 qd x 7 days. In all efficacy analyses, across all treatment arms, the 95%

 confidence intervals around the point estimates for clinical success overlapped, indicating a 
consistent and high clinical success rate, similar to the active comparator (daptomycin).  
The clinical response results observed in Phase 2a Study PMX63-203 were confirmed in a Phase 2b clinical study (CTIX- BRI-204) which treated 209 patients with ABSSSI. Clinical 
success in treating the infe ctions found was achieved across the three Brilacidin treatment 
groups and daptomycin active control group between 83.3% to 100%, and all 95% confidence intervals overlapped. The 4 treatment groups were (SLD = single loading dose; dose in mg/kg): (1) 0.6 SLD, (2) 0.8 SLD, (3) 0.60 SLD + 0.30 qd x 2 days, and (4) daptomycin 4 qd x 7 days. Patients given Brilacidin on active treatment days were also given placebo on other days to maintain the double-blind design. 
After an extensive PK /PD analysis and discussion with experts (including a meeting with 
FDA), it was deemed that cardiovascular and neurosensory effects were dose- related, and 
when given systemically in lower doses, as in the Phase 2b ABSSSI trial, these effects are 
likely to reduce in both frequency and severity.  
The lowest dose tested (0.6 SLD) in the Phase 2b Study CTIX- BRI-204 was efficacious 
(comparable to the daptomycin arm) and generally well -tolerated, and is the IV dose proposed 
for progression to Phase 3 testing  in the ABSSSI indication.

Brilacidin administered per rectum as a daily (at night) retention enema has demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in a Phase 2 clinical trial for induction of remission of  active mild 
to moderate ulcerat ive proctitis (UP) or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS ). Bri lacidin rectal 
enema resulted in clinical remission after 6 weeks of treatment in a majority of subjects for the doses tested. Endoscopic improvement was demonstrated. Certain markers indicative of inflammation  – including fecal calprotectin, and  IL-1β and IL -6 measured in colon tissue 
biopsies (from rectum and sigmoid) at Week 6 – reduced with study treatment, supporting the treatment group clinical responses .

 1.4.  Dose Rationale 
In this study, a ll subjects  are to receive local SoC plus allocated study treatment in addition. 
Two IV study treatment arms  are planned : 
• SoC + Brilacidin IV 0.6 mg/kg (D1), 0.3 mg/kg (D2 and D3) with potential to expand 
dosinga of 0.3 mg/kg on D4 and D5 
• SoC + Saline IV inf usion (D1, D2, and D 3) with potential to expand dosinga on D4 and 
D5 
a Note: Dependent on safety revie w and recommendation by [CONTACT_1578] ( DMC) . 
D1, D2, and D3 (above) refer to Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 of study treatment. Similarly, D4 and D5 are Day 4 and 
Day 5.  
The doses of Brilacidin are selected from the dose range previously tested in the IV program.  
From the Phase 2 program conducted with Brilacidin administered IV for the indication of 
ABSSSI, a multiple  dose regime n (0.6 mg/kg on Day 1, followed by 0.3 mg/kg on Days 2 and 
3) from the Phase 2b study (CTIX- BRI-204) is initially selected for testing in this trial.   
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to conduct periodic safety reviews  (Section 8.1.6). An initial safety review  is planned to occur after approximately 
[ADDRESS_105356] completed up to Day 15. Th is initial interim analysis will focus 
on review of cardiovascular safety, vital signs and adverse events. At the time of the initial interim safety review  (or any subsequent safety review), the DMC may recommend 
expanding dosing to Days 4 and 5 at the same doses as on Days 2 and 3. Brilacidin was also administered IV for 5 days of treatment in the ABSSSI program, in the Phase 2a study (PMX63 -203), albeit with slightly different 5-day dosing regimens. 
The rationale for looking to expand treatment duration to five days, from the initial dose regimen of three days, is to be able to provide a longer duration of systemic Brilacidin exposure at a level that can strongly suppress SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_105357] of 
Brilacidin treatment and provide enhanced benefit to the patient, with the 5-day regimen incorporated only following recommendation by [CONTACT_95300](es).  
The safety profile of the proposed 3-day, and potential 5- day, regimens are covered by [CONTACT_95301] , and the safety findings are regarded as manageable for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]-19 patients meeting the protocol entry requirements. The potential for the selected  dose regimens to achieve efficacy in human  has been modeled, using plasma 
concentration data from the prior ABSSSI development program and comparing to derived in vitro  antiviral efficacy parameters (IC50 and IC90) from experiments with human lung 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].

 1.4.1.  Safety Profile for Selected Doses  
Safety Profile: Up to three (3) days multiple dose regimen  
The adverse events summary from Phase 2 b Study CTIX -BRI-204 is presented in Table 5. 
Numbness/Tingling (N/T), defined as paraesthesia/paraesthes ia oral or hypoaesthesia/ 
hypoaesthesia oral, was the most frequently reported AE, reported for 58.5% to 73.6% of 
subjects  in the B rilacidin groups, and 8.0% for the daptomycin group, respectively . All 
numbness/tingling events tended to be transient, mild in intensity, and were reported by [CONTACT_42929].  
Adver se events were reported for  46% of subjects in the daptomycin group and for 79.2-
92.5% of subjects  across the Brilacidin groups. Excluding N/T events, all- causality AE rates 
across all treatment groups were 52.8%, 56.6%, 69.8%, and 46.0%, and drug- related AE rates 
were 7.5%, 7.5%, 15.1%, and 26.0%, in the Brilacidin 0.6 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg , 0.6/0.3 mg/kg 
and daptomycin groups, respectively. Nausea was reported in 13.8% of the combined 
Brilacidin groups, and in 8.0% of the daptomycin group. 
Infrequent, t ransient  epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] “hypertension” or “blood pressure increased” events (i.e., 
SBP > 160 mmHg) w ere reported in 2 (3.8%), 9 (17.0%), 14 (26.4%), and 5 (10.0%) subjects, 
respectively, for  the Brilacidin 0.6 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg, 0.6/0.3 mg/kg and daptomycin groups. 
Of note, the incidence of blood- pressure related AEs  in the daptomycin group was higher than 
in the single dose 0.6 mg/kg arm, and daptomycin is not known to affect blood pressure. 
Hence, sensitivity of data collection and reporting would appear to indicate that, for the reporting in this study, the background rate for such blood pressure related AEs is up to ~10%, and that for the single dose 0.6 mg/kg arm, the incidence indicates no distinct drug-related adverse effects. None of the reported  blood pressure events were considered serious or 
severe; in any treatment arm, and the majority were reported as  related to study drug.

Safety Profile: Five (5) days multiple dose regimen  
The adverse events summary from Phase 2 a Study PMX63 -203 is presented in Table 6. Safety 
analysis showed 87% of patients in  the highest dose group experienced at least one peripheral 
sensory effect, primarily tingling (paresthesia) and numbness (hypoesthesia). The lowest dose produced sensory effects in 65% of patients. Excluding numbness/tingling, the treatment-related adverse event rates were similar across  treatment groups.

Approximately 80% of the sensory effec ts caused by [CONTACT_95302] r

did not require medi cal int ervention. All (100%) of pa tients having a sensory AE had 
resolution of these effects by [CONTACT_95303]. There were no discontinuations due 
to sensor y AEs (numbne ss/tin gling). 
There w ere no d eaths  in the study, and 5 pat ients  experienced  a serious adverse  event ( SAE) 
of which 3 SAEs were regarded as treatment -related. These treatment -related SAEs were 
hypertensive crisis (n=1 in medium-dose group; n=1 in high-dose group; both discontinued 
study), and thrombocytosis (n=1 in low-dose group). 
Blood pressure  was measured  pre-dose, during infusion, and [ADDRESS_105363]-infusion each day 
of the 7-day tr eatment  period. Given  that antibiotics  are dos ed acutely – and not over a

Moreover, across the three Brilacidin  treatm ent groups, the outlier analy sis revealed a low

dose-related (low-dos e, 1 event; medium-dos e, 2 events; high-dos e, 3 events); howev er, 
geogra phic clust ering is a potential confound er, as these cases occurred at just 3 of the 21 
enrolling site s. On ly one of these patients (high-dose group) had elevated SBP ≥180 mmHg 
for two cons ecutive mea surements (next day). 
There were three patients (from the medium and high dose groups) who developed 
hypertension near 220/120 mmHg. When study drug was discontinued and patients were 
treated with anti-hypertensive medications, their blood pressure decreased. In all cases, blood

 pressure increases were observed as gradual over hours or days allowing for prompt medical 
intervention. 
Given the overall risk:benefit assessment for use of Brilacidin in treatment of COVID -19, the 
proposed protocol doses of Brilacidin are supported by t he available safety data in the 
previous Phase 2 , and additional Phase 1, clinical studies  with Brilacidin administered 
intravenously. Blood pressure monitoring during study treatment to monitor for safety alerts is 
described in Section 1.4.2. 
1.4.2.  Vital Signs Measurements during Study Treatment  
The blood pressure data from the prior Phase 2 ABSSSI program was examined for the 
following criteria:  
• Systolic blood pressure increased: ≥180 and increase from baseline ≥20  
• Diastolic blood pressure increased: ≥110 and increase from baseline ≥15

In Study PMX63 -203, single BP values were measured; in Study CTIX -BRI-204, single BP values was reported as the average of triplicate 
measurements. A confirmed value is a value either repeated at timepoint, or by [CONTACT_95306] a different timepoint.  
In Study PMX63-203, patients that met the BP noted were typi[INVESTIGATOR_95236], with IV and/or oral anti -hypertensive treatments; in Study CTIX -BRI-204, 
such concomitant treatment was not initiated.

 Vital signs were measured more intensely in Study CTIX- BRI-204 than in Study PMX63-
203. 
In this study, blood pressure and pulse rate measurements will be measured more intensely 
during the treatment period with s tudy drug, during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. On Days 1-3 (and 
potentially Day 4- 5 also, after initial interim safety readout) , measurements will be made pre -
dose, within no more than 30 mins after the end of infusion, and 3 hours (± 30 mins) post- start 
of infusion (i.e., ~[ADDRESS_105366]-end of infusion). 
If systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥ 20 mmHg, the 
measurement is to be repeated within 15 -30 minutes. If the repeat measurement is confirmed, 
the attending physician is to review the patient profile and determine if treatment for 
hypertension is needed. After a confirmed systolic blood pressure elevation, blood pressure measurements are to be performed approximately every 4 hours or as frequently as necessary in accordance with local standar d of care. 
Similarly, if diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥ [ADDRESS_105367] of care.  
See Section 8.1.5 (Adverse Events of Special Interest/ Blood Pressure category reporting) and 
Section 9.2 ( Interim Analyses/ Data Monitoring Committee  Reviews ). 
1.4.3.  PK/PD Modeling of Antiviral Efficacy Parameters for Selected Doses  
The potential for the selected  dose regimens to achieve efficacy in human has been modeled, 
using plasma concentration data from the prior Phase 2b study (for the ABSSSI development program) and comparing to derived in vitro antiviral efficacy parameters (IC50 and IC90) from experiment s with human lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].  (The CC10 was also included in the 
preliminary modeling readouts, but is  removed from final assessment readouts as that 
parameter – as an indicator of a safety margin – is not relevant since it is far above achievable Cmax concentrations following selected regimen dosing.) 
Using a previously-developed population PK model describing the disposition of B rilacidin 
(developed for the ABSSSI program - Van Wart et al 2015; Van Wart et al [ICPD] 2016 ), 
calculated PK /PD targets generated from the in vitro  antiviral analyses  (i.e., the IC50 and 
IC90, see  Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), and de mographic characteristics from clinical studies conducted  
with Brilacidin in patients with ABSSSI , an R Shiny simulation application was  created to 
evaluate various Br ilacidin dosing regimens for the treatment of patients with COVID -19. 
Protein binding is not adjusted for in the model, as the protein load in the in vitro assays  has 
not been calculated  - 10% fetal bovine serum is present in the Calu-3 cell culture. The total 
plasma Brilacidin concentrations is presented in the modeling, and the total concentration of Brilacidin present in vitro  used . 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 43 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 Final  modeling readouts for the selected dose regimens are shown in Figure 6 an d Figure  7. 
The concentration- time profiles are presented on linear (A , left panel) and semi -log (B, right 
panel) Y axes .  
Plots of the median and 90% prediction interval (PI) for total plasma Brilacidin concentrations 
are shown, simulated for the selected dosing regimens. The IC90 and IC50 parameters from in 
vitro, as Brilacidin free -base values, are shown as dotted red -lines and are labelled 
accordingly. 
The figures demonstrate that the in vitro viral inhibition parameters of IC50 and IC90 are 
clinically -achievable concentrations for a sustained duration of time with the selected 
regimens :  
• For the 3 days multiple dose regimen [of 0.6 mg/kg (D1), 0.3 mg/kg (D2 and D3)], 
over the 7 days (168 hours) after start of treatment the simulated population median is above the IC50 threshold for 10 3 hours, with the IC90 threshold exceeded for 40.7 
hours. 
• For the 5 days multiple dose regimen [of 0.6 mg/kg (D1), 0.3 mg/kg (D2 to D5)], over the 7 days (168 hours) after start of treatment the simulated population median is above the IC50 threshold for 152 hours, with the IC90 threshold exceeded for 63.7 hours.

The modeling is only taking one therapeutic property of Brilacidin into consideration - i.e., 
it’s applying in vitro antiviral parameter targets to simulated in vivo human plasma concentration s, without taking into consideration the anti- inflammatory potential of Brilacidin 
in vivo, which should also be able to impact the course of COVID-19 disease.  
Given the limitations of modeling, particularly application between in vitro and in vivo 
systems, the proposed doses selected appear appropriate for testing in this Phase 2 Proof- of 
Concept study. Selecting doses within the range previously tested in the Phase 2 program for 
the indication of ABSSSI also allows for an expected safety profile and known expectation of associated safety signals with those Brilacidin dose regimens.

Screening/ Baseline visit (Day -1 to 1): Lasts up to 24-48 hours and comprises screening/ 
baseline assessment s. This visit will confirm that study inclusion and exclusion crite ria are 
met by [CONTACT_95267]. 
Treatment period (Day 1-3 with potential to expand to Day 4-5):  Randomized subjects will 
receive blinded study treatment once daily by [CONTACT_16228], in addition to SoC.  
Follow-up period (Day 4-6 through D ay 60):  Subjects will be assessed daily while 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] . Discharged  patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 29. (Of 
note: the median hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95237]-19 has been reported to be 12 days with an 
interquartile range of 1 to 14 days [ Cao et al 2020] ). All subjects will undergo a series of 
efficacy and safety assessments, including laboratory assays. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs will be obtained on D ays 1 , 3, 5, 8, 11 (while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and/or

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]). Note: NP swab s are to be collected . 
If subjects are discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] 15, or Day 29, and a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95211], then visiting  nursing services and mobile phlebotomy may support that  visit 
remotely where these are available in accordance with local guidelines and should include all possible assessments (e.g., oxygen saturation with portable monitors). Every effort should be made to ensure discharged patient follow-up at Days 15 and 29, via a healthcare interaction (minimally by [CONTACT_65859]) . A follow-up visit at Day 60(±10), by [CONTACT_65859], is also 
included to confirm patient status. 
All subjects  receive local SoC, plus allocated study treatment in addition. T wo IV study 
treatment arms  are planned : 
• SoC + Brilacidin IV 0.6 mg/kg (D1), 0.3 mg/kg (D2 and D3) with potential to expand 
dosing
a of 0.3 mg/kg on D4 and D5 
• SoC + Saline IV infusion (D1, D2, and D 3) with potential to expand dosinga on D4 
and D5 
a Note: Dependent on safety review  and recommendation by [CONTACT_941] D MC. 
D1, D2, and D3 (above) refer to Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 of study treatment. Similarly, D4 and D5 are Day 4 and 
Day 5 . 
Treatment randomization is 1:1 (n=60 per arm). Randomization will also be stratified by 
(1) Age (≤65  years, >65 years), (2) Severity of disease (moderate, severe) , and (3) Country. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to conduct periodic safety reviews  (Section 8.1.6). An initial safe ty review  is planned to occur after approximately 
[ADDRESS_105370] occurred in the 
approximately 20 subjec ts to receive Days 1 -3 of study treatment. A further safety review by 
[CONTACT_95309] 50% of subjects have completed up to Day 29, to allow for unblinded monitoring of safety data around the study mid-point. T he D MC 
may recommend expanding dosing to Days 4 and 5 ( at the same doses as on Days 2 and 3 ), 
continuation of the Days 1-3 study dosing unchanged, or that the trial be interrupted or stopped for safety reasons. The DMC will be guided by [CONTACT_95279]/ events observed in the ongoing study which should not exceed the 
number and/or severity of those observed in previous studies with Bril acidin IV treatment  for 
expansion of dosing to occur as planned. 
The rationale for looking to expand treatment duration to five days, from the initial dose 
regimen of three days, is to be able to provide a longer duration of systemic Brilacidin exposure at a level that can strongly suppress SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_105371] of 
Brilacidin treatment and provide enhanced benefit to the patient, with the 5-day regimen

placebo in addition to available SoC. Subjects  that are eligible will be randomized to one of 
the following t wo IV study treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1  (n=60 per arm)  
• SoC + Brilacidin IV 0.6 mg/kg (D1), 0.3 mg/kg (D2 and D3) with potential to expand 
dosinga of 0.3 mg/kg on D4 and D5 
• SoC + Saline IV infusion (D1, D2, and D3) with potential to expand dosinga on D4 
and D5 
a Note: Dependent on safety review  and recommendation by [CONTACT_941] D MC. 
D1, D2, and D3 (above) refer to Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 of study treatment.  Similarly, D4 and D5 are Day 4 and 
Day 5.  
Randomization of subjects to treatment will also be stratified by (1) Age (≤65 years, >65 years), (2) Severity of disease (moderate, severe) , and (3) Country. 
Brilacidin for Injection concentrated solution, for dilution with normal saline for subsequent IV infusion, will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. SoC administered alongside the study treatment 
will be supplied by [CONTACT_2727].  
5.2.  Subject Numbering  
Each subject screened is assigned a unique subject number, which is a combination of the site number (three-digit) that is provided by [CONTACT_1034], and a three-digit sequential number assigned at  the site.  Once assigned to a subject, the subject number will not be reused.  
At each study site, the first subject is assigned subject number -001, and subsequent subjects are assigned consecutive numbers (e.g., the second subject is assigned subject number -002, the third subject is assigned subject number -003). The Investigator or site staff will contact [CONTACT_32629] T system and provide the requested identifying information for the subject to register 
them . 
If the subjects fails to be randomized for any reason, the IRT system must be notified of the decision being taken that the subject was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered into the eCRF /IRT system . 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105377] ’s randomization number generated by [CONTACT_95312] a subject will be shared 
with the site’s unblinded pharmacist, and they will consult the open randomization code previously provided to them for this study.  
The unblinded pharmacist will keep the randomization code confidential throughout the conduct of the study, except in the event of subject medical emergencies for which individual subject unblinded may be initiated .  
5.4.  Emergency Unblinding of Treatment  
In the event of a medical emergency, the subject -specific treatment may be identified; 
however, every effort should be made to maintain the blind. Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol violation.  
Where possible, the Investigator (or designated physici an) sh all contact [CONTACT_95313].  The subject -specific treatment code can be obtained from the site’s unblinded pharmacist, or 
from contact[CONTACT_95314]. Instructions on 
how to perform an unblinding will be provided separately. 
Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind is to be reported immediately to the 
Sponsor. Wh en the blinding code for a subject has been broken, the reason must be fully 
documented.  
5.5.  Investigational Product Sup plies 
5.5.1.  Description  
The investigational drug product supplied is Brilacidin for Injection, 50 mg/mL (free  base), 
provided in 2 mL glass via ls with 1 mL extractable volume, to be stored  frozen at  -20±5°C. 
The provided solution formulation contai ns 50 mg/mL of Brilacidin free base and 20% w/v 
hydroxypropyl- beta-cyclodextrin (Kleptose HPB) in water for injection. Brilacidin sterile 
concentrated solution is a clear, colorless to yellow to brown solution supplied in 2 mL clear 
glass vials with 13 mm Omn iflex Plus serum stoppers and sealed with flip off seals. Each vial 
has a fill volume ~1.2 mL to ensure 1.0 mL extractable volume per vial. The sterile solution formulation provided requires further dilution with normal saline for subsequent intravenous infusion. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 55 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 The 2 mL glass vials are labelled as containing “Brilacidin for Injection, 50 mg/mL (free 
base)  for 1.0 mL extractable volume”. 
Brilacidin IV infusion requires unblinded pharmacist preparation at the study site; allows for blinded treatment adminis tration by [CONTACT_95274]. 
5.5.2.  Storage Conditions 
Brilacidin vials  must be stored according to the labeled storage conditions, which is to be 
stored frozen at -20±5°C . The  Investigator, or an approved representative (e.g., pharmacist, 
designat ed study site staff member), will ensure that all investigational product is stored in a 
secured and locked area with restricted access . 
If any investigational product is deemed to have been exposed to temperatures outside the range noted above, the supplies should not be administered to any participant until the Sponsor provides further direction. 
5.5.3.  Packaging and Labeling  
Vials will be packaged in cartons of at least 10 vials.  
Vial and carton labels will be in the local language (or in English in case allowed according to 
local regulation) and comply with the legal requirements of each country, as applicable. Labeling  will include storage conditions for the study treatment and clearly identify for 
investigational use only. 
5.5.4.  Dose Preparation  
For intraven ous infusion administration, Brilacidin for Injection is diluted in sterile 0.9% w/v 
sodium chloride (normal saline)  to provide the desired final dose within 8 hours of 
administration. Placebo IV infusion will be sterile 0.9% w/v sodium chloride (normal sa line).  
Intravenous infusion requires unblinded pharmacist (or appropriate designee) preparation, 
with appropriate mg/kg per study participant prepared. The Brilacidin dose will be prepared according to the protocol- specified treatment regimen (see Section 5.1).  Dose calculation for a 
subject’s study treatment infusions will be based on actual body weight measured at Screening.  
Dose preparation is to be conducted by [CONTACT_95315] ( or 
appropriate designee) , the “dose preparer”. Prior to dilution, the appropriate number of 
Brilacidin vial (s) will be removed from freezer storage and thawed at room temperature for 
approximately 1 hour. The thawed vial(s) should be mixed by [CONTACT_5237]. The dose preparer will document on the appropriate vial labels the subject randomization number and date the vial was opened/used.  
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 56 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 Using aseptic technique, the appropriate volume of Brilacidin 50 mg/mL (free base)  required 
for subject dosing is to  be added to a plastic infusion bag containing sterile 0.9 % saline, to 
achieve a final volume of [ADDRESS_105378]'s study number, randomization number, dose date, 
and protocol study number will be attached onto the infusion bag containing the prepared dose; the label will be blinded to the study treatment to be administered.  
The desired final dose in the infusion bag can be prepared within eight (8) hours of administration.  The prepared, diluted drug product in the infusion bag is to be stored at room 
temperature not above 25°C , 77° F, in-between preparation and administration. 
Any unused Brilacidin 50 mg/mL (free base) solution remaining in an opened vial should be retained for performing drug accountability. Any next dose (s) for a subject is /(are)  to be 
prepared from unopened frozen vials. 
5.5.5.  Administration of Prepared Dose  
Diluted Brilacidin solution is stored at room temperature not above 25°C , 77°F, prior to use 
and is filtered through a 0.[ADDRESS_105379] to maintain blinding. The identity  of the prepared dose will be concealed by [CONTACT_95316].  
The prepared study dose in the infusion bag provided to the medical staff will be administered 
intravenously by [CONTACT_95317] a 60 ±5 minute  interval  into the peripheral vein; the 
IV infusion set must include an in -line 0.2 μm membrane filter.  
The IV line for study treatment should be dedicated. IV lines should not be flushed with 
dextrose 5% in water (D5W). Approximately two  (or more) mL  of 0.9 % saline may be used 
to flush the line  before and after administration. Heparin (in 0.9% saline) may also be used 
following study treatment administration to keep the catheter patent.  
5.6.  Investigational Product Handling and Accountability  
Investigational product must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and 
stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and 
designated site staff have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according 
to the instructions specified on the label. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the current disposition of the study 
treatments  is maintained at his/her study site where investigational product is inventoried and 
dispensed.  
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105380]/packaging must be retained at the site until the conclusion of the study or until permission for disposition is granted. The study monitor will complete the final drug accountability and assist the site with return and/or destruction of investigational product/packaging at the end of the study. Used IV related supplies will be destroyed after use in compliance with local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95239].

 6.  THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_95240]  
6.1.  Concomitant Medications and Concurrent  Procedures  
All medications , procedures, non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood 
transfusions) administered after the participant was enrolled into the study  will be  captured in 
the eCR F.  
Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited 
medication. If in doubt, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_95318] a participant or allowing a new medication to be started. If the subject is already enrolled, contact [CONTACT_95319]. 
For subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] 29, they must be told to notify the t reating 
physician about any new medications he/ she takes through end of the study. During the course of the study, subjects may receive antiviral treatment, intravenous, oral or 
inhaled corticosteroids, antibiotics and other agents where these forms part of SoC for the treatment  of COVID -19 at their participating site.  
6.1.1.  Concomitant Medications to be used with caution 
Using the January 2020 FDA Guidance for in vitro DDI studies, available data indicates there is a potential for Brilacidin to reversibly inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 with a possible although probably not likely time-dependent inhibition of CYP2B6. (P lease refer to 
the Investigator’s B rochure for additional information). 
Investigators may, at their discretion, co-administer known inhibitors of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
and CYP3A4 during study treatment, but their duration should be kept as short as possible, 
and patients are to  be closely monitored. Particularly, caution is advised when study treatment 
is co-administered with drugs that are sensitive substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP3A4  and/or have a narrow therapeutic index. Table [ADDRESS_105381] of some c linical 
substrates for CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A P450- mediated metabolism 
The patient and the treating physician should be aware of potential signs of adverse effects/ overdose of concomitant medication (s) and in the event of suspected study drug related 
toxicity; administration of study drug should be held according to the treating physician’s judgement.

Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 7.3.  Effic acy Assessments  
7.3.1.  Clinical Status  
Assessment of clinical status will be made using an 8-point ordinal scale, adapted from scales 
published ( WHO 2020a ; WHO 2020c ), and following the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID ) ordinal scale framework (as used in ACTT trials).  
Each day the worse score for the previous day will be recorded, i.e., on Day 3, Day 2 score is obtained and recorded as Day 2. For  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] , assessment is made for baseline 
(Day 1), Day 2, and every day until Day 29 (end of study). If a subject is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], assessment is to be sought by [CONTACT_21955] (between 7AM and 12 PM local time) up to 
Day [ADDRESS_105384] is successfully discharged before Day 15 , and also on Day 29. 
Table 11: Clinical Status 8 -point Ordinal Scale  
Score  Description  
1 Death   
2 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  
3 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non -invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen 
devices  
4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring low- flow su pplemental oxygen 
5 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring 
ongoing medical care (COVID -19 related or otherwise)  
6 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer 
requires ongoing medical care (other than for per protocol dosing or 
assessments, as appropriate)  
7 Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities and/or requiring home 
oxygen  
8 Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities  
7.3.2. National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) 
The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) has demonstrated an ability to discriminate subjects at risk of poor outcomes ( Williams et al 2012 ). This score is based on seven ( 7) 
clinical parameters. NEWS2  values  reported for the study will be calculated electronically 
based on vital sign parameters and NEWS2  related assessments recorded by [CONTACT_95321] s. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 62 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 In addition to the vital signs – whereby , in addition to systolic blood pressure, the associated 
diastolic blood pressure must also be entered into the appropriate additional eCRF field – the 
patient’s level of consciousness and the presence/absence of respir atory support must be 
recorded.  The NEWS2  parameter for respi[INVESTIGATOR_95242] 
“oxygen” can include other forms of ventilation to maintain oxygen saturation. These should be recorded at the same time points as the vital sign measurements  (see Section 7.5.2).  
Table 12: National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) 
 
SpO 2 = oxygen saturation  
The oxygen saturation should be scored according to either the SpO 2 Scale 1 or 2 presented in 
Table 12 . The SpO 2 Scale 2 is for patients with a target oxygen saturation requirement of 
88%-92% (e.g., in patients with hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_95243], such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD]).  This should only be used in 
patients confirmed to have hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_95244] a prior or their c urrent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
The decision to use the SpO 2 Scale 2 should be made by [CONTACT_95322].  In all other circumstances, the SpO 2 Scale 1 should be used. 
For physiological parameter “Air or Oxygen?”: Any patients requiring the use of oxygen or other forms of ventilation to maintain oxygen saturations and support respi[INVESTIGATOR_95245] a score of 2. 

Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105385] clinical condition of the 
patient during the assessment.  Patients who are assessed as “Alert” (A) should be assigned a 
score of 0. Patients assessed as “New Confusion” (C), “Responsive to Voice” (V), “Responsive to Pain” (P), or “Unconscious” should be assigned a score of 3. 
Scores should be assigned for respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic blood pressure, pulse, and temperature 
according to Table 12. 
For the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95246] , the measurements 
of the NEWS2 are to  be performed twice daily. All parameters – including the vital sign 
parameters and oxygen saturation – should be recorded together in the morning, and then 
between noon and midnight, for the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95216]. Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95247] (Days 15 and 29). 
Repeat measurements may be taken , as clinically appropriate. 
7.3.3.  In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95248] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95249]:  
• Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]* 
• Time to discharge 
• Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation 
• Duration of supplemental oxygen support 
• Durat ion of ECMO 
• No oxygen therapy (and/or peripheral oxygen saturation SpO
2 > 93% on room air) at 
Days 8, 15 and 29 
*If a subject is unable to be discharged due to administrative reasons, then the date that the 
subject, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is ready to be discharged to be reported in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95250]. 
7.4. Other Assessments  
7.4.1.  SARS -CoV- 2 virus testing  
SARS -CoV-2 virus is to be measured using PCR or equivalent/ other approved diagnostic 
testing at Screening, except for those subjects who have had another valid ated test done 
within [ADDRESS_105386] result is needed prior to 
randomization. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 64 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 Nasopharyngeal ( NP) swab  samples are to be collected from the pre-dose assessment through 
Day 11 (while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057])  and/or on day of discharge; and Days 15 and 29 (by [CONTACT_95323]/ remote visit or if still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) .  
Swab collection is to be pre-dose on dosing days; efforts are to be made to allow for swabs to 
be collected at appr oximately the same time each collection day throughout the study. 
Note : NP swab s are to be collected . In exceptional circumstances only, such as NP swabs 
cannot be used due to participant nasal physiology, the collection method for all samples from such a subject may be altered to Oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, if provided for by [CONTACT_6626].  
Collected swabs are to be stored in  the refrigerator/ or  a -20°C or -70°C  freezer , with the 
temperature of storage likely dependent on the time between collection and shipment. 
Subsequently, samples are expected to be batch shipped on dry ice to a central laboratory for testing. Follow instructions provided in a separate laboratory manual. 
Swab samples will be assayed using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR to quantify SARS-
CoV- [ADDRESS_105387] treatment blinding is maintained. 
7.4.2.  Biomarkers  
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of  biological and immunological markers of 
illness/inflammation . These will include: 
Local laboratory testing: CRP, ferritin, LDH, D-dimer, troponin T hs, absolute neutrophil 
count [at Screening, Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11 (while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and/or on day of discharge ; and 
Days 15 and 29 (by [CONTACT_95324][INVESTIGATOR_057])]  – see Section  7.5.3. 
Central laboratory testing: IL -1β, IL -6, IL-10, total IL -18, TNF- α [at Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 11 
(while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and/or on day of discharge; and Day 15 (by [CONTACT_95324][INVESTIGATOR_057])] . 
For central laboratory testing samples, follow instructions outlined in the laboratory manual regarding sample collection, numbering, processing, storage and shipment. 
Sample analysis may be performed ongoing or in batches. Analytical data will be shared with 
care while the study is ongoing, to ensure that for study personnel the subject treatment blinding is maintained.

Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 7.4.3.  Drug Concentration Measurements (Pharmacokinetic Assessments)  
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of Brilacidin concentration in plasma.  
Sparse sampling will be performed on Days 1 to 4.  
All blood samples for PK assessments will be drawn from the opposite arm than that used to 
administer study treatment, or from an alternate site other than the arm used for the study treatment infusion . 
Samples will be collected as follows: 
• Day 1: pre-dose, within 30 mins  after the end of infusion, and between 8-12  hours 
from start of the  Day 1  infusion. 
• Day 2: pre-dose (approximately 24 hours from start of the Day 1 infusion)  
• Day 3: pre-dose (approximately 24 hours from the start of the Day 2 infusion)  
• Day 4: at approximately [ADDRESS_105388] time of study drug dosing preceding the sample are recorded in the eCRF . 
Blood samples (approximately 3 mL) to provide approximately 1 mL of plasma for PK analysis will be collected in appropriately labeled  tubes containing potassium EDTA at the 
times specified. Samples are to be centr ifuged at approximately 2000 g for about 10 minutes 
at 4°C within  a target of  30 minutes after collection; separated plasma is to be transferred into 
the appropriately labeled screw -capped polypropylene tubes and stored at -2 0°C ± 5 °C until 
shipped.  
Additional instructions are outlined in the laboratory manual regarding sample collection, 
numbering, processing, storage and shipment. 
Samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass 
spectrometry detection  (LC-MS/MS) assay method . Sample analysis may be performed 
ongoing or in batches. Analytical data will be shared (with Sponsor study team 
members/designees) with care while the  study is ongoing, to ensure that for study personnel 
the subject treatment blinding is maintained.  
7.4.4.  Recording Concomitant Medications and Concurrent Procedures  
Relevant prior, and any concomitant medications or concurrent procedures used from the time the subject signs the ICF through the end of study, must be recorded i n the eCRF  on an 
ongoing basis. Details recorded  may  include the medication name/ dose / route of 
administration  or procedure name, start and stop dates, and indication for use .

 7.5.  Safety Assessments 
7.5.1.  Physical Exam, Height and Weight 
Physical examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_39595], Sub-Investigator or appropriately 
qualified designee (e.g., Physician’s Assistant, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Practitioner, or Registered Nurse as per local regulations). At the Screening visit a complete physical examination is to be conducted, including skin, neck (including thyroid), HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurologic systems. Clinically relevant findings that are present prior to signing informed consent are to  be recorded on the appropriate eCRF that captures medical history. Height will 
be measured at Screening also . Subsequent visit assessments can be an abbreviated physical 
examination (including at a minimum: HEENT, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities and 
examination of any body system where there are symptoms reported by [CONTACT_70579] t). 
Height and body weight are to be measured with the subject in indoor clothing and shoes removed. Height is to be recorded to the nearest [ADDRESS_105389], the finding may be considered an AE. Refer to Section 
8.1. 
7.5.2.  Vital Signs  and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_95251], systolic and diastolic blood pressures and body temperature 
(recorded in °C) as per local practice.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_95252] , if 
possible. Documentation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_95253], and details of

• Oxygen supplementation: room air, low flow O 2 (L/min and %), high flow O 2 (L/min  
and % ), CPAP/BIPAP (FiO 2 or %), mechanical ventilation (FiO 2 or %), ECMO . 
Measurements are to be performed twice daily. ( The measurements will assist in comple ting 
the NEWS2 score twice daily , while the subject is outside of the ICU) . The vital sign 
parameters and oxygen saturation should be recorded together in the morning, and then between noon and midnight, for the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95247] (Days 15 and 29). 
Repeat measurements may be taken , as clinically appropriate. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105390], the finding may be considered an AE. Refer to 
Section  8.1. 
During Study Treatment 
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements will be measured more intensely during the treatment period with study drug, during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. On Days 1-3 (and potentially Day 4-5 also, after initial interim safety readout), measurements will be made pre -dose, within no 
more than 30 mins after the end of infusion, and 3 hours (±30 mins) post-start of infusion (i.e., ~[ADDRESS_105391]-end of infusion). 
If systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥ [ADDRESS_105392] of care. 
Similarly, if diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥ [ADDRESS_105393] of care. 
See Section 8.1.5 (Adverse Events of Special Interest/ Blood Pressure category reporting) and 
Section 9.2 ( Interim Analyses/ Data Monitoring Committee  Reviews ). 
7.5.3.  Laboratory Evaluations 
A certified local laboratory will perform the clinical laboratory tests for this study, as outlined in Table 13. The laboratory will be local to the study site.  
Reports of laboratory results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_26359].  For each laboratory test result outside the reference range, the Investigator must ascertain if 
the abnormal lab result is a clinically significant result for that individual subject. This determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal value is observed; the Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test.  
The Investigator must review the results of all laboratory tests as they become available. For 
each test result outside the reference range, on the printed document (or alternate source record) the Investigator must note Not Clinically Significant (NCS) or Clinically Significant (CS) for each out of range laboratory value, and is to initial to confirm their review.

Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 7.5.5.  Recording Adverse Events (AEs)  
Adverse event s should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the subject and are to be 
recorded, graded, and assessed as defined in Section 8.[ADDRESS_105396] records, together with details of the onset, duration, the relationship to the study drug and/or related to background standard-of- care and degree of severity, the action taken 
regarding study treatment, if other medication or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95254] (concomitant medication/non-drug therapy), and the outcome. 
If an AE constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE), the procedure outlined in Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_105397] be discontinued under the following circumstances: 
• Subject decision , for any reason  
• Investigator believes that continuation  would negatively impact the subject's overall 
status  or the risk/benefit of study treatment  
• Sever e hypersensitivity reaction occurs, including any of the following: anaphylaxis, 
fever, chills, urticaria, dyspnea, headache, myalgia, and hypotension. Immediate 
discontinuation of study treatment and initiation of appropriate medical treatment is 
required  in such cases.  
• Any protocol deviation or situation that results in a significant risk to the subject’s safety.  
Transient hypertensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_95255]. 
If adverse events  emerge, as assessed by [CONTACT_95325], that meet 
criteria for hypertensive urgency (e.g., SBP >220 mmHg or DBP >120 mmHg) or 
hypertensive emergency , the investigator is to consider temporarily stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_95256].  
If discontinuation of study treatment occurs for a subject , the investigator must determine the 
primary reason for the discontinuation of study treatment and record this information. Subjects  who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 70 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw 
their consent (see Section  7.6.2). Where possible, subjects are to  continue with (if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or return for the assessments indicated in the Schedule of Activities  (Table 1).  If 
they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, e-mail, and letter) should be made to contact [CONTACT_423] /pre-designated person contact [CONTACT_95326] -up section (Section 7.6.3). This contact [CONTACT_95327]. 
If the subject cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular 
telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], or with a person pre-designated by [CONTACT_95328].  
After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data 
should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact:  
• New / concomitant treatments  
• Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events 
Subjec ts who discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 
7.6.2.  Withdrawal of informed consent  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in  the study for any reason at any 
time at their own request. 
Withdrawal of consent occurs only when a subject requests the following: 
• Does not want to participate in the study any more;  
and 
• Does not want any further visits or assessments;  
and 
• Does not want any further study- related contacts.  
In this situation, the investigator should make reasonable efforts (e.g., telephone, e- mail, 
letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent 
and record this information. 
Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that 
would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. All efforts should 
be made to complete the assessments prior to study discontinuation. A final evaluation at the time of the subject ’s study discontinuation should be made as detailed in the a ssessment table.  
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research results (data) for the subject that have already been collected as part of study evaluations. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105398] show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_762], e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject s hould not be considered as lost to follow-up 
until due diligence has been completed or until the completion of the study. 
7.7.  Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_73399] (DMC) will review safety at intervals during the 
study, including mortality and SAEs. Enrollment in the study will be placed on hold if any of the following occurs: 
• There is a doubling of the mortality rate on Brilacidin treatment compared to placebo, with data stratified by [CONTACT_654]/ severity/ country (assessed after appro ximatel y 50% of 
subjects have enrolled/completed)  
• The number and/or severity of AEs, including Adverse Events of Special Interest 
(AESIs)  (Section 8.1.5), abnormal safety monitoring assessment s, or abnormal 
laboratory findings justify putting the study on hold (assessed after approximately 20 subjects, and after 50% of subjects, have enrolled/ completed) . 
The study may resume following the safety review, if the DMC and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed.  Alternatively, the study may be stopped. 
Recommendation guidelines and further details of the DMC will be  prepared separately from 
this protocol in a D MC Charte r. The charter may super sede the summary details presented 
here in the protocol. See Section 8.1.6. 
7.8.  Early Study Termination  by [CONTACT_95329]. Should this be 
necessary, the Sponsor and the investigators will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are completed, and that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests.

 8.  SAFETY  MONITORING  
8.1.  Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Definition s 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, 
disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury, or accident) in a clinical- trial subject that emerges or worsens after providing writte n 
informed consent for participation in the study. The untoward medical occurrence may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of medicinal [investigational] product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal  [investigational] product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal [investigational] product. 
Pre-existing medical conditions/diseases (i.e., medical history(ies)) are considered AEs if th ey 
worsen after administration of a medicinal [investigational] product. Abnormal laboratory 
values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, or are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined  as an adverse event that meets one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is anothe r significant medical event as defined below:  
Significant medical events are those that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], and based upon appropriate medical judgment, an event that might jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Any of the above must be reported immediately to the Sponsor or designee as indicated in the Immediately Reportable Serio us Adverse Event section of this protocol. 
Pre-Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95257], but rather a therapeutic intervention.  However, if during the pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95258], the event will be considered an SAE.  Surgeries or interventions that were under 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 73 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 consideration but not performed prior to enrollment in the study will not be considered serious 
if they are performed after enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95259]. 
Note : The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Sever ity (or intensity) refers to 
the grade of an AE (see below).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition . 
8.1.2.  Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determinin g the severity of the 
event. Severity is graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 when applicable. For an AE not found on the CTCAE listing, they will be allocated a grade according to the following guidelines. 
Grade 1   Mild Adverse Event (any of the following):  
• Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated, or non- prescription intervention indicated; asymptomatic 
laboratory finding only; marginal clinical relevance. 
Grade 2   Moderate Adverse Event (any of the following): 
• Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting (age-appropriate) instrumental Activities of Daily Living [ADL] (e.g., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, laundry). 
Grade 3   Severe Adverse Event (any of the following): 
• Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL (e.g., 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, getting in and out of bed). 
Grade 4   Life-threatening Adverse Event (any of the following): 
• Life-threatening consequences ; urgent intervention indicated; ind ividual at risk of 
death at the time of the event if immediate intervention is not undertaken. 
Grade 5   Fatal  Adverse Event:  
• Death related to AE . 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 74 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 8.1.3.  Causality of Adverse Events 
The relationship is characterized as:  
• Not Related / Unlikely Related : There is not a temporal or causal relationship between 
the use of the study drug and the onset of the AE; no association of the event to use of 
study drug.  
• Possible : There may or may not be a reasonable temporal relationship between the us e 
of the study drug and the onset of the AE; the association of the event with the study drug is unknown, however, a relationship between drug and event cannot be ruled out.  
• Probable : There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the us e of the study 
drug and the onset of the AE; the association of the event with the study drug seems likely  and the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_95330]/underlying illness, other 
drugs or procedures. 
• Definite : The re is a reasonable temporal relationship between the use of th e study drug 
and the onset of the AE, and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_95331]’ s clinical state, environment or other drugs or procedures. 
It disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study drug and reappe ars with 
re-administration  of the study drug.  
For the purpose of regulatory safety reporting, AEs that are assessed  as not related/unlikely 
related to the study drug, as per the protocol definition, will not qualify as adverse reactions (see Section 8.1.4).  
Information about common side effects already known about the study medication can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure. A summary of this information will be included in the informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. 
8.1.4.  Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Any SAE  during the Screening, Treatment, and Follow -up (through Day 29) periods, whether 
deemed related to study treatment  or not, must be reported by [CONTACT_95332] 24 hours of their awareness of the event. Any new 
SAE(s) reported by [CONTACT_95333]-up period (through Day 29) that are suspected by [CONTACT_95334] a causal relationship with the study treatment  should be reported to Sponsor or the authorized representative within 
24 hours of their awareness of the event. Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow-
up information) is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
Summary of actions to be taken by [CONTACT_737]: 
• Investigator to complete and forward an SAE Form (within 24 hours) with all 
information known to date, including Investigat or’s assessment of causality.  
• If the event is fatal or life -threatening, the Investigator is to telephone the Sponsor or 
the authorized representative immediately on awareness of event.  
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 75 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 • Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records (discharge summary, autopsy report, 
etc.) relating to the subject’s treatment and follow -up. 
• Provide follow-up and/or updated information to Sponsor or the authorized representative, as it becomes available.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be related to the investigational study drug, the Sponsor or the authorized representative may urgently require further information from the Investigator for Health Authority reporting. Sponsor or the authorized representative may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has be en 
reported. Suspected unexpected serious adverse r eaction s (S[LOCATION_003]R s) will be collected and 
reported to the competent author ities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with 
national regulatory requirements (in participating countries) and any local requirements. 
The Investigator will collect information on SAEs until a subject’s health has returned to the 
baseline state of health, or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition. The Investigator must report follow-up information as and when it becomes known to the Investigator.  
Any new SAEs reported by [CONTACT_95335], and the IRB/IEC, as required.  
8.1.5.  Adverse Events of Special Interest/ Blood Pressure category reporting  
Adverse events  of special interest (AESIs) are (i) hypertension Grade 3 or greater, and (ii) 
paresthesias / dysesthesias Grade 2 or greater .  
The CTCAE (version 5.0 ) details , including definitions, for AESIs are provided in Table 14.

Blood pressure measurements will also be summarized for the following criteria:  
• Systolic blood pressure increased: ≥180 and increase from baseline ≥20  
• Diastolic blood pressure increased: ≥110 and increase from baseline ≥15  
During study treatment, if a blood pressure values meets one of the above safety alert 
categories, the measurement is to be repeated within 15 -30 minutes; if the repeat 
measurement is confirmed, the attending physician is to review the patient profile and determine if treatment for hypertension is needed (see Section 7.5.2). The  Investigator or 
attending physician shall contact [CONTACT_95338]. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 77 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 Ongoing during the study, the Sponsor will closely monitor the incidence and duration of 
related Grade 3 hypertension or greater (in accordance with CTCAE criteria) , and monitor for 
incidence of confirmed hypertensive values. The Medical Monitor will review such data on a frequent basis; such safety data will also be a key component of the periodic safety review  by 
[CONTACT_1363]  (see Section 9.2).  
The incidence and duration of all paresthesias / dysesthesias Grade 2 or greater (in accordance with CTCAE criteria) will also be closely reviewed  ongoing during the study, by [CONTACT_95339], and by [CONTACT_1363] . As numbness/paresthesia has been reported as an 
uncommon manifestation of COVID-19, events regarded both as related and unrelated to study treatment will be closely monitored, and will be reviewed in relation to frequency of other peripheral nervous system AEs. 
8.1.6.  Data Monitoring Committee 
This study will include an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  which will be 
composed of at least three external medical experts familiar with the conduct of and /or data 
review of clinical studies. The DMC will conduct periodic safety reviews, and will 
recommend to the Sponsor whether to continue, modify, or terminate a clinical trial. 
Specific details regarding committee composition, responsibilities, data monitoring, 
recommendation guidelines, and meeting frequency/administration will be described in a separate DMC Charter, to be established between the Sponsor and the DMC. 
See Section 7.7 (Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]) and Section 9.2 ( Interim Analyses/ Data Monitoring 
Committee  Reviews).  
8.2.  Reporting Pregnancy/Study Drug Exposure During Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE, the outcome of any pregnancy that occurs 
during the study must be documented.  
Prior to study enrollment, study participants must agree in the ICF to take appropriate 
measures to avoid pregnancy at all times during the study, commencing from the time of consent, throughout the study and for 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056] (i.e., approximately [ADDRESS_105399] dose of study drug). If pregnancy occurs, they must agree to report the pregnancy and cooperate with the Investigator as set forth below. 
Should a pregnancy occur, the study participant must immediately inform the Investigator.  
Any female study participant receiving study drug who becomes pregnant must immediately discontinue study drug.  The Investigator should counsel the study participant, discussing any risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus.  The study participant must agree to follow up by [CONTACT_95340].  Outcome is defined as elective termination of the pregnancy, miscarriage, or delivery of the fetus.  For pregnancies with an outcome of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed by [CONTACT_13177] a minimum of eight weeks.  Any 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 78 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect noted in the infant must be reported as an SAE [within 
24 hours of awareness] .  The Investigator will notify Sponsor or its authorized representative 
of a pregnancy occurring in a study participant within [ADDRESS_105400] becoming aware of such pregnancy.  All follow-up information gathered by [CONTACT_95341] 14 days of Investigator’s first knowledge of such information.

 9.  STATISTICAL  METHODS  
Full details of the statistical methodology for summary and analyses of the data collected in 
this study will be prepared separately from this protocol in a Stati stical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
This Phase 2 Proof of Concept (PoC) study is exploratory in nature and will be initiated with a dose regimen  of Brilacidin in addition to SoC, compared to placebo with SoC. Proof of 
concept will be established by a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint or a positive direction of effect amongst multiple  efficacy  endpoints. Comparisons will be 
performed against placebo plus SoC at a one-sided type I error rate of 0.05 which will not be adjusted for multiple testing.  
The selected primary efficacy endpoint is time to sustained recovery, where recovery is defined as the participant being well enough for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], meaning the participant either no longer requires supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or is no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (with or without some limitation on activities).  
Tabulations will be produced for appropriate demographic, baseline, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters. For categorical variables, summary tables with number and percentage of subjects within each category will be presented. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics including the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values will be presented. Kaplan- Meier method s will be 
used to summarize time to event endpoints, including the 25
th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles with associated 9 0% confidence intervals, as well as percentage of events and 
censored observations. 
9.1.  Sample Size Considerations  
This study is exploratory in nature and the sample size (up to 60 per treatment arm) was 
selected to provide sufficient power under a range of alternative hypotheses to support initial PoC of Brilacidin versus SoC. The type I error will not be adjusted to account for multiple comparisons. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint of time to recovery, assuming a total of 100 subjects (50 per 
treatment arm included in analysis ), if a total of [ADDRESS_105401] 90% power with a one-sided type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_105402] ratio of 2.0 [equivalent to median time to recovery of 5 
days on Brilacidin versus 10 days on SoC]. If instead the hazard ratio is 1.67 (time to recovery 
on Brilacidin of 6 days versus 10 days on SoC) and [ADDRESS_105403] 70% power. The assumptions for sample estimation are adapted from the median time to recovery data reported for the remdesivir (11 days) treatment group in Beigel et al 2020 ; remdesivir has Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in multiple 
countries and has become SoC where available. 
A total of [ADDRESS_105404] e, for the secondary endpoint of clinical improvement (2-point increase in ordinal 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 80 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 scale) at Day 15, applying an unadjusted one-sided type I error rate of 0.05, 50 subjects per 
arm would provide 80% power to detect a treatment effect of 0.[ADDRESS_105405] 70% power to detect a treatment effect of 0.1854 under the same sample size.  (The assumptions for sample estimation are based on clinical 
improvement data reported for SoC and remdesivir treatment groups in Spi[INVESTIGATOR_95260] 2020).  
9.2.  Interim Analys es/ Data Monitoring Committee  Reviews  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to conduct periodic safety reviews  (Section 8.1.6). 
Safety data summaries and listings will be produced for DMC safety monitoring when needed . 
An initial safety review  is planned to occur after approximately [ADDRESS_105406] occurred in the approximately 20 subjects to 
receive Days 1 -3 of study treatment. A further safety review by [CONTACT_95278] 50% of subjects have completed up to Day 29, to allow for unblinded monitoring of safety data around the study mid-point. T he DMC may recommend expanding 
dosing to Days 4 and 5 (at the same doses as on Days 2 and 3), co ntinuation of the Days 1-3 
study dosing unchanged, or that the trial be interrupted or stopped for safety reasons. The DMC will be guided by [CONTACT_95279]/ events observed in 
the ongoing study which should not exceed the nu mber and /or severity of those observed in 
previous studies with Brilacidin IV treatment for expansion of dosing to occur as planned. 
The rationale for looking to expand treatment duration to five days, from the initial dose 
regimen of three days, is to be able to provide a longer duration of systemic Brilacidin exposure at a level that can strongly suppress SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_105407] of 
Brilacidin treatment and provide enhanced benefit to the patient, with the 5-day regimen incorporated only following recommendation by [CONTACT_95300](es).  
Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_95238] 7.7. Recommendation guidelines and fur ther 
detail s of the D MC will be  prepared separately from this protocol in a D MC Charte r. The 
charter may super sede the summary details presented here in the protocol.  
Other interim analyses may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current clinical study or in case of any safety concerns. 
The primary efficacy analysis will occur once all subjects complete  the Day 29 visit (or 
discontinue from study, if before Day 29). Final database lock and updated safety reporting 
will follow the completion of Day 60 follow-up telephone visits. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 81 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 9.3.  Definitions of Study Populations for Analysis  
Efficacy analyses performed on the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population will be considered 
primary, with the ITT population including all subjects who are randomized and receive at 
least one dose of study drug. Subjects in this population will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. 
The Safety population includes all subjects in the ITT population. Subjects in this population 
will be analyzed according to treatment received. All safety analyses will be based on this population. 
The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the ITT population and includes subjects who 
meet particular study completion criteria with no major  protocol deviations; these criteria will 
be described in the SAP and will be approved prior to database lock and study unblinding. Efficacy analyses performed using the PP population will be considered supportive. 
All subjects in the ITT population who pr ovide at least one PK sample and have at least one 
valid concentration measurement will be included in the PK population. 9.4.  Handling of Missing Data 
When analyzing time to sustained recovery, if subjects are lost to follow-up prior to achieving 
recovery  or die prior to Day 29, their time to recovery will be censored at Day 29. Subjects 
who are lost to follow-up after achieving recovery but prior to Day [ADDRESS_105408] satisfies one of the following three categories from the ordinal scale ( Table 11) with  response sustained through Day 29: 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 82 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 • Score of 6: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires 
ongoing medical care (other than for per protocol dosing or assessments, as appropriate); 
• Score of 7: Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen;  
• Score of  8: Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities.  
The primary endpoint of time to sustained recovery will be analyzed with the log- rank test for 
treatment difference, stratified by [CONTACT_95342], disease severity  and country, with dose regimen 
as covariate (if expanded after DMC recommendation), and summarized using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. Subjects who are lost to follow-up prior to achieving recovery or who have died prior to Day [ADDRESS_105409] to follow-up after 
achieving recovery but prior to Day 29 will be censored at the day of achieving recovery. 
All safety data, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively 
through appropriate data tabulations, descri ptive statistics, and categorical summaries on the 
Safety Population. 
9.6.2.  Secondary  and Exploratory/ Other Endpoint Analyses  
Categorical endpoints will be summarized with frequencies and percentages. Comparisons 
between treatment arms will be performed using logistic regressions adjusted for randomization strata at specified timepoints. Longitudinal analyses using generalized estimating equations may be performed. Continuous measures will be summarized with descriptive statisti cs. Comparisons between treatment  groups will be performed using analysis 
of covariance models adjusted for randomization strata at specified timepoints. Mixed models with repeated measures will be applied for longitudinal modeling of continuous measures. 
The clinical status 8 -point ordinal scale will be analyzed using ordinal categorical data 
methods, including a proportional odds logistic regression. Longitudinal analysis of the 8-
point scale over time will be performed to investigate temporal patterns of improvement.  
9.6.3.  Sensitivity  Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of efficacy parameters controlling for baseline covariates (such as presence of certain comorbidities) or on subgroups (such as those subjects treated with an 
antiviral therapy as SoC) may be performed. Full details of sensitivity analyses will be 
presented in the SAP.  
9.7.  Safety Analysis 
All safety data, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, and categorical summaries  on the 
Safety Population.

 The duration of exposure (in days) to Brilacidin and standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95261].  Changes from ba seline in clinical 
laboratory parameters, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), and ECG parameters will be summarized. Treatment -emergent changes from values within normal range to abnormal 
values in clinical laboratory parameters will be characterized  by [CONTACT_95343].  
Adverse event (AE) data will be listed individually and treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_11189] (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT). SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and/or deaths will likewise be listed and summarized separately. AEs will be further summarized by [CONTACT_95344]. Each subject  will be counted only once within a SOC or a PT using the 
event with  the highest severity and strongest relationship, respectively, within each category. 
Prior and concomitant medications and concurrent procedures will be classified on the basis of World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DDE) term inology. Concomitant

 10.  SITE MO NITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1.  Site Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a 
Sponsor/designee representative will review the protocol and study Case Report Forms (CRFs) with the investigator(s) and their staff. During the study, a study monitor will visit the site regularly  (as possible, due to COVID-19 restrictions) to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that consent is being sought and obtained in compliance with applicable regulations, and that the investigational drug is being stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications. The Investigator and key trial personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits. 
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for maintaining source documents for each subject 
in the study, consisting of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing 
demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject's file. 
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the CRF entries. No information in these records about the identity of the subjects will leave the study center; on CRFs, subjects will only be identified by [CONTACT_95345]. Monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/ exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs will be performed according to the study- specific monitoring 
plan. 
If planned on- site monitoring visits are no t possible due to COVID-[ADDRESS_105410] periodic monitoring visits to 
ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. Study monitors will review source 
documents to confirm accuracy of data recorded on CRFs. The investigator and institution will allow monitors for the Sponsor or its designee, and appropriate regulatory authorities (as applicable), direct access to source documents to perform this verification. 
The study site may be subject to review by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or to qu ality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_95346],  and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708]. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105411] be explained or resolved. 
Completed eCRFs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034]’s monitoring staff or the Sponsor’s 
designee. An eCRF will be completed for each consented subject . 
The monitor and Sponsor/designee staff review the data entered into the CRFs by [CONTACT_95347], and request clarifications and data queries. Queries will be sent to the site using an electronic data query. Designated site staff are required to respond to each query and confirm or correct the data, or make any required additions to the CRF entries. If the electronic query system is not used, a paper Data Query Form will be faxed to the site. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to the Sponsor/designee staff that will make the correction to the database. The signed copy of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site.  
The investigator must certify that the data entered into the electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_95263].  
11.2.  Records Retention  
The investigator agrees to keep  study records, including the identity of all participating 
subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_95348], local regulations, or by [CONTACT_95349] (if needed) , whichever is longer. 
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period, the Sponsor should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor such as another investigator, another 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105412] their origin in 
the current Declaration of Helsinki , and will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, 
the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline on Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
12.2.  Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB/IEC 
It is the responsibility of  the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
any protocol amendments, informed consent forms and subject information, and other 
relevant documents, e.g., recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent/subject information have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC must be given to the Sponsor/designee before study initiation. 
A copy of all reports relating to this study submitted to the IRB must be sent to the 
Sponsor/designee.  
If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must 
information the Sponsor/designee immediately that this request has been made 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to trial subjects. In 
that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Sponsor/designee in writing immediately after the implementation.  
Prior to s tudy start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature [CONTACT_16066]/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with this protocol and key 
responsibi lities of study oversight, delegation, and information access. With any protocol 
amendment, the protocol signature [CONTACT_95352]. 
12.3.  Informed Consent P rocedures  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC-approved informed consent. 
If applicable, in cases where the participant’s legal/authorized representative gives consent (if 
allowed according to local requirements), the participant must be informed about the study to 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page 87 
Clinical Protocol, Version 1.2   IPI-BRIc-201 
 
 the ex tent possible. If the participant is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate agreement 
by [CONTACT_30803]. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures, and the 
process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the subject source documents. The investigator will retain the original of each subject’s signed consent form. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the subject. 
The Sponsor/designee will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed 
Informed Consent F orm (ICF) that complies with the ICH guideline and regulatory 
requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_95350]/designee before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the Sponsor/designee after IRB/IEC approval. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the IB. This information will be included in the ICF  and should be discussed with the 
subject  during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safety profile of the 
investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification or an aggregate safety finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the subject.  
12.4.  Publication of Study Protocol and Results 
The Sponsor will post the key design elements of this protocol in a publicly accessible database such  as clinicaltrials.gov. The results of this trial will be either submitted for 
publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results.  
13.  PROTOCOL ADHERENCE AND AMENDMENT  
13.1.  Protocol Adherence  
Investigators ascertain they will ap ply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations, and no 
requests to approve deviations will be granted by [CONTACT_1034]/designee. 
This protocol defines the study objectives, procedures and data to be collected on study 
participants. No additional procedures or data for any research related purpose may be performed or collected.  
If the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by [CONTACT_95351]/IEC it cannot be implemented.  
All significant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the C linical Study Report. 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_105413] be approved by [CONTACT_1034], government regulatory a uthorities ( where required ), 
and the IRB/IEC. Only the Sponsor may formally amend the protocol text. 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard (s) to trial subjects. 
In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Sponsor/designee in writing immediately after the implementation.

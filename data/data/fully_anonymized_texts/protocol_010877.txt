BACKGROUND:  
Central airway stenosis  (CAS ) is seen in 8 -15% patients after lung transplantation.1,[ADDRESS_241320] stenosis can cause decline in pulmonary functi on, increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_037], increased infections, and occasionally death3. The lungs are unique in containing dual 
circulatory supply from the pulmonary circulation which is reanastomosed during lung 
transplantation, and the bronchial circulation which is not. Perfusion of the large airways is 
thought to occur via retrograde flow from vascular plexus’ between the bronchial and pulmonary arterial circulation until new collateral circulation to the bronchial arterial system can develop in the weeks following transplantation
3. Assessment of large airways perfusion has been 
surprisingly poorly studied, but development of airways ischemia post -transplantation is thought 
to be involved with development of CAS and other airway complications, opportunistic 
infections, particula rly fungal infections, and possibly with chronic allograft rejection.1,[ADDRESS_241321] patients develop some element of necrotic desquamation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_202276]  “exudative plaques” or “pseudomembranes”in the large central airways two 
to four w eeks after lung transplantation. Th ere is a spectrum of involvement, but prior work 
would suggest that up to 50% of patients who develop the most severe manifestations of these 
plaques go on to develop some form of large airway complication, most commonly CAS
9. Our 
local experience support s this observation. There is no e stablished intervention available for 
these patients , however, because  airway ischemia is thought to play an important role in this 
process, our group has treated a small group of patients with hyperbaric oxygen therapy  (HBOT)  
with anecdotal improvement in the appearance of the airways as well as a perceived reduction in 
frequency and severity of anticipated airway complications  in some patients .  
April [ADDRESS_241322] 1.4 atmospheres absolute  pressure 
(ATA) of pure oxygen. It is believed to decrease inflammation, control infection, enhance 
perfusion and promote wound healing.[ADDRESS_241323] to surgical 
reconstruction wounds, flaps or grafts, and chronic osteomyelitis.11-13 It has been shown to 
improve wound healing and decrease the need for limb amputations in diabetic patients. HBOT is not necessary or recommended for normal or uncompromised grafts or flaps, but where the 
graft or flap is compromised by [CONTACT_68413], ischemia or congestion, HBO
2 has been shown to be 
extremely useful in graft salvage (14). Our preliminary experience with  HBOT in lung transplant 
patients with severe pseudomembranes has been encouraging. We perceive that use of this 
technique has hastened resolution of the pseudomembranes, improved infectious complications 
and decreased the incidence of CAS.  Based on t his preliminary experience we feel systematic 
examination of this approach is warranted.  
 
OBJECTIVES:  
The objective of this  study is to evaluate the effect of HBOT on subsequent airway 
complications in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_202277]. Study subjects with extensive desquamation (exudative plaques) of the large airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_202278]- transplant period will be randomized to HBOT or usual care and 
followed clinically for [ADDRESS_241324] extensive exudative plaques (grade 3 or 4) at the ir [ADDRESS_241325] follow -up bronchoscopy 2 to 3 weeks later. Should 
the patient show no sign of improvement in their airways, or worsening of the plaques they will 
be considered eligible for enrollment in the study.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion criteria include: use of mechanical ventilation with FiO
2 greater than 40%, use of 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, use of inhaled nitric oxide, presence of pneumothorax, 
pregnancy, or inability to provide informed consent. In addition, subjects who are deemed to be 
April [ADDRESS_241326] in participating in the study  by [CONTACT_1963] . Those interested will be approached by [CONTACT_202284]. Once informed consent is obtained, subjects will be 
randomized to usual care or HBOT by [CONTACT_144130] a pre- prepared envelope containing the 
randomization assignment. We wil l target a total enrollment of 40  subjects with 1:[ADDRESS_241327] HBOT protocol used at Duke for the treatment 
of compromised grafts and flaps. This is 2 hours of breathing >99% medical  grade oxygen inside 
an air -pressurized chamber at [ADDRESS_241328] Duke informed consent for the administration of HBOT inside the chamber. The primary risks, which each occur in less t han 10% of patients, are middle ear 
barotrauma from the changes in barometric pressure (resolves in a few days) and temporary near -
sightedness that may occur after [ADDRESS_241329] some persistent my opia that requires a change in eyeglass prescription. The other 
April 2015  
 risks are very rare (<1%) and include oxygen- induced convulsions, and pneumothorax, and there 
is a very remote chance of mechanical or electrical failure in the chamber resulting in a fire.  
Airway Surveillance  
While the patients randomized to receive usual care will not undergo HBOT, both study groups 
will receive standard serial bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_202279], due to the high rate of infection in lung transplant patients . All s ubjects will undergo the standard surveillance bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_44813] 3 to 4 weeks 
(x3) for clearance of the exudate from the airway , as well as monitoring progression of the 
airway abnormalities.  Additional bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_202280]. 
Following the completion of the airway surveillance, subjects will revert to the standard rejection 
surveillance schedule of bronchoscopy every [ADDRESS_241330] subcarina for each donor lung. Three samples will be collected from each of the biopsy sites. These samples are small (1 to 2 mm) and are thought to have a minimal clinical risk of minor bleeding associated with the procedure. Biopsy will add 
roughly [ADDRESS_241331] expression of genes associated with response to tissue hypoxia. 
Measurements and Data Collection  
Primary outcomes : Need for airway stent placement and r ate of acute rejection in the 12 months 
of observation as determined by [CONTACT_202285].  
Secondary outcomes : Include  development of airway stenosis, need for balloon bronchoplasty, 
development of clinically significant pulmonary infection as def ined by [CONTACT_202286], development of airway dehiscence following 
enrollment in the study , development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and bronchial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_202281].  
Addit ional clinical data to be collected will include spi[INVESTIGATOR_202282] , frequency of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], ICU days, mechanical ventilation days, need for tracheostomy, and 
survival.  
 
 
April [ADDRESS_241332] that is no longer traversable with a therapeutic (6.4mm OD)  bronchoscope. Other complications are airway dehiscence or malacia 
(excessive loss of structural int egrity). The second criterion is failure of the airway exudate to 
improve in score severity during the 8 week observation period. This is measured using the 
scoring system outlined in Table 1.  
 
RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
It is currently unknown if treatment of patients with severe exudative plaques in the early post -
lung tranplant period with HBOT will prevent development of large airway complications. Our 
limited anecdotal experience suggests it may improve outcomes. The risks of the procedure are 
small and d etailed above. The potential benefits are significant since airway stenosis can lead to 
worse allograft function, increased infections, and occasionally death. Subjects r andomized to 
usual care will  be at usual risk of airway complications. Given the clini cal equipoise regarding 
HBOT treatment in lung transplant, we feel this is an ethical treatment decision for this patient 
population.    
 
COST TO THE SUBJECT 
There will be no additional costs to the subject over usual care. The hyperbaric treatment will be  
provided at no charge to the subjects.  
DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_202287]. Categorical data will be analyzed 
using Fisher’s exact test given the small sample size, while continuous data will be assessed for statistical significance with Student’s t- test. Our prior work with airway stenosis in lung 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_202283] a 15% rate of stenosis in all transplant patients. Our clinical 
experience suggests a rate [ADDRESS_241333] stenosis may be as low as 10% after therapy. Sample size calculations using a 60% 
stenosis rate in the usual care group, a 10% stenosis rate in the HBOT group with a p- value of 
0.[ADDRESS_241334] that a sample of 14 subjects/group w ill have an 80% power to detect  statistical 
significance. We will target a total of [ADDRESS_241335] stent placement. All biolo gic samples will be collected by [CONTACT_5875] 6, prior to 
any patient crossover events.  
 
DATA and SAFETY MONITORING  
Data will be stored on a secured Access database located on the PIN station “U” drive in an 
secured folder. All subject entries will be de -identifie d using a study assigned identification 
number. The key to the study identifiers will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the study coordinators office. Database use will be limited to the primary investigators, co -investigators, 
and the study coordinator.  
Primary risks are related to bronchoscopy with minimal risk of bleeding related to the 
endobronchial lung biopsy, and some discomfort from the bronchoscopy itself which is part of 
usual post -transplant care. Additional risks of hyperbaric treatment are detailed above and very 
rare.  Any adverse events that occur during the study will be immediately reported to the IRB .

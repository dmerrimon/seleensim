  "text": "trials are blinding and randomization, and these should be normal features of most controlled clinical trials intended to be included in a marketing application. Most such trials follow a double-blind approach in which treatments are prepacked in accordance with a suitable randomization schedule, and supplied to the trial center(s) labeled only with the subject number and the treatment period, so that no one involved in the conduct of the trial is aware of the specific treatment allocated to any particular subject, not even as a code letter. This approach will be assumed in section II.C.1 and most of section II.C.2, exceptions being considered at the end. Bias can also be reduced at the design stage by specifying procedures in the protocol aimed at minimizing any anticipated irregularities in trial conduct that might impair a satisfactory analysis, including various types of protocol violations, withdrawals and missing values. The protocol should consider ways both to reduce the frequency of such problems and to handle the problems that do occur in the analysis of data. 1. Blinding (2.3.1) Blinding or masking is intended to limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of a clinical trial arising from the influence that the knowledge of treatment may have on the recruitment and allocation of subjects, their subsequent care, the attitudes of subjects to the treatments, the assessment of end-points, the handling of withdrawals, the exclusion of data from analysis, and so on. The essential aim is to prevent identification of the treatments until all such opportunities for bias have passed. A double-blind trial is one in which neither the subject nor any of the investigator or sponsor staff involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects are aware of the treatment received. This includes anyone determining subject eligibility, evaluating endpoints, or assessing compliance with the protocol. This level of blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, and only when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be unblinded. If any of the sponsor staff who are not involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects are required to be unblinded to the treatment code (e.g., bioanalytical scientists, auditors, those involved in serious adverse event reporting), the sponsor should have adequate standard",

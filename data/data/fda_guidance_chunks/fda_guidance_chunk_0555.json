With regard to the description of race and ethnicity, the categories that are suggested previously in this document (Section IV) provide more detail than those suggested in the ICH M4E eCTD guidance. FDA recommends that sponsors provide the level of detail described in Section IV of this guidance. For relevant device submissions, we recommend following the guidance presented here and, when finalized, the recommendations in the draft guidance documents Evaluation and Reporting of Age, Race, and Ethnicity Data in Medical Device Clinical Studies14. 49 Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format – Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications: Guidance for Industry (May 2015), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM333969.pdf 50 Revision of M4E Guideline on Enhancing the Format and Structure of Benefit-Risk Information on ICH Efficacy – M4E(R2) (June 15, 2016), available at http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/CTD/M4E_R2_Efficacy/M4E_R2 Step_4.pdf 51 The ICH M4 eCTD document suggests specific kinds of demographic information to be collected as a part of a clinical trial, but does not provide rigid specifications on how the data should be presented, noting, for example, that “if relative exposure of demographic groups in the controlled trials differ from the overall exposure, it may be useful to provide separate tables.” Choices of how best to summarize demographic data depend on the nature of the data to be conveyed. For some trials, it may be useful to show the distribution of one demographic characteristic within a second demographic (e.g., the age distribution of men and women enrolled in a set of controlled trials). Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control Information Guidance for Industry This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION A. Purpose and Scope We, FDA (or Agency), are providing you, Investigational New Drug Application (IND) sponsors, with recommendations regarding IND submissions for early clinical trials with live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) in the United States (U.S.), including LBPs lawfully",

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION This guidance provides recommendations to clinical investigators and sponsors regarding the inclusion of patients who have not received available therapy2 (commonly referred to as existing treatment options) for their cancer in clinical trials of drugs3 and biological products for the treatment of cancer in the non-curative setting (i.e., when there is no potential for cure or prolonged/near normal survival). For the purpose of this guidance, non-curative is generally defined as 1) unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease in solid tumors or 2) hematologic malignancies with unfavorable long-term overall survival. The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 Refer to the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics (May 2014) for a description of available therapy. We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents. 3",

The results of the initial period of treatment, in which subjects who appear to respond are identified and maintained on therapy, are thus validated by a rigorous, largely assumption- and bias-free study. 6. Advantages of Externally Controlled Trials (2.5.6) The main advantage of an externally controlled trial is that all patients can receive a promising drug, making the study more attractive to patients and physicians. The design has some potential efficiencies because all patients are exposed to test drug, of particular importance in rare diseases. However, despite the use of a single treatment group in an externally controlled trial, the estimate of the external control group outcome always should be made conservatively, possibly leading to a larger sample size than would be needed in a placebocontrolled trial. Great caution (e.g., applying a more stringent significance level) is called for because there are likely to be both identified and unidentified or unmeasurable differences between the treatment and control groups, often favoring treatment. 7. Disadvantages of Externally Controlled Trials (2.5.7) The externally controlled study cannot be blinded and is subject to patient, observer, and analyst bias; these are major disadvantages. It is possible to mitigate these problems to a degree, but even the steps suggested in section 2.5.2 cannot resolve such problems fully, as treatment assignment is not randomized and comparability of control and treatment groups at the start of treatment, and comparability of treatment of patients during the trial, cannot be ensured or well assessed. It is well documented that externally controlled trials tend to overestimate efficacy of test therapies. It should be recognized that tests of statistical significance carried out in such studies are less reliable than in randomized trials. III. CHOOSING THE CONCURRENT CONTROL GROUP (3.0) Table 1 describes the usefulness of specific types of control groups, and Figure 1 provides a decision tree for choosing among different types of control groups. Although the table and figure focus on the choice of control to demonstrate efficacy, some designs also allow comparisons of test and control agents. The choice of control can be affected by the availability of therapies and by medical practices in specific regions. The potential usefulness of the principal types of control (placebo, active, and dose-response) in specific situations and for specific purposes is shown in Table 1. The table",

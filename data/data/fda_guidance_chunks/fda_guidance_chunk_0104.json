Master Protocols With Biomarker-Defined Subgroups In master protocols with basket or complex design, where human subject assignment to a treatment arm is based on the presence of a specific biomarker of interest, the protocol should clearly specify how subjects with more than one biomarker of interest will be assigned to 22 See also the ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and the guidance for clinical trial sponsors Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees. 10 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations substudies. There are two approaches to making such assignments that FDA recommends from a clinical trial design perspective, but other approaches may also be appropriate. One approach is to prioritize biomarkers or treatments. For example, in the BATTLE-1 trial, investigators ranked the biomarker groups based on their predictive values and assigned human subjects with multiple biomarkers to the group for one of their biomarkers that has the highest predictive value (Kim et al. 2011). The other approach is based on a prespecified randomization ratio. For example, the Lung-MAP trial uses a reversed ratio of prevalence rates. Using reverse prevalence ratios, subjects in the trial with tumors that have biomarkers with low prevalence have a greater likelihood to be assigned to a substudy for the lower prevalence population.23 Consideration should be given to the clinical relevance, if any, of low-prevalence passenger mutations that coexist with driver mutations, for which adjustment to randomization may not be needed. Sponsors should provide justification for the selected approach and should state in the justification whether the proposed approach of assigning subjects with more than one biomarker of interest to a particular substudy would impact the prevalence of the biomarkers in each subpopulation and whether any statistical methods to address this potential issue/bias are needed. VIII. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS A. Safety Monitoring and Reporting Plans The sponsor of the master protocol IND is required to ensure proper monitoring of the investigations and to ensure that the investigations are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND (21 CFR 312.50).24 Similarly, the sponsor of the investigational product IND for a drug that will be administered under a master protocol IND",

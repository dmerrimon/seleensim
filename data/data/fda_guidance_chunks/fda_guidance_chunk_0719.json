  "text": "easily understood by the sponsor. 6. To reduce the number of essential revisions in study protocols. On perusal of the contents of the \"Protocol Development Guideline,\" it will become obvious that the contents are neither all inclusive nor will all items listed be applicable to all study protocols. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to ensure the essential components of a study are included in the study protocol(s). It is requested that effectiveness and target animal safety study protocols follow this suggested format. In addition to facilitating the development of study protocols, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) suggests that this format be followed when submitting the final reports of the trials conducted for review by CVM. This format may also be used to prepare the final reports by clinical investigators, study monitors, and the sponsor. More uniform reports should facilitate a systematic, orderly review of the data. This will enhance the efficiency of each CVM reviewer resulting in quicker more complete review of the data. Regulatory Background: Guidelines state procedures or practices that may be useful to the persons to whom they are directed, but are not legal requirements. Guidelines represent the agency's position on a procedure or practice at the time of their issuance. A person may follow the guideline or may choose to follow alternative procedures. If a person chooses to use alternate procedures, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or benefits for or on any person. Where the guideline states a requirement is imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline. This guideline was written in response to a need perceived by the Center for Veterinary Medicine in its work with the animal health industry.

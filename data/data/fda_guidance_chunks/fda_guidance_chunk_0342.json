These procedures may take place at participants’ homes, local health care facilities, or other suitable locations convenient for participants. • As part of the requirement that investigators protect the safety of subjects,27 investigators should evaluate reports from local HCPs of abnormal signs or symptoms detected at in-person visits. Investigators should follow up with participants as appropriate. • Videoconferencing may be useful to allow investigators to oversee trial personnel performing activities described in the trial protocol (e.g., photographing lesions, fitting wearable sensors) at participants’ locations. • Investigators should enroll only as many trial participants as they can appropriately manage to ensure adequate supervision of DCT-related activities. • As for any drug trial required to be conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) under 21 CFR part 312, Form FDA 1572 must be completed by all investigators.28 The decision to include individuals as subinvestigators in a DCT should 21 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. 22 21 CFR 312.61, 812.100, and 812.110(c). 23 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. 24 Ibid. 25 See also the guidance for industry Investigator Responsibilities — Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects (October 2009). 26 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. 27 See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. 28 21 CFR 312.53(c).

When trial personnel contribute directly and significantly to the trial data (e.g., assessing adverse events, performing a clinical outcome assessment, applying a protocol-defined scoring system) or require a detailed knowledge of the protocol, investigator’s brochure, or IP, they should be included on Form FDA 1572 as subinvestigators. 29 Individuals who are not subinvestigators should not be listed on Form FDA 1572. In addition, as part of the IND, sponsors must submit a list of all investigators and subinvestigators.30 • Investigators do not need to maintain a log of local HCPs performing trial-related activities. However, as part of preparing and maintaining adequate case histories, investigators should ensure that reports from local HCPs include the name of the local HCP and the date when activities were performed.31 • For device investigations, investigator and sponsor responsibilities under 21 CFR part 812 include the requirement that there be a signed agreement between the investigator and",

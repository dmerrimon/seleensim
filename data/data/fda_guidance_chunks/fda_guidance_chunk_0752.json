  "text": "when used with an early-escape endpoint, such as return of symptoms, is that the period of placebo exposure with poor response that a patient would have to undergo is short. This type of design can address dosing issues. After all patients have received an initial fixed dose, they could be randomly assigned in the withdrawal phase to several different doses (as well as placebo), a particularly useful approach when there is reason to think the initial and maintenance doses might be different, either on pharmacodynamic grounds or because there is substantial accumulation of active drug resulting from a long half life of parent drug or active metabolite. Note that the randomized withdrawal design could be used to assess dose-response after an initial placebo-controlled titration study (See ICH E4). The titration study is an efficient design for establishing effectiveness, but does not give good dose-response information in many cases. The randomized withdrawal phase, with responders randomly assigned to several fixed doses and placebo, will permit dose-response to be studied rigorously while allowing the efficiency of the titration design to be used in the initial phase of the trial. In using randomized withdrawal designs, it is important to appreciate the possibility of withdrawal phenomena, suggesting the wisdom of relatively slow tapering. A patient may develop tolerance to a drug such that no benefit is being accrued, but the drug’s withdrawal may lead to disease exacerbation, resulting in an erroneous conclusion of persisting efficacy. It is also important to realize that treatment effects observed in these trials may be larger than those seen in an unselected population because randomized withdrawal studies are enriched with responders and exclude people who cannot tolerate the drug. This phenomenon results when the trial explicitly includes only subjects who appear to have responded to the drug or includes only people who have completed a previous phase of study (which is often an indicator of a good response and always indicates ability to tolerate the drug). In the case of studies intended to determine how long a therapy should be continued, such entry criteria provide the study population and comparison of interest. v. Other Design Considerations (2.1.5.2.5) In any placebo-controlled study, unbalanced randomization (e.g., 2:1, study drug to placebo) may enhance the safety database and may also make the study more attractive to",

  "text": "Additional Doses (2.1.5.1.2) Randomization to several fixed doses of the test drug in addition to placebo allows assessment of dose-response and may be particularly useful in a comparative trial to ensure a fair comparison of treatments (see ICH E4: Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration). iii. Factorial Designs (2.1.5.1.3) Factorial designs may be used to explore several doses of the investigational drug as monotherapy and in combination with several doses of another agent proposed for use in combination with it. A single study of this type can define the properties of a wide array of combinations. Such studies are common in the evaluation of new antihypertensive therapies, but can be considered in a variety of settings where more than one treatment is used simultaneously. For example, the independent additive effects of aspirin and streptokinase in preventing mortality after a heart attack were shown in such a trial. b. Other Modifications of Study Design (2.1.5.2) i. Add on Study, Placebo-Controlled; Replacement Study. (2.1.5.2.1) An add-on study is a placebo-controlled trial of a new agent conducted in people also receiving standard treatment. Such studies are particularly important when available treatment is known to decrease mortality or irreversible morbidity, and when a non-inferiority trial with standard treatment as the active control cannot be carried out or would be difficult to interpret (see section 1.5). It is common to study anticancer, antiepileptic, and heart failure drugs this way. This design is useful only when standard treatment is not fully effective (which, however, is almost always the case), and it has the advantage of providing evidence of improved clinical outcomes (rather than mere non-inferiority). Efficacy is, of course, established by such studies only for the combination treatment, and the dose in a monotherapy situation might be different from the dose found to be effective in combination. In general, this approach is likely to succeed only when the new and standard treatments possess different pharmacologic mechanisms, although there are exceptions. For example, combination treatments for people with AIDS may show a beneficial effect of pharmacologically related drugs because of delays in development of resistance. A variation of this design that can sometimes give information on monotherapy, and that is particularly applicable in the setting of chronic disease, is the replacement study, in which the new drug or placebo is added",

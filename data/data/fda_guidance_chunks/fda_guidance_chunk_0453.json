Early identification of relevant intrinsic and extrinsic factors could set a good foundation for planning confirmatory MRCTs. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Figure 1. Illustrations of clinical drug development workflow across regions for drug submission and regulatory review in independent and global strategies It may be plausible and efficient for an MRCT to be the single pivotal trial to support regulatory submission, and if this is the case, the MRCT should be designed to provide sufficient and robust evidence to support approval. In summary, strategic use of MRCTs, properly designed and executed according to this guidance, can increase efficiency of drug development, allow for exploration of the treatment effect to diverse populations, and enable simultaneous submission of marketing authorization applications and regulatory decision-making in multiple regions. Therefore, MRCTs may generally become the preferred option for investigating a new drug for which regulatory submission is planned in multiple regions. 2. Good Clinical Practice Standards and MRCTs (2.1.2) All sites participating in MRCTs should meet applicable quality, ethical, and regulatory standards. Specifically, MRCTs should be conducted in compliance with ICH E6 good clinical practice (GCP) standards in all regions and sites, including making sites available for GCP inspections by regulatory authorities. Monitoring plans and other quality checks should be prespecified and implemented to address potential risks to subject rights, safety and well-being, *: Marketing Authorization Application/New Drug Application **: Could be parallel single region trials or MRCTs Contains Nonbinding Recommendations and the reliability of study results. Centralized and risk-based monitoring may be particularly useful for MRCTs to monitor and mitigate the impact of emerging regional differences in, for example, trial subject retention or adverse event reporting (ICH E6). Timely and accurate flow of information should occur between the sponsor, the trial management team, and the participating sites. 3. Scientific Consultation Meetings With Regulatory Authorities (2.1.3) Sponsors of MRCTs are encouraged to have scientific consultation meetings with relevant regulatory authorities. These interactions should take place during the planning stage of MRCTs to discuss the regulatory requirements for the overall development plan and the acceptability of MRCT data to support marketing authorization. Conducting such consultation meetings early in the planning stage of MRCTs will enable",

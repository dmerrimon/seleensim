The sponsor of the master protocol IND should establish a systematic approach that ensures rapid communication of serious safety issues to all participating clinical investigators and FDA under IND safety reporting regulations.25 Additionally the master protocol IND sponsor should ensure rapid communication of serious safety issues to the sponsors of all products used in the master protocol, according to the established safety reporting plan. In addition, the approach should describe the process for rapid implementation of protocol amendments to address serious safety issues.26 Safety monitoring and reporting obligations of the sponsor of the master protocol IND and sponsors of each IND covered by the master protocol remain unchanged in master protocol trials. 23 See the guidance for industry Developing Targeted Therapies in Low-Frequency Molecular Subsets of a Disease (October 2018). 24 See the guidance for industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring (August 2013). 25 21 CFR 312.32. 26 21 CFR 312.30(b)(1) and 312.30(b)(2)(ii). 11 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations These reporting obligations are described, along with recommendations to help sponsors comply with expedited safety reporting requirements, in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities—Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies (June 2021).27 For master protocols in oncology, FDA may expect a sponsor to conduct aggregate analyses of all SAEs at intervals based on the volume of safety data collected or based on the number of subjects accrued into the master protocol in order to fulfill its review obligations under 312.32(b). A sponsor would then be required to submit events that qualify for reporting under 312.32(c) and as described in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities—Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies. The frequency of the cumulative aggregate safety analyses should be discussed with the Agency at a pre-IND meeting, taking into account",

See also the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures—Scope and Application (August 2003) and the draft guidance for industry Electronic Systems, Electronic Records, and Electronic Signatures in Clinical Investigations Questions and Answers (March 2023). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. 44 For electronic records that are not subject to part 11, sponsors and other regulated entities should rely on their internal business practices to determine acceptable electronic signature methods and controls. 45 When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. 46 See 21 CFR 50.27(a). 47 See 21 CFR 11.3(b)(8) for the definition of a handwritten signature. 48 See 21 CFR 312.57, 312.62, and 812.140. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations arise in which a sponsor cannot meet eCTD requirements (e.g., if computer operations are impacted). For information on requesting a short-term waiver from eCTD requirements, see section III.E of the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format — Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (eCTD guidance) (February 2020). Companies experiencing technical difficulties with transmission of their electronic submissions to FDA should consult FDA’s electronic submission staff for technical assistance, rather than submitting a waiver request, as described in section III.E of the eCTD guidance. Q17. During a disaster or PHE, participants may no longer be able to travel to a central location for administration of an investigational drug that is scheduled on a recurring basis. Can the IP be shipped to a local HCP who is not a sub-investigator to administer the product to a participant while still maintaining integrity of the trial? If so, what else would be needed regarding trial monitoring and IRB oversight? Specific circumstances for a given clinical trial would affect the feasibility and appropriateness of shipping IP to locations other than clinical trial sites as specified under an IND, as well as administering the IP. Depending on how the IP(s) being evaluated in the trial are administered, it would be important that any alternative location have appropriately trained personnel and oversight by physicians with sufficient experience regarding the class of products involved to assure trial participant safety comparable to administration at a trial site.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

INTRODUCTION This guidance outlines a process (algorithm) and vocabulary for deriving the maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) for first-in-human clinical trials of new molecular entities in adult healthy volunteers, and recommends a standardized process by which the MRSD can be selected. The purpose of this process is to ensure the safety of the human volunteers. The goals of this guidance are to: (1) establish a consistent terminology for discussing the starting dose; (2) provide common conversion factors for deriving a human equivalent dose (HED); and (3) delineate a strategy for selecting the MRSD for adult healthy volunteers, regardless of the projected clinical use. This process is depicted in a flow chart that presents the decisions and calculations used to generate the MRSD from animal data (see Appendix E). FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of New Drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations II. BACKGROUND The process identified in this guidance pertains to determining the MRSD for adult healthy subjects when beginning a clinical investigation of any new drug or biological therapeutic that has",

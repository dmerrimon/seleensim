It might sometimes be conducted in a number of different countries to facilitate generalizability (see Glossary) even further. If a multicenter trial is to be meaningfully interpreted and extrapolated, then the manner in which the protocol is implemented should be clear and similar at all centers. Furthermore, the usual sample size and power calculations depend upon the assumption that the differences between the compared treatments in the centers are unbiased estimates of the same quantity. It is important to design the common protocol and to conduct the trial with this background in mind. Procedures should be standardized as completely as possible. Variation of evaluation criteria and schemes can be reduced by investigator meetings, by the training of personnel in advance of the trial, and by careful monitoring during the trial. Good design should generally aim to achieve the same distribution of subjects to treatments within each center and good management should maintain this design objective. Trials that avoid excessive variation in the numbers of subjects per center and trials that avoid a few very small centers have advantages if it is later found necessary to take into account the heterogeneity of the treatment effect from center to center, because they reduce the differences between different weighted estimates of the treatment effect. (This point does not apply to trials in which all centers are very small and in which center does not feature in the analysis.) Failure to take these precautions, combined with doubts about the homogeneity of the results, may, in severe cases, reduce the value of a multicenter trial to such a degree that it cannot be regarded as giving convincing evidence for the sponsor's claims. In the simplest multicenter trial, each investigator will be responsible for the subjects recruited at one hospital, so that center is identified uniquely by either investigator or hospital. In many trials, however, the situation is more complex. One investigator may recruit subjects from several hospitals; one investigator may represent a team of clinicians (subinvestigators) who all recruit subjects from their own clinics at one hospital or at several associated hospitals. Whenever there is room for doubt about the definition of center in a statistical model, the",

In spite of these limitations, the mortality rates among the treated patient cohorts are reasonably consistent, ranging from 5% to 17% across the three decades represented. Mortality rates in the untreated cohorts are more variable. The older references provide estimates of 31% and 41%, while the more recent study gives an estimated mortality rate of 82%, but this estimate is based on a very small sample size (n=17). In the absence of any placebo-controlled trials of active control drugs in this disease area, it is not possible to estimate M1 using the methods advocated in this guidance document (e.g., the 95%-95% method), but it is clear that the untreated mortality is substantial. Thus, based on the historical evidence described above, with the caveats noted about the nature and age of the studies, it is reasonable to assume that the mortality rate due to CABP, if left untreated, will be substantially higher than the rates observed among the treated cohorts. Use of an NI margin (M2) of approximately 10% is therefore a valid approach for evaluating new treatments of CABP and would clearly represent an effect superior to no treatment as well as, based on clinical judgment, an appropriate clinical margin. Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff1 I. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this guidance is to provide FDA expectations for and recommendations on use of a standardized approach for collecting and reporting race and ethnicity data in submissions for clinical trials for FDA regulated medical products conducted in the United States and abroad. Using standard terminology for age, sex, race, and ethnicity helps ensure that subpopulation data is collected consistently. The recommended standardized approach is based on the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive 152 and developed in accordance with section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act3, the HHS Implementation Guidance on Data Collection Standards for Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Primary Language, and Disability Status4, and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act5 (FDASIA) Section 907 Action Plan6. This guidance lists the OMB 1 This guidance has been developed by the Agency-wide Race and Ethnicity Working Group from the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Minority",

Based on the positive results from five of the six studies, it can reasonably be assumed that were placebo to be included in a warfarin-controlled NI study involving a novel anticoagulant, warfarin would have been superior to placebo.

Placebo-Controlled Trials of Warfarin in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Study Summary Events/Patient Years Risk Ratio (95% CI) Warfarin Placebo AFASAK open label. 1.2 yr follow-up 9/413 = 2.18% 21/398 = 5.28% 0.41 (0.19, 0.89) BAATAF open label. 2.2 yr follow-up 3/487 = 0.62% 13/435 = 2.99% 0.21 (0.06, 0.72) EAFT open label. 2.3 yr follow-up patients with recent TIA 21/507 = 4.14% 54/405 = 13.3% 0.31 (0.19, 0.51) CAFA* double blind. 1.3 yr follow-up 7/237 = 2.95% 11/241 = 4.56% 0.65 (0.26, 1.64) SPAF I open label. 1.3 yr follow-up 8/260 = 3.08% 20/244 = 8.20% 0.38 (0.17, 0.84) SPINAF double blind. 1.7 yr follow-up 9/489 = 1.84% 24/483 = 4.97% 0.37 (0.17, 0.79) * CAFA was stopped early because of favorable results observed in other studies. As can be seen from the summary table, most of these studies were open label. It is not clear how great a concern this should be given the reasonably objective endpoints in the study (see Table 2), but to the extent there was judgment involved in assessing the endpoints, there may have been the potential for bias to be introduced. The event rate for placebo in the EAFT study was strikingly high, perhaps because the patient population in that study was different from the patient population in the remaining five studies, in that only patients with a recent TIA or stroke were enrolled in EAFT. That factor would clearly increase the event rate, but in fact the risk reduction in EAFT was very similar to the four trials other than CAFA, which is relatively reassuring with respect to constancy of risk reduction in various AF populations. Even if the historical studies are consistent, a critical consideration in deciding upon the NI margin is whether the constancy assumption is reasonable. That is, we must consider whether the magnitude of the effect of warfarin relative to placebo in the previous studies would be present in the new NI study, or whether changes in medical practice (e.g., concomitant medications, skill at reaching the",

  "text": "Consistency of treatment effect: A lack of clinically relevant differences between treatment effects in different regions or subpopulations of an MRCT. Multiregional Clinical Trial, MRCT: A clinical trial conducted in more than one region under a single protocol. Region: A geographical region, country, or regulatory region. Regulatory Region: A region comprised of countries for which a common set of regulatory requirements applies for drug approval (e.g., European Union). Pooled regions: Pooling some geographical regions, countries, or regulatory regions at the planning stage, if subjects in those regions are thought to be similar enough with respect to intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors relevant to the disease and/or drug under study. Pooled subpopulations: Pooling a subset of the subjects from a particular region with similarly defined subsets from other regions whose members share one or more intrinsic or extrinsic factors important for the drug development program at the planning stage. Pooled subpopulations are assumed to be ethnicity-related subgroups and are particularly important in the MRCT setting.

These local HCPs would not be considered trial personnel, nor would they be considered subinvestigators in a drug trial. • Trial-related activities that are unique to a research study (i.e., not routine in clinical practice) and/or require a detailed knowledge of the protocol, investigator’s brochure, or IP should be performed by qualified trial personnel who have been appropriately trained on the protocol. When applicable, both trial personnel and trial participants should be trained on how to conduct or participate in a telehealth visit and other visits not conducted at traditional clinical trial sites (e.g., home visits). • Study records should indicate if a visit was conducted via telehealth and should include the date of the visit and the name of the person who conducted the visit. • The trial protocol should specify how adverse events identified remotely will be evaluated and managed. The protocol should describe how care will be provided for adverse events that require urgent or in-person attention. • Sponsors and investigators should ensure that remote clinical trial visits conducted via telehealth comply with laws governing telehealth in the relevant U.S. States or territories and other countries, as applicable. C. Digital Health Technologies DHTs may allow transmission of data remotely and securely from trial participants wherever they are located. The sponsor should consider the following information regarding the use of DHTs in a DCT: • The guidance for industry, investigators, and other stakeholders Digital Health Technologies for Remote Data Acquisition in Clinical Investigations provides recommendations to sponsors, clinical investigators, and other parties for measuring clinical events and characteristics of interest using DHTs to acquire data remotely from participants in clinical trials evaluating drugs, biological products, and devices. The guidance discusses, among other things, selection of DHTs for use in clinical trials; verification, validation, and usability evaluations; use of DHTs to collect data for clinical trial endpoints; training on the use of DHTs; and management of risks related to the use 11 Local HCPs can also be utilized in clinical trials that are integrated into routine clinical practice.

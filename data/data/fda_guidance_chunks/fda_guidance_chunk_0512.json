  "text": "the historical data should identify differences in the outcomes for important subgroups so that the statistical analysis plan for the NI study can be designed prospectively to take these factors into account (e.g., through covariate adjustments) or so that the value of M1 can be revisited in light of the baseline characteristics of the study population that was enrolled in the NI study. C. Fixed Margin and Synthesis Methods Conceptually, the conclusion of non-inferiority is a synthesis of information from the NI trial itself and the historical evidence that the comparator in that trial was effective. The historical trials assessed Ch – P, the effect of the active control compared to placebo. The NI trial assesses T – Cn , the effect of the test drug compared to active control. If the outcome for the active control is constant across studies, then Cn = Ch, and the sum T – Cn + Ch – P = T – P represents the effect of the test drug compared to placebo. The indispensable purpose of a NI trial is to show with high confidence that this effect is positive. Additionally, NI trials are usually intended to estimate this effect, at least roughly, in comparison to the historical effect of the active control. The historical studies will furnish an estimate of Ch – P with an associated standard error SEH. Similarly, the NI study will estimate T – Cn with a standard error SEN. The two estimates are independent, so that the standard error of the sum is given by 􀶥𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻2+𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁2 . Notwithstanding that the interpretation of an NI study is fundamentally a synthesis, we recommend a statistical method, the fixed-margin method, that treats the problem in two separate steps. This approach offers two practical advantages. First, it allows separation of the problem of calculating, justifying, and possibly adjusting the NI margins M1 and M2 from the problem of analyzing the NI study. Second, it is equivalent to applying a somewhat larger standard error to the synthesized estimate, which can be seen as an allowance for the possibility of minor deviations from constancy. 1. The Fixed Margin Approach The fixed margin approach to analysis in an NI trial is well known (see, e.g., ICH E9, section 3.3.2). This approach relies upon the choice of a fixed NI",

For cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an important enzyme that metabolizes drugs belonging to a variety of therapeutic areas such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and beta blockers, the frequency of poor metabolizers is higher in Whites39 (7-10%) and Blacks or African Americans (3-8%) than in persons of Asian heritage (Xie 2001)40. The incidence of anticonvulsant carbamazepine41-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis has shown a strong association with HLA-B*1502 (Chung 200442), an allele that is highly prevalent in Asian populations (particularly Chinese) when compared to non-Asian populations (Hung 200643and Alfirevic 200644). Collecting data on race and/or ethnicity is critical to identifying population-specific signals. As illustrated above, genetic studies may explain the basis for observed differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety across racial or ethnic subgroups, and FDA has recommended collection of DNA samples in clinical trials for such purposes45. FDA has also published guidance on enrichment strategies for selecting participants for clinical trials based on prognostic or predicative biomarkers (such as genotype)46. 35 Taylor S, 2002, “Skin of Color: Biology, Structure, Function, and Implications for Dermatologic Disease,” Journal of American Academy of Dermatology, 46: S41-62 36 Yan, Guofen, et al., 2013, \"The relationship of age, race, and ethnicity with survival in dialysis patients,\" Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 8.6: 953-961. 37 Exner D, Dries D, Donamski M, and Cohn J, 2001, “Lesser Response to Angiotensin Converting-Enzyme Inhibitor Therapy in Black as Compared with White Patients With Left Ventricular Dysfunction,” N Engl J Med, 344: 1351- 1357 38 Yancy C, Fowler M, Colucci W, Gilbert E, Bristow M, et al., 2001, “Race and the Response to Adrenergic Blockade with Carvedilol in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure,” N Engl J Med, 344: 1358-1365. 39 The terms used in this guidance to describe the various racial and ethnic groups are those used by OMB 40 Xie H, Kim R, Wood A, and Stein C, 2001, “Molecular Basis of Ethnic Differences in Drug Disposition and Response,” Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol, 41: 815-850. 41 Carbamazepine postmarket drug safety and information (December 12, 2007), available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm124718.htm 42 Chung, WH, Hung, SI, Hong, HS, Hsih, MS, Yang, LC, et al, 2004, “A Marker for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,” Nature, 428: 486. 43 Hung SI, Chung WH, Jee SH, Chen WC, Chang",

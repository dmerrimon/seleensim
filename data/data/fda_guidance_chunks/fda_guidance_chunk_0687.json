Institutional normal reference ranges should be provided to demonstrate that they are appropriate. ** The clinical signs or symptoms associated with laboratory abnormalities might result in characterization of the laboratory abnormalities as Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4). For example. a low sodium value that falls within a grade 3 parameter (125-129 mE/L) should be recorded as a grade 4 hyponatremia event if the subject had a new seizure associated with the low sodium value. ***ULN” is the upper limit of the normal range.

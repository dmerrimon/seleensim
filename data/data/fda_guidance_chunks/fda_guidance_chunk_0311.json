  "text": "The terms “research,” “trial,” and “study,” are deemed to be synonymous for purposes of this guidance and include both clinical research (also referred to as “clinical study,” “clinical trial,” and “clinical investigation”) and nonclinical research (also referred to as “nonclinical trial” and “nonclinical laboratory study”). 9 “REMS” refers to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, see section 505-1 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 3551). “PADE” refers to Postmarketing Adverse Drug Experience, see e.g. 21 CFR 310.305 , 21 CFR 314.80, 21 CFR 329.100 , 21 CFR 600.80 , and 21 CFR parts 803 and 806. 10 See section 704(a)(5)(F) of the FD&C Act. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft — Not for Implementation 64 permit FDA to inspect relevant facilities and equipment used in generating that information.11 At 65 the same time, section 704(a)(5) makes clear that existing safeguards12 against disclosure of 66 confidential commercial information and trade secrets continue to apply, and that BIMO 67 inspections – like inspections generally – are to be conducted at reasonable times, within 68 reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner.13 69 70 Generally, an inspection, such as described in section 704(a) of the FD&C Act, involves duly 71 designated officers or employees of FDA physically entering establishments subject to regulation 72 under the FD&C Act to determine compliance with applicable FDA requirements. FDA also uses 73 other oversight tools when appropriate, such as RRAs. An RRA is an examination of an FDA74 regulated establishment and/or its records, conducted entirely remotely, to evaluate compliance 75 with applicable FDA requirements. RRAs under the BIMO Program may consist of: (1) Remote 76 Interactive Evaluations14 and (2) requests for records or other information under section 77 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act from sites and facilities subject to inspection under section 78 704(a)(5)(C)(i) (i.e., establishments subject to BIMO inspections) in advance of or in lieu of such 79 inspections.15 80 81 82 83 11 See section 704(a)(5)(D)(i) of the FD&C Act. 12 See section 704(a)(5)(D)(ii) of the FD&C Act. 13 See section 704(a)(5)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act. Also see Department of Health and Human Services’ website for information on permissible disclosures of protected health information to public health authorities (including FDA), available at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/public-health/index.html. 14 For more information on Remote Interactive Evaluations, see \"Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities",

Other Design Considerations (2.1.5.2.5) In any placebo-controlled study, unbalanced randomization (e.g., 2:1, study drug to placebo) may enhance the safety database and may also make the study more attractive to patients and/or investigators. 6. Advantages of Placebo-controlled Trials (2.1.6) a. Ability to Demonstrate Efficacy (2.1.6.1) Like other superiority trials, a placebo-controlled trial contains internal evidence of assay sensitivity. When a difference is demonstrated it is interpretable without reference to external findings. b. Measures Absolute Efficacy and Safety (2.1.6.2) The placebo-controlled trial measures the total pharmacologically mediated effect of treatment. In contrast, an active control trial or a dose-comparison trial measures the effect relative to another treatment. The placebo-controlled trial also allows a distinction between adverse events due to the drug and those due to the underlying disease or background noise. The absolute effect size information is valuable in a three-group trial (test, placebo, active), even if the primary purpose of the trial is the test versus active control comparison. c. Efficiency (2.1.6.3) Placebo-controlled trials are efficient in that they can detect treatment effects with a smaller sample size than any other type of concurrently controlled study. d. Minimizing the Effect of Subject and Investigator Expectations (2.1.6.4) Use of a blinded placebo control may decrease the amount of improvement resulting from subject or investigator expectations because both are aware that some subjects will receive no active drug. This may increase the ability of the study to detect true drug effects. 7. Disadvantages of Placebo-controlled Trials (2.1.7) a. Ethical Concerns (See Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4) (2.1.7.1) When effective therapy that is known to prevent death or irreversible morbidity exists for a particular population, that population cannot usually be ethically studied in placebo-controlled trials; the particular conditions and populations for which this is true may be controversial. Ethical concerns may also direct studies toward less ill subjects or toward examination of short-term endpoints when long-term outcomes are of greater interest. Where a placebocontrolled trial is unethical and an active control trial would not be credible, it may be very difficult to study new drugs at all. For example, it would not be considered ethical to carry out a placebo-controlled trial of a thrombolytic agent in patients with acute myocardial",

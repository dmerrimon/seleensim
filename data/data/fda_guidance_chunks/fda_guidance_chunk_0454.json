These interactions should take place during the planning stage of MRCTs to discuss the regulatory requirements for the overall development plan and the acceptability of MRCT data to support marketing authorization. Conducting such consultation meetings early in the planning stage of MRCTs will enable the comments received from regulatory authorities to be taken into consideration. The sponsor should prepare the protocol and other relevant documents, and it may be beneficial to include information about which authorities are providing regulatory advice, and how that advice is being taken into consideration. Consultation with authorities may happen at various stages, affecting different aspects of protocol development. Inter-authority scientific discussions are encouraged to allow for harmonization of study requirements. B. Clinical Trial Design and Protocol-Related Issues (2.2) 1. Preconsideration of Regional Variability and Its Potential Impact on Efficacy and Safety (2.2.1) At the planning stage, regional variability, the extent to which it can be explained by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and its potential to influence the study results should be carefully considered in determining the role MRCTs can play in the drug development strategy. To facilitate taking into consideration differences among regions in intrinsic and extrinsic factors, we recommend that investigators and experts representing participating regions be consulted in the planning and design of MRCTs. The most current and relevant data should be used to understand the potential sources of regional variability (e.g., early trials, previous experience of the drug class). If historical data are used, the sponsor should consider whether these data are still relevant in terms of scientific and methodological validity and in the current treatment context. The magnitude of such variability could be examined in exploratory studies before the planning and design of confirmatory MRCTs. The intrinsic and extrinsic factors important to the drug development program should be identified during the planning stage of an MRCT, and information about these factors should be collected during the confirmatory trial for later evaluation of their impact on treatment effects. The ICH E5 guidance describes intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may affect the treatment effect. In the MRCT setting, the following factors are particularly important and should be considered to identify regions that are suspected to show differences in treatment effects compared to the overall trial results.

  "text": "removing the General Safety Test (21 CFR 610.11) as an example of a test method in section IV.C and by updating certain footnotes, references, and addresses.4 FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA’s guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. B. Definitions For purposes of this guidance: A drug includes, but is not limited to, articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals. (see section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)) for the full definition). A biological product means a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound) applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings (see section 351(i) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 262(i)). The FD&C Act applies to a biological product subject to regulation under 42 U.S.C. 262, except that, under 42 U.S.C. 262(j), a product for which a license has been approved under subsection (a) of 42 U.S.C. 262 shall not be required to have an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355). 3As a general matter, the Office of Vaccines Research and Review in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) reviews the clinical studies for the LBPs described in this guidance. CBER’s Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (OCTGT) reviews the clinical studies for certain microbial products, such as microbial vectors for gene therapy (MVGT), oncolytic bacteria and oncolytic viruses. OCTGT encourages potential sponsors of INDs for such products to contact its office for additional guidance prior to submission of their IND. 4 We are removing reference to the General Safety Test because the underlying regulations were revoked in 2015. See “Revocation of General Safety Test Regulations That Are Duplicative of Requirements in Biologics License Applications” (80 FR 37971, July 2, 2015). Contains Nonbinding",

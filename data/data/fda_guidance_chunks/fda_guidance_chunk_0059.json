An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a)) Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. Within the reporting requirement under 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i), FDA makes clear the meaning of reasonable possibility by providing the following examples of types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome)  One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture)  An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all adverse events for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. Inherent in this definition, and in the requirement to report suspected adverse reactions, is the need for the sponsor to evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the likelihood that the drug actually caused the adverse event. We consider the application of the reasonable possibility causality standard to be consistent with the discussion about causality in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A Guideline (“ICH E2A guidance”).4 However, the Agency notes there is a difference between this rule and the ICH E2A guidance with respect to who is responsible for making the",

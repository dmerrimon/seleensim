If finding a statistically significant treatment effect in any one of the considered endpoints is considered a success, then methods that appropriately adjust for multiplicity across the family of endpoints can be applicable. However, if endpoints are ordered based on clinical importance or logically related, then different methods can be recommended (e.g., Pocock et al. 2012). For example, in the simple case where there is one primary and one secondary endpoint, a hierarchical testing approach can be used. Some methodologies have been developed to account for more complex logical/ hierarchical relationships among the endpoints such as graphical approaches (e.g., Bretz et al. 2009) and mixture gatekeeping procedures (Dmitrienko et al. 2008). The graphical method has a sequential testing algorithm and makes it possible to visualize the testing process via a graph. 13 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations In some cases, a primary endpoint can be tested for non-inferiority (with a fixed margin), followed by testing it for superiority. If this endpoint is the only endpoint being tested, then noninferiority and superiority can be tested without multiplicity adjustment because the null hypotheses of non-inferiority and superiority are naturally ordered, and the two tests apply to the one hierarchy considered for this endpoint. However, if at least one more endpoint is included for testing, then multiplicity issues arise, and adjustments should be made to control the overall Type I error probability. For example, the tests could be ordered in a single hierarchy where the additional endpoint(s) are tested after the superiority hypothesis for the primary endpoint. Or, alternatively, testing could proceed to both the superiority hypothesis for the primary endpoint and to the hypotheses for the additional endpoints, with alpha allocation across these multiple hypotheses. To see why such alpha allocation can be applicable, suppose the drug is non-inferior to the active control with respect to the primary endpoint, but the drug is neither superior to the active control for the primary endpoint nor non-inferior to the active control for the secondary endpoint. Thus, a Type I error could occur with either of these hypothesis tests. If both of these were tested at 0.05, the probability of at least one of",

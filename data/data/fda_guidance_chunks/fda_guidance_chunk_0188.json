For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. 4 These definitions of the terms non-comparative analysis and comparative analysis refer to the setting of a multiarm clinical trial. In a single-arm clinical trial, any analysis of accumulating trial data involves identification of treatment assignment information and, therefore, is considered comparable to a comparative analysis for the purposes of this guidance. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations • The term prospective, for the purposes of this guidance, means that the adaptation is planned and details specified before any comparative analyses of accumulating trial data are conducted. In nearly all situations, potential adaptive design modifications should be planned and described in the clinical trial protocol (and in a separate statistical analysis plan) prior to initiation of the trial. • This guidance distinguishes between those trials that are intended to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and other trials, termed exploratory trials. 5 This distinction depends on multiple features of a clinical trial, such as the clinical relevance of the primary endpoint, quality of trial conduct, rigor of control of the chance of erroneous conclusions, and reliability of estimation. • A fixed sample trial is a clinical trial with a targeted total sample size, or a targeted total number of events, 6 that is specified at the design stage and not subject to prospectively planned adaptation. • A non-adaptive trial is a clinical trial without any prospectively planned opportunities for modifications to the design. • Bias is a systematic tendency for the estimate of treatment effect to deviate from its true value. • Reliability is the extent to which statistical inference from the clinical trial accurately and precisely evaluates the treatment effect. • A critical component of the demonstration of the effectiveness and, in some cases, safety of a drug is the test of a null hypothesis in a clinical trial. If the null hypothesis is rejected at a specified level of significance (typically a one-sided level equal to .025), with demonstration of a clinically meaningful effect of the drug, the evidence generally supports a conclusion of effectiveness. Sometimes, however, the null hypothesis is rejected even though the drug is ineffective. This is called a Type I error. Typically, there are multiple scenarios for which the null",

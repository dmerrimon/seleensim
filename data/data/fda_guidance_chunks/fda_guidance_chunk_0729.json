  "text": "control groups should be similar with regard to all baseline and ontreatment variables that could influence outcome, except for the study treatment. Failure to achieve this similarity can introduce a bias into the study. Bias here (and as used in ICH E9) means the systematic tendency of any aspects of the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of the results of clinical trials to make the estimate of a treatment effect deviate from its true value. Randomization and blinding are the two techniques usually used to minimize the chance of such bias and to ensure that the test treatment and control groups are similar at the start of the study and are treated similarly in the course of the study (see ICH E9). Whether a trial design includes these features is a critical determinant of its quality and persuasiveness. 1. Randomization (1.2.1) Assurance that subject populations are similar in test and control groups is best attained by randomly dividing a single sample population into groups that receive the test or control treatments. Randomization avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. Inability to eliminate systematic differences between treatment groups is a major problem of studies without a concurrent randomized control (see external control trials, section 1.3.5). Randomization also provides a sound basis for statistical inference. 2. Blinding (1.2.2) The groups should not only be similar at baseline, but should be treated and observed similarly during the trial, except for receiving the test and control drug. Clinical trials are often double-blind (or double-masked), meaning that both subjects and investigators, as well as sponsor or investigator staff involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of subjects, are unaware of each subject's assigned treatment. Blinding is intended to minimize the potential biases resulting from differences in management, treatment, or assessment of patients, or interpretation of results that could arise as a result of subject or investigator knowledge of the assigned treatment. For example: · Subjects on active drug might report more favorable outcomes because they expect a benefit or might be more likely to stay in a study if they knew they were on active drug. · Observers might be less likely to identify and report treatment responses in a no-treatment group or might be more sensitive to a",

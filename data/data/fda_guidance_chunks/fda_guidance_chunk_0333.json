Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND Many clinical trials already include decentralized elements. For example, laboratory tests are often conducted by clinical laboratory facilities at locations remote from traditional clinical trial sites. DCTs have the potential to expand access to more representative patient populations and improve trial efficiencies.7 Advances in using electronic communications and information technology to interact with trial participants in different locations (i.e., telehealth) allow for fewer in-person visits to traditional clinical trial sites. Digital health technologies (DHTs), for example, have expanded the types of trial-related data that can be obtained remotely from trial participants. By enabling remote participation, DCTs may enhance convenience for trial participants, reduce the burden on caregivers, and facilitate research on rare diseases and diseases affecting populations with limited mobility or limited access to traditional clinical trial sites. This may help improve trial participant engagement, recruitment, enrollment, and retention of a more representative trial participant population to improve the strength and generalizability of the evidence produced by the trial. 5 See 21 CFR parts 312 and 812. 6 See section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)) for the definition of a drug. In this guidance, all references to drugs include both human drugs and biological products, unless otherwise specified. See section 351(i) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(i)) for the definition of a biological product. See section 201(h)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)(1)) for the definition of a device. 7 See the guidance for industry Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations — Eligibility Criteria, Enrollment Practices, and Trial Designs (November 2020). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Trials where all activities are decentralized may be appropriate for investigational products (IPs) that have well-characterized safety profiles (see section III.G) and do not require complex preparation, administration, or medical assessments. Alternatively, there may be cases when the administration of an IP or a",

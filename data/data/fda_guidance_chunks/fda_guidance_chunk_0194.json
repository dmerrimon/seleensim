Contains Nonbinding Recommendations considerations with the appropriate FDA review division at regulatory meetings such as End-ofPhase-2 (EOP2) or Type C meetings. III. PRINCIPLES FOR ADAPTIVE DESIGNS In general, the design, conduct, and analysis of an adaptive clinical trial intended to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness should satisfy four key principles: the chance of erroneous conclusions should be adequately controlled, estimation of treatment effects should be sufficiently reliable, details of the design should be completely prespecified, and trial integrity should be appropriately maintained. While all clinical trials intended to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness should satisfy these four principles, the following sections outline considerations specific to adaptive designs. A. Controlling the Chance of Erroneous Conclusions Because clinical trials play a central role in premarket decision-making, it is critical to assess the probability that any trial design under consideration will lead to incorrect conclusions of safety or effectiveness, incorrect conclusions of lack of safety or effectiveness, or misleading estimates that contribute to an overall assessment of benefit-risk. For example, there are a number of ways in which adaptive features can inflate the Type I error probability of a trial. The most obvious examples of this are cases in which multiple statistical hypothesis tests are performed. Consider a group sequential design, in which a preliminary test to potentially stop the trial for efficacy is performed after 50 percent of planned subjects have completed the trial. If the trial is not stopped early, a final test is performed once 100 percent of the planned subjects have completed the trial. If each of these two tests were performed at the conventional .025 one-sided significance level and the drug were not effective, the overall chance of the trial yielding a Type I error would exceed 2.5 percent. This is a well-known problem, and a variety of methods exist to determine appropriate significance levels for interim and final analyses that together ensure the overall Type I error probability of the trial is controlled at 2.5 percent (Jennison and",

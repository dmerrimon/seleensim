  "text": "concern, and lowered when concern is reduced because of available data that provide added assurance of safety. This can be visualized as a sliding scale, balancing findings that mitigate the concern for harm to healthy volunteers with those that suggest greater concern is warranted. The extent of the increase or decrease is largely a matter of judgment, using the available information. It is incumbent on the evaluator to clearly explain the reasoning behind the applied safety factor when it differs from the default value of 10, particularly if it is less than 10. A. Increasing the Safety Factor The following considerations indicate a safety concern that might warrant increasing the safety factor. In these circumstances, the MRSD would be calculated by dividing the HED by a safety factor that is greater than 10. If any of the following concerns are defined in review of the nonclinical safety database, an increase in the safety factor may be called for. If multiple concerns are identified, the safety factor should be increased accordingly. • Steep dose response curve. A steep dose response curve for significant toxicities in the most appropriate species or in multiple species may indicate a greater risk to humans. • Severe toxicities. Qualitatively severe toxicities or damage to an organ system (e.g., central nervous system (CNS)) indicate increased risk to humans. • Nonmonitorable toxicity. Nonmonitorable toxicities may include histopathologic changes in animals that are not readily monitored by clinical pathology markers. • Toxicities without premonitory signs. If the onset of significant toxicities is not reliably associated with premonitory signs in animals, it may be difficult to know when toxic doses are approached in human trials. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations • Variable bioavailability. Widely divergent or poor bioavailability in the several animal species, or poor bioavailability in the test species used to derive the HED, suggest a greater possibility for underestimating the toxicity in humans. • Irreversible toxicity. Irreversible toxicities in animals suggest the possibility of permanent injury in human trial participants. • Unexplained mortality. Mortality that is not predicted by other parameters raises the level of concern. • Large variability in doses or plasma drug levels eliciting effect. When doses or exposure levels that produce a toxic effect differ greatly across species or among individual animals of a species, the ability to predict a toxic",

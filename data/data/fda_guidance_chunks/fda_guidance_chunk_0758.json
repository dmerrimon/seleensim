It should also be appreciated that it is not uncommon to show no difference between doses in a dose-response study; if there is no placebo group this is usually an uninformative outcome. If the therapeutic range is not known at all, the design may be inefficient, as many patients may be assigned to sub-therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. Dose-response designs may be less efficient than placebo-controlled titration designs for showing the presence of a drug effect; they do, however, in most cases provide better dose-response information (see ICH E4). D. Active Control (See Section 1.3.4) (2.4) 1. Description (2.4.1) An active control (positive control) trial is one in which an investigational drug is compared with a known active drug. Such trials are randomized and usually double blind. The most crucial design question is whether the trial is intended to show a difference between the two treatments or to show non-inferiority or equivalence. A sponsor intending to demonstrate effectiveness by means of a trial showing non-inferiority of the test drug to a standard agent needs to address the issue of the assay sensitivity of the trial, as discussed in section 1.5. In a non-inferiority or equivalence trial, the active control treatment needs to be of established efficacy at the dose used and under the conditions of the study (see ICH E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials). In general, this means it should be a drug acceptable in the region to which the studies will be submitted for the same indication at the dose being studied. A superiority study favoring the test drug, on the other hand, is readily interpretable as evidence of efficacy, even if the dose of active control is too low or the active control is of uncertain benefit (but not if it could be harmful). Such a result, however--superiority in the trial of the test agent to the control--is interpretable as true superiority of the test treatment to the control treatment only when the active control is used in appropriate patients at an appropriate dose and schedule (see section 1.4.3). Lack of appropriate use of the control treatment would also make the study unusable as a non-inferiority study, if superiority of the test drug is not shown, because assay sensitivity of the study would not be ensured",

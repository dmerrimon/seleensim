In light of diverse regional practices, ensuring high quality of study design and conduct in accordance with ICH E6 in all regions is of paramount importance to ensure the study results are interpretable. Careful attention to quality during trial planning, investigator training, and trial monitoring will help achieve consistently high trial quality required for a successful MRCT. 7. Efficient communication among sponsors and regulatory authorities is encouraged at the planning stage of MRCTs, with the goal of obtaining acceptance of a global approach to study design across the different regulatory regions. II. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PLANNING AND DESIGN OF MRCTs (2) A. Strategy-Related Issues (2.1) 1. The Value of MRCTs in Drug Development (2.1.1) Historically, drug development focused on regulatory strategies designed for specific regulatory regions. In that context, MRCTs had been recognized as an efficient way to enable recruitment of the planned number of trial subjects within a reasonable time frame when the disease and/or Contains Nonbinding Recommendations condition was rare (e.g., an enzyme deficiency disorder), when the disease and/or condition was for special (e.g., elderly, pediatric) populations, or when very large numbers of subjects were required (e.g., cardiovascular outcome studies, vaccine efficacy studies). More recently, global regulatory strategies are also used to plan and conduct studies more efficiently to facilitate more rapid availability of drugs to patients worldwide. MRCTs allow for an examination of the applicability of a treatment to diverse populations. The intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors that are believed or suspected to have an impact on responses to the drug can be further evaluated based on data from various regions using a single protocol. For example, the impact on the treatment effect of genetic differences or different distribution of gene polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes or the molecular target of a drug can be examined in exploratory and/or confirmatory MRCTs that include subjects with different intrinsic factors across regions. Accumulated knowledge of the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors and global sharing of experiences in various regions may promote inclusion of additional regions in MRCTs. The primary reason for performing MRCTs is to evaluate the overall treatment effect based on data from subjects in all regions. However, intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors may be expected",

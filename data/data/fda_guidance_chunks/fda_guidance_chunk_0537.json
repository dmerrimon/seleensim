The NI margin is therefore 1.09 for a fixed margin approach ruling out M1. A summary of the survival results based on the intent-to-treat populations for each of the two Xeloda NI trials is presented in Table 6. Study 2 rules out M1 using a fixed margin approach, but Study 1 does not. Table 6. Summary of the Survival Results Study Hazard Ratio1 Log Hazard Ratio1 Standard Error 95% confidence interval for the Hazard Ratio1 NI Study 1 1.00 -0.0036 0.0868 (0.84, 1.18) NI Study 2 0.92 -0.0844 0.0867 (0.78, 1.09) 1 Hazard ratios and log hazard ratios are Xeloda/5-FU+LV The clinical choice of how much of the effect on survival of 5-FU+LV should be retained by Xeloda was determined to be 50%. The synthesis approach was used to analyze whether the NI criteria of 50% loss was met. This synthesis approach for each study combines the results of that NI study with the results from the random effects meta-analysis to produce a normalized test statistic. Based on this NI synthesis test procedure, NI Study 1 failed to demonstrate that Xeloda retained at least 50% of the historical effect of 5-FU+LV versus 5-FU on overall survival, but NI Study 2 did demonstrate such an effect. It was then decided to determine what percent retention was demonstrated. By adapting the synthesis test procedure for retention of an arbitrary percent of the 5-FU+LV historical effect, it was determined that NI Study 1",

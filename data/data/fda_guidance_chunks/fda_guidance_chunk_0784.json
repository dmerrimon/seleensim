  "text": "If a double-blind trial is not feasible, then the single-blind option should be considered. In some cases only an open-label trial is practically or ethically possible. Single-blind and open-label trials provide additional flexibility, but it is particularly important that the investigator's knowledge of the next treatment should not influence the decision to enter the subject; this decision should precede knowledge of the randomized treatment. For these trials, consideration should be given to the use of a centralized randomization method, such as telephone randomization, to administer the assignment of randomized treatment. In addition, clinical assessments should be made by medical staff who are not involved in treating the subjects and who remain blind to treatment. In single-blind or openlabel trials every effort should be made to minimize the various known sources of bias and primary variables should be as objective as possible. The reasons for the degree of blinding adopted, as well as steps taken to minimize bias by other means, should be explained in the protocol. For example, the sponsor should have adequate standard operating procedures to ensure that access to the treatment code is appropriately restricted during the process of cleaning the database prior to its release for analysis. Breaking the blind (for a single subject) should be considered only when knowledge of the treatment assignment is deemed essential by the subject's physician for the subject's care. Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind should be reported and explained at the end of the trial, irrespective of the reason for its occurrence. The procedure and timing for revealing the treatment assignments should be documented. In this document, the blind review (see Glossary) of data refers to the checking of data during the period of time between trial completion (the last observation on the last subject) and the breaking of the blind. 2. Randomization (2.3.2) Randomization introduces a deliberate element of chance into the assignment of treatments to subjects in a clinical trial. During subsequent analysis of the trial data, it provides a sound statistical basis for the quantitative evaluation of the evidence relating to treatment effects. It also tends to produce treatment groups in which the distributions of prognostic factors, known and unknown, are similar. In combination with blinding, randomization helps to avoid possible bias in the selection and allocation of subjects",

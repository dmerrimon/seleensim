  "text": "Thus, the overall Type I error rate in favor of the drug nearly doubles when two independent endpoints are tested. This higher-than-intended overall Type I error rate when multiple tests are conducted without adjustment is called the multiplicity problem. Thus, without correction for multiplicity, the chance of making a Type I error for this example study as a whole would rise to approximately as high as 5% in favor of the drug, and, therefore, the overall Type I error rate would not be adequately controlled. The problem is exacerbated when more than two endpoints are considered. For example, for three independent endpoints, the Type I error rate is 1 - (0.975 * 0.975 * 0.975), which is about 7%. For ten independent endpoints, the Type I error rate is about 22%. If the multiple endpoints are correlated, the overall Type I error rate is also inflated but potentially by a lesser degree. Even when a single outcome variable is being assessed, if multiple facets of that outcome are analyzed (e.g., multiple dose groups, multiple time points, or multiple subject subgroups based on demographic or other characteristics) and if any one of the analyses is used to conclude that the drug has been shown to produce a beneficial effect, the multiplicity of analyses may cause inflation of the Type I error rate. Hence, by inflating the Type I error rate, multiplicity produces uncertainty in interpretation of the study results such that the conclusions about whether effectiveness has been demonstrated in the study become unreliable. There are various approaches that can be planned prospectively and applied to maintain the overall Type I error rate at 2.5% or below. For controlling multiplicity, an important principle is to first prospectively specify all planned endpoints, time points, analysis populations, doses, and analyses; then, once these factors are 5 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations specified, appropriate adjustments for multiple endpoints and analyses can be selected, prespecified, and applied, as appropriate. Changes in the analytic plan to perform additional analyses can reintroduce a multiplicity problem that can negatively impact the ability to interpret the study’s results unless these changes are made prior to data analysis and appropriate multiplicity adjustments are performed. The statistical analysis plan should not be changed after unmasking of treatment assignments and performing statistical analyses. A focus of this guidance",

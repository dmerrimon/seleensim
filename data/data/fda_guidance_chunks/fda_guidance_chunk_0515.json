  "text": "clinical margin M2 is a matter of judgment about how large a loss of the control treatment effect would be acceptable, a consideration that may reflect the seriousness of the outcome, the benefit of the active comparator, and the relative safety profiles of the test and comparator. Choice of M2 also has major practical implications. For example, in large cardiovascular studies, it is unusual to have an M2 that reflects a loss of less than 50% of the control drug effect, even if this might be clinically reasonable, because doing so will usually make the study size infeasible. Of course, allowing too much inferiority of the test drug to the standard, especially for endpoints of mortality and serious morbidity, would clearly not be acceptable. The fixed margin approach considers the NI margin as a single number, fixed in advance of the NI study. The hypothesis tested in the NI study determines whether the comparison of the test drug to the active control meets the specified NI criterion, assuming, of course, that the active control had at least its expected effect (equal to M1) (that is, the study had assay sensitivity). A successful NI conclusion, ruling out a difference > M1, shows that the test drug is effective (just as a superiority study showing a significant effect at p ≤ 0.05 does) and, if a difference > M2 is also ruled out, shows that the new drug preserves the desired fraction of the control drug’s effect. 2. The Synthesis Approach An alternative statistical approach is known as the synthesis approach because it combines or synthesizes the data from the historical trials and the current NI trial, reflecting the variability in the two sources of data (the current NI study and the past studies used to determine HESDE). The synthesis method is designed to directly address the question of whether the test product would have been superior to a placebo had a placebo been in the NI study and also to address the related question of what fraction of the active control’s effect is maintained by the test product. In the synthesis approach, M1 is not prespecified, but the percent of active control effect to be preserved is prespecified. Based on the observed outcome of the test drug vs. active control comparison in the NI study,",

  "text": "as a general guideline for sponsors considering this approach. Because specific details of an adult oncology drug development program that includes adolescent patients will vary depending on the characteristics and development stage of the drug and disease(s) under evaluation, sponsors are encouraged to 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Divisions of Hematology and Oncology Products and Clinical Pharmacology V in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 For purposes of this guidance, references to drugs includes drugs and biological products approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and biological products licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that are drugs. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations contact the responsible FDA review division to discuss details of the program before implementation. In addition, enrolling adolescent patients in adult oncology clinical trials may contribute toward addressing pediatric regulatory requirements under section 505A or 505B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Details of these requirements should be discussed with the responsible FDA review division. In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND Cancers in young pediatric patients are often different from those in adult patients and require unique treatment approaches; however, some cancers found in adolescent patients—such as some soft tissue and bone sarcomas, central nervous system tumors, leukemias and lymphomas, and melanoma—are similar in histology and biologic behavior to those found in adults. Adolescent patients, because of their age, have historically been ineligible for enrollment in adult oncology clinical trials, and the initial pediatric trials for many drugs are conducted years later, often after the drug is approved in adults. As a result, adolescent patients may have delayed access to potentially effective therapies. In addition, accrual of adolescent patients to pediatric trials evaluating approved drugs may be difficult because patients can receive the drug through off-label use.",

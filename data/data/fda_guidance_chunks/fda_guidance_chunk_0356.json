Contains Nonbinding Recommendations • Conduct an evaluation to ensure the PRO instrument’s comprehensibility and usability 94 before implementation in a trial to mitigate the risk of poor instrument performance.9,10 95 Such an evaluation should be conducted even if the sponsor chooses to use an approach 96 similar to the example approach shown in Table 1. 97 B. Example Assessment of Key COVID-19-Related Symptoms 99 Given the heterogeneous nature of COVID-19-related symptoms, key COVID-19-related 101 symptoms should be assessed systematically to provide an accurate evaluation of benefit in 102 outpatients. In this guidance we provide an exemplary set of 14 common COVID-19-related 103 symptoms to consider in Table 1 (as described below). Although we recommend assessing these 104 items to capture change in common COVID-19-related symptoms (e.g., emergence, 105 improvement, or worsening) during the",

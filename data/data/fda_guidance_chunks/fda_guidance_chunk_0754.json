  "text": "a placebocontrolled trial is unethical and an active control trial would not be credible, it may be very difficult to study new drugs at all. For example, it would not be considered ethical to carry out a placebo-controlled trial of a thrombolytic agent in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Yet it would be difficult in the current environment to establish a valid non-inferiority margin based on historical data because of the emergence of acute revascularization procedures that might alter the size of the benefits of the thrombolytics. The designs described in section 2.1.5 may be useful in some of these cases. b. Patient and Physician Practical Concerns (2.1.7.2) Physicians and/or patients may be reluctant to accept the possibility that the patient will be assigned to the placebo treatment, even if there is general agreement that withholding or delaying treatment will not result in harm. Subjects who sense they are not improving may withdraw from treatment because they attribute lack of effect to having been treated with placebo, complicating the analysis of the study. With care, however, withdrawal for lack of effectiveness can sometimes be used as a study endpoint. Although this may provide some information on drug effectiveness, such information is less precise than actual information on clinical status in subjects receiving their assigned treatment. c. Generalizability (2.1.7.3) It is sometimes argued that any controlled trial, but especially a placebo-controlled trial, represents an artificial environment that gives results different from true real world effectiveness. If study populations are unrepresentative in placebo-controlled trials because of ethical or practical concerns, questions about the generalizability of study results can arise. For example, protocol, investigator, or patient choice from placebo-controlled trials may exclude patients with more serious disease. In some cases, only a limited number of patients or centers may be willing to participate in studies. Whether these concerns actually (as opposed to theoretically) limit generalizability has not been established. d. No Comparative Information (2.1.7.4) Placebo-controlled trials lacking an active control give little useful information about comparative effectiveness, information that is of interest and importance in many circumstances. Such information cannot reliably be obtained from cross-study comparisons, as the conditions of the studies may have been quite different. B. No-treatment Concurrent Control (See Section 1.3.2) (2.2) The randomized no-treatment control is similar in its general properties and its",

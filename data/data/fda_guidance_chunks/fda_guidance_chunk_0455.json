In the MRCT setting, the following factors are particularly important and should be considered to identify regions that are suspected to show differences in treatment effects compared to the overall trial results. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 1. Disease definitions, methods of diagnosis, and the understanding of certain endpoints may vary between regions. These differences could be mitigated by precisely defining inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as study procedures. 2. There may be differences in medical practices and treatments across regions. Such differences may have an impact on the trial results and/or their interpretation. Standardized protocol and training for investigators and study personnel in each region before initiating the trial in that region may reduce some of the impact of this variability. 3. Diet, environmental factors, cultural or socioeconomic factors (e.g., contraceptive use, preferences for a particular route of administration), and access to health care may have an impact on trial results. They may also have an impact on recruitment, compliance, and study subject retention, and may inform relevant mitigation strategies. 4. Subjects’ responses to different drugs may be more or less sensitive to intrinsic factors, leading to regional variability. For example, genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism or receptor sensitivity (described in ICH E5, Appendix D) or body weight and age may have an impact on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, as well as efficacy and safety of the drug. This impact applies not only to the investigational drug but also to comparators and concomitant medications and should be taken into account during planning of MRCTs. Some sensitivity of the treatment effect to intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors may be expected in different regions, but should not preclude consideration of MRCTs. Often, the degree of variability based on the factors mentioned above can be mitigated by proper design and execution of MRCTs. Providing additional support as needed (e.g., logistical, infrastructure, laboratory) for specific regions or other mitigation strategies should be considered and implemented to reduce variability. However, it is important to consider whether the degree of mitigation may have an impact on the generalizability of the study results. Even with the mitigation strategies described above, regional differences may still exist, and these differences are usually because of underlying intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this sense, region is an indicator for other,",

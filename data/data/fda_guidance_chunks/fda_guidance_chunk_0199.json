The analysis of outcome data without using treatment assignment is sometimes called pooled analysis. The most widely used category of adaptive design based on pooled outcome data involves sample size adaptations (sometimes called blinded sample size re-estimation). Sample size calculations in clinical trials depend on several factors: the desired significance level, the desired power, the assumed or targeted difference in outcome due to treatment assignment, and additional nuisance parameters—values that are not of primary interest but may affect the statistical comparisons. In trials with binary outcomes such as a response or an undesirable event, the probability of response or event in the control group is commonly considered a nuisance parameter. In trials with continuous outcomes such as symptom scores, the variance of the scores is a nuisance parameter. By using accumulating information about nuisance parameters, sample sizes can be adjusted according to prespecified algorithms to ensure the desired power is maintained. In some cases, these techniques involve statistical modeling to estimate the value of the nuisance parameter, because the parameter itself depends on knowledge of treatment assignment (Gould and Shih 1992). These adaptations generally do not inflate the Type I error probability. However, there is the potential for limited Type I error probability inflation in trials incorporating hypothesis tests of non-inferiority or equivalence (Friede and Kieser 2003). Sponsors should evaluate the extent of inflation in these scenarios. Another example of adapting based on pooled outcome data is the planned interim reevaluation of the prognostic strength of a biomarker or other baseline characteristic in a prognostic enrichment strategy.13 For example, a trial may be targeting greater enrollment among patients with a certain biomarker to increase the number of endpoint events, but interim pooled outcome data may suggest the biomarker does not have the anticipated effect on the pooled event rate, perhaps leading to a change in recruitment strategies. V. ADAPTIVE DESIGNS BASED ON COMPARATIVE DATA This section discusses different types of clinical trial designs in which there are prespecified rules for stopping the trial or modifying the design based on interim analyses of comparative data. Such analyses are sometimes called unblinded or unmasked analyses. There are a few important concepts that are generally applicable to the sections that",

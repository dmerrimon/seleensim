Likewise the HED in mg/kg based on a surface area conversion given an animal NOAEL is HED = NOAEL C(Wa/Wh)0.33. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations APPENDIX D: Examples of Calculations for Converting Animal Doses to Human Equivalent Doses This appendix provides examples of specific calculations to be taken in deriving an HED based on standardized factors. Tables 1 and 3 provide standardized conversion factors for changing animal or human doses expressed as mg/kg to doses expressed as mg/m2. Tables 1 and 3 also have factors (and divisors) for converting animal doses in mg/kg to the human dose in mg/kg that is equivalent to the animal dose if both were expressed on a mg/m2 basis. This human dose in mg/kg is referred to as the HED. Example 1: Converting to mg/m2 HED To convert an animal or human dose from mg/kg to mg/m2, the dose in mg/kg is multiplied by the conversion factor indicated as km (for mass constant). The km factor has units of kg/m2; it is equal to the body weight in kg divided by the surface area in m2. formula: mg/kg × km = mg/m2 to convert a dose of 30 mg/kg in a dog: 30 × 20 = 600 mg/m2 to convert a dose of 2.5 mg/kg in a human: 2.5 × 37",

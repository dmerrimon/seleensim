Applicants who are required to complete postmarketing clinical trials for drugs or biological products follow a timetable that includes due dates for completing certain milestones in the trial. FDA encourages applicants to inform FDA as soon as possible if they experience delays due to a disaster or PHE that may affect the applicant’s ability to meet the applicable interim,55 trial completion, and/or final report submission milestones. These applicants should propose feasible revised milestones for interim, trial completion, and/or final report submission milestones.56 For postmarket device studies, the approved postapproval study protocol or postmarket surveillance plan generally includes due dates for completing certain study milestones. Due dates for certain milestones may also be listed expressly in the order requiring the postmarket study. Applicants required to complete such studies should similarly inform FDA as soon as possible of delays due to a disaster or PHE that may affect the applicant’s ability to meet those milestones and propose feasible revised milestones.57 Applicants with PMRs or required postmarket device studies should also provide an explanation to FDA of how the disaster or PHE impacts the ability to meet the original milestones. FDA will evaluate the facts and circumstances of the explanation provided, as well as the conduct of the applicant, in determining whether the applicant is in compliance with the applicable authority requiring the postmarketing trial or postmarket device study after an original milestone has been missed. Additional considerations for drug and biological product PMRs include: • PMRs Under Section 505(o)(3) of the FD&C Act: FDA will continue to make “good cause” determinations on a case-by-case basis for all missed milestones, including those where the applicant asserts that its failure to meet a PMR interim, 54 For devices subject to premarket approval, FDA may require postapproval studies as a condition of approval (21 CFR 814.82(a)(2)). FDA may also require manufacturers to conduct postmarket surveillance studies of certain Class II and Class III devices under section 522 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360l). 55 Interim milestones refer to those due dates scheduled to occur between the final protocol submission and trial completion milestones. 56 Although a revised trial completion date may be acknowledged by FDA, for drugs and biological product PMRs, the original projected completion date will continue to be displayed on the FDA’s Postmarket",

FDA is issuing this guidance to provide general considerations to assist sponsors, institutional review boards (IRBs), and clinical investigators in assuring the safety of trial participants,3 maintaining compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), and minimizing risks to trial integrity during disasters and PHEs that may lead to major disruption of clinical trial conduct and operations. The appendix to this guidance further explains these general considerations in a question-and-answer format. In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.

! Three treatment periods of maximum 3 days each: subjects will be resident from the morning 
of the day before the first dosing with BGF MDI (Day -1) in Treatment Period 1, throughout 
all treatment and  washout periods up to discharge on Day 2 of Treatment Period 3; and  
! Follow -up: within 3 to 7 days after the last administration of BGF MDI.  
There will be a washout period of 3 to 7 days between each dose.  
Each subject will receive 3 single -dose treatments of BGF MDI, following an overnight fast of 
at least 8 hours.  
Expected Duration of the Study  
Each subject will be involved in the study for up to 53 days.  
Targeted Study Population  
This study will be conduc ted in healthy male subjects, 18 to 60 years of age

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  6 of 91 Safety and tolerability variables will include  
! Adverse events (AEs)/Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
! Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature,oxygen 
saturation, and respiratory rate)  
! 12-lead safety and digital ele ctrocardiograms (ECGs) as well as cardiac telemetry  
! Physical examination  
! Laboratory assessments (Hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis)  
! Spirometry  
! Taste assessment  
Viral serology and drugs of abuse, alcohol and cotinine will be assessed for eligibility. Use of 
concomitant medication will also be assessed and reported.  
Exploratory Endpoints: 
! Not applicable  
Statistical Methods  
Presentation and Analysis of Pharmacokin etic Data:  
All PK concentrations, parameter summaries and statistical analyses will be presented for the 
PK Analysis Set, unless otherwise specified. The PK concentration and parameter listings will 
be presented for the Safety Analysis Set and will include  all reportable individual PK results.  
Individual PK concentration and parameter data for any subjects not included in the PK Analysis 
Set or excluded from the descriptive summary tables, figures and/or inferential statistical 
analyses will be included in  the listings and flagged with an appropriate footnote.  
The test treatments will be compared to the reference treatment separately (Treatment A vs 
Treatment C and Treatment B vs Treatment C) and also separately for each analyte. The 
statistical analyses will be performed using a linear mixed effects analysis of  variance model, 
using the natural logarithm of AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax as the response variables, with 
sequence, period, treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as random effect. 
Transformed back from the logarithmic scale, geometr ic means together with and the intra -
subject coefficient of variation confidence intervals (CIs) (2 sided 95%) for AUCinf, AUClast, 
and Cmax will be estimated and presented. In addition, ratios of geometric means together with 
CIs (2 sided 90%) will be est imated and presented. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios of 
the PK parameters will be evaluated against the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 
125.00%.  
Additionally, the median difference in untransformed tmax between the test treatments and t he 
reference treatment for each analyte and the 90% CIs for the median differences will be 
calculated using the non -parametric Hodges Lehmann method.  
Presentation and Analysis of Safety and Eligibility Data:  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  7 of 91 Safety data (scheduled and unscheduled) will be presented in the data listings. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, maximum) by treatment. Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency tables 
(frequency and proportio n) by treatment, if applicable. The analysis of the safety variables will 
be based on the Safety Analysis Set.  
Adverse events will be summarized by Preferred Term and System Organ Class using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities vocabulary. Further more, listings of SAEs and AEs that led 
to withdrawal will be made and the number of subjects who had any AEs, SAEs, AEs that led to 
withdrawal, and AEs with severe intensity will be summarized. Adverse events that occur before 
dosing will be reported sepa rately.  
Tabulations and listings of data for vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, digital ECGs and 12 -lead 
safety ECGs (listings only), telemetry (listings only) and spirometry will be presented. Results 
from the taste assessment will be presented separ ately in listings only. Any new or aggravated 
clinically relevant abnormal medical physical examination finding compared to the baseline 
assessment will be reported as an AE. Data will be summarized for the observed values at each 
scheduled assessment, tog ether with the corresponding changes from the baseline when baseline 
is defined. Clinical laboratory data will be reported in the units provided by the clinical 
laboratory for the Safety Review Committee meeting, and in Système International units in the 
Clinical Study Report.  
Out-of-range values for safety laboratory assessments will be flagged in individual listings as 
well as summarized descriptively using agreed standard reference ranges and/or extended 
reference ranges (eg, AstraZeneca, program, or lab oratory ranges).  
Determination of Sample Size  
This is a pilot PK study to determine the relative bioavailability between 2 test formulations of 
BGF MDI with NGPs compared with the current formulation with HFA propellant. Therefore, 
no sample size calculati on has been performed.  
It is expected that 48 healthy subjects will be randomized to a 6 -sequence Williams design for 
3 periods and 3 treatments: ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, CBA, in order to ensure at least 20 
evaluable subjects at the end of the last treatme nt period.  
Subjects are considered evaluable if they have an evaluable PK profile, ie, (1) receive active 
treatment, (2) do not significantly violate protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria, or deviate 
significantly from the protocol, and (3) do not have unavailable or incomplete data which may 
influence the PK analysis.

3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Background Information  
Pressurized MDIs are frequently used in the application of therapeutic delivery for the treatment 
of pulmonary diseases, such as COPD and/or asthma. Their formulations are generally 
comprised of a therapeutic material, a propellant, co-solvents, and surfactants to prevent drug -
aerosol coagulation and to lubricate moving parts of the metering valve. Historically these 
propellants were ozone -depleting chlorofluorocarbons, which prompted the search for more 
environmentally friendly alter natives [ 1]. 
The current HFA propellant (reference treatment) is known to have a relatively high GWP 
compared with some alternative propellants and contributes substantially to the Sponsor, 
AstraZeneca’s carbon footprint. The reformulation of AstraZeneca’s  MDI products with a NGP 
that has much lower GWP will allow patients to continue to use MDI type treatments while 
contributing to AstraZeneca’s sustainability efforts.  
AstraZeneca is developing a Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate MDI, 
hereinafter referred to as BGF MDI, for the treatment of COPD and asthma. The use of BGF 
MDI has recently been approved for the treatment of COPD. This drug product is a M DI 
formulated as a suspension with micronized active pharmaceutical ingredients and Co -
Suspension™ Delivery Technology.  
The Co -Suspension™ Delivery Technology consists of spray -dried porous particles comprised 
of the phospholipid 1,2 -distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine and calcium chloride (DSPC) 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  21 of 91 suspended in a HFA propellant. When used in combination MDI products, these particles form 
strong non -specific associations with the active pharmaceutical ingredients, preventing the drugs 
from interacting with each other in the suspension and providing reproducible drug delivery and 
long-term stability.  
The formulations to be evaluated in this study are MDIs containing a fixed -dose triple 
combination of budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, glycopyrronium, a lo ng-acting muscarinic 
antagonist, and formoterol fumarate, a long -acting β2-agonist that utilize either the current 
propellant (HFA [Treatment C]) or one of two NGPs with lower GWP ( CCI [Treatment A] and 
CCI [Treatment B]). This will be the first study of B GF MDI formulated with the NGPs and 
will determine the relative bioavailability of the new formulations compared with the current 
formulation.  
3.2. Investigational Medicinal Product Information  
3.2.1.  Description of Investigational Medicinal Products  
The study will in clude the assessment of BGF MDI formulated with 3 different propellants:  
CCI (Treatment A [test]), CCI (Treatment B [test]) and HFA (Treatment C [reference]). Each

22 of 91 subject will receive 3 single -dose treatments of BGF MDI, following an overnight fast of at 
least 8 hours:  
of BGF MDI ( CCI  propellant) - test ! Treatment A: 2 inhalations of 
formulation.  
! Treatment B: 2 inhalations of  of BGF MDI ( CCI  propellant) - test 
formulation.  
! Treatment C: 2 inhalations of  of BGF MDI (HFA propellant) - reference 
formulation.  
No fluids will be allowed apart from water which can be given until 1 hour prior to 
administration of the investigational products and then from 2 hours after administratio n of the 
investigational products. A meal will be given 4 hours after administration of the investigational 
products.  
There will be a 3 to 7 -days washout between each treatment period. Subjects will be resident 
from the morning of the day before dosing wit h BGF MDI in Treatment Period 1 until 24 hours 
following dosing in Treatment Period 3.  
3.2.2.  Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate are components (alone or in 
combination) of approved inhalation products (HFA propellant ba sed) for treatment of patients 
with COPD and their safety and efficacy are well characterized. Specific nonclinical absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies for the combination have not been conducted as 
it has been extensively investiga ted and is available in marketed products. General 
PK/toxicokinetic parameters were assessed in rats and dogs in (or in parallel to) the toxicity 
studies on the FDC and each active substance individually and showed no significant PK 
interactions. The Spons or has completed 13 clinical studies in support of the clinical 
development program for BGF MDI. In addition, the Sponsor has completed 3 PK studies  
(Phase 1) and 1 clinical (Phase 2) study in support of the clinical development program for BGF 
MDI to ass ist in dose selection for budesonide [ 1]. 
Budesonide  
The plasma protein binding of budesonide is moderate with an unbound fraction of 8 to 15% in 
human and nonclinical species plasma. Budesonide is a high clearance compound with the 
elimination being solely dependent on metabolic clearance. Two major metabol ites, formed via 
CYP3A4 catalyzed biotransformation, have been identified as 16 α-hydroxyprednisolone and 
6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these metabolites is less than 1% 
of that of the parent compound. Data indicates little po tential for budesonide to be involved in 
drug-drug interactions. Budesonide is a substrate of P -glycoprotein and did not show any 
inhibition toward any of the transporters tested. In addition, budesonide did not inhibit or induce CCI

concentration [ 1]. 
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  
Glycopyrronium  
The free fraction of glycopyrronium in plasma is approximately 60% to 80% in nonclinical 
species and approximately 50% in human.  In vitro, hepatocytes from nonclinical species and 
man showed the main metabolic pathways in most species were mono -oxygenation, di -
oxygenation and mono -oxygenation in combination with desaturation. No turnover was seen in 
lung microsomes. CYP2D6 was foun d to be the predominant CYP isoform involved in the 
metabolism of glycopyrronium. However, in vivo metabolism data in animals showed that 
unchanged glycopyrronium accounted for the major part of drug -related material in plasma and 
urine following intraveno us administration whereas an acidic metabolite (formed by hydrolysis 
of glycopyrronium) was the major metabolite in plasma following oral administration. 
Glycopyrronium shows some drug transporter interactions at high concentrations, but the 
potential for drug interaction is considered to be low from comparison to relevant plasma 
concentrations at a therapeutic dose [ 1]. 
Formoterol Fumarate  
The free fraction of formoterol in plasma is approximately 50% in both human and nonclinical 
species. The primary meta bolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O -
demethylation followed by conjugation to inactive metabolites. Secondary metabolic pathways 
include deformylation and sulfate conjugation. The CYP enzymes involved in the O -
demethylation are CYP2D6  and CYP2C. Possible interaction of formoterol with other 
substrates metabolized by CYP enzymes was also studied. Results indicated that drug -drug 
interactions do not seem likely except possibly for CYP2D6; however, low concentrations of 
formoterol with th erapeutic dosing makes any interaction unlikely [ 1].

Refer to [ 2] and [ 3] for information on the NGPs.  
3.2.3.  Adverse Events, Contraindications and Warnings  
As the IMP contains budesonide, glycopyrroniumand formoterol, the type and severityof 
adverse reactions associated with each of these components may be expected.  
To date, the clinical development program has evaluated over 15000 patients with COPD and 
BGF MDI was found to be well -tolerated with a safety profile commensurate with the 
individual components and the medication class. The following AEs may be associated with 
BGF MDI: oral candidiasis, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, anxiety, insomnia, headache, 
palpit ations, dysphonia, coughing, nausea, urinary tract infections, and muscle spasms – 
common frequency; hypersensitivity, depression, agitation, restlessness, nervousness, tremor, 
dizziness, angina pectoris, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, throat irritation , bronchospasms, 
dry mouth, bruising, urinary retention, chest pain, endocrine and psychiatric disorders -

24 of 91 uncommon frequency. The IMP is contraindicated in subjects who exhibit hypersensitivity to 
any of the excipients or to drugs which are chemically sim ilar to BGF. No formal drug 
interaction studies have been  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
performed, therefore co -administration with other anticholinergic and/or long -acting β2-agonist 
containing medicinal product is not recommended [ 1]. 
No reproductive and  development toxicity studies have been conducted with BGF MDI since 
each of the individual active substances have been investigated. As with other 
glucocorticosteroids, budesonide is teratogenic and embryocidal in studies in rats and rabbits. 
Formoterol h as been shown to cause embryofetal toxicity, teratogenicity, and reduced male 
fertility only at very high doses, and glycopyrronium has shown no significant effects on 
reproduction at large multiples of the therapeutic dose. Experience with glucocorticoste roids 
suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from glucocorticosteroids than 
humans. Studies of pregnant women have shown that inhaled budesonide does not increase the 
risk of abnormality when used during pregnancy. However, there are n o adequate and well 
controlled studies of the use of BGF MDI during pregnancy and lactation, therefore women will 
not be allowed to participate in this study [ 1]. 
There is no previous clinical experience with the NGPs ( CCI  and CCI ), however preclinical 
data generated indicates an adequate safety profile. For more information on the preclinical data 
generated, refer to [ 2] and [ 3].

3.3.1.  Study Rationale  
The study is intended to assess the relative bioavailability and tolerability of FDCs of BGF 
MDI “test” formulations compared to the reference formulation to contribute data to the 
selection  of the NGPs.  
3.3.2.  Overall Study Design  
This study will be a randomized, single blind, 3 -period, 3 -treatment, single -dose, single -
center, crossover study. The study will include the assessment of BGF MDI formulated with 3 
different propellants: CCI (Treatment A  [test]), CCI (Treatment B [test]) and HFA 
(Treatment C [reference]) described in Section 3.2.1 . 
The study will comprise:  
! Screening period: up to 28 days prior to first dosing;  
! Three treatment periods of maximum 3 days each: subjects will be resident f rom the 
morning of the day before the first dosing with BGF MDI (Day -1) in Treatment Period 1, 
throughout all treatment and washout periods up to discharge on Day 2 of Treatment 
Period 3; and  
! Follow -up: within 3 to 7 days after the last administration o f BGF MDI.  
There will be a washout period of 3 to 7 days between each dose.  
Each subject will receive 3 single -dose treatments of BGF MDI (1 dose CCI  [Treatment A]; 
1 dose CCI  [Treatment B] and 1 dose HFA [Treatment C]), following an overnight fast of at 
least 8 hours.  
Approximately 48 healthy male subjects will be randomized in this study to ensure that at 
least 20 subjects are evaluable.

The approximate total amount of blood to be collected from each subject in this study, 
excluding repeat samples, is summarized in Table 3 –4.

Plasma for budesonide, 
glycopyrronium, and formoterol  10 mL  39 390 mL  
 Total  465.5 mL  
Repeat blood samples may be collected for safety reasons. The maximum volume to be drawn 
from each subject must not exceed 500 mL.  
3.3.5.  Order of Assessments  
It is important that PK sampling occurs as close as possible to scheduled time. In order to 
achieve this , other assessments scheduled at the same time may be initiated prior to the time 
point. The sequence at a particular time point is:  
1 Electrocardiograms.  
2 Vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP, pulse rate, SpO 2, body temperature and respiratory 
rate).  
3 Pharm acokinetic blood sampling (will be drawn at the specified time point).  
4 Spirometry.  
In the event of a delay due to technical or logistical issues with the vital sign assessment, PK 
blood sampling should be prioritized to ensure that it is taken within the ±  1-minute window 
allowed.  
Pre-dose assessments (except for pre -dose PK assessments) may be performed up to 
60 minutes prior to dosing.  
3.4. Dose Rationale  
The current dosage is 2 inhalations BID and therefore 2 inhalations should be sufficient to 
reliably estim ate PK parameters. The dose of the propellant to which participants will be 
exposed, is reflective of a 12 hour cycle which is part of the 2 inhalation BID dosage of BGF.

3.5.1.  Risks  
See Section 3.2.3 for risks and AEs that may be associated with BGF MDI.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, safety, known and expected 
benefits, and potential risks of BGF MDI is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure [ 1]. 
Overall, BGF MDI is well tolerated, especially considering that this study includes only 
single -dose administrations.  
Since the products to test are reformulations based on a change in the excipient propellant gas:  
! The active ingredients are the same  
! Treatment is expected  to be as safe as it was previously  
! Treatment is expected to be as effective as it was previously  
! Inhaler device of reformulated drug is same as previous inhaler  
! NGPs are not expected to be environmentally damaging  
! Trials have been undertaken with the NGP -based products in the past  
CCI  
was negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests. It was also very well  
tolerated in single -dose (mouse and rat) and repeat dose (rat and dog) studies with the most 
noteworthy in -life finding being a non -adverse, slight reduction in body weight gain in dog s  
(up to 3620 mg/kg/day). During an inhaled multigeneration reproductive toxicology study,  
10 female rats given 19400 ppm for 6 hours/day (equating to female doses  
> 20000 mg/kg/day) were found dead or were killed early during the lactation stage 
(distr ibuted across the F0 and F1 generations). In one F0 animal, the paralysis was associated 
with brain lesions identified histologically; there were no histological findings to explain the 
deaths/poor condition of other decedents [ 2]. 
In repeat dose studies i n rats, microscopic changes were observed in the heart and liver. In 
repeat dose rat studies, very high gas concentrations were associated with an exacerbation of 
progressive murine cardiomyopathy, a commonly observed background finding in control 
animals.  The severity of this finding was low and did not progress upon longer term dosing; a 
NOAEL of 5000 ppm (6 or 4 hours/day) was maintained at 3 and 6 months. It was also 
generally associated with an increase in plasma AST activity. In a 2 week study, rats g iven ≥ 
20500 ppm showed hepatocyte vacuolation and inflammation with alterations in some 
associated clinical pathology parameters. This finding was not observed in longer term studies 
up to 6 months at doses to 15000 ppm. There were no findings in the hear t or liver of dogs 
treated with CCI  for up to 3 months (14700 ppm for 2 hour/day [> 3000 mg/kg/day]). The CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  34 of 91 NOAEL in the 6 month rat study (5180 ppm, 4280 mg/kg/day) provides a safety margin in 
excess of > 2000 fold, compared with the proposed human single -dose of 1.95 mg/kg [ 2]. 
In conclusion, based on the significant safety margins achieved (> 2000 to > 3000 -fold) 
demonstrated, the data from the toxicology studies completed to date are considered 
appropriate to support the proposed clinical trial [ 2]. 
CCI  
was negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests while in single and repeat  
dose toxicity studies, transient clinical observations were recorded during 
the dosing/exposure period which generally recovered upon cessation of dosing; exceptions to 
this w ere occasional deaths due to self -injury (primarily recorded in rats) and tube deaths 
(mice) at very high gas concentrations (at which levels, low oxygen levels were recorded). No 
other toxicologically important findings were observed in these studies. The  NOAELs 
achieved in the 14 -day repeat dose studies provide significant margins to a proposed single 
human dose of  
1.52 mg/kg (2 shots of 45.6 mg CCI /shot) in the proposed clinical study (between > 2000 
to > 16000 times) [ 3]. 
In conclusion, based on the si gnificant safety margins achieved (> 2000 to > 16000 fold), the 
data from the toxicology studies completed to date are considered appropriate to support the 
proposed clinical trial [ 3]. 
3.5.2.  Risk Assessment for COVID -19 Pandemic  
AstraZeneca is committed to supp orting the safety and well -being of our study participants, 
investigators, and site staff. All local regulations and site requirements are being applied in the 
countries that are affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, including COVID -19 testing of 
participants  if applicable. A benefit/risk assessment has been determined to be positive for the 
participants that are planned to be enrolled in the proposed clinical trial. As the COVID -19 
situation evolves, investigators must use their best judgment to minimize risk  to participants 
during the conduct of the study.  
Measures to mitigate the additional risks caused by COVID -19 are:  
! This study is going to start enrolling only when the Sponsor and CRO in collaboration deem 
it is safe to start the study. In addition, the study will not start until the local confinement 
measures or other safety restrictions linked to the COVID -19 pandemi c are lifted by the 
local authorities.  
! Current national laws and local recommendations for prevention of pandemic will be strictly 
adhered to.  CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  35 of 91 ! Subjects will be closely monitored for any signs and symptoms of COVID -19, including 
fever, dry cough, dyspne a, sore throat and fatigue throughout the study. Once clinical 
signs of infection are reported by subjects, the PI needs to determine whether samples can  
be collected, and safety data can be recorded on site. If not, AEs and concomitant 
medications will b e obtained via phone calls. Daily body temperature measurements 
during in -house stay and outpatient visits will be implemented.  
! The PI will not dose subjects upon identification of any signs of COVID -19 infection.  
! Confirmation of COVID -19 infection by optional laboratory assessment will be conducted 
based on availability (test capacity and turnaround time) of approved tests and on PIs 
discretion. This would include serology testing at screening and virus testing prior to any 
admission.  
! The probability  of virus transmission will be controlled as much as possible by:  
∀ Advising the subject to adhere to local requirements for reduction of the public 
exposure while ambulatory.  
∀ All subjects are contacted by phone one day prior to every visit for assessing  COVID -
19 symptoms and signs and are asked not to attend the site in case of suspected 
reports. In addition, subjects are asked for any contact with a person who has tested 
positive for SARS -CoV -2. If applicable, subjects will be referred to the local heal th 
care system for further follow -up and treatment.  
∀ Physical distancing and person -to-person contact restrictions will be applied during site 
visits and in -house confinement.  
∀ Where physical distancing is not possible, personal protective equipment will  be used 
by subjects (surgical face mask, gloves) and staff (for example, but not limited to 
masks, gloves, protectors, medical suits) if deemed appropriate by the PI and site 
staff and guided by local requirements.  
∀ Logistical improvements of the site an d structural measures of the study site building 
will be implemented to further improve physical distancing.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  41 of 91 5.2.1.  Reproductive Restrictions  
Restrictions  
There is no information about the effects that the NGPs used in BGF MDI could have on the 
development of the fetus in humans. Therefore, it is important that women of childbearing 
potential who are the partners of male subjects, do not become pregnant duri ng the study and 
for a total period of 3 months after the male subject has attended the study follow -up. 
Male subjects who have been sterilized are required to use one barrier method of 
contraception (condom) from the time of IMP administration until after  the follow -up is 
completed. The subject must have received medical assessment of the surgical success.  
As a precaution, all non -sterilized male subjects should avoid fathering a child by either true 
abstinence1 or use a condom and their female partner/spo use has to be either of non -
childbearing potential or has to use a highly effective contraception form of birth control, 
starting from the time of IMP administration until 3 months after the study follow -up visit. 
The female partner/spouse should be stable  on their chosen method of birth control for at least 
3 months before first dosing.  
Highly effective contraception form of birth control, ie, a form of birth control with a failure 
rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, are:  
! Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation o Oral 
o Intravaginal o Transdermal  
! Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation o 
Oral 
o Injectable  
o Implantabl e 
! Intrauterine device  
! Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
! Bilateral tubal occlusion  
1 Sexual abstinence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the study treatments. It is only acceptable if preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject.

Male subjects should not d onate sperm for the duration of the study and for at least 3 months 
after the study follow -up visit.  
Pregnancy  
Subjects will be instructed that if their partner becomes pregnant during the study this should 
be reported to the PI. The PI should also be noti fied of pregnancy occurring during the study 
but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a subject’s partner is 
subsequently found to be pregnant after the subject is included in the study, then consent will 
be sought from the partner an d if granted any pregnancy will be followed and the status of 
mother and/or child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery.  
A pregnancy notification form and follow -up will be completed.  
5.3. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the stu dy due to AEs or changes in safety parameters will 
not be replaced unless a specific sample size is to be met for statistical purposes and if the 
Sponsor’s responsible physician and the PI agree it is safe to do so. Subjects who withdraw or 
are withdrawn f rom the study for other reasons may be replaced following discussion with the 
Sponsor. Subjects who do not have evaluable PK profiles may be replaced at the discretion of 
the Sponsor in order to achieve the minimum of 20 evaluable subjects.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  46 of 91 In each treatment period, the IMP will be administered after a n overnight fast of at least 
8 hours.  
Subjects will be allowed to drink water to prevent dehydration until 1 hour before dosing.  
Water will be allowed ad libitum from 2 hours after dosing and a standard meal will be given 
4 hours after dosing.  
After dosing , subjects will remain semi -supine on their bed or sitting (except when necessary 
for study procedures) until completion of the 4 hour assessments.  
Other restrictions are described in Section 5.2. Data of subjects may be excluded from the PK 
Analysis Set a s described in Section 10.3.2 . 
Specific precautions will be taken to prevent any contamination of collected PK samples by 
the particles of IMP inhalations. Administration of IMP will take place in a room separate 
from the room where blood samples will be d rawn. During administration, subjects and clinic 
personnel will wear protective clothing and gloves according to the routines at the Clinical 
Unit. The protective clothing and gloves will be discarded immediately after administration in 
the room used for i nhalation if the personnel are going directly to the blood draw area, to 
avoid subsequent contamination of blood samples. Subjects will also wash their hands and 
face with soap and water or a disposable wipe after administration of IMP. Subjects must 
wear a surgical mask for approximately 30 minutes before and after dosing.  
All devices must be primed in a separate room (ie, a different room than will be used to 
administer IMP to subjects) by study personnel before the first use. Study personnel must 
wear laboratory coats and gloves during IMP inhaler priming and must remove t heir 
laboratory coats and gloves immediately after priming is completed in the room where 
priming was conducted.  
At the screening visit, on admission/Day -1, and pre -dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, 
subjects will be instructed by site staff on the i nhalation technique for MDI using the 
Vitalograph AIM device. In addition, at the same visits, the subjects will be trained to use the 
placebo BGF MDI inhalers to ensure adequate demonstration of MDI techniques.  
Each dose will consist of 2 actuations from the MDI. The second actuation must take place 
within approximately 30 seconds from the first. At the time of dosing, a healthcare provider 
will be present to ensure that the required number of actuations of the MDI device is properly 
administered by the su bject and that the subject inhales the full dose by observing that none of 
the IMP plume escapes the subject’s mouth. The Sponsor will provide the Clinical Unit with 
instructions for use. The dosing time (recorded as the time of the second inhalation) must  be 
documented on the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  47 of 91 7.7. Concomitant and Post -study Treatments  
If a subject is being considered for enrolment into the study and also being considered for 
COVID -19 vaccination, the subject must not be randomized until at least 7 days after the last 
dose of vaccine or booster.  
Apart from paracetamol/acetaminophen, no concomitant medication or therapy will be 
allowed.  
The subjects should be instructed that no other medication is allowed, including herbal 
remedies, vitamin supplements, and OTC products, wit hout the consent of the PI.  
Medication, which is considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well -being, may be 
given at the discretion of the PI during the residential period.  
When any medication is required, it should be prescribed by the PI. Follo wing consultation 
with the AstraZeneca Lead Physician, the PI should determine whether the subject should 
continue in the study. Administration of concomitant medications that may influence the 
measurement of the PK endpoints may be documented as a protoco l deviation after 
consultation of the PI with AstraZeneca Lead Physician.  
7.8. Treatment Compliance  
Dosing will take place at the Parexel Early Phase Clinical Unit.  
The administration of all IMPs will be recorded in ClinBase™.  
Compliance will be assured by dire ct supervision and witnessing of study drug administration.  
7.9. Randomization  
7.9.1.  Subject Enrolment and Randomization  
The PI will ensure:  
! Signed informed consent is obtained from each potential subject before any study specific 
procedures are performed.  
! Each p otential subject is assigned a unique enrolment number at screening upon signing the 
Informed Consent.  
! The eligibility of each subject is in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
! Each eligible subject is assigned a unique randomization code.  
Randomization can be done on the evening prior to the day of first dosing (Day 1 of 
Treatment Perio d 1). 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  48 of 91 Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially as subjects become eligible for 
randomization [codes to be used without leading zero(s)].  
When using unique enrolment number, the specific format must be followed (ie, reduced 
enrolment numbe r “1001” in ClinBase™ and on labels, full enrolment number “E0001001” 
for outputs).  
If a subject withdraws his participation in the study, then his enrolment/randomization code 
cannot be reused. If a replacement is mandated replacement subjects will receiv e a new 
randomization number and will be allocated to the same treatment sequence as the replaced 
subject.  
7.9.2.  Procedures for Randomization  
Upon completion of the randomization requirements specifications form, the randomization 
will be produced by Parexel acc ording to the AstraZeneca randomization system (AZRand).  
Subjects will be randomized to treatments A, B and C (see Section 3.2.1 ) in one of 
6 sequences as described below.  
The number of subject identifiers generated for the study will account for the numbe r of 
randomized subjects per the sample size calculation (N = 24, see Section 10.4) as well as 
providing sufficient randomization numbers for replacements, on a like -for-like treatment 
sequence basis. For this study, a total of 24 subject identifiers will be randomly assigned to 
the treatment sequence(s): ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, CBA. For replacements, an 
additional 24 subjects will be randomly assigned to the same treatment sequences. For this, an 
additional set of random numbers will be generated on a lik e-for-like treatment sequence 
basis.  
7.9.3.  Procedures for Handling Incorrectly Randomized Subjects  
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion criteria or meet any exclusion criterion should not, 
under any circumstances, be randomized into the study. There can be no  exceptions to this 
rule. 
Where a subject, who does not meet the selection criteria, is randomized in error and this is 
identified before dosing, the subject should be withdrawn from the study. If a subject is 
withdrawn prior to dosing they will be replace d. 
If a subject, who does not meet the selection criteria and has been dosed before the error is 
identified, the subject should be withdrawn and advised to continue safety assessments to 
ensure their safety. The PI will inform the AstraZeneca Lead Physicia n of the error and a joint 
decision made as to whether the subject should be replaced.

8.4.1.  Adverse Eve nts 
Refer to Section 11. 
8.4.2.  Taste Assessment  
The taste of BGF MDI will be assessed by administration of a questionnaire after the 
administration of each dose of the IMP as indicated in Table 3 –2. 
The questionnaire will be administered to subjects immediately post-dose and 30 minutes 
following intake of BGF MDI. Subjects will be asked to complete the questionnaire without 
assistance or influence from site personnel. The questionnaire will be identical for each 
assessment and will require the subject’s opinion o n the following questions:  
(1) Did you detect a taste in the medicine administered? Yes/No  
(2) If yes, on a scale from 1 to 5 (where 1 indicates not unpleasant and 5 indicates 
extremely unpleasant), rate the detected taste of the medicine.  
(3) If yes, please provide a short text description of the taste.  
8.4.3.  Vital Signs  
The following variables will be colle cted after the subject has rested in the supine position for 
at least 5 minutes:  
! Systolic BP (mmHg)

The measurement of vital signs will be  carried out according to the relevant Parexel SOPs.  
8.4.4.  Electrocardiograms  
8.4.4.1.  Resting 12 -lead Electrocardiogram  
A 10 -second twelve -lead safety ECG will be obtained after the subject has been resting in the 
supine position for at least 10 minutes at all timepoints listed in Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 3 –2) and whenever it is required by the PI. All ECGs will be ev aluated with respect to 
rhythm, HR, and PR, RR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals from the 12 -lead safety ECG, and the 
PI will judge the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, it will be decided 
whether the abnormality is CS or not, and the a bnormality will be recorded. The PI or 
delegate will evaluate the printout of the safety ECG in real -time.  
The date/time and the physician interpretation (normal, abnormal CS, abnormal NCS) for the 
safety ECGs will be recorded in the eCRF and stored as sou rce documents.  
8.4.4.2.  Electronic Capture of 12 -Lead Continuous Digital ECG  
The AstraZeneca ECG Center will perform the dECG analysis in this study, using the 
EClysis© system, version 4.0, or higher. V2 will be used as the primary analysis lead, with 
lead V5 as th e primary back -up lead and lead II as the secondary back -up lead, for all time 
points when lead V2 is found to be unsuitable for analysis.  
At the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 –2), 12-lead continuous 
dECG files will be record ed using the site’s Mortara Telemetry Surveyor equipment, 
according to the agreed Parexel and AstraZeneca ECG Center standard procedures for 
settings/configuration, recording and transfer of dECGs.  
The same recording device will be used for each subject, a t all timepoints, when possible. 
Date and time settings must be checked on the Mortara Telemetry Surveyor at the start of 
each study day and aligned with an official timekeeper.  
The metadata of each file will be checked by the responsible personnel at the study site to 
ensure that the files transferred to the AstraZeneca central dECG files repository have correct 
metadata.  
Skin preparation must be thorough and electrode positions must be according to standard 12 -
lead ECG placement. Permanent electrodes will  be applied at least 30 minutes before first 
study recording and left in place for the duration of each relevant study day.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  52 of 91 Subjects will rest in a supine position for at least 10 minutes before the start of each 
recording. The subject should be in the sam e supine body position (maximum 30 degrees 
flexion of the hip and feet not in contact with the footboard) at each recording time point 
during the study.  
From the continuous dECG files received at the AstraZeneca ECG Center, the EClysis© 
system will extract  continuous files of at least 5 minutes length at CSP -indicated time points 
in the Time Schedule for Digital Electrocardiogram Assessments ( Table 3 –3). The extraction 
window can be adjusted by the responsible ECG Scientific Advisor during the metadata 
approval procedure, based on the ‘clinical logs’ received from the site. As standard, from each 
dECG extracted window, 10 -second ECGs will then be extracted by the EClysis© system 
twice per minute and automatically analyzed by the software. The ECG Scientific Advisor 
will perform all necessary manual corrections of the ECG annotations provided automatically 
by EClysis©. All dECGs from one subject will be analyzed by a single reader in a blinded 
manner.  
The AstraZeneca ECG Center Cardiologist will finally review  all data and perform all 
necessary adjustments before locking the data into a read --only state. From the locked data, 
the numerical values for the ECG intervals and amplitudes will then be made accessible on a 
secure file share of the AstraZeneca dECG cen tral repository to accredited Data Management 
specialists for conversion into SAS® files.  
The following dECG variables will be reported by the AstraZeneca ECG Center: RR, PR, 
QRS and QT intervals from the lead defined as the primary analysis lead, as well as potential 
T-wave morphology changes.  
Derived parameters (QTcF, HR and others, as applicable) are calculated by the study 
statistician or delegate.  
8.4.4.3.  Real -Time ECG (Cardiac Telemetry)  
A 12 -lead real -time cardiac telemetry ECG will be performed for 4 to 6 hours on the day 
before dosing, and from at least 30 minutes pre -dose until 24 hours post -dose on dosing days, 
using the Mortara Surveyor Telemetry 12 -leads system.  
The telemetry monito ring system will be reviewed by the PI or research nurse and paper 
printouts of any clinically important events will be stored as source data.

The brief physical examinations will include an assessment of the general appearance, skin, 
abdomen, cardiovascular system and respiratory.  
8.4.6.  Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed by a technologist or a qualified designee to ensure subjec ts 
achieve optimal lung function and using standardized equipment that meets or exceeds the 
ATS/ERS joint recommendations.  
The subject will be in a seated position during spirometry. The following variables will be 
recorded:  
! Forced expiratory volume in o ne second  
! Forced expiratory volume in one second percentage of predicted value  
! Forced vital capacity  
! Forced vital capacity percentage of predicted value  
! FEV1/FVC ratio  
! Forced expiratory flow from 25 % to 75 % of the forced vital capacity  
! Forced  expiratory flow from 25 -75 % of the forced vital capacity – percentage of predicted 
value  
The predicted normal values will be based on the equations derived from the NHANES III 
dataset for adult men.  
The highest value for FEV1 and FVC will be recorded, even if these are not from the same 
maneuver. The FEF25 -75 % is taken from the blow with the largest sum of FEV1 and FVC. 
An assessment of “normal” or “abnormal” will be included, however no statistical assessment 
of mean change from baseline will be done, since this is a healthy population.  
The ATS/ERS guidelines for repeatability and acceptabili ty will be followed. The same 
device will be used for each subject during the 3 Treatment Periods. It is recommended that a 
subject’s spirometry assessments should be performed on the same spirometry device during 
study participation, however if that is no t possible due to operational/logistic aspects, 
screening and follow -up assessment spirometry could be performed on different devices

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  56 of 91 8.5.1.1.  Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be disposed of after the bioanalytical report f inalization or 
6 months after issuance of the draft bioanalytical report (whichever is earlier), unless 
requested for future analyses.  
Pharmacokinetic samples may be disposed of or anonymized by pooling. Additional analyses 
may be conducted on the anonymized, pooled pharmacokinetic samples to further evaluate 
and validate the analytical method. Any results from such analyses may be report ed separately 
from the CSR.  
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis or additional assay development, if any, will be 
performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test samples. The results from the evaluation will 
not be reported in the CSR but separately in  a bioanalytical report.  
8.5.2.  Labeling and Shipment of Biohazard Samples  
Samples will be labeled and shipped in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the 
Biological Substance, Category B regulations (materials containing or suspected to contain 
infectious s ubstances that do not meet Category A criteria), see Appendix B of this CSP 
‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.  
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials will not be shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the subject unless agreed with  AstraZeneca and appropriate 
labeling, shipment and containment provisions are approved.  
8.5.3.  Chain of Custody of Biological Samples  
A full chain of custody will be maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.  
The PI will ensure full traceability of c ollected biological samples from the subjects while in 
storage at the center until shipment and will keep documentation of receipt of arrival.  
The sample receiver will keep full traceability of samples while in storage and during use, 
until used, disposed of, or until further shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and will keep 
documentation of receipt of arrival.  
Samples retained for further use will be registered in the AstraZeneca biobank system during 
the entire life cycle.  
8.5.4.  Withdrawal of Informed Cons ent for Donated Biological Samples  
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be 
disposed if not already analyzed and the action documented.

9.1. Quality Control and Source Data Verific ation  
Source data verification will be conducted with due regard to subject confidentiality.  
The Clinical Unit will allow the study monitor and Sponsor representative direct access to all 
study documents, medical files and source documents to enable verification of the study data, 
while maintaining the anonymity of the subject and confidentiality of the data.  
Internal quality control will be performed at all stages of the study by the Clinical Unit.  
9.2. Audit/Inspections  
The Clinical Unit facilities and all study data/documentation may be audited/inspected by 
independent auditor/inspector/any representatives of regulatory authorities. The PI must allow 
the applicable persons access to all relevant facilities and data/docum ents. The PI must be 
available to discuss any findings/issues.  
If an audit was performed, the audit certificate will be included in the CSR.  
9.3. Study Monitoring  
The conduct of the study will be monitored by an independent Parexel monitor or a 
subcontracted mo nitor to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and 
GCP. The summary of the documentation of the monitoring visits will form part of the study 
documentation and will be archived as such.  
9.4. Data Collection  
The ClinBase™ system is an electro nic source data capturing and information management 
system. The system combines all aspects of source data capturing with process control and 
clinical study management. All clinical and laboratory data, except those which are paper -
based or provided by ex ternal vendor, will be collected in ClinBase™. Only paper -based data 
will be subject to data entry. For electronic source data, no data entry will be performed.  
The responsible study monitor will check data at the monitoring visits to the Clinical Unit. 
The PI will ensure that the data collected are accurate, complete and legible. Data will be 
monitored within ClinBase™ by the study monitor before being exported. Any changes made 
during monitoring will be documented with a full audit trail within ClinBase™.  
9.4.1.  Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
All data obtained using paper collection methods during the clinical study will be recorded in 
ClinBase™. All source documents from which ClinBase™ entries are derived should be 
placed in the subject’s personal recor ds.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  59 of 91 The original ClinBase™ entries for each subject will be checked against source documents by 
the study monitor. Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the PI 
for resolution.  
9.4.2.  Access to Source Documents  
During the course of th e clinical study, a study monitor will make Clinical Unit visits to 
review protocol compliance, compare ClinBase™ entries and individual subject’s personal 
records, assess IMP accountability and ensure that the clinical study is being conducted 
according t o pertinent regulatory requirements. ClinBase™ entries will be verified against 
source documents. The review of medical records will be handled confidentially to ensure 
subject anonymity.  
Checking of the ClinBase™ entries for completeness and clarity and v erifying with source 
documents, will be required to monitor the clinical study for compliance with GCP and other 
regulations. Moreover, regulatory authorities of certain countries, IRBs may wish to carry out 
source data inspections on -site, and the Sponsor ’s clinical quality assurance group may wish 
to carry out audits. Direct access to source data will be required for these inspections and 
audits; they will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and subject 
confidentiality. The PI assur es the Sponsor of the necessary support at all times.  
9.5. Data Management  
Parexel will utilize standardized and validated procedures and systems to collect, process 
and file the clinical data of this study. Any system used will be compliant with FDA 21 CFR 
Part 11 requirements.  
A DMP will be prepared to describe the processes and data -flow within the clinical study. 
Timelines, versions for the computer systems and the coding will be defined in the DMP, and 
if applicable, Sponsor specific requests will also be d ocumented within. The DMP will be 
finalized before first dose, where possible, but before database lock.  
A DVS will be created to outline the validation checks to be performed during the study. The 
DVS must be finalized before data validation.  
After the data has been monitored by the responsible study monitor all data received will be 
reviewed, logged and filed.  
The raw data intended for further processing will be checked by standard routines or 
according to the DVS and queries will be generated  and sent to the PI for review and 
resolution. Corrections resulting from these queries will be confirmed on the Data 
Clarification Forms. This process will be repeated until no further discrepancies are found. 
The data will then be declared as clean. Appl icable documentation will be stored in the study 
files.

10.1. Overview  
The statistical methodology below describes the statistical analysis as it is foreseen when the 
study is being planned.  
If circumstances should arise during the study rendering the analysis inappropriate, or if in the 
meantime improved methods of analysis should come to light, different analyses may be 
performed. A separate SAP will not be written for the study. Any deviations from the 
statistical methodology defined in this protocol, reasons for such deviations and all 
alternative/additional statistical analyses that may be performed will be described i n the CSR. 
Such changes to analyses may be written into an abbreviated SAP, if appropriate. The 
verification and review of all statistical modeling assumptions will be documented 
appropriately.  
10.2. General Statistical Methodology  
All original and derived param eters as well as demographic and disposition data will be listed 
and described using summary statistics. All safety data (scheduled and unscheduled) will be 
presented in the data listings.  
Demographic and baseline data will be summarized for the Randomized  Set. Pharmacokinetic 
data will be summarized by treatment based on the PK Analysis Set. Safety and tolerability 
data will be summarized by treatment for the Safety Analysis Set.  
Frequency counts (number of subjects [n] and percentages) will be made for ea ch qualitative 
variable. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and 
maximum) will be calculated for each quantitative variable (unless otherwise stated). 
Descriptive statistics will only be presented if n > 3. If no subje cts have data at a given 
timepoint, then only n = 0 will be presented. If n < 3, only the n, minimum and maximum will 
be presented. If n = 3, only the n, median, minimum and maximum will be presented. The 
other descriptive statistics will be left blank.  
The following rules will apply to any repeated safety assessments occurring within each 
treatment period:  
! If the repeated measurement of a specific parameter occurs prior to IMP administration (Day 
1), then the last obtained value prior to dosing will be u sed in the descriptive statistics and 
in the calculation of changes from baseline;  
! If the repeated measurement of a specific parameter occurs after IMP administration (Day 
1), then the first (non -missing) value after dosing will be used in descriptive st atistics and 
in the calculation of changes from baseline.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  62 of 91 The planned sequence for measurement of multiple assessments at the same time point is 
described in Section 3.3.5 . 
For safety assessments performed at screening and the follow -up, the following rule s will 
apply for any repeated assessments:  
! If the repeated assessment occurs at screening the last available value will be used in the 
summary statistics;  
! If the repeated assessment occurs at the follow -up visit the first non -missing assessment will 
be used in the summary statistics.  
All statisti cal analyses and production of tables, figures and listings will be performed using 
SAS® version 9.4 or later.  
10.2.1.  Rounding Conventions for Safety Data  
The following rules will be followed with regard to the number of decimal places and 
presentation of data in  the tables and listings:  
! All data will be listed according to the number of decimal places or significant figures 
presented in the original data.  
! Arithmetic mean and median are presented using 1 decimal place more than the original data 
using the number of digits of the individual data + 1.  
! Arithmetic SD is presented using the number of digits of the individual data+ 2.  
! Percentages will be prese nted to 2 decimal places.  
! A maximum of 3 decimal places will apply to all summary statistics.  
10.2.2.  Missing Data  
Missing dates and times in the AE data will be handled as described in Section 10.10.1 . 
Concentrations that are NQ in the PK data will be handled as described in Section 10.9.2 . 
There will be no imputations of other missing data. All subjects who received at least  
1 inhalation of the IMP will be included into the safety analyses as far as th e data permit.  
10.3. Study Populations  
10.3.1.  Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 inhalation of any 
BGF MDI formulated treatment. This includes all original and replacement subjects where the 
1 inhalation criter ion is met.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  63 of 91 Unless otherwise stated, the Safety Analysis Set will be used for the presentation of all safety 
analyses. Exposure to IMP will also be presented using the Safety Analysis Set.  
10.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  
The PK Analysis Set will consist of al l subjects in the Safety Analysis Set for whom at least 
1 of the primary PK parameters can be calculated, and who have no important protocol 
deviations thought to impact on the analysis of the PK data.  
Clinical PK of BGF MDI are described in Section 3.2. 
Data from subjects may be excluded from the PK Analysis Set as a result of the following:  
! Subjects for whom the pre -dose concentration is > 5% of Cmax for budesonide, 
glycopyrronium, or formoterol in a specific treatment period will be excluded from the 
statistical analysis of the affected analyte.  
A subject may be excluded from the analysis due to certain AE affecting PK profiles, but the 
exclusion will be only for the specific treatment period in which the AE occurred.  
The exclusion of any subjects or ti me points from the calculation of the PK parameters will be 
documented by the PK Scientist including the reason(s) for exclusion.  
The available concentration data and PK parameter data for any subjects excluded from the  
PK Analysis Set will be listed only. Concentration data for subjects excluded from the PK 
Analysis Set will be presented in the individual figures of concentration versus time plots, 
using the Safety Analysis Set.  
10.3.3.  Randomized Set  
The Randomized Set will con sist of all subjects randomized into the study.  
10.4. Determination of Sample Size  
This is a pilot PK study to determine the relative bioavailability between 2 formulations of 
BGF MDI with NGPs compared with the current formulation with HFA propellant. Therefore , 
no sample size calculation has been performed.  
It is expected that 48 healthy subjects will be randomized to a 6 -sequence Williams design for 
3 periods and 3 treatments: ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, CBA, in order to ensure at least 20 
evaluable subjects at t he end of the last treatment period.  
Subjects are considered evaluable if they have an evaluable PK profile, ie, (1) receive active 
treatment, (2) do not significantly violate protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria, or deviate

influence the PK analysis.  
10.5. Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are considered any deviation from the CSP relating to a subject, and 
include the following:  
! Inclusion/exclusion criteria  deviations  
! Dosing deviations (eg, incorrect treatment received, subject was not fasted as per the 
protocol requirements prior to and after dosing)  
! Time window deviations for safety and/or PK assessments  
! Subjects receiving prohibited concomitant medi cations  
! Other procedural and study conduct deviations recorded by the Clinical Unit on a protocol 
deviation log  
The criteria for the assessment and reporting of protocol deviations will be stipulated in a 
separate study specific PDS document. This will i nclude a WAD which stipulates tolerance 
windows for safety and PK assessments. Measurements performed within these tolerance 
windows will not be considered as protocol deviations and will not be reported.  
All protocol deviations will be discussed at the data review meeting prior to database hard 
lock in order to define the analysis sets for the study.  
Important protocol deviations will be listed by subject.  
Protocol deviations will be handled in accordance with Parexel SOPs.  
For handling of protocol amendments, see Section 1.6. 
10.6. Subject Disposition  
A randomization listing will be presented and include the following: each subject’s 
randomization number, the sub ject’s full enrolment number, the planned treatment sequence 
and the actual treatment sequence to which the subject has been randomized and the country

stop da te (or ongoing if applicable).  
10.8. Prior and Concomitant Medication and Drug Administration  
10.8.1.  Prior and Concomitant Medication  
Prior medications are those that started and stopped prior to the first dose of IMP; all 
medications taken after first dosing are consi dered as concomitant (including medications that 
started prior to dosing and continued after). Prior medication started within 3 months prior to 
the first dose of IMP will be recorded also in the concomitant medication module of 
ClinBase™.  
Prior and concom itant medication will be listed by subject and will include the following 
information: planned treatment sequence, reported name, Preferred Term, the route of 
administration, dose, frequency, start date/time, duration and indication. Prior and 
concomitant medication will be coded according to the Sponsor’s drug dictionary.  
The duration will be calculated as:  
Duration = end date/time – start date/time  
The duration may be presented in hours or days in the listing depending on the applicability to 
the emerging  data. For medications with partial or completely missing start date/times and/or 
end date/times, the duration will not be calculated.

AUCinf is estimated by AUClast + Clast/ #z where Clast is the last observed 
quantifiable concentration (Day 1  only) 
AUClast  Area under the plasma concentration - curve from time zero to the time of last 
quantifiable concentration  
Cmax  Maximum observed concentration  
Secondary PK Parameters  
tmax Time to reach maximum observed concentration  
t½λz Terminal elimination half -life, estimated as (ln2)/ λz 
MRT Mean residence time in the systemic circulation extrapolated to infinity  
λz Terminal elimination rate constant, estimated by log -linear least squares regression 
of the terminal part of the concentration -time curve  
CL/F Apparent total body clearance of drug after extravascular administration  
Vz/F Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after extravascular 
administration  
TRCmax  Treatment ratio for Cmax [Test Treatment (A or B)/ Reference Treatment (C)], 
derived by dividing the Cmax of the test treatment by the reference treatment

The following diagnostic parameters for plasma PK analysis will be provided:  
λz, Interval or λz upper 
and λz lower  The time interval (h) of the log -linear regression to determine t½ λz. 
λzN Number of data points included in the log -linear regression analysis.  
Rsq adj  Regression coefficient adjusted for λzN, goodness of fit statistic for calculation of 
λz. Reporting criteria: where Rsq_adj of < 0.8, parameters derived using λz will be 
flagged  in the data listings and excluded from descriptive and inferential statistics.  
λz span ratio  Time period over which λz was determined as a ratio of t½ λz. Reporting criteria: 
where t½ λz is estimated over less than 3 half -lives, the value will be flagged i n the 
data listings and excluded from descriptive statistics.  
tlast Time to last quantifiable concentration.  
AUCextr (%)  Percentage of AUCinf obtained by extrapolation, calculated as  
[(Clast/ #z)/AUCinf * 100]. Reporting criteria: where AUCextr is greater than 
20%, AUCinf and parameters derived from this will be flagged in the data listings 
and excluded from descriptive and inferential statistics.  
Additional PK parameters may be determined wher e appropriate.  
The PK parameters will be calculated/estimated according to AZ standards, Guideline 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in Clinical Studies v3 Feb 2020.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will, where data allow, be carried out using actual elapsed times 
deter mined from the PK sampling and dosing times recorded in the database. If actual elapsed 
times are missing, nominal times may be used.  
If an entire concentration -time profile is NQ, the profile will be excluded from the PK 
analysis. Handling of BLQ concentr ations will be according to AZ standards, Guideline 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in Clinical Studies v3 Feb 2020.  
The minimum requirement for the calculation of AUC will be the inclusion of at least 3 
consecutive plasma concentrations above the LLOQ. Where there are just 3 quantifiable 
concentrations, at least 1 of these concentrations should follow the peak concentration.  
10.9.2.  Presentation of Pharmacokinetic Data

the listings and flagged with an appropriate footnote.  
Tables, listings and figures for PK concentration and PK parameter data will be presented 
according to the most recent version of the AZ CPE TFL standards, that includes applicable 
descriptive statistics, handling of individual concentrations below the LLO Q for listings, 
descriptive statistics and figures, and precision and rounding rules for concentrations and PK 
parameter data.  
10.9.2.1.  Plasma Concentration Data  
A listing of individual PK blood sample collection times, derived sampling time deviations 
and concentr ations for all analytes at each protocol scheduled time point will be presented for 
all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set. Listings will be presented by Treatment and Visit.  
For each analyte, plasma concentrations for each scheduled time point will be su mmarized by 
Treatment and Visit using appropriate descriptive statistics. Individual concentrations with 
collection time deviations of greater than ± 10% from the protocol scheduled time will be 
used in the PK analysis but will be flagged for exclusion fro m the summary tables and 
corresponding figures.  
Protocol scheduled times will be used to present the PK concentration summary tables and 
corresponding geometric mean concentration -time figures.  
10.9.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic Parameter Data  
All reportable PK parameters, i ncluding diagnostic parameters, will be listed for the Safety 
Analysis Set for each subject by treatment, where treatments are pooled across periods and 
visit, for each analyte separately.  
All PK parameters will be summarized for the PK Analysis Set separa tely for each analyte by 
treatment, where treatments are pooled across periods, using appropriate descriptive statistics.  
Three values are required as a minimum for PK parameters to be summarized. Two values are 
presented as a min and max with the other de scriptive statistics as NC.  
If 1 or more values for a given parameter is zero (or imputed with zero), then no geometric 
statistics will be calculated for that parameter and the results for geometric statistics will be 
set to NC.  
10.9.2.3.  Graphical Presentation of P harmacokinetic Data  
Data permitting, the following figures may be presented as 
appropriate:

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  69 of 91 ! Figures for the gmean plasma concentration -time data (with ± gSD error bars) presented on 
both linear and semi -logarithmic scales (without ± gSD error bars) usin g scheduled post -
dose time plotted separately for each analyte and all treatments overlaid on the same plot.  
! Individual subject plasma concentration -time data for each analyte graphically presented 
separately on both linear and semi -logarithmic scales us ing actual time post -dose:  
∀ By subject with all treatments for the same subject overlaid on the same plot  
∀ Overlaying individual plots by treatment with all subject’s data in the same treatment 
overlaid on the same plot (separate plots for each analyte/treatment)  
! Individual Test/Reference Treatment Ratios for Cmax, AUCinf and AUClast plotted by 
parameter, to include the gmean ratio and 90% CI for each treatment comparison and 
each analyte separately.  
All geometric mean plots or overlaying individual plots showing all subjects by treatment will 
be based on the PK Analysis Set. Individual plots by subject will b e based on the Safety 
Analysis Set. Scatter plots for individual PK parameters versus treatment will present both 
summary and individual subject parameter data for each treatment including only subjects in 
the PK Analysis Set.  
For consistency, the plasma c oncentration values used in the gmean concentration -time plots 
will be those given in the descriptive statistics summary table for each time point. 
Concentrations that are NQ will be handled as described for the descriptive statistics; if the 
gmean is NQ, the value plotted will be zero for linear plots and missing for semi -logarithmic 
plots. Any gmean ± gSD error bar values that are negative will be truncated at zero on linear 
concentration -time plots and omitted from semi -logarithmic plots.  
10.9.3.  Statistical Ana lysis of Pharmacokinetic Data  
The relative bioavailability will be assessed between the test treatments and the reference 
treatment separately ( CCI  propellant [Treatment A] vs HFA propellant [Treatment C] and 
CCI propellant [Treatment B] vs HFA propellant [Treatment C]) separately for each analyte 
based on the PK Analysis Set.  
For each analyte, the statistical analyses will be performed using a linear mixed -effects 
analysis of variance model using the natural logarithm of AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax as the 
response variables, with sequence, period, treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within 
sequence as random effect. Pairwise statistical models will be fit to the data such that, the 
analysis for each comparison will be conducted excluding the data fr om the treatment that is 
not relevant for the comparison in question. For each analysis, transformed back from the 
logarithmic scale, geometric means together with the CIs (2 -sided 95%) and the intra -subject 
CV for AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax for each treatm ent will be estimated and presented. In

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  70 of 91 addition, ratios of geometric means together with CIs (2 -sided 90%) will be estimated for each 
treatment comparison and presented. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios of the PK 
parameters will be evaluated agains t the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 
125.00%.  
Additionally, the median difference in untransformed tmax between the test treatments and 
the reference treatment for each analyte and the 90% CIs for the median differences will be 
calculated using  the non -parametric Hodges -Lehmann method.  
10.10.  Analysis of Safety Data  
Safety data (scheduled and unscheduled) will be presented in the data listings. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
maximum) by treatment. Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency tables 
(frequency and proportion) by treatment. The analysis of the safety variables will be based on 
the Safety Analysis Set. However, the safety data for the replacement subjects may als o be 
presented separately from the original subjects so as not to attenuate any potential safety 
signals stemming from less than full exposure to the investigational product.  
Adverse events will be summarized by Preferred Term and SOC using MedDRA vocabula ry. 
Furthermore, listings of SAEs and adverse events that led to withdrawal will be made and the 
number of subjects who had any AE, SAEs, AEs that led to withdrawal, and AEs with severe 
intensity will be summarized. SAEs will be recorded from time of infor med consent.  
Tabulations and listings of data for vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, digital ECG and  
12-lead safety ECGs (listings only), telemetry (listings only) and spirometry will be 
presented. Results from the taste assessment will be presented separately in listings only. Any 
new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical physical examination finding 
compared to the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. Data will be summarized for 
the observed values at each scheduled assessment , together with the corresponding changes 
from the baseline when baseline is defined. Clinical laboratory data will be reported in 
Système International units in the CSR.  
Out-of-range values for safety laboratory assessments will be flagged in individual l istings as 
well as summarized descriptively using agreed standard reference ranges and/or extended 
reference ranges (eg, AZ, program, or laboratory ranges).  
10.10.1.  Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using the latest version of the MedDRA vocabulary and will be listed 
for each subject. Adverse events with a start date and time before dosing in Treatment 
Period 1 will be captured as medical history.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  71 of 91 Adverse events will be assigned to a treatment based on the start date/time of the AE in 
relation to dosing in that period; for tabulation purposes the AE will then be assigned to the 
treatment received in the respective treatment period as follows:  
! Treatment Period 1: AEs with start d ate/time at the time of or after dosing in Treatment 
Period 1 until the time of dosing in Treatment Period 2.  
! Treatment Period 2: AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing in Treatment 
Period 2 until the time of dosing in Treatment Period 3.  
! Treatment Period 3: AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing in Treatment 
Period 3 until the final follow -up visit.  
Adverse events with missing start dates/times will be handled as follows:  
! If the start date is completely missing but the end date is known and shows that the AE 
ended on or after the first dose date, then the start date will be im puted as the first day of 
dosing; if the end date is known and shows that the AE ended before the first dose date, 
then the screening date will be used for the start date. If the end date is non -informative 
(ie, is missing or does not contain enough inform ation), the start date will be imputed as 
the first date of dosing;  
! If only the start day is missing the day will be imputed as the first day on which a dose was 
given in that month unless the end date is known and shows that the AE ended before a 
dose w as given in that month; in which case the date will be imputed as 01. If the end 
date is non -informative (ie, is missing or does not contain enough information), the start 
date will be imputed as the first date of dosing in the known month. If the month is  not a 
dosing month the date will be imputed as 01;  
! If the start day and month are missing the date will be imputed as the first day of dosing in 
the known year unless the end date is known and shows that the AE ended before a dose 
was given in that year ; in which case the start day and month will be imputed as 01Jan or 
with the date of screening if this is later. If the end date is non -informative (ie, is missing 
or does not contain enough information), the start date will be imputed as the first date of  
dosing in the known year. If the year is not a year of dosing then the date will be imputed 
as 01Jan or with the date of screening if this is later;  
! Missing times will be imputed as 00:00 h or with the time of dosing for events starting on a 
dosing day.  
For purposes of the AE summaries, the following will apply:  
! AEs with unknown intensity will be treated as “severe” for the tabulations.

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  72 of 91 ! AEs with unknown relationship will be treated as “related” for the tabulations.  
! AEs with unknown seriousness will be treated as “serious” for the tabulations.  
There will be no imputation of AE data for the data listings. All data will be listed as recorded 
in the CRFs.  
Adverse events with onset (start date/time) after dosing in Treatm ent Period 1, up to and 
including the final follow -up visit, will be summarized by treatment (where treatments will be 
pooled across treatment periods) and overall for all subjects, including tabulations by causality 
and severity (mild, moderate and severe ). All tabulations will be presented by SOC and 
Preferred Term using MedDRA vocabulary, with the exception of the causality and severity 
(mild, moderate and severe) tables, which will be presented by Preferred Term only.  
All tabulations will include the n umber and percentage of subjects. In addition, a separate 
tabulation will be presented showing the number of events by treatment and Preferred Term.  
Finally, an overview summary of all AEs will be presented, separately for the number and 
percentage of subj ects and the number of events. This will include categories for any AE, AEs 
that led to discontinuation, AEs with outcome of death, and SAEs.  
Adverse events will be listed by subject and treatment and the following information will be 
included in the listi ngs: verbatim term, SOC, Preferred Term and lowest level term, start 
date/time, end date/time, time from last dose, causality, action taken, whether the AE was 
classified as serious and the outcome. Furthermore, separate listings of SAEs, DAEs and AEs 
that led to death will be presented.  
10.10.2.  Vital Signs  
The results of the vital signs measurements (including SpO 2) will be listed by subject and time 
point including the date/time of the assessment, changes from baseline and 
repeat/unscheduled measurements. The bas eline for vital signs measurements will be the last 
pre-dose assessment on Day 1 in each treatment period. Descriptive statistics will be 
presented by treatment (where treatments will be pooled across treatment periods) and time 
point for both observed val ues and changes from baseline, for all post baseline time points, 
excluding the follow -up visit.  
10.10.3.  Electrocardiograms  
10.10.3.1.  Resting 12 -lead Electrocardiogram  
12-Lead ECG results will be listed for each subject with overall interpretation by the PI as

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  73 of 91 10.10.3.2.  Digital Electrocardiogram (dECG)  
From the dECG data, the following parameters will be derived:  
! QTcF will be calculated as QTcF = QT*RR-1/3, where the QT interval is in milliseconds and 
the RR interval is in seconds.  
! Heart  rate will be calculated, based on the RR interval as HR = 60/RR interval, where the 
RR interval is in seconds.  
Calculation of derived parameters will be performed after smoothing of QT and RR data.  
The dECG data will be smoothed on an individual basis bef ore performing the derivations 
above and prior to calculation of any changes from baseline or descriptive statistics. For each 
subject it will be done as follows: the mean value of all the measurements will be taken 
provided that at least 4 measurements ar e present and the time between the first and last is 
greater than 2.75 minutes or else, the smoothed value at the corresponding target time point 
will be set to missing.  
Digital ECG results will be listed by treatment for each subject and time point and wi ll 
include all individual and smoothed values of PR, RR, QRS, QT interval, and the derived 
values of QTcF and HR. All smoothed and derived parameters will have changes from 
baseline derived and presented.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment and time point for smoothed values and 
changes from baseline of smoothed values of PR, RR, QRS, QT; derived values and changes 
from baseline for QTcF and HR will also be included. The baseline for the d ECG 
measurements will be the (smoothed) pre -dose assessment on Day 1 in each treatment period.  
Outliers with respect to QTcF will also be tabulated for the following categories:  
! Absolute value > 450 ms and ≤ 480 ms  
! Absolute value > 480 ms and ≤ 500 ms  
! Absolute value > 500 ms  
! Increase from baseline > 30 ms and ≤ 60 ms  
! Increase from baseline > 60 ms  
All calculations of dECG parameters and reporting described in this section will be performed 
by Parexel.

Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical physical examination finding 
compared to the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
Body weight will be listed by subject and time point.  
10.10.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
Hematology and clinical chemistry values will be listed by subject and time point including 
changes from baseline an d repeat/unscheduled measurements. Summary tabulations including 
absolute value and changes from baseline to 24 hours post -dose will be presented by treatment 
and time point for the Safety Analysis Set. The baseline for the measurements will be the Day 
-1 assessment performed prior to dosing in each treatment period.  
Any laboratory parameters with results from the laboratory given as “< xx” or “> xx” in the 
database will be imputed with the absolute value of the number without the sign (eg, < 2.2 
will be imputed as 2.2) for the descriptive statistics and changes from b aseline.  
The listings will include the following information: test name, date of measurement, reference 
range, result and flags for any measurements that are outside the reference range (eg, 
AstraZeneca, program, or laboratory ranges). Clinical laboratory data will be reported in 
System International units in the CSR.

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1. Definitions  
11.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and un intended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include b oth Serious and Non -Serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
11.1.2.  Definitions of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run -in, treatment, washout, follow -up), 
that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
! Results in death  
! Is immediately life -threatening  
! Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of e xisting hospitalization  
! Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
! Is an important medical event that may jeopard ize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A of this CSP.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  76 of 91 Adverse Events for malignant tumors reported during a study should generally be as sessed as 
SAEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘important medical event’ criterion should be 
used. In certain situations, however, medical judgment on an individual event basis should be 
applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should  be assessed and reported as a 
NonSerious AE. For example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression 
occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may not fulfill th e attributes for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, 
some types of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospitalization, may be assessed as Non -Serious; examples include Stage 1 
basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy.  
11.1.3.  Other Significant Adverse Events  
During the evaluation of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs or where relevant DAEs and withdrawal from 
the study. Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance 
may, after consultation with the Global Safety Physici an, be considered OAEs and reported as 
such in the CSR. A similar review of other data from laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs and 
other safety assessments will be performed for identification of OAEs.  
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain 
events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction 
or significant additional treatment.  
11.2. Recording of Adverse Events  
11.2.1.  Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be collected from the first dose of IMP throughout the treatment period 
up to and including the follow -up visit.  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent.  
11.2.2.  Follow -up of Unresolv ed Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by the PI 
for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the ClinBase™.  
AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional informa tion for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
11.2.3.  Variables  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  77 of 91 ! AE diagnosis/description  
! The date and time when the AE started and stopped  
! Intensity  
! Wheth er the AE is serious or not  
! Principle Investigator causality rating against the investigational product (yes or no)  
! Action taken with regard to IMP  
! AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)  
! Outcome  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
! Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
! Date PI became aware of serious AE  
! Adverse Event is serious due to  
! Date of hospital ization  
! Date of discharge  
! Probable cause of death  
! Date of death  
! Autopsy performed  
! Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
! Causality assessment to other medication  
The following intensity ratings will be used:  
1 Mild (awareness of s ign or symptom, but easily tolerated).  
2 Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities).  
3 Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs:  
! Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 
11.1.2 . 
! An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea 
that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea , but not a SAE. On the 
other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be an SAE.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  78 of 91 11.2.4.  Causality Collection  
The PI will assess causal relationship between investigational product and each adver se event, 
and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?”  
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication, any additional drug 
and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure 
the causal relationship is implied as “yes”.  
A guide to the interpretat ion of the causality question is found in Appendix A of this CSP.  
11.2.5.  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question 
from the study personnel: “Have you had any health probl ems since you were last asked?” , or 
revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the ClinBase™.  
When collecting AEs the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  
However, if a diagnosis is k nown and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally 
part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
11.2.6.  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests  
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory tests,  vital signs, ECGs and other safety 
assessments will be summarized in the CSR.  
Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values, vital signs, 
ECGs and other safety assessments should therefore only be reported as AEs if they ful fill any 
of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational 
product.  
If deterioration in a laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as a n AE and the associated laboratory result, 
or vital sign will be considered as additional information.  
Wherever possible the reporting PI should use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, 
anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
In the absence of c linical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in nonprotocol -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  79 of 91 Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical 
examination as compared with the baseline assessm ent will be reported as an AE.  
11.2.7.  Hy's Law  
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN may need to be  
reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix C for further instruction on cases of  increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.  
11.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorde d in the ClinBase™.  
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then PIs or other site personnel will inform 
appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he 
or she becomes aware of it.  
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the PI to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca patient safety data entry site within 1 
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar 
days of ini tial receipt for all other SAEs.  
For fatal or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow -up will be undertaken immediately.  
PIs or other site personnel will inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow -up 
information on a previously reported SAE immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he 
or she becomes aware of it.  
11.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the PI to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and 
ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention 
under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about  the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, IRB, and PIs.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  80 of 91 For all studies except those utilizing medical d evices investigator safety reports must be 
prepared for SUSAR according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to PIs as necessary.  
A PI who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety 
informa tion (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
12. LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
12.1. Archiving of Study Document s 
All source documents generated in connection with the study will be retained in the limited 
access file storage area, respecting the privacy and confidentiality of all records that could 
identify the subjects. Direct access is allowed only for authorized  people for monitoring and 
auditing purposes. Source documents will be handled, stored and archived according to in 
house procedures.  
The Investigator's Site File will be archived by the CRO for 15 years after completion of the 
study.  
12.2. Publication of Study Results  
All of the study information and data collected during the study are confidential and the 
property of AstraZeneca. After completion of the study, AstraZeneca may prepare a joint

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Life-threatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in th e 
subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
Hospitalization  
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a  SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrolled in the st udy, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study.  
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical  events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These 
should  usually be considered as serious.  
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.  
Examples of such events are:  
! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intraven ous 
hydrocortisone treatment.  
! Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol/acetaminophen overdose requiring treatment with N -
acetyl cysteine.  
! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm.  
! Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization.  
! Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  84 of 91 The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility” that an AE may have been caused by the IMP.  
! Time Course / Exposure to suspect drug:  
Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?  
! Consistency with known drug profile:  
Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and 
toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? OR, could the AE be anticipated 
from its pharmacological properties?  
! Dechallenge experience:  
Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or  reducing the dose of the suspect drug?  
! No alternative cause:  
The AE cannot be reasonably explained by other etiology such as the underlying disease, 
other drugs, other host or environmental factors.  
! Rechallenge experience:  
Did the AE reoccur if the su spected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped?  
Note: AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a rechallenge.  
! Laboratory tests:  
A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship?  
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  
! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?  
! Is there a known mechanism?  
Causality of ‘related’ i s made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a  
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that the re are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.

Labeling and Shipment of Biohazard Samples  
International Airline Transportation Association classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categories (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.ht  
m). For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk groups 
was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations in the 46th edition (2005). Infectious 
substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt . There is no direct 
relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.  
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disea se in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are for example, Ebola and 
Lassa Fever viruses. Category A pathogens:  
Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.  
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious subs tances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are for example, hepatitis A, B, C, D and E 
viruses, and HIV types 1 and 2. They are assigned the following UN number and proper 
shipping name:  
! UN 3373 – Biological Su bstance, Category B  
! Are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA Instruction 650.  
Exempt refers to all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens.  
! Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or Exempt under IATA regulations.  
! Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in 
IATA 650 compliant packaging.  
(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm)  
! Biological samples transported in dry ice require add itional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry ice content.  
! International Airline Transportation Association compliant courier and packaging materials 
should be used for packing and transportation. Packing should be done by an IATA 
certified person, as applicable.  
! Samples routinely transported by road or rail are subject to local regulations which require 
that they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to contain any risk 
of infection or contamination by using approved couriers and packaging / containment

Appendix C  Actions Required in Cases of Combined Increase of 
Aminotransferase and Total Bilirub in - Hy’s Law C 1
 Introduction  
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report PHL cases and HL cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the 
management of elevated liver biochemistries.  
Durin g the course of the study the PI will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. 
The PI is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential PHL criteria at any 
point during the study.  
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate fo r the determination of PHL and HL events; this 
includes samples taken at scheduled study visits and other visits including central and all local 
laboratory evaluations even if collected outside of the study visits; for example, PHL criteria 
could be met by  an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and/or elevated TBL from a local 
laboratory.  
The PI will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver 
biochemistry) for possible PHL events.  
The PI participates, together with As traZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and 
assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL criteria are 
met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than 
DILI cau sed by the IMP.  
The PI is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting SAEs 
and AEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety 
reporting processes.  
C 2 Definitions  
Potential Hy’s Law (P HL) 
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN at any point 
during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in ALP.  
Hy’s Law (HL)  
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no 
other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, 
elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  88 of 91 For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.  
C 3 Identification of Potentia l Hy’s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:  
! Alanine aminotransferase ≥ 3 × ULN  
! Aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 × ULN  
! Total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN  
The PI will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria 
are met will:  
! Notify the AstraZeneca representative.  
! Determine whether the subject mee ts PHL criteria (see Section C 2 for definitions) by 
reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits.  
! Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF module(s).  
C 4 Follow -up 
C 4.1  Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met  
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the PI will:  
! Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.  
! Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance pro vided in 
the CSP.  
C 4.2  Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the PI will:  
! Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team.  
! Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the PI will report the  case as an SAE of Potential 
Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘important medical event’ and causality assessment 
‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  89 of 91 ! For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the PI is not required to submi t a 
PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the subject’s condition.  
! The Study Physician contacts the PI, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for 
the study subjects’ follow -up (including any further laboratory testing) and the 
continuous review of data.  
! Subsequent to this contact the PI will:  
∀ Monitor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes follow -up SAE Form as required.  
o Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician. This includes deciding which of the tests 
available in the HL laboratory kit should be used (if applicable).  
o Complete the 3 Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.  
# A ‘si gnificant’ change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determ ination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the PI, this may be 
in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
C 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
The instructions in this sec tion should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the PI in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an 
alternat ive explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to ensure 
timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL 
criteria was met. The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety 
Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the PI will follow the instructions 
below.  
Where there is an agreed alternative explanat ion for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and 
subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  AstraZeneca  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  90 of 91 ! If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative expl anation on the 
appropriate CRF module(s).  
! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted PHL SAE and 
AE CRF entries accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality 
and seriousness criteria) following the AZ standard processes.  
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:  
! Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes.  
∀ The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply  
∀ As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.  
If there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is 
no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
! Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL, (report term now 
‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causality assessment i s ‘related to IMP’ and the seriousness 
criterion is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.  
! Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary 
information is obtained, repeat the review and a ssessment to determine whether HL 
criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report following CSP 
process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the 
reported term if an alternative explanation for the li ver biochemistry elevations is 
determined.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
Duloxetine (“Cymbalta”) is a serotonin and norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) 
that is an effective treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy.  It is approved for major 
depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 
fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain ( http://pi.lilly.com/us/cymbalta -pi.pdf ; 
accessed 4/18/2017 ).  
 
Ho et al (“Duloxetine reduces morphine requirements after knee replacement surgery” B r 
J Anaesth 2010) compared duloxetine, 60 mg, to placebo.  Duloxetine was given 2 h prior to 
surgery, as well as POD1.  Patients received general anesthesia, IV morphine PCA, and no 
peripheral nerve block.  Morphine consumption was reduced (19.5 +/ - 14.5 mg ; mean, SD 
vs. 30.3 +/ - 18.1 mg).  Pain scores and side effects were not different.  
 
From the Cochrane review "Duloxetine for treating painful neuropathy or chronic pain", 
Lunn, Hughes, Wiffen: "The action of drugs such as duloxetine is independent of their  
effects on depression.   Onset of benefit occurs within days, earlier and at lower doses than 
in depression.   Furthermore, they have similar effects on pain in depressed and non -
depressed people.”   
 
The Anesthesia/ARJR research collaboration recently p ublished results of a randomized, 
placebo -controlled trial of a 14 -day course of duloxetine for total knee arthroplasty patients 
(YaDeau et al Anesthesiology 2016; 125).  Patients in this study received multimodal 
analgesia with epidural analgesia, adducto r canal nerve blockade, meloxicam, and 
oxycodone/acetaminophen.  There was no effect of duloxetine on pain (the primary 
outcome), but there were two interesting secondary outcomes; reduced opioid intake and 
reduced nausea.  To quote from the paper; “Given the negative result for the primary 
outcome, and the paucity of studies about perioperative analgesic use of duloxetine, it is 
premature to recommend routine use of duloxetine for analgesia after TKA.  Subsequent 
studies could use multiple hypothesis testi ng.”  A related editorial called for ‘more research 
into this area’ (Jacobs MB and Cohen SP.  “Duloxetine for subacute pain management after 
total knee arthroplasty.  Should we write it off or reevaluate?”  Anesthesiology 2016;125:)   
 
Nationally, postoperati ve analgesia with combined epidural infusions and peripheral 
nerve block is uncommon, but the use of local infiltration analgesia (also termed peri -
articular injection) with adductor canal block is recommended by experts , appears to be 
gaining in popularit y, and shows benefits compared to either technique alone  (Sawhney 
Anesth Analg 2016 ; 122:2040 -6; Goytizolo abstract 2017 ASRA meeting ).

2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
 
There is strong justification for additional duloxetine studies with a multiple 
hypothesis testing design. As with the previous pregabalin and duloxetine studies, t his 
study’s outcomes would involve following patients for pain and opioid use through POD14.  
Pain that occurs in the time period between acute and chronic pain, such as pain at 2 
weeks, c an be termed subacute pain.  The previous d uloxetine trial found both group had 
similar pain scores with ambulation on POD14 of 3.8 [2.3]  (mean [SD]) .  Excessive pain can 
cause psychological distress and impair participation in physical therapy.   The duloxetine 
group used less opioid and had less n ausea.   This study will use both opioid administration 
and pain as primary outcomes.   
 
Epidural analgesia after knee arthroplasty is not as prevalent at HSS as formerly, in 
large part due to the rise of local infiltration analgesia.  Studies using epidural  analgesia may 
also lack generalizability given the infrequent use of epidural analgesia at other institutions.  
For these reasons, we plan to use adductor canal nerve blockade + local infiltration 
analgesia for management of immediate postoperative pain.   Patients w ill receive spinal 
anesthesia as the primary anesthetic. It is particularly important to study duloxetine in the 
context of local infiltration analgesia, as patients receiving local infiltration analgesia receive 
increased doses of opioids, com pared to patients receiving epidural analgesia.   
3.0  STUDY HYPOTHESES  
 
Administration of duloxetine to knee a rthroplasty patients (compared to placebo) will reduce 
opioid use and pain scores during the 2 weeks after surgery.

6.0 PROCEDURES  
6.1 Intraoperative  Protocol  
Patients would be randomized to duloxetine (60 mg PO daily for 15 days) or placebo. 
The first dose will be given prior to surgery.   
Preferred Anesthetic/Analge sic protocol: All patients would receive a spinal epidural 
anesthetic (Mepivacaine, 45 -60 mg).  Epidural bolus 2% lidocaine as needed. Patients will 
be given (IV) 4mg dexamethasone, 4 mg odanestron, 20 mg famotidine, 15 mg 
ketorolac.30 -50 mg Ketamine. Up to  5mg Midazolam for sedation. Propofol given as 
needed. No PCA. No intrathecal opioids.  
Adductor canal nerve block (15 cc bupivacaine, 0.25% with 2mg PF -dexamethasone).  
Periarticular injection: one deep injection prior to cementation and then a second more 
superficial injection prior to closure. The deep injection will consist of bupivacaine 0.25% 
with epinephrine, 30 cc; methylprednisolone, 40 mg/ml, 1 ml; cefazolin, 500 mg in 10 ml; 
normal saline, 22cc. The superficial injection will be 20 ml 0.25% bupivac aine. The 
methylprednisolone can be omitted at the surgeon's discretion if necessary for the patient.  
IPACK technique: 25 cc 0.25% bupivacaine  
Postoperative ketorolac (15 mg IV q 8hr, 4 doses) with subsequent oral meloxicam 
(7.5-15 mg PO daily). Oxycodone (5/10/15 mg PO q 3 hr PRN), Acetaminophen (1000 mg 
IV q 6 hr for 4 doses for one day, then 1000 mg PO q 6hr) - PO dose can be adjusted for 
weight if asked by pharmacy.

7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
1. Proposed analysis :  Non-inferiority and superiority tests (one -sided)  
2. Alpha level:   0.0042 to 0.025  
3. Beta or power level:   0.8 
4. Primary outcome variable estimate (mean +/ - s.d. for continuous outc ome, 
frequency/percentage for categorical variable):    See below  
5. Number of groups being compared (use 1 for paired analysis within the same 
subjects):   2 
6. Effect size or change expected between groups:    See below  
7. Resulting number per group:  66 
8. Total sample  size required:   132 + 20% to account for attrition = 160  
 
The primary analysis will be a joint hypothesis test, where duloxetine will be 
recommended if (and only if) it is found to be (A) no n-inferior to placebo in cumulative 
opioid consumption POD 0 – POD 14  and non-inferior to placebo in NRS pain score on 
POD 1, POD 2, and POD 14  and (B) superior to placebo in either cumulative opioid 
consumption  or NRS pain score at at least one timepoint.  Cumulative opioid use will be 
assessed for noninferiority and superiority using two -sample  t-tests. NRS pain score will 
be assessed for noninferiority and superiority using linear mixed effects modeling. The 
model will be adjusted for baseline NRS score, and a group by time interaction term will 
be included in the model regardless of P value (given interest of the PI in obtaining 
estimates for each timepoint separately).  
Inequality hypothesis tests will be performed for all secondary outcomes. Continuous  
secondary outcomes measured at a single timepoint will be analyzed using two -
sample  t-tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum tests, depending upon the distribution of the data. 
Categorical secondary outcomes measured at a single time point will be compared

between gr oups using  χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. Outcomes measured at 
multiple time points will be analyzed using mixed effects modeling with a group by time 
interaction term included in each model regardless of P value.  
Balance on demographics an d baseline characteristics will be assessed by 
calculating standardized differences (difference in means or proportions divided by the 
pooled standard deviation) between groups.  Balance will be assessed using two 
thresholds: (1) 1.96 x (2/80)1/2 = 0.31 an d (2) 0.20 (Austin 2009).  
The success of blinding in each group will be assessed using the Bang Blinding 
Index (Bang 2010).  
All analyses will be performed on an intention -to-treat basis.

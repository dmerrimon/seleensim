Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Summary of Changes to the Protocol  
The previous version of this protocol (Version 2.0, 12 July 2021) was amended to c reate the 
current version (Version 3.0, 19 August 2021 ). The protocol history is provided below.  
Protocol History  
Version and Date of Protocol  Comments  
Version  1.0, 27 April  2021  Original version  
Version 2.0, 12 July 2021  Added exclusion criteria that subjects cannot participate in an interventional 
study of a non -investigational treatment from screening through end of study 
participation;  
Updated acceptable methods of contraception based on supporting nonclinical 
data 
Version 3.0, 19 August 2021  Curre nt version  
 
 
Key changes in the current version of the protocol are summarized below.  
Change and Rationale  Affected Sections  
Expanded study population to include subjects who have  at least 1 CFTR  
mutation identified as responsive to ELX/TEZ/IVA based on in vitro 
data and no F508del mutation (TCR/non -F) (in addition to subjects 
homozygous for F508del  or heterozygous for F508del  and either a gating 
or residual function mutation).  Global  
Increased planned sample size and Treatment Period duration  Global  
Study endpoints were updated to reflect the change in Treatment Period 
duration  Sections 2, 7, and 12.3.3  
Liver function test elevations, creatine kinase elevations, rash, cataracts, 
hypoglycem ia, and neuropsychiatric events were designated as adverse 
events of special interest  Section 12.3.4  
Hemoglobin A1c was added to the hematology pan el to assess pancreatic 
endocrine function  Section 9.3.4 , Table  3-1, Table  3-2, 
and Table  11-2 
Analysis of primary and key secondary endpoints through Week 24 will  
be estimated by averaging Weeks 16 and 24  Sections 2 and 12.3.3.1  
Stratification by genotype group was updated to be based on F/F, F/G, 
F/RF, and TCR/non -F genotypes  Sections 2, 9.2, and 12.3.3  
Rationale for the non -inferiority margin for prim ary analysis of the 
primary endpoint was provided  Section 12.1 
Clarified that it is the responsibility of the investigator to report 
unexpected ser ious adverse drug reactions to the local IRB/IEC if 
allowed by local regulations  Section 13.1.2.3  
 
Typographical and administrative changes were also made to improve the clarity of the 
document.

Assessments  Efficacy : Spirometry, SwCl,  CFQ -R, documentation of events related to health outcomes 
(e.g., PEx), height, and weight  
Safety : AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical 
examinations, and ophthalmologic  examinations (for subjects <18  years of age on the date of 
informed consent)  
PK: VX-121, TEZ, D -IVA, ELX, IVA, and relevant metabolite plasma concentrations  
Exploratory:  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), Cystic Fibrosis 
Impact Qu estionnaire (CF -IQ), DNA sample (optional),  inflammatory mediators,  blood 
biomarker sample, RNA sample (optional), and sputum samples  
  
Statistical 
Analyses  The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through 
Week 24  (estimated by averaging Weeks 16 and 24) . The primary null hypothesis to be 
tested is that the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24 for 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA is inferior by >3  percentage points compared to ELX/TEZ/IVA. The 
null hypothes is will be tested at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025.  
Assuming a within -group SD of 8 and 10% drop -out rate at Week 24 and a treatment 
difference of 0 between VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA, a sample size of 
275 subjects in each group for a total o f 550 subjects will have more than 95% power to test 
the primary hypothesis for the primary endpoint, based on a 1 -sided, 2 -sample t-test at a 
significance level of 0.025.  

Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 6 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted with clinic spirometr y data 
only and will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, and 
Week 24 as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit , and 
treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, continuous 
baseline SwCl, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and genotype group (F/F, 
F/G, F/RF, and TCR/non -F) as covariates . An unstructured covariance s tructure will be used 
to model the within -subject errors.  
The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference 
through Week 24. The primary null hypothesis will be rejected and non -inferiority 
demonstrated if the lower boun d of the 95% CI is ≥ -3.0. 
  
DMC Reviews  A data monitoring committee ( DMC ) will conduct safety reviews of study data as outlined in 
the DMC Charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. CF affects more than 80,000  individuals worldwide 
(approximately 31,000 in the US and 49,000  in the EU).1-4  
CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutatio ns in the 
CFTR  gene.5 CFTR is a channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other anions across 
epithelia in multiple organs and tissues, in cluding the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal 
organs, and sweat glands.6 Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and 
mucolytics, the current median age at death among people with CF is approximately 30  years, 
and the predicted median age of survival is approximately 47  years.1, 2 More effective treatments 
are needed for CF.  
The most common disease -causing mutation is F508del : approximately 85.3% of people with CF 
in the U S and 80.6% in Europe have at least one F508del  allele.1, 2 
At present CF does not have a cure. CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) represent 
a major advancement in the treatment of CF because they are systemic therapies that target the 
underlying cause of the disease and have been shown to improve CF survival by modifying the 
course of disease.7, 8 The clinical testing and regulatory approval of CFTR modulators in certain 
countries for the treatment of people with CF caused by specific CFTR genotype s have 
established the therapeutic value of specific regimens developed by Vertex. These treatment 
regimens include ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco™), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA dual 
combination therapy (Orkambi™), tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA dual combination the rapy 
(Symdeko™, Symkevi™), and elexacaftor (ELX)/TEZ/IVA triple combination (TC) therapy 
(Trikafta™, Kaftrio™).  
Deutivacaftor (D -IVA, VX-561) is a CFTR potentiator and is a deuterated isotope of IVA with a 
specific pattern of 9  substituted deuteriums. In vitro data indicate similar potency of D -IVA in 
human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells relative to IVA. Nonclinical and clinical data 
demonstrate a similar safety profile relative to IVA, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data support once 
daily (qd) dosing (refer to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA Investigator’s Brochure).  
VX-121 is a CFTR corrector that improves the processing and trafficking of mutated CFTR in 
vitro, thereby increasing the quantity of functional protein at the cell surface. The effect of 
VX-121 was additive to the effect of TEZ. The CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by 
VX-121 alone or in combination with TEZ (VX -121/TEZ) was potentiated by either IVA or 
D-IVA. In HBE cells derived from people homozygous for F508del  (F/F-HBE) and people 
heterozygous for F508del  and a minimal function (MF) CFTR  mutation (F/MF -HBE cells) and 
studied in vitro, the TC of VX -121, TEZ, and IVA (VX -121/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride 
transport more than the dual combinations of VX -121/TEZ or VX -121/IVA under most 
conditions (re fer to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA Investigator’s Brochure).  
5.2 Study Rationale  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA in CF subjects who are 
homozygous for F508del  (F/F), heterozygous for F508del  and a gating (F/G) or residual function 
(F/RF) mutation , or have at least 1 triple combination responsive (TCR) CFTR  mutation

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  identified as responsive to ELX/TEZ/IVA and do not have an F508del  mutation (TCR/non -F). 
While ELX/TEZ/IVA is approved in certain  regions for subjects with these genotypes, there 
remains a need for more highly effective CFTR modulators that can restore CFTR function 
(e.g.,  CFTR -mediated chloride transport) toward levels seen in carriers (who do not develop CF) 
in as many patients wi th CF as possible. The potential for benefit in these patients is supported 
by in vitro data and clinical data in F/MF subjects and F/F subjects; in addition, 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA is generally safe and well tolerated (refer to VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA 
Investigator’s B rochure).

Note: Study drug administration is described in Section 9.6. 
Study visits and assessments to be conducted are shown in Table  3-1 and Table  3-2. All visits 
will occur within the windows specified.  
9.1.1  Screening  
Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1. 
The Screening Period (Day  -56 through Day  -29) will occur within 28  days before the first dose 
of ELX/TEZ/IVA  in the Run -in Period.  
Screening assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet the eligibility criteria. The 
investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent and assent, if 
applicable, from each subject before any study procedure takes place.  
9.1.1.1  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility.  If repeat values of the 
individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the scre ening 
window, then the subject is eligible for the study.  
9.1.1.2  Rescreening  
Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be 
repeated, except for:  
• CFTR  genotyping  
• Follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal 
range as determined by the laboratory performing the test during prior screening)  
• Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3  months of the date of informed consent, 
for subjects <18  years of age  on the date of inf ormed consent ) 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 28 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening 
assessment has been initiated.  
9.1.1.3  Extension of Screening Period Window  
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2  weeks for the following  
reasons:  
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section  9.1.1. 1) 
• Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility cr iteria  
• Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (for subjects <18  years of age on the date of 
informed consent, Section  11.6.6 ) 
9.1.2  ELX/TEZ/IVA Run -in Period  
The Run -in Period has a 4 -week duration and is designed to establish a reliable on -treatment 
(ELX/TEZ/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of open -label ELX/TEZ/IVA 
will be administered at the Day -28 Visit. Female subjects must hav e a negative pregnancy test at 
Day -28 before receiving study drug. The last dose of open -label ELX/TEZ/IVA will be 
administered on Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit).  
On Day -14, spirometry (clinic and mobile) and SwCl will be assessed. The Day -14 cli nic 
spirometry and SwCl assessments will be used for stratification of randomization  (Section 9.2).  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study dru g treatment during the Run -in Period will not be 
randomized or participate in the Treatment Period (Section 9.1.5.1 ). 
9.1.3  Treatment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table  3-2.  
The Treatme nt Period will be randomized, double -blind, and ELX/TEZ/IVA -controlled. It will 
last approximately 52  weeks (Day  1 through Week  52). Study drug administration details are 
provided in Section  9.6. 
Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and 
may occur on either Day 1 or Day  -1. Randomization and stratification details are provided in 
Section  9.2. 
To enter the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease (as judged by the 
investigator) and have remained on a stable CF treatment regimen during the Run -in Period. 
Female subjects also must have a negative pregnancy test at Day 1 before receiv ing randomized 
study drug. If these conditions are not met (for example, if the subject has an acute upper or 
lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therapy [including antibiotics] for sinopulmonary 
disease within 28 days before the Day 1 Visit [f irst dose of study drug in the Treatment Period]), 
the subject is considered a run -in failure and cannot enter the Treatment Period or rescreen.  
The Week 12 Visit may be performed either in the clinic or as a home health visit, if permitted 
by local regul ations. All home health visits must have a consultation between the subject and 
investigator (i.e., in person, phone, or telemedicine video conference). This consultation should 
occur within 2 business days before or after the home health visit and can be outside the visit 
window. Additional details regarding home health visits will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 29 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will remain in the study from the 
time of discontinuation of study drug tre atment through the last scheduled study visit 
(Section  9.1.5 ). 
9.1.4  Follow -up 
The Safety Follow -up Visit will occur approximately 28 (± 7) days after the  last dose of study 
drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study drug dosing, as described in Section 9.1.5 . The assessments performed at the Safety 
Follow -up Visit are listed in Table  3-2. 
An open -label study will be available for subjects who complete the Week 52 Visit and are 
eligible. The Safety Follow -up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Treatment 
Period and transition within 28 days of the last dose of study drug to ei ther:  
• a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator regimen,  
• a managed access program -supplied Vertex CFTR modulator regimen,  
• or, an open -label study or other qualified Vertex study.  
9.1.5  Early Termination of Treatment   
If a subject prematurely discontinues s tudy drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment 
(ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue treatment. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety 
Follow -up Vi sit, approximately 28 (±  7) days after their last dose of study drug.  
If the ETT Visit occurs 3  weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit 
will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will no t be 
required.  
If a subject withdraws consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex 
may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study ends, and may use the 
samples and information in the development of the study compound, for other drugs and 
diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws 
from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study (Section  9.9). 
9.1.5.1  Discontinuation During the Run -in Period  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run -in Period will not be 
randomized or participate in the Tre atment Period. These subjects will complete an ETT Visit 
and Safety Follow -up Visit (as applicable).  
9.1.5.2  Discontinuation During the Treatment Period  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period should 
continue to complete all scheduled study visits for assessments following completion of the ETT 
Visit (and Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable), as detailed in Table  3-2.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 30 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  9.1.6  Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if both of the following occur:  
• The subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3  documented attempts by telephone 
within 2  weeks following the second missed visit)  
• The subject does not respond within 2  weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3  attempted 
telephone contacts.  
9.1.7  Completion of Study Participation  
Completion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as one of the following:  
• For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and transition to either an op en-label study 
or other qualified Vertex study , a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator regimen, 
or a managed access program -supplied Vertex CFTR modulator regimen within 28  days of 
the Week  52 Visit: the Week  52 Visit  
• For subjects who complete the  Treatment Period and do not transition to either an open -label 
study or other qualified Vertex study , a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator 
regimen, or a managed access program -supplied Vertex CFTR modulator regimen within 
28 days of the Week  52 Visit: the Safety Follow -up Visit  
• For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment but do not withdraw consent 
(and assent, as applicable): the latest completed study visit up to and including the 
Week  52 Visit, ETT Visit, or Safety Follow -up Visit (if required)  
• For subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, 
whichever is earlier (Section  9.9) 
If subjec ts are lost to follow -up (Section  9.1.6 ), the date of completion of study participation  will 
be defined as the date of the last contact.  
The end of s tudy is defined in Section  13.2.9 . 
9.1.8  Use of Remote Measures in Extenuating Circumstances  
Study visits should be performed in the clinic as specified in Section 3, Table  3-1, and Table  3-2, 
if at all possible. However, under extenuating circumstances, specific alternative measures may 
be implemented (e.g., if a subject is unable to travel to th e study site due to safety concerns 
and/or local restrictions related to COVID -19 or other emerging events) in order to ensure the 
safety of subjects, site investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP 
and minimizing impact to the  integrity of the study. The decision whether to conduct study visits 
remotely or in clinic will be at the discretion of the investigator; if the investigator determines 
that study visits will be conducted remotely, the medical monitor should be notified. The 
Screening Visit, Day -28 Visit, Day -14 Visit, Day 1 Visit, Week 24 Visit, and Week 52 Visit 
must be performed in clinic.  
The following remote measures may be implemented. Additional details can be found in the 
Study Reference Manual.  
• Consent or recons ent may be obtained remotely in writing (or verbally, with follow -up 
written confirmation), as allowed by local regulations.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 31 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Study drug may be shipped directly from the site to the subject, as applicable and as allowed 
by local regulations.  
• Study visits ( except for those noted above) may be conducted as in -home visits by qualified 
personnel.  
• Study assessments to evaluate safety and efficacy may be performed or overseen by qualified 
personnel conducting the in -home visits.  
9.1.9  Data Monitoring Committee  
Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee (DMC) to ensure 
the safety of the subjects. Procedural details of the DMC’s structure and function, frequency of 
meetings, and data planned for review will be in the DMC charter. The DMC  charter will be 
finalized before the first subject is screened.  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA group or the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group. Randomization will be stratified by age at the Screening Visit (<18  versus ≥18  years of 
age), ppFEV 1 determined during the Run -in Period (Day -14 clinic assessment; <70 versus ≥70), 
SwCl determined during the Run -in Period (Day -14 assessment; <30 versus ≥30 mmol/L), prior 
CFTR modulator use (yes versu s no), and genotype group (F/F, F/G, F/RF, and TCR/non -F). If 
the Day -14 ppFEV 1 and/or SwCl values are not valid or not available, the most recent available 
clinic -assessed ppFEV 1 and/or SwCl value will be used for stratification.  
An interactive web respo nse system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The 
randomization code list will be produced by Vertex Biometrics or a qualified randomization 
vendor.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
This Phase 3 study will assess the efficacy and  safety of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA therapy in CF 
subjects who have  at least 1 responsive CFTR  mutation (e. g., subjects with F/F, F/G, F/RF, or 
TCR/non -F genotypes) . 
A randomized, double -blind, ELX/TEZ/IVA -controlled study design was selected to ascertain 
the effe cts of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA while avoiding observer bias. ELX/TEZ/IVA is considered 
an appropriate active control since it is an approved standard of care for treatment of patients 
who have  at least 1 responsive  CFTR  mutation in certain  regions.  
A 4-week Run-in Period was incorporated into this study  to establish a reliable on -treatment 
(ELX/TEZ/IVA) baseline for comparison during the Treatment Period.  
A 52 -week treatment duration was selected to characterize the safety and efficacy of 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA com pared to ELX/TEZ/IVA. The primary endpoint is absolute change 
from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24. Based on prior experience with CFTR modulators, 
24 weeks is adequate to compare the efficacy of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA versus ELX/TEZ/IVA on 
the endpoints bein g evaluated.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 32 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  9.3.2  Study Population  
This study will evaluate the treatment effect of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA in subjects who have  at 
least 1  responsive CFTR  mutation . As described in Section 9.3.3 , subjects who have  at least 
1 F508del  allele (e.g., F/F, F/G, and F/RF genotypes) are expected to respond to 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA based on results from a Phase 2 study conducted in F/MF and F/F subjects. 
This study will also enroll subjects w ho have  at least 1  TCR  CFTR  mutation that is responsive to 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment  based on in vitro data and do not have an F508del  mutation . These 
TCR mutations were identified to be responsive to ELX/TEZ/IVA using a robust in vitro a ssay 
that has demonstrated a strong relationship between in vitro responsiveness and clinical 
response.  
Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rationale for treating patients earlier in life. 
Experience with CFTR modulators in adolescent su bjects ≥12 to <18  years of age, including 
with ELX/TEZ/IVA, suggests that the exposures and safety profile of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA will 
be similar in adolescents and adults, which supports evaluation of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA in 
adolescents in the present study.  
9.3.3  Study Drug Dose  
ELX/TEZ/IVA  
ELX/TEZ/IVA will be administered as ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, 
which is the approved dosing regimen for Trikafta (Kaftrio) in subjects 12 years of age and 
older.  
VX-121 
The VX -121 dose of 20 mg  qd was selected fo r Phase 3 based on an assessment of the  benefit -
risk profile from the Phase 2 Study VX18 -121-101 (Study 121 -101) Part 1 and the relative 
bioavailability (BA) of VX-121 Form A compared to Form D in Study VX19 -121-003 (Study 
121-003).  
Study 121 -101 evaluated  a range of VX -121 (Form A) doses (5 mg qd, 10 mg  qd, and 20 mg  qd) 
in TC with TEZ 100 mg  qd/D -IVA 150 mg  qd for 4 weeks in F/MF subjects. Treatment with 
VX-121 10 mg  qd in TC with TEZ/D -IVA resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in 
ppFEV 1 and SwCl  compared to the placebo group, with minimal additional improvement at a 
higher dose of VX -121 20 mg in TC with TEZ/D -IVA. VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA was generally safe 
and well tolerated in all dose groups, and no differences in the safety profile of 
VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA were observed across the dose groups.   
In addition to the Phase 2 efficacy study, Study 121 -003 evaluated the relative BA of a fixed -
dose combination (FDC) of VX -121 (Form D) 20 mg/TEZ 100 mg/D -IVA 150 mg compared to 
separate tablets of VX -121 (Form A),  TEZ, and D -IVA at the same dose. Results showed that 
VX-121 Form D had ~55% lower  Cmax and ~50% lower AUC compared to VX -121 Form 
A. Therefore, a  dose of VX -121 20  mg qd Form D was selected for Phase 3 to achieve similar 
exposures as the VX -121 10 mg (For m A) dose.   
TEZ  
Based on results from Studies VX17 -121-001 and 121 -101, exposures of TEZ and its metabolites 
at the approved dose of TEZ 100 mg qd in combination with VX -121/IVA or VX -121/D -IVA 
were similar to historical exposures. The dose of TEZ to be e valuated in Phase 3 will be 100 mg 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 33 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  qd, which is part of the approved dosing regimens for Symdeko (Symkevi) and Trikafta 
(Kaftrio).  
D-IVA 
The D -IVA dose of 250 mg qd was selected for Phase 3 based on assessment of the benefit -risk 
profile from the Phase 2 S tudy VX18 -561-101 (Study  561-101) as well as PK data and exposure -
response modeling.  
A Phase 2 monotherapy dose -ranging study (Study 561 -101) was conducted that evaluated 
D-IVA at 25 mg qd, 50 mg qd, 150 mg qd, and 250 mg qd for 12 weeks in subjects with a  gating 
mutation who were receiving stable IVA treatment. Treatment with D -IVA 250 mg qd resulted 
in similar ppFEV 1 and SwCl values as the IVA 150 mg q12h group, with greater improvements 
in SwCl compared to the D -IVA 150 mg qd group. Treatment with D -IVA 150 mg qd and 
250 mg qd was safe and well tolerated, and D -IVA exposures seen at 250 mg qd are consistent 
with prior IVA clinical experience.  
9.3.4  Rationale for Study Assessments  
The efficacy endpoints being evaluated (spirometry, SwCl, CFQ -R, PEx, and anthropometric 
measurements) are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant 
to the study of individuals with CF. On the Day -14 and Day 1 Visits, spirometry will be 
collected using a mobile device to establish baseline val ues on the mobile device. SwCl was 
evaluated in the registration study of IVA (Kalydeco), TEZ/IVA combination therapy (Symdeko, 
Symkevi), and ELX/TEZ/IVA (Trikafta, Kaftrio). Spirometry and CFQ -R assessments were 
evaluated in the registration studies of IV A (Kalydeco), LUM/IVA combination therapy 
(Orkambi), TEZ/IVA combination therapy (Symdeko, Symkevi), and ELX/TEZ/IVA (Trikafta, 
Kaftrio).  
All safety and PK assessments are standard measurements for clinical studies in drug 
development. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1 c) is included to assess pancreatic endocrine function.  
Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, chronic bacterial infection of the airways, and the 
inflammatory response all play a role in causing lung damage in CF. Therefore, assessment of 
inflammatory mediators and other biomarkers is included.  
The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is included as an additional 
endpoint, and is a widely used generic measure of satisfaction with medication and has been 
demonstrated to be a valid a nd reliable measure of satisfaction in patients with CF.14 The 
domains of the TSQM measure effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. 
Because treatment satisfaction is not measured with the other health -related quality -of-life 
measures in this study, the TSQM is included as a study assessment. CF -IQ is also included as an 
additional endpoint to assess life impacts of CF and complement the CFQ -R and TSQM.  Patient 
Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) are 
included to assess a subject’ s perceived severity/change of disease.

9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other 
medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies,  will be collected from each subj ect’s source 
documentation for medications taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through 
completion of study participation, as defined in Section  9.1.7 . 
• Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28  days before the 
Run-in/Day -28 through completion of study participation . Stable treatment regimen is 
defined as the current treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 
28 days before the Run -in/Day -28. Subjects may remain on Vertex CFTR modulators 
(investigational or approved) during the Screening Period and may transition directly to the 
Run-in/Day  -28 without a washout ( Table  9-2). Subjects should not initiate long -term 
treatment with new medication from 28  days before the Run -in/Day -28 through completion 
of study participation . Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF are as follows:  
o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics 
should remain on that regimen throughout the study.  
o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibio tic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period should 
be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in 
the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic.  
o Subjects w ho alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the 
same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period should be synchronized as closely as possible 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 35 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  (e.g., not more than ±  3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled 
antibiotics.  
• Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10  mg/day chronically. 
Subjects cannot receive prednisone or prednisolone at doses >60 mg qd for longer than a 
5-day period.  
• TEZ/IVA is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1, and ELX and M23 -ELX are potential inhibitors 
of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Administration of VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA or ELX/TEZ/IVA may 
increase systemic exposure of substrates of OATP1B1/1B3, which may increase or prolong 
their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions; therefore, caution and appropriate monitoring 
should be used when coadministration of study drugs with medicinal products that are 
substrates of OATP1B1/1B3, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide , is 
required.  
• IVA and D -IVA are weak inhibitors of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Administration of IVA or 
D-IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of 
P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect an d adverse reactions. Digoxin 
or other substrates of P -gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, 
sirolimus, and tacrolimus, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  
• IVA and D -IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, dur ing coadministration with warfarin, 
additional monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended. Other medicinal 
products that are CYP2C9 substrates for which exposure may be increased include 
glimepiride and glipizide; these should be used with caution.  
• Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments performed 
according to the guidelines provided in Section  11.5.1 . 
9.6 Administration  
9.6.1  Dosing  
Study drug will be administered orally. All subjects will receive the same number of tablets each 
day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Study drug will be administered with a  fat-containing meal or snack, such as a standard “CF” 
meal or snack or a standard meal.  
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack.  
2. Study drug will be administered as FDC tablets (e.g.,  2 VX-121/TEZ/D -IVA or matching 
placebo tablets; 2 ELX/TEZ/IVA or matching placebo tablets) in the morning and as 1  IVA 
or matching placebo tablet in the evening. For each subject, doses of study drugs will be 
taken at approximately the same time (±  2 hours) each day.  
3. The d ate, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was 
taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2  doses before PK sample collection and the 
dose received on the morning of PK sample collection.  
4. On days of scheduled visit s, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site 
after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site 
for the morning dose of study drug.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 36 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  5. If a subject’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used:  
• If the dose in the clinic will be within 6  hours of the subject ’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning dose will 
be administered in the clinic.  
• If the do se in the clinic will be more than 6  hours after the subject ’s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should take the morning dose of study drug at home.  
• At the Day  1 Visit, the morning dose of study drug must be administered in the clinic to 
enable predose and/or postdose PK sampling relative to the morning dose.  
6. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
9.6.2  Missed Doses  
If 6 hours or  less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the subject should take 
the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.  
Morning dose : If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed morning dose, the subject 
should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose.  
Evening dose : If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed evening dose, the subject 
should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the  usual 
time.  
Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time.  
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted as outlined in 
Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing 
(Section 9.9). 
9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules  
The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for 
any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption.  
9.8.1  Liver Function Tests  
The central l aboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3  × ULN and total 
bilirubin >2  × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples.  
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN, with or without 
total bilirubin >2  × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by 
the central laboratory within 48  to 72  hours of the initial finding and subsequent close 
monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated.  
If a subject cannot ret urn to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 37 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ide ally within 
48 to 72  hours).  
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2  weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in associati on with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued  if the following  criterion is met:  
• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of wh ether transaminase levels have improved  
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to 
baseline.  
If an alternative, rev ersible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified , study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminases  return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study 
drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 
4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat 
testing within 48  to 72  hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.   
9.8.2  Rash  
Indivi duals who develop a generalized rash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade  3 or higher, or a rash that is 
considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical monitor of 
any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade  3 or higher (Section 13.1.1.4 ), or is an 
SAE. Investigators sho uld consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing 
(e.g.,  complete blood count [CBC] with differential, LFTs), photographs of the rash, and 
dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered 
clinical ly appropriate.  
9.9 Removal of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex 
for safety, behavior, noncompliance  with study procedures, or administrative reasons. A subject 
who withdraws from study drug treatment will continue to be followed unless the subject 
withdraws consent (and assent, as applicable).  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 38 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug  treatment if the subject meets any of 
the following criteria:  
• Has a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR  
genotype laboratory report was used to establish eligibility. These subjects must be 
discontinued from t he study (Section  8.1) 
• Meets any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria (Section  9.8) 
• Becomes pregnant (Section 11.6.7.2 ) 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment early sh ould continue to return for study assessments, 
as noted in Section  9.1.5 .  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all 
unused investigational product(s), requ est that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety 
Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section  9.1.4 ), and follow  up with the subject regardin g any 
unresolved AEs.  
If a subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. 
Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study ends, and may 
use the samples and information in the dev elopment of the study compound, for other drugs and 
diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws 
from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will 
not be  able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may 
request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those 
samples can be identified as his/her samples.  
9.10 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn before the first dose of study drug on Day  1 of the 
Treatment Period may be replaced.  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug treatment 
period may be replaced at Vertex’s discret ion.

10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information about the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug 
returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all  used and unused materials 
associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to 
instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug 
records and inventory throughout the study.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 40 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  If a site uses a site -specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes 
associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and 
approved by Vertex. Additional details will be provided in the P harmacy Manual. The study 
monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study 
monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with 
the site.  
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unu sed Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until 
the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional 
policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately 
documented.  
The principal investigator (PI), study site staff, including pharmacy personnel will assist Vertex 
with any recall activities (as applicable) and place impacted investigational medicinal product 
(IMP) in quarantine when requested.  
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing 
that occurs at the site. At ea ch visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with 
study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will 
also be assessed by ongoing study drug count.  
If a subject demonstrates continued noncomplia nce of study drug dosing despite educational 
efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study.   
10.7 Blinding and Unblinding  
This is a double -blind study.  
10.7.1  Blinding  
All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site  personnel (including the investigator, 
the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to 
the treatment codes.  
Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following:  
• Any site personnel for whom this inform ation is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
in the event of a life -threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy  
• Vertex Globa l Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE 
processing and reporting regulations  
• Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list  
• Vertex IWRS Manager  
• Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 41 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • DMC  
• Vendor preparing the unblinded analy sis of safety data for review by the DMC  
• Analysts or vendor for modeling and simulations performing population PK modeling in 
preparation for regulatory submission(s)  
• Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and the Vertex 
Bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team  but reviews raw data from the 
Bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex Bioanalytical study team  member will continue to be 
blinded.  
Access to Spirometry and SwCl Results : 
During the conduct of the study, th e Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry or 
SwCl results after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 of the Treatment Period, with the 
exception of spirometry related to adverse event reporting.  
Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spirometry and SwCl data will be 
reviewed for data cleaning purposes by a limited Vertex team that does not have access to the 
treatment codes.  
Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the except ion of the 
Screening Visit and Day -14 values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not 
be informed of study -related spirometry results until Vertex has determined that the study has 
completed (i.e.,  clinical study report [CSR] finalizat ion), regardless of whether the subject has 
prematurely discontinued treatment.  
10.7.2  Unblinding  
At the initiation of the study, study site personnel will be instructed on the method for breaking 
the blind. The unblinding method will be either manual or electro nic. 
Unblinding of the individual subject’s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical 
emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment is 
necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investig ators will use their best judgment as to 
whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. 
If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the 
medical monitor t o discuss unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding.  
Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate 
document.  
If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24  hours of the unblinding even t. 
The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’s study file. 
Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shar ed with Vertex, the CRO, or any site 
personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the investigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 42 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  according to the regulatory definitio ns or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to 
Vertex GPS or designee, per Section  13.1.2 . 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any  SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual 
subjects at any time.  
11 ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of assessments is shown in Table  3-1 and Table  3-2.  
11.1 Subject and Disease Characteristics  
Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, 
and weight . 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject and extracted from medical records during 
screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying 
medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history will 
include a complete review of systems, medical and surgical histories, and any allergies.  
Height and weight will be meas ured with shoes off . Height will be collected at screening for all 
subjects. Following screening,  height will be collected only for subjects ≤21  years of age on the 
date of informed consent.  
11.2 Pharmacokinetics  
11.2.1  Blood Sampling  
Blood samples will be collected t o determine plasma concentrations of VX-121, TEZ, D -IVA, 
ELX, IVA, and relevant metabolites . These samples may also be used for further evaluation of 
the bioanalytical method, or for exploratory analyses that provide information on the metabolic 
pathways u sed by or affected by any study drugs.  
All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing. 
Acceptable windows for sampling times are shown in Table  11-1. Samples collected outside of 
these acceptable windows will be considered protocol deviations. The exact time of the sample 
collection will be noted.  
Table  11-1 Acceptable Pharmacokinetic Sampling Windows

Predose  -60 minutes  
2 hours after study drug dosing  ± 15 minutes  
 
Blood samples will be collected as shown in Table  3-2. 
For each visit with a PK blood draw, a record of study drug administration will be collected as 
described in Section  9.6. The collection date and exact time that each PK blood sample is drawn 
will also be recorded.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 43 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Samples from the PK sampling will be kept frozen by Vertex or its designee until all analyses 
have been completed and t hen disposed of according to Vertex or designee standard operating 
procedures.  
11.2.2  Processing and Handling of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Detailed procedures for the collection of blood samples and further procedures for processing 
and handling of samples for PK a nalysis will be in the PK Sample Handling Guidelines.  
11.2.3  Bioanalysis  
Samples will be analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Vertex or 
designee standard operating procedures. A description of the assay and validation data will be 
provided in separate reports.  
11.3 Pharmacodynamics  
While SwCl is a pharmacodynamic measure of CFTR function, it is also a measure of efficacy 
and is discussed in Section 11.5.2 . 
11.4 Exploratory Assessments  
These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes. Detailed procedures for the collection 
of blood samples and additional procedures for processing and handling samples for 
pharmacogenomics analysis will be provided in a separate document.  
11.4.1  Pharmac ogenomics  
An optional single  blood sample (DNA Sample) will be collected for potential exploratory 
evaluation of associations between DNA markers with PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), treatment 
response, AEs, and health and disease, especially CF, for subjects w ho choose to participate in 
this assessment (if permitted by local regulations).  
11.4.2  Inflammatory Mediators  
Blood samples (inflammatory mediator samples) will be collected at the time points noted in 
Table  3-2 and tested to assess markers related to inflammation. These may include, but are not 
limited to, C -reactive protein (CRP), immunoglobulin G (IgG), white blood cell (WBC, 
leukocyte) count, and interleuk in-8 (IL -8). Specific instructions for the collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment of inflammatory mediator samples will be provided in the Laboratory 
Manual.  
11.4.3  Other Blood Biomarkers  
Additional blood samples for plasma and serum will be collected and banked for potential future 
exploratory evaluation of other blood biomarkers (e.g., proteins, peptides, lipids, metabolites, 
etc.) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and various disease manifestations of CF.  
Optional blood samples (RNA Sample ) may be collected (if permitted by local regulations) for 
potential exploratory evaluation of associations between RNA markers with PK, PD, treatment 
response, and AEs.  
11.4.4  Microbiology and Other Sputum Biomarkers  
Sputum samples will be collected at the time points noted in Table  3-2 from subjects who can 
produce a sample spontaneously. Each sample will be proce ssed and frozen for potential 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 44 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  exploratory evaluation of microbiology analysis and sputum biomarkers (which may include, but 
are not limited to, qualitative and quantitative bacterial and viral assessments including genomic 
analyses, analysis of immune cell s, inflammatory markers, proteins, peptides, lipids, and 
endogenous metabolites) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and various disease 
manifestations of CF . 
Specific instructions for the collection, processing, aliquoting, storage, and shipme nt of sputum 
samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.   
11.4.5  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication  
The TSQM is a widely used generic measure of satisfaction with medication. The domains of the 
TSQM measure effectiveness, side effects, con venience, and global satisfaction. Because 
treatment satisfaction is not measured with the other health -related quality -of-life measures in 
this study, the TSQM will be included as an assessment for this purpose. Translations of the 
TSQM will be provided f or participating centers with non -English -speaking populations.  
All subjects should be instructed to complete the TSQM questionnaire on the Day  -28 Visit 
based on their experience of their current medication regimen over the prior 2 to 3  weeks. Only 
subje cts <18  years of age on the date of informed consent will complete the TSQM at subsequent 
visits; these subjects should be instructed to complete the TSQM based on their experience of the 
study drug over the prior 2 to 3  weeks. Subjects who discontinue stu dy drug prematurely or who 
have interrupted study drug will still complete the TSQM basing their experience of the study 
drug if taken during the prior 2 to 3  weeks. If study drug was not taken during this period, the 
responses should be based on their exp erience of their current medication regimen.  
TSQM may be completed within 5 days prior to the study visit. All questionnaires completed on 
the day of the study visit must be completed prior to any other assessments, with CFQ -R 
completed first.  
11.4.6  Other Questi onnaires  
The CF -IQ is a 23 -item measure of patient -reported life impacts of CF across 5 domains: control 
and burden of CF treatment, physical activity, social activity, emotional, and work/school 
limitations.  The CF -IQ measures each concept using a 5 - or 7-point verbal rating scale and 
specifies a 7 -day recall period for retrospective questions. The CF -IQ was developed to 
characterize the patients’ experience of living with CF and to measure the impact of CF and CF 
treatment on patients’ lives. The CF -IQ is  designed to complement existing, more symptom -
focused, CF -specific patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures like the CFQ -R. Translations of 
the CF -IQ will be provided for participating centers with non -English -speaking populations .  
For purposes of validat ing CF -IQ, PGIS and PGIC will be performed per Table  3-2 in order to 
assess a subject’s perceived severity/change of disease. Details regarding CF -IQ validation will 
be provided in a separate document.  
CF-IQ, PGIS, and PGIC may be completed within 5 days prior to the study visit. CF -IQ, PGIS, 
and PGIC must be completed on the same day, and CF -IQ must be performed before PGIS or 
PGIC (as applicable) . All questionnaires completed on the day of the study visit must be 
completed prior to any other asses sments, with CFQ -R completed first.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  11.5 Efficacy  
11.5.1  Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines/European 
Respiratory Society Guidelines10 and according to the additional guidelines that follow.  
Pre-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have  
• withheld their short -acting bronchodilators (e.g.,  albuterol) or anticholinergic 
(e.g.,  ipratropium brom ide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4  hours before the spirometry 
assessment;  
• withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g.,  salmeterol) for more than 12  hours before the 
spirometry assessment; and  
• withheld their once -daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g.,  tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) 
for more than 24  hours before the spirometry assessment.  
During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre - or 
post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessments should be perfo rmed 
pre-bronchodilator. During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed 
before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1 ) at approximately the same time at each visit. In the 
event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed 
according to the following:  
• If a subject’s Day  1 spirometry assessment is pre -bronchodilator, but, on a subsequent visit, 
the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post -bronchodilator spirometry 
assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled.  
• If, on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry 
should be performed post -bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometric measurements 
(according to the schedule of assessments in Table  3-2) should be performed 
post-bronchodilator.  
• Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre - or 
post-bronchodilator.  
Spirometers will be provided to be used for  all study assessments. During study visits, 
spirometry assessments will be conducted per Table  3-1 and Table  3-2 and will be performed on 
more than one spirometer as applicable. All s pirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized 
spirometry service for quality review. The investigator’s assessmen t of the spirometry results 
will be used for the screening assessment and determination of eligibility.  
See Section  10.7.1  for information about acc ess to spirometry results.  
The measured spirometric values listed below will be converted to percent predicted values using 
the standard equations of GLI.9 
• FEV 1 (L) 
• Forced vi tal capacity (FVC) (L)  
• FEV 1/FVC (ratio)  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 46 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (FEF 25%-75%) (L/s)  
11.5.2  Sweat Chloride  
SwCl samples will be collected with an approved collection device. Each collection will occur 
before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1 ). At each time point, 2  samples will be collected, 1  from 
each arm (left and right). Sweat samples will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and  
interpretation of results. Specific instructions for the collection, handling, processing, and 
shipping of SwCl samples to the central laboratory will be provided separately.  
See Section  10.7.1  for information about access to SwCl results.  
11.5.3  Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised  
The CFQ -R provides information about demographics; general quality of life, school, work, or 
daily activities; and symptom di fficulties (pertaining to CF).  
Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ -R in their native language, if validated translations 
are available.15, 16 If there is no validated translation available in the subject’s native language, 
the subject will not complete t he questionnaire. Copies of the CFQ -R used will be provided in 
the Study Reference Manual. Validated translations of the CFQ -R, if available, will be provided 
for participating centers with non -English -speaking populations.17, 18  
The CFQ -R will be completed before any other assessments are performed on the day of the 
study visit.  
Subjects who are either 12 or 13 years of age on the date of informed consent will complete the 
CFQ -R Child version th emselves, and their parents/caregivers will complete the CFQ -R Parent 
version, at all visits, regardless of whether the subject subsequently turns 14  years of age during 
the study. Subjects 14  years of age and older on the date of informed consent will com plete the 
Adolescent/Adult version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits.  
11.5.4  Other  Events Related to Outcome  
11.5.4.1  Antibiotic Therapy for Sinopulmonary Sign/Symptoms  
New or changed antibiotic therapy (intravenous [IV], inhaled, or oral) for the following 
sinopulmonary signs/symptoms will be determined and documented at visits as indicated in 
Table  3-2: 
• Change in sputum  
• New or increased hemoptysis  
• Increased cough  
• Increased dyspnea  
• Malaise, fatigue, or lethargy  
• Temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F)  
• Anorexia or weight loss  
• Sinus pain or tenderness  
• Change in sinus discharge  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 47 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Change in physical examination (PE) of the chest  
• Decrease in pulmonary function by 10%  
• Radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection  
For this study, PEx is defined as a new or change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, o r oral) 
for any 4  or more of the above signs/symptoms.  This definition is based on the definition of a 
PEx used in previous clinical studies, including IVA clinical studies.19, 20  
It is recommended that the study drug not be interrupted during a PEx unless, in the opinion of 
the investigator, it would be in the best interest of  the subject.  
11.5.4.2  Hospitalization for CF  
Subjects will be queried about planned and unplanned hospitalizations lasting ≥24  hours that 
occurred during the study. The dates of hospitalizations and the reasons for hospitalizations will 
be documented.  
For any hosp italization (planned and unplanned), the procedures for safety reporting should also 
be followed.  
11.5.5  Height  and Weight  
Height and weight will be measured with shoes off . Height will be collected at screening for all 
subjects. Following screening,  height will be collected only for subjects ≤21 years of age on the 
date of informed consent.  
11.6 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital 
signs, ECGs, PEs, and pulse oximetry.  
11.6.1  Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with current ICH  E6 GCP 
Guidelines. Section  13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, cri teria, and procedures for 
documenting, grading, and reporting AEs.  
11.6.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory, with the exception of the urine 
pregnancy tests. As described below, urine pregnancy tests  will either be analyzed by the site or 
at home using a home kit. On Day  1, blood samples will be collected before the first dose of 
study drug in the Treatment Period. Specific instructions for the collection, processing, and 
shipment of samples will be p rovided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
Laboratory test results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant will be reported as 
AEs (see Section  13.1).

c Hemoglobin A1c wil l be assessed per Table  3-1 and Table  3-2. 
Pregnancy (β -human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests:  All female subjects, regardless of 
childbearing potential, will complete the pregnancy tests outlined in Table  3-1 and Table  3-2. 
Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. 
Urine pregnancy tests will  either be performed and analyzed at the site or, when there is no clinic 
visit scheduled, at home by using a home kit provided by the site . Results will be reported to the 
site by telephone. The urine pregnancy test on Day -28 must be negative before th e first dose of 
study drug  in the Run -in Period. The urine pregnancy test on Day  1 must be negative before the 
first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Additional pregnancy tests may be required 
according to local regulations and/or requirements.  
FSH: Blood samples for FSH will be measured as needed for any postmenopausal female with at 
least 12  months of continuous spontaneous amenorrhea. Serum FSH levels must be in the 
postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test. Refe r to Section 
11.6.7.1  for details regarding contraception guidelines.  
CFTR  Genotype (Screening Period Only):  CFTR  genotyping will be performed for all subjects. 
If the screening CFTR  genotype result is not received before randomization, a previous CFTR  
genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility (Section 8.1). Subjects who have 
been enrolled and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibility must be 
discontinued from the study (Section  9.9). 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 49 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it wi ll be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator 
becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investig ator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value . 
11.6.3  Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select 
study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs and  symptom -directed vital signs assessments 
can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider . 
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; ca rdiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; 
musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed 
when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs 
will be reported as AE s.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: head, neck, and 
thyroid; EENT; cardiovascular system; respiratory system; skin; and abdomen.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse ra te, and 
respiration rate and will be assessed before dosing (as applicable). The subject will be instructed 
to rest for at least 5  minutes before vital signs are assessed.  
11.6.4  Pulse Oximetry  
Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the ti ssues and has been 
correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry 
will be assessed following at least a 5 -minute rest. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, 
pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing (Section  9.6.1 ). 
11.6.5  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Additional standard 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
• The test should be performed in the supine position and before dosing (as applicable).  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through com pletion of study participation will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF v alue is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 50 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from base line or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. If study sites cannot 
evaluate QTcF they should discuss alternatives with the m edical monitor.  
11.6.6  Ophthalmologic  Examination  
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted only for subjects who are <18  years of age on 
the date of informed consent . The examination does not need to be completed if there is 
documentation of bilateral lens r emoval for the subject.  
All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will 
include:  
• measurement of best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically -dilated examination of the lens with a slit la mp. 
The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an 
examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3  months before the 
date of informed consent.  
In addition to the screening ophthalmologic examination, subjects who are <18  years of age on 
the date of informed consent and who have completed at least 12  weeks of study drug treatment 
will have a single ophthalmologic examination within 4 weeks prior t o completion of study 
participation (Section 9.1.7 ), except for those subjects who have withdrawn consent or assent 
(Table  3-2). This examination should be completed within 4  weeks before the Week  52 Visit, 
unless the subject prematurely discontinues study drug, in which case this examination shou ld 
occur by the Safety Follow -up Visit (or ETT  Visit for subjects who do not complete a Safety 
Follow -up Visit), as described in Section 9.1.5 . 
Any c linically significant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs.  
11.6.7  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects of VX -121, ELX, TEZ, IVA, and D -IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in 
humans are not known. VX -121, ELX, TEZ, IVA, and D -IVA did not show genotoxic potential 
in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured 
mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxicology studies of 
VX-121, ELX, TEZ, and IVA have not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  
11.6.7.1  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below:  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence f or the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinen ce must 
be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). For cases of presumed complete bilateral 
absence of the vas deferens of a male subject, infertility must be documented by the 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 51 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  investigator before the first dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period (e.g., examination of 
a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound).  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consec utive months and a serum FSH level 
within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females  
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo -oophorectomy  
Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do  not have 
a documented bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo -oophorectomy) will be considered to be of 
childbearing potential.  
• Exclusive same sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived , study participation 
requires a com mitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method of effective 
contraception will be used as a couple.  Acceptable methods of contraception must be in 
successful use from signing of consent, approximately 28  days before the first dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IV A in the Run -in Period (unless otherwise noted), and until 90  days following the 
last dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed 
according to local regulations and/or requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception are 
listed in Table  11-3.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Additional notes : 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite sex.  
• Male subjects must not donate sperm during the period starting from the first dose of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  
• Female subjects of childbearing potential should not plan to become pregnant during the 
study or within 90  days after the last dose of study drug. For male subjects with a female 
partner of childbearing potential, the couple should not plan to become pregnant during the 
study or within 90  days aft er the last dose of study drug, with the exception of couples who 
plan to become pregnant by artificial insemination using sperm banked by the male subject 
before the first dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period or sperm from another source . 
• Male subject s whose female partner becomes pregnant through well -documented in vitro 
fertilization (donated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug), or is otherwise already pregnant before the male subject’s first dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
in the Run -in Period , must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this 
scenario, the male subject and his female partner must commit to using a male condom (to 
ensure there is no exposure of the fetus to study drug) from signing consent throu gh 90 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  
• Female subjects should not breast -feed a child from signing consent through 90  days 
following the last dose of study drug.  
• Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed wi th the 
Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee  on an individual basis.  
11.6.7.2  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
If a subject , or the female partner of a male subject, becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 
1) notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site’s know ledge of the 
subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and 2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form to 
Vertex GPS.  
A subject (or their partner, if relevant) who becomes pregnant while on study will be followed 
until the end of the pregnancy, and the inf ant will be followed for 1  year after birth, provided 
informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow -up 
activities. Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Approximately 550  subjects  will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to the VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA 
group or the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Information regarding the powering of the primary and 
selected key secondary efficacy endpoint is presented below.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 53 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Power for Primary Analysis of Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24. 
The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from 
baseline through Week 24 for VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA is inferior by >3  percentage points compared 
to ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
The non -inferiority margin represents a clinically acceptable loss of effectiveness as outlined in 
regulatory guidances. Furthermore, a statistical approach using the Rothmann method 
recommends that the non -inferiority margin preserve at least 50% of the treatment effect of the 
active control (ELX/TEZ/IVA) compared to placebo, where the treatment effect is estimated by 
the lower bound of the 95% CI.21, 22 In the overall population eligible for th is study, the lower 
bound of the 95% CI of the treatment effect is approximately 12 percentage points for ppFEV 1. 
The selected non -inferiority margin of 3 percentage points is consistent with this statistical 
method and the non -inferiority margin for ppFEV 1 used in clinical studies evaluating 
symptomatic CF treatments.23, 24 
The null hypothesis will  be tested at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025.  
Assuming a within -group SD of 8 and 10% drop -out rate at Week 24 and a treatment difference 
of 0 between VX -121/TEZ/D -IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA, a sample size of 275 subjects in each 
group for a total of 550 s ubjects will have more than 95% power to test the primary hypothesis 
for the primary endpoint, based on a 1 -sided, 2 -sample t-test at a significance level of 0.025.  
Power for Analysis of Selected Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
A key secondary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in SwCl  from baseline through 
Week  24. Assuming a within -group SD of 14  mmol/L  and a 10% dropout rate at Week 24, a 
sample size of 275  subjects in each treatment group will have more than 95% power to detect a 
difference bet ween the treatment groups of -5 mmol/L for the absolute change in SwCl  from 
baseline through Week 24, based on a 2 -sided, 2 -sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysi s Set (FAS), Safety Set, 
and Per -protocol Set (PPS).  
The All Subjects Set  will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose 
of study drug. This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition 
summa ry tables, unless otherwise specified.  
The FAS  will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR  allele mutation(s) 
and received at least 1  dose of study drug during the Treatment Period. The FAS will be used to 
summarize subject demographic s and baseline characteristics, and for analyses of all efficacy 
endpoints in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, 
unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set for the Run -in Period  will include all subjects who rece ived at least 1 dose of 
study drug in the Run -in Period. This safety set will be used only for individual subject data 
listings, unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set for the Treatment Period  will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug during the Treatment Period. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses in 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 54 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received, unless 
otherwise sp ecified.   
The PPS will be a subset of FAS after excluding subjects with certain important protocol 
deviations and other situations; details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the 
study.  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descri ptive summary statistics: 
number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most rece nt non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). For SwCl, baseline will be defined as the average of the 
Day -14 and Day 1 values. If either the Day -14 or  the Day 1 value are missing, the other will be 
used as the average.  
Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value – baseline value.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period for the Run -in Period  will be from the first dose date 
of stu dy drug in the Run -in Period to (1) the first dose date of study drug in the Treatment Period 
for subjects who complete the Run -in Period and continue to the Treatment Period, or 
(2) 28 days after the last dose date of study drug in the Run -in Period or to  the completion of 
study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.7 ), whichever occurs first, for subjects who do 
not continue to the Treatment  Period (e.g., subjects who do not meet the conditions to enter the 
Treatment Period).  
The TE Period for the Treatment Period  will include the time from the first dose date of study 
drug in the Treatment Period to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug or to the completion 
of study participation date, whichever occurs first.  
12.3.2  Background Characteristics  
Subject disposition,  demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant 
medications, exposure, compliance, and important protocol deviations will be summarized. 
Details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
All efficacy analyses described  in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise 
specified. Only the principal features of the efficacy analysis will be presented in this section. 
Additional details will be included in the SAP.  
12.3.3.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy  endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week 24  
(estimated by averaging Weeks 16 and 24) . The primary analysis will be conducted with clinic 
spirometry data only and will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measur es 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 55 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  (MMRM) with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, 
and Week 24 as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline p pFEV 1, continuous 
baseline SwCl, age at screening (<18  versus ≥18 years of age), and genotype group (F/F, F/G, 
F/RF, TCR/non -F) as covariates; if there is non -convergence due to small number of subjects in 
either F/G, F/RF, or TCR/non -F, the genotype group  will be considered with two levels: F/F and 
non-F/F. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator 
degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger 
approximation. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject 
errors. If the model estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure 
will be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data will be 
assumed to  be missing at random; therefore, no imputation of missing data will be performed.  
The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference through 
Week 24. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided. The primary  null 
hypothesis will be rejected and non -inferiority demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI is 
≥-3.0. The estimated within group change from baseline and the treatment difference at each 
post-baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the model.  
The primary null hypothesis of non -inferiority described above will be tested based on the FAS.  
If the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than 0, then superiority for the primary endpoint is 
demonstrated and the 2 -sided P value for superiority w ill be calculated.  
Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be described in the SAP.  
Supportive analyses and subgroup analyses (as appropriate) will also be described in the SAP.  
12.3.3.2  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Analysis of Key Secondary Variabl es 
• Absolute change from baseline in SwCl through Week 24 : The analysis of this variable will 
be based on an MMRM similar to the analysis of the primary endpoint above, with absolute 
change from baseline in SwCl at Day 15, Week 4, Week 16, and Week 24 as the dependent 
variable. The primary result obtained from t he model will be the estimated treatment 
difference through Week 24. The LS mean estimate with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a 2 -sided 
P value will be provided. The estimated within group change from baseline and the treatment 
difference at each post -baseline visit , obtained from the model, will also be provided.  
• Proportion of subjects with SwCl <60 mmol/L through Week 24 (pooled with data from 
Study VX20 -121-102): The response corresponding to SwCl <60 mmol/L through Week 24 
based on pooling data from FAS of this s tudy and from Study VX20 -121-102 (which has a 
similar study design and will evaluate CF subjects with other genotypes) will be analyzed. 
Details of this analysis will be described in the SAP.  
• Proportion of subjects with SwCl <30 mmol/L through Week 24 (poo led with data from 
Study VX20 -121-102): The response corresponding to SwCl <30 mmol/L through Week 24 
based on data pooled from the FAS of this study and from Study VX20 -121-102 will be 
analyzed. Details of this analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 56 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Analysis of Other Secondary Variables  
The other secondary variables include: number of PEx through Week 52, absolute change from 
baseline in CFQ -R RD score through Week 24, absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 
through Week  52, absolute change from basel ine in SwCl through Week 52, proportion of 
subjects with SwCl <60 mmol/L through Week 24, and proportion of subjects with SwCl 
<30 mmol/L through Week 24. The analysis details for these variables will be described in the 
SAP.  
12.3.3.3  Multiplicity Adjustment  
A hier archical testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error at an alpha of 
0.05. The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested at an alpha of 0.05 only if the  primary 
analysis of absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Week  24 is statistically significant, 
i.e., null hypothesis of inferiority has been rejected . For a test at any step to be considered 
statistically significant within the testing hierarchy, it must be statistically significant, and all 
previous tests (if any) wit hin the hierarchy must be statistically significant at the 0.05 level 
2-sided (1 -sided 0.025 level for the primary endpoint). Additional details will be provided in the 
SAP.  
12.3.3.4  Analysis of Other Endpoints  
The analysis details of other endpoints will be descri bed in the SAP.  
12.3.4  Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be based on the data from the TE period for the Treatment Period for all 
subjects in the corresponding Safety Set for the Treatment Period, unless otherwise specified.  
The overall safety profile of s tudy drug will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability assessments:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis as 
applicable)  
• Standard 12 -lead ECGs  
• Vital signs  
• Pulse oximetry  
• Ophthalmological examinations  
Only descriptive analysis of safety will be performed and no statistical testing will be performed. 
The safety data during the Run -in Period will only be presented in listings, unless otherwise 
specified. Additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
LFT elevations, creatine kinase  elevations, rash, cataracts, hypoglycemia, and neuropsychiatric 
events will be designated as AEs of special interest.  
12.4 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be pe rformed.  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 57 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  12.5 Data Monitoring Committee Analysis  
The DMC (Section 9.1.9 ) will conduct safety reviews of study data as outlined in the DMC 
Charter.  
12.6 Clinica l Pharmacology Analysis  
12.6.1  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK analysis of VX -121, TEZ, and D -IVA may be performed using nonlinear mixed -effects 
modeling and/or standard noncompartmental analysis, as data allow. Metabolites, including 
M1-TEZ, may be included in t he analyses as supported by data. Descriptive statistics will be 
used to summarize PK parameter values for all analytes.  
A detailed description of the planned PK analysis will be presented in the clinical pharmacology 
analysis plan (CPAP).  
12.6.2  Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
PD assessments to be included in PK/PD analyses may include SwCl, ppFEV 1, as well as other 
endpoints such as CFQ -R RD score.  
A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD  analysis. The Bayesian 
estimates of individual PK parameters from the final population PK model will be used to 
simulate PK profiles for each subject. The simulated VX -121, TEZ, D -IVA, or metabolite 
plasma concentrations will be used in the potential phar macological response models to describe 
changes in each endpoint from baseline. Fixed - and random -effect parameter estimates and the 
associated asymptotic SEs will be estimated.  
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal rel ationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  13.1.2.1 .  
13.1.1.2  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed t o have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the abs ence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 58 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomita nt signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in th e absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 wil l not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4  laboratory value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes  study 
participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7 . 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study  visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the case report 
form (CRF) and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently 
enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if appli cable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Pro gram, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed July 
2021 ). When considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will 
consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those 
in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE described by a term that does not app ear in the CTCAE 
will be determined according to the definitions in Table  13-1.

ADL: activities of daily living; AE: adverse event  
Note: A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
b Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
13.1.1.5  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will  be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-2 Classifications for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism  for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association  between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s c linical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other  than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action tak en 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE

Classificationa Definition  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be u sed in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to Sections 9.7 and 9.8 for directions regarding what drug actions are per mitted per protocol.  
13.1.1.7  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or sy mptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to followup)  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for  any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treat ments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (dea th, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of deat h from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 61 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned 
befor e the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitaliz ations clearly not 
associated with an AE (e.g.,  social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “s evere” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the sam e as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory r eporting obligations.   
13.1.2.2  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to 
Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the 
completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to 
Vertex GPS within 24  hours of identification .  
For SA Es that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through  the 
completion of study participation , the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well 
as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Inve stigators are asked to 
report follow -up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email: globalpatie ntsafety@vrtx.com  (preferred choice)  
Fax: +1 -617-341-6159  
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact telephone: +1 -617-341-6677  
SAEs that occur after the completion of study participation and are considered related to study 
drug(s)  will be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form 
(hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relat ionship to the 
investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study 
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 62 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes 
unlikely related), and severity assessment will not b e required. For the purposes of study 
analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be 
documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is 
required to follow the event to reso lution and report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
13.1.2.3  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IEC, and 
participating investigators in accordance with current ICH E2A Guidelines and/or local 
regulatory requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be 
responsible for the submission of safet y letters to central IECs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local IRB/IEC of all 
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects , if allowed by local 
regulations . 
13.2 Administrative Req uirements  
13.2.1  Product Complaints  
A product complaint is defined as any verbal or written communication addressed to Vertex, or 
designee, of inquiry or dissatisfaction with the identity, strength, quality, or purity of a released 
drug product, IMP, or medical d evice. In addition, suspected counterfeit/falsified product is 
considered a product complaint.   
Product complaints are to be reported to Vertex.  
13.2.2  Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current ICH  E6 GCP Guidelines, which  are 
consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance

obligation to provide Vertex with complete tes t results and all data developed in the study.  
13.7 Publications and Clinical Study Report  
13.7.1  Publication of Study Results  
Vertex is committed to reporting the design and results of all clinical studies in a complete, 
accurate, balanced, transparent, and timely ma nner, consistent with Good Publication Practices 
(GPP3).25  
Publication Planning : Vertex staff along with the lead PIs, the steering committee, and/or the 
publication committee will work together to develop a publication plan.  
Authorship : Authorship of  publications will be determined based on the Recommendations for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria26: 
1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;  
Protocol VX20 -121-103, Version  3.0 Page 66 of 72 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  3. Final approval of the version to be published; and  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related

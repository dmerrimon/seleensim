Criteria  to be used for response evaluation:  
 
The evaluation  of cutaneous  tumor burden  in CTCL is an evolving  process. Skin  tumor and lymph 
node  assess ments will be perfor med prior  to treatment and after eight cycles  of Doxil®  accor ding 
the Severity -Weighted  Assess ment Tool (SWAT) for CTCL  response  that is currently  employed 
in IRB 02-078 and  04-051. Also the  completion  of treat ment, history  and general  physical 
examination,  Karnofsky perfo rmance status,  CBC  with Sézary  cell count  for patients  with Sézary 
syndro me, and CT scans of the  chest,  abdo men and pelvis  for patie nts with TNM stage  IV CTCL 
will be obtained.  These studies  will also be obtained  prior to treatment. If clinical  complete 
remission  of target  skin lesions  is suspected,  skin biopsies  will be repeated  following  completion 
of treat ment.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  is a chronic  lymphoma that is not curable  with syste mic 
treatment. Doxorubicin  is one of many single  agents  with activity  in CTCL  1. Doxorubicin 
HClliposome  injection  (Doxil®)  is licensed  for the treatment of Kaposi’s sarco ma. High 
concentrations  are attained  in skin lesions  of Kapo si’s sarco ma following  intravenous 
administration  of Doxil®.  At 48 and  96 hours post -infusion  of Doxil®  20mg/m2  in 11 patients, 
the concentrations  of Doxil®  in biopsies  of skin  lesions  of Kaposi’s sarcoma were  several-fold 
higher  than in those  in normal skin. Adverse events  led to discontinuation  of Doxil®  in only 5% 
of patients  with Kaposi’s sa rcoma treated  at this dose.  Wollina  et al.2 treated  34 CTCL  patients 
with Doxil;  27 rec eived Doxil at a dose of 20 mg/ m2 every  2-4 weeks, 23 of whom were  treated 
every  4 weeks. The  major response rate  was 88 .2% with  15 patients  achieving  a CR or CRu  (not 
confir med by skin  biopsy) and  15 a PR. Event -free survival  was 12.0 months ± 9.5 months.  Only  
6 patients  experienced  grade  3 or 4 toxicities.  Prince  and colleague s3 reported  on two patients 
with CTCL  who failed  to respond to  Doxil®.  Both were  refractory  to other  previously 
administered  intravenous  chemotherapy.  Although  the Package  Insert  for Doxil®  recom mends a 
dose of 20 mg /me administered  every  3 weeks for Kaposi ’s sarco ma, the safety  and efficacy  of 
this dose a dministered  every  two weeks has been  recently establis hed for breast  cance r4,5. 
 
 
 
Bexarotene  (Targreti n®) is a synthetic  retinoid that selec tively activates retinoid X receptors 
(RXRs). These  retinoid receptors have biolo gic activity distinct  from  that of retinoic acid 
receptors (RARs). Once  activated,  these recept ors function  as transcri ption factors  that regulate 
the expression  of genes  that control cellular  differenti ation and proliferation.  By mechanis ms that 
are not known, activity  has been  found again st CTCL,  and the drug has been  recently 
commercially  released.  The optimal dose was 300  mg/m2/day,  and patients  on the  trials  were 
treated  for up to  97 weeks. At the  optimal dose,  in patie nts with refractory or per sistent early 
stage  CTCL,  the overall  response rate  was 54%  and was 45% for patients  with refractory 
advanced  stage disease  6,7. At this  dose, most side effects  were infrequent  and included  pruritus, 
headache,  peripheral  edema, leukopenia,  hypothyroidism  and rash. Grade  3 or 4 
hypertriglyceride mia and hypercholesterole mia were  seen in 25%-30% of patients.  These 
elevations  are reversi ble with cessation  of the  drug, and  some  patients  were continued  on 
treatment with the addition of antili pemic treatment. 
 
 
 
 
There  are no preclinical  data on potential  synergy of Doxil ® and Targretin ®. Sequential 
treatment with single  agents in patients with CTCL  has been  as effective  as and  less t oxic than 
the use of drug co mbinations  8.

IRB#:  05-098 A(6)  
  
Further  organized  phase  II investigation  of Doxil®  followed  by Targreti n® treatment of CTCL  
seems warranted  in view  of the  following  considerations:  
1.   Treat ment of patients  with CTCL  with both agents  results  in high response rates.  
2.   The  high skin lesion  concentratio ns and efficacy  were  seen in the treatment of Kaposi’s 
sarco ma with Doxil®.  
3.   Severe  adverse  events  were  infrequent  in patients  with Kaposi’s sarco ma or CTCL  
treated  at the doses proposed in  this study.  
4.   Although  Doxil ® alone  results  in a high overall  response rate,  the responses of at  least 
50% of the  patients  are incomplete,  and progress ion-free survival  can be relatively  short.  
5.   Although  cardiotoxicity  is less with  Doxi l® than doxorubicin,  concern  about  eventual 
cardiac  toxicity  might limit the continuous  use of Doxi l® as a maintenance  drug. The 
responses with Doxi l® might be more rapid  than with Targreti n®. The latter  agent  might 
improve  on initial  responses to  Doxi l® and maintain  complete  and partial  remissions  for a 
longer  time than a brief course  of Doxil ® alone. 
 
 
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design  
 
This is a phase II, multi-center,  open-label,  single arm trial. The goals  are to prolong 
progression -free survival  and improve  response  rate in patients  with cutaneous  T-cell 
lymphomas with the sequenti al use of Tar gretin after an optimal course  of Doxil  
 
4.2 Intervention  
 
Patients  will be treated  with intravenous  Doxil® every  two weeks for 8 doses (16 weeks). 
Responses will  be assessed. They  will then receive  Targreti n® orally for at  least 16 weeks. 
Patie nts who achieve  a CR or PR may  contin ue on Targr etin® until relapse. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
Doxil® (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection)  
Doxi l® (doxorubicin  HCl liposo me injection)  is doxorubicin  hydroch loride  (HCl) encapsulated  in 
STEALTH® liposo mes for intravenous  administration. The active  ingredient  of Doxi l® is 
doxorubicin  HCl,  a cytotoxic  anthracycline  antibiotic  isolated  from  Strept omyces peucetius var. 
caesius .  The  mechanism  of action  of doxorubicin  HCl is thought  to be related  to its ability  to 
bind DNA and inhibit  nucleic  acid synthesis.  Cell structure  studies  have demonstrated  rapid  cell 
penetration  and perinuc lear chromatin binding,  rapid  inhibition  of mitotic  activity  and nucleic 
acid synthesis,  and induction  of mutagenesis  and chromosomal  aberrations.  
 
If at anyti me the patient  develops  progress ive disease  he/she  will be taken  off study  and 
referred  for alternative  therapy.

IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  05-098 A(6)  
  
 
If at anyti me the patient  develops  unacceptab le toxicity  he/she will be removed  from  study.  
 
If at anyti me the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the  protocol  as designated  in the section 
on Criteria  for Patient/ Subject  Eligibility  (i.e., a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be 
removed  from  the study.  
 
Doxi l® is doxorubicin  HCl encapsulat ed in long-circulating  STEALTH® liposo mes. Liposo mes 
are microscopic  vesicles  composed  of a phospholi pid bilayer  that are capable  of encapsulating 
active  drugs.  The  STEALTH® liposo mes of Doxil® are formulated  with surface -bound 
methoxypolyethylene  glycol  (MPEG), a  process often  referred  to as pegylation,  to protect 
liposo mes from  detection  by the  mononuclear  phagocyte  system  (MPS) and  to increase  blood 
circulation  time. 
 
Doxi l® (doxorubicin  HCl liposo me injection)  is indicated  for: 
 
 
DOXIL®  (doxorubicin  HCl liposo me injection)  is indicated  for the treatment of patients  with 
ovarian  cancer  whose disease  has progressed or  recurred  after platinu m-based  chemotherapy.  
 
DOXIL® ( doxorubicin  HCl liposo me injection)  is also indicated  for the  treatment of AIDS - 
related  Kaposi’s sarco ma in patients  with disease  that has progressed on prior  combination 
chemotherapy  or in patients  who are  intolera nt to such the rapy. 
 
These  indications  are based  on objective  tumor response  rates.  No results  are available  from 
contr olled trials that demonstr ate a clinical  benefit  resulting  from  this treatment, such as 
improvement in disease -related  symptoms or increased  survival.  
 
Doxil  Study  Drug Supplier/Accountability  
 
Doxil  will be provided  by Ortho Biotech  Products, L.P.  The investi gator agrees  not to supply  the 
study  drug to  any person other  than investigators,  designated  staff and the subjects  participatin g in  
the study.  It is the responsibility of the clinica l investigato r to ensur e that all study drug received a t 
the site will be inventorie d and accounte d for throughout the study. Records  must be kept by the 
institution.  Administration  of the  study  drug must be recorded  in the patient 's permanent  record. 
The study  drug provided  may not be used for any  purpose other  than what  is outlined  in this 
protocol,  including  other  human studies,  animal investigations  or in vitro testing.  Study drug will 
be stored in a limited access or locked area and under refrigera tion. 
 
Doxil  Storage  and Handling  
Refrigerate  unopened  vials of Doxi l® at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  Avoid freezing.  Prolonged 
freezing  may adversely  affect  liposomal drug products;  however,  short -term freezing  (less than  1 
month)  does not  appear  to have a deleterious  effect  on Doxil®.

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  05-098 A(6)  
 
 
Caution  should  be exercised  in the handling  and preparation  of Doxil®. The use of gloves  is 
required.  If Doxi l® comes  into contact with skin or mucosa,  immediately  wash thoroughly  with 
soap and  water.  
 
Doxi l® should  be considered  an irritant  and precautions  should  be taken  to avoid  extravasation. 
With intravenous  administration  of Doxil®, extravasation  may occur  with or without  an 
accompanying  stingi ng or burning  sensation,  even if blood  returns  well on aspirati on of the 
infusion  needle.  If any  signs or sy mptoms of extravasation  have  occurred,  the infusion  should  be 
immediately  terminated  and restarted  in another  vein. Doxi l® must not be given  by the 
intramuscular  or subcutaneous  route.  
 
Doxi l® should  be handled  and disposed  of in a manner  consistent  with other  anticancer  drugs. 
Several  guidelines on this  subje ct exist.  
 
Targretin®  (bexarote ne) 
Targretin®  (bexarotene)  is a member of a subclass of retinoids  that selectively 
activate retinoid  X receptors  (RXRs). These  retinoid  receptors  have biologic  activity 
distinct  from  that of retinoic  acid receptors  (RARs). Each  soft g elatin capsule  for oral 
administration  contains  75 mg of bexarotene.  
The chemical name is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8 -tetrahydro -3,5,5,8,8 -penta methyl -2- 
naphthalenyl)  ethenyl]  benzo ic acid, and the structural  formula is as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bexarotene  is an off-white  to white  powder with a molecular  weight  of 348.48 and  a 
molecular  formula of C24H28O2. It  is insoluble in water  and slightly  soluble in 
vegetable  oils and ethanol,  USP.  
Each  Targretin®  (bexarotene)  capsule also contains  the following  inactive 
ingredients:  polyethylene  glycol  400, NF, polysorbate  20, N F, povidone,  USP, and 
butylated  hydroxyanisole,  NF. The  capsule  shell contains  gelatin,  NF, sorbitol 
special -glycerin  blend,  and titanium  dioxide,  USP.  
 
Bexarotene  selectively  binds and activates  retinoid  X recept or subtypes ( RXRa, 
RXRb, RXRg). RXRs can  form heterodi mers with various  receptor  partners such as 
retinoic  acid receptors (RARs), vita min D rece ptor, thyroid recept or, and peroxiso me 
proliferator  activator  receptors  (PPARs).  Once  activated,  these  receptors  function  
as tra nscription  factors  that regulate  the expression  of genes  that control cellular 
differentiation  and proliferation.  Bexarotene  inhibits  the growth in vitro  of so me 
tumor cell lines of hematopoietic  and squamous cell origin.  It also induces  tumor

regression  in vivo in some animal models.  The exact  mechanism  of action  of 
bexarotene  in the treatment of cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  is unknown.  
 
Targretin®  capsules  were  evaluated  in 152 patients  with advanced  and early  stage 
cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  in two multicenter,  open-label,  historically  contr olled 
clinical  studies  conduct ed in the U.S., Canada,  Europe,  and Australia.  
The advanced  disease  patients  had disease refractory  to at least one prior syste mic 
therapy  (median of two, range  one to six prior  syste mic therapies)  and had been treated  
with a median  of five  (range  1 to 11) prior  syste mic, irradiation,  and/or  topical 
thera pies. Early disease patients were intolerant  to, had disease  that was refractory  
to, or had  reached  a response plateau  of six months  on, at  least two prior  therapies. 
The patients  entered  had been treated  with a median  of 3.5 (range  2 to 12) therapies 
(syste mic, radiation,  and/or  topical).  
 
The two clinical  studies  enrolled  a total of 152 patients,  102 of whom had  disease 
refractory  to at least one prior syste mic therapy,  90 with  advanced  disease  and 12 
with early  disease.  This is the patient  population  for whom  Targretin®  capsules  are 
indicated.  Patients  were  initially  treated  with a starting  dose of 650 mg/m2/day  with a 
subsequent  reduction  of starting  dose to  500 mg/m2/day.  Neither  of these  starting 
doses were  tolerated,  and the starting  dose was then  reduced  to 300 mg/m2/day.  If, 
however,  a patient  on 300 mg/m2/day  of Targretin®  capsules  showed no response 
after eight or more weeks of  therapy,  the dose could  be increased  to 400 mg /m2/day.  
Tumor response was assessed in  both studies  by observation  of up to  five baseline  defined 
index  lesions  using  a Composite  Assess ment of Index  Lesion  Disease  
Severity  (CA). This  endpoint  was based  on a summation  of the  grades, for all  indexes 
lesions,  of erythe ma, scaling,  plaque  elevation,  hypopig mentation  or 
hyperpig mentation,  and area of involve ment. Also considered  in response  
assess ment was the  presence or absence  of cuta neous tumors and extracutaneous 
disease  manifestations.  
 
All tumor responses required  confir mation  over at least two assess ments separated 
by at  least four weeks. A  partial  response was defined  as an  improvement of at 
least 50% in  the index  lesions  without  worsening, or develop ment of new cutaneous 
tumors or non -cutaneous  manifestations.  A co mplete  clinical  response required 
complete  disappeara nce of all  manifesta tions of disease,  but did not require 
confir mation  by biopsy.  
 
At the  initial  dose of 300 mg/m2/day,  1/62 (1.6%) of patients  had a complete  clinical 
tumor response and  19/62  (30%) of patients  had a partial  tumor response. The  rate 
of relapse  (25% increase  in CA or worsening of other  aspects  of disease)  in the 
20 patients  who had  a tumor response was 6/20  (30%) over  a median  duration  of 
observation  of 21 weeks, and  the median  duration  of tumor response had  not been 
reached.  Responses were  seen as early  as 4 weeks and  new responses continued  
to be seen at later visits.

7.0 RECRUI TMENT PLAN 
 
The trial will require  37 patients  to meet study  endpoints.  With  the targeted  annual  accrual  of 10 - 
15 patients,  this study  will require  about 3 years  to complete  accrual.  
 
Potential  research  subjects will be identified by a member of the  patient’s  treatment team, the 
protocol  investigator,  or res earch team  at Memorial Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC - 
Lead  Center),  M. D. Anderson Cancer  Center, New York U niversity  Medical  Center, Hackensack  
University  Medical  Center, and Roswell  Park Cancer  Instit ute. If the investigator is a member  of 
the treatment team, s/he will screen their patient’s  medical  records  for suitable research  study  
participants  and discuss the  study  and their potential  for enrolling  in the research study.  Potential  
subjects  contacted  by the ir treating  physician  will be referred  to the investigator/research  staff of 
the study.  
 
Consent  Process 
 
Participation  is voluntar y. The patient  must be aware  of the  nature  of his/her  disease  and 
willin gly consent  after being informed  of the procedures  to be followed,  the experimental nature 
of the thera py, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects,  risks and  discomforts.  All patients 
will be required  to sign a statement of informed consent  that conforms to IRB guideli nes. 
Informed consent  will be documented  by the  use of  a written  consent  form that has been 
approved  by the institution ’s IRB.  Three  copies of the informed consent  will be signed and dated 
by the  patient  or the patient ’s legally  authorized  represe ntative. One copy  will be given to the 
patie nt, one copy will be filed in the patie nt’s medical  record, and one copy will be retained  in 
the Protocol Participa nt Regist ration  (PPR) O ffice. Written  consent  will be obtai ned by eith er 
the principal  investigators  or participating  investigators.

Dose Modification  Guidelines  
 
 
 
Patie nts should be carefully monito red for toxi city. Adverse events,  such as pal mar-plantar 
erythrodysthesia  (hand -foot syndrome),  hematologic  toxicities,  and stomatitis  may be 
managed  by dose delays  and adjustments.  Following  the first appearance  of Grade  1 
toxicity,  patients  will be prescribed  topical  betamethasone  diproprionate  (Diprolene)  0.05% 
gel to use twice daily on hands and  feet only until signs and  sympto ms resolve.  Following 
the first appearance  of a Grade  2 or higher  adverse  event,  the dosing  should  be adjusted  or 
delayed  as described  in the following  tables.  Once  the dose has been  reduced,  it should  not 
be increased  at a later time.

12.2 History and  physical  examination  including  skin assess ment 
 
12.3 Karnofsky performance  status.  
 
12.4 CBC  with Sézary  cell count  and/or  flow cytometry in patients  with Sézary 
syndro me. 
 
12.5 Asses sment of response status  and any residual toxicity will be perfor med 4 weeks 
after completion  of treatment. 
 
12.6 Biopsy  of residual  lesions  4 weeks after  the completion  of treat ment if clinical 
complete  remission  is suspected.  
 
12.7 Der matologic  evaluation  of response  
 
Dermatologic  responses will  be deter mined by the  Severity -Weighted  Assess ment Tool 
(SWAT), a standar dized approach  to measur ing the extent  and severity  of overall  skin 
disease  in patients with CTCL.  It will be briefly described  and full details are provi ded in 
an appendix.  The purpose of this  description  is to optimize intra-observer  objectivity  and 
to minimize the potential for intra-observer  and inter-observer variability  in the 
measur ement of overall  skin disease.  Only  physicians  who received  training will be 
permitted to conduct  SWAT assessments during  the clinical study.  It is essential  that 
physicians  adhere  as closely  as possible  to the prescribed  procedures  so as to  reduce 
measur ement error and variability. All efficacy  assess ments should  be perfo rmed by the 
same physician  for each  patie nt whenever  possible. Physicians  will be instructed  not to 
examine previous  SWAT assess ments and full body photographs  prior  to conducting  the 
curre nt SWAT assessment.  
 
1.   Total  Body  Surface  Area  (TBSA) Involve ment by Skin  Disease  
 
The body  is divided  into 12 regions  with pre-assigned  %TBSA based  on the  burn 
literature.  The extent of skin disease  in each region  is quantified  by using  the 
patient’s  palm  to measure  the %TB SA involvement  within  region:  
Patient’s  palm  with 4 fingers  (exclud ing the thumb)  is 1% of TBSA 
Patient’s  palm  without  fingers  is 0.5% of TBSA.  
 
The patient’s palm  with 4 fingers  is traced  on a transpare ncy sheet  at the baseline 
visit,  using a permanent  marker  that will not rub o ff or smear. The trans parency  of 
the patient’s  palm  should  be used in  all SWAT assess ments during  the course  of the 
clinical  study.  The transpa rency will be labeled  with the patient’s  study  ID nu mber 
kept in the patient’s  study  file on site.  Using the  baseline  visit transparency  of the 
patie nt’s palm, the investigator  will measure  and record on the  case report  form 
(Example of table  from CRF is  given  below)  the %TBSA for  each lesion  type within 
each of the  12 regions.  
 
2.   Severity  Weighting  Factor  
 
The severity  weighting  factors  will be the following:  
Amended:  9/9/08  20 of 34  
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  05-098 A(6)  
  
1= patch  (flat erythema or eryt hema with mild infiltration) 
2=plaque  (elevated  erythe ma or ery thema with moderate  infiltration)  
 
4= tumor or ulceration  (erythe ma with fissuring, ulceration  or tumor) 
Patch  is defined  as abnor mal skin not eleva ted from  normal skin.  A plaque  is defined 
as abnor mal skin elevated  from  normal skin by < 5 mm. A plaque  elevated  ≥5 mm  is 
a tumor. 
 
3.  Calculating  Skin Scores  
 
The sum of %TBSA by lesion  is derived  by sum ming the %TBSA  from all regions 
affected  by the  lesion.  The sum of %TBSA across lesion  types  (patches,  plaques  and 
tumors) within  each region can not exceed  the %TBSA for the  region. For exa mple, 
the %TBSA for the  head region  is 7%.  T he sum of %TBSA a cross lesion  types  from 
head can only range  from 0-7%.  The  skin score  subtotal  by lesion  type are derived  by 
multipl ying the sum of %TBSA for patches  from all regions by 1, sum  of %TBSA of 
plaques  from all regions  by 2, and  the sum of %TBSA of tumors  or ulcers  from all 
regions  by 4.  The  skin score  total is derived from  summing the skin score  subtotals  
for patches,  plaques  and tumors or ulcers.  The skin score  total is dimensionless  with 
a scale  of 0 to  400.

Responses will  be deter mined by the  criteria  described  in the table  below. Progres sion of 
disease  while  on treat ment should  be confir med by a second  assess ment 1-4 weeks later  so 
that patients  who experience  a temporary  flare of disease  due to skin infection  or other 
intercurrent illnesses  are not removed from the study prematurely.

Assessment of Over all Skin Disease  
 
 
 
Pruritus  Relief  (Appendix  1) 
 
The inten sity of pruritus  will be evaluated  by the patie nt at baseline,  at the week  16 (end of 
treatment with Doxil®)  and week  32 (after  16 weeks of treat ment with Tagretin®)  using  a 1- 
10 point  scale,  where  0 is no pruritus  and 10 is the worst i maginable  pruritus.  A 3-point 
decrease  in pruritus  intensity  confir med by a second assess ment at least 4 weeks later  without 
an increase  in the use of anti -pruritic medications  is considered  clinically  significant in those 
whose pruritus  score  is ≥3 on the  0-10 point  scale  at baseline.  
 
 
 
4. As a  secondary  goal,  index  lesion  severity  will be evaluated  by a modified  Composite 
Assess ment Scale  (Appendix  2). These  are measurements of skin disease  that have been e mployed  
and valid ated in the phase II-III studi es of Targretin®  and in the current  MSKCC trial of 
Targretin®  of Intron -A® (IRB #01 -128) in  CTCL.  Up to  4 index  skin lesions  will be chosen from  
representative  patch,  plaque  and tumor lesions,  and erythroder mic lesions.  For erythroder mic 
patients,  a 10x10 c m. area,  easily  identified  by anato mic landmarks will be chosen and  asses sed 
by the  same scale.  These index  lesions will be photographed  and asses sed at the sa me time as the  
SWAT assess ment. 
 
In the  Phase  II-III studi es of Targretin  capsul es in CTCL,  the Composite  Assess ment (CA) of  
Index  Lesion  Disease  Severity  was based  on a core element of the  summ ation of index  lesion  
Amended:  9/9/08  22 of 34

IRB#:  05-098 A(6)  
  
clinical  signs .  Up to  a maximum of five  (5) cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma lesions  were  designated 
as index  lesions.  If the  patient  had five or fewer  CTCL  lesions,  then all CTCL  lesions  were 
designated  as index  lesions.  If the  patients  had more  than five CTCL  lesions,  then five lesions that  
were  representative  of the  patient’s  overall  cutaneous  disease  were  designated  as index lesions.  
The index  lesions  were  preferably  separ ate and distinct  from other  lesions  in order  to minimize the 
chance  of lesion  confl uence.  Individual index  lesion  clinical  signs and  symptoms were  to have 
been graded  at each visit accor ding to a 0-to-8 point scale  (see Table).  A CA summation  was 
generated  by summing  the grades for each  index  lesion  for each  clinical sign.  
To deter mine the area of each  index  lesion,  the longest  diameter and the longest  diameter 
perpendicular  to this diameter of each  index  lesion were  to have been measured  to the neare st 
millimeter. The area in square  centi meters  was then  converted  to a 0-to-18 scale  in order to 
provide  a means for integrating  the area into the CA summation  of grades  (see Table). The 
summation  of CA grades  at baseli ne was divid ed into the summation  of CA grades  at each 
subsequent  post-baseline  study  visit to deter mine the CA ratio  to provide  an objective  measure  of 
the patient’s  response to  treatment (e.g.,  a CA ratio  <1.0 indicated  improve ment in disease  and a 
ratio >1.0 indicated  a worsening of d isease).  This CA score  was found to  correlate  with the 
Physicians  Global  Assess ment, which is replaced  by SWAT in  this study.  
 
 
 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR RE MOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
If at anyti me the patient  develops  progress ive disease  he/she  will be taken  off study  and 
referred  for alternative  therapy.  
If at anyti me the patient  develops  unacceptab le toxicity  he/she will be removed  from  study.  If 
at anyti me the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the  protocol  as designated  in the section  
on Criteria  for Patient/ Subject  Eligibility  (i.e., a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be 
removed  from  the study.  
 
 
 
14.0 BIOSTAT ISTICS  
 
This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label, single arm trial. The goal of this trial is to improve 
response rate  and prolong  progression -free survival  in patients  with cutaneous  T-cell lymphomas 
with the sequential  use of Targretin®  after an optimal course  of Doxil®.  The primary endpoint  is 
progression -free survival  at 12 months.  Based  on historical  data, the median  progression -free is 
12 months  for treat ment of CTCL  with Doxil®.  With the new treat ment, this trial will be 
considered  as pro mising if the probability  of progression -free at 12 months  is 70%. Thirty  seven 
patients  are needed  in this trial with conventional  type I error  0.05 and  power 0.8. This  trial 
would be  considered  to be promising  for further  study  if 24 or more patients  are progression free 
at one year.  There  is 80% chance  of observing  24 or more progression -free out of 37 patients  if 
the true rate is 70% or better.

16.1 Quality Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated to monitor  patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports will be generated  to assess 
missing  data and incon sistencies.  Accrual  rates and extent  and accuracy  of evaluatio ns 
and follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential 
proble ms will be brought  to the attention of the study  team  for discus sion and action  
 
Rando m-sample  data quality  and protocol  complian ce audits  will be conducted  by the 
study  team, at a minimum of once  a year, more frequently  if indicated.  
 
 
 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center 
were  approved  by the  National  Cancer  Instit ute in Septe mber 2001.  The  plans  address the 
new policies  set forth by the  NCI in the docu ment entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer 
Institute  for Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.ni h.gov/researchers/ds m/index.ht ml.  The DSM Plans  at MSKCC were 
established  and are monitored  by the  Office  of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found on the  MSKCC Intranet  at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index .htm 
 
There  are several  different  mechanis ms by which  clinical trials are monitored  for data,  safety 
and quality.  There  are institutional process es in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol 
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits, therapeutic  response, and  staff education 
on clinical  research  QA) and  departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clini cal trials 
progra ms. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  for Phase I and

II clinical  trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  for Phase III clinical 
trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During the  protoc ol develop ment and review  process, each protocol  will be asses sed for 
it’s level of risk and  degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored, in -house  sponsored, ind ustrial  spons ored, NCI cooperative  group, etc.)  Will 
be addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol

18.0 INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
All Patients  will be required  to sign a statement of informed consent  that has been approved 
by both  the sponsor and  by the  local Institutional  Review  Board.  The principal  investigator  is 
responsible  for verifying  compliance  with all aspects  of both  the protocol  and the infor med 
consent  process, which  must  indic ate that the patient has received  adequate information  to 
make such info rmed consent.  
 
Patie nts willing  to enroll will be required to sign three  copies of the consent form; one will be 
returned to the patient,  one will be filed in the patient’s  chart, and one copy will be filed with 
Protocol  Patient  Registration  (PPR) at  the Office  of Clinical  Research.  
 
18.1 Research Authori zation  
 
Procedures  for obtaining  Research  Authorization:  Before  any protocol -specific 
procedu res are carried out, investigators and/or design ated staff will fully explain  the 
details  of the  protocol,  study  procedures,  and the aspects  of patient  privacy  concerning 
research  specific  information.  In addition  to signing the IRB Informed Consent,  all 
patients  must sign the Research  Authorization  component  of the  infor med consent  form. 
The Research  Authorization  requires a separate  set of signatures  from  the patient.  The 
original signed docu ments will become part of the patient ’s medical  record, and each

PTX® stent for treatment of superficiAL  femoral and/or proximal popliteal arteries  
guidewires.  
Zilver PTX Stent (Control Device)  
The Zilver  PTX Stent is commercially available in all geographic regions 
included in this global trial.  To meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
Zilver PTX stent diameters of 6 and 7 mm will be allowed in this trial.  
Available Zilver PTX stent lengths range b etween 20 mm to 120 mm.  Use of 
two overlapping Zilver PTX stents is allowed according to the device 
Instructions for Use ( IFU). The system is also available in two SDS sizes; 80 
cm and 125 cm.  The sheath compatibility is also 6 French used with 0.035 
inch guidewires.  
Study Design  A global, prospective, multi -center trial evaluating the safety and 
effectiveness  of the ELUVIA  stent versus Zilver PTX stent in the treatment 
of lesions 30 -140 mm long located in the femoropopliteal arteries in subjects 
with sy mptoms classified as Rutherford categories 2 -4.  
The trial consists of a prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs 
Zilver PTX), controlled, single -blind, non -inferiority trial (RCT) , a 
concurrent, non -blinded, non -randomized, single -arm, pharmaco kinetic (PK) 
substudy  and a concurrent, non -blinded, non -randomized, Long Lesion 
substudy . A subject can be enrolled in either the RCT or the PK substudy. A 
subject cannot be enrolled in both of these studies.   
If a subject’s target lesion is longer than t hat allowed in the RCT and PK 
substudy, the subject may be enrolled in the Long Lesion substudy.  
If a subject is enrolled in the Long Lesion substudy at a site conducting the 
PK substudy and the subject is  willing to undergo PK testing, they will also 
follow the blood draw schedule for the PK substudy.  
Planned 
Number of 
Subjects  Approximately 527-535 subjects will be enrolled in the IMPERIAL trial.  
 465 subjects to receive treatment with either an investigational test device 
(ELUVIA, N=310 subjects) or a control device (Zilver PTX, N=155 
subjects) in the RCT  
 12-20 subjects to receive treatment with the investigational test device 
(ELUVIA) in the PK substudy  
 50 subjects to receive treatment with the investigational test device 
(ELUVIA) in the  Long Lesion substudy  
Planned Up to 75 study centers worldwide may enroll subjects in the RCT. Regions

Number of 
Centers / 
Regions  that may participate include, but are not limited to, the United States, Canada, 
European Union, Japan  and New Zealand.  
Appr oximately  10 study centers in the US may enroll subjects in the PK 
substudy.  
Any study center participating in the RCT may opt to also enroll subjects in 
the Long Lesion substudy.  
Primary 
Endpoints  Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint assesses the occurrence of Major Adverse 
Events (MAEs) defined as all causes of death through 1 month, target limb 
major amputation through 12 months and/or target lesion revascularization 
(TLR) through 12 months.  This safety e ndpoint is designed to demonstrate 
that the 12 -month MAE -free rate for the ELUVIA  treatment group is non -
inferior to the control group.  
Primary Effectiveness  Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness  endpoint assesses primary patency at 12 months 
post-procedure. This effectiveness  endpoint is designed to demonstrate that 
the 12 -month primary patency for the ELUVIA treatment group is non -
inferior to the Zilver PTX treatment group.  
Primary vessel paten cy is defined as a binary endpoint and will be 
determined to be a success when the duplex ultrasound (DUS) Peak Systolic 
Velocity Ratio (PSVR) is ≤ 2.4 at the 12 -month follow -up visit in the absence 
of clinically -driven TLR or bypass of the target lesion.  All DUS readings 
will be assessed by an independent core laboratory.  
Additional 
Endpoints   Technical success  
 Procedural success  
 MAE rate at 1 month post -index procedure defined as all causes of death, 
target limb major amputation and/or TLR  
 Primary Patency and Assisted Primary Patency at 6 months, 12 months, 
24 months and 60 months using different PSVRs  
 Clinically -driven TLR and clinically -driven Target Vessel 
Revascularization (TVR) Rate at each time point  
 Adverse Event Rates (unanticipated, major, serious, device/procedure -
related) at each time point  
 Non-serious , non-device/procedure -related Adverse Event Rates at each

Method of 
Assigning 
Patients to 
Treatment  Once the subject has signed the approved study informed consent form (ICF), 
and has met all clinical inclusion and no clinical exclusion criteria, the 
subject will be considered eligible to be enrolled in the RCT or PK substudy.  
If the subject is found to  meet exclusion criteria during the angiographic 
eligibility assessment, the subject will be considered a screen failure and 
should not be randomized or receive an investigational device, nor should the 
subject be followed post -procedure per protocol.  
For the RCT, if the subject is found to meet the inclusion criteria during the 
angiographic phase of the procedure, the subject will be considered eligible 
to be randomized (2:1 allocation treatment versus control). Randomization 
will be stratified by site. A fter the Investigator successfully crosses the target 
lesion with the guidewire, a  randomization custom function within the Rave 
electronic data capture (EDC) database will be used to assign subjects to the 
test or control treatment group. Subjects will be  considered enrolled after 
they have been successfully randomized (i.e. when a treatment assignment is 
received by the study site). 
In the PK substudy  and the Long Lesion substudy , subjects will not be 
randomized; all subjects will be treated with the ELUV IA stent.  In the PK

PTX® stent for treatment of superficiAL  femoral and/or proximal popliteal arteries  
substudy , subjects will be considered enrolled when the ELUVIA stent is 
introduced into the subject’s vasculature.  In the Long Lesion substudy, 
subjects will be considered enrolled when the first ELUVIA stent is 
introduced into the subj ect’s vasculature.  
Blinding/  
Unblinding  IMPERIAL RCT is a single blind trial. Subjects will be blinded to treatment 
assigned and treatment received. All subjects must remain blinded until 
completion of all 12 -month follow -up visits (primary endpoint). Pac kaging of 
the investigational control and test devices are different, therefore the 
Investigator performing the procedure will not be blinded to the assigned 
treatment arm or resulting treatment. Study center personnel will be trained 
not to disclose the t reatment assignment to the subject to minimize the 
potential unblinding of the subject.  
Site personnel conducting clinical follow -up will be blinded to a subject’s 
treatment assignment whenever possible. Duplex Ultrasound Core 
Laboratory personnel , Angiogr aphy Core Laboratory personnel  and the 
Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be blinded to a subject’s treatment 
assignment during the trial. Those involved in data analysis for the Sponsor  
will remain blinded until the primary endpoint analysis.  
Instructions regarding the unblinding of a subject for a medical emergency 
can be found in the Manual of Operations.  
Follow -up 
Schedule  All RCT , PK substudy , and Long Lesion substudy  subjects will be evaluated 
at 1 (30 ±7 days), 6 (182 ±30 days), 12 (365 ±30 days), 24 (730 ±30 days), 36 
(1095 ±30 days), 48 (1460 ±30 days) and 60 (1825 ±30 days) months post -
procedure . 
 Subjects who are randomized but an ELUVIA stent or Zilver PTX stent 
was not successfully implanted will be followed through the 1-month 
follo w-up visit only.  Data for assessment of MAE  will be collected for 
these subjects; other testing is not required.  
 Assessment of the primary safety and effectiveness  endpoints will occur 
at the 12 -month follow -up visit.  
 All follow -up visits will be conducted in the office/clinic with the 
exception of long -term follow -up visits conducted 36 months (3 years) 
and 48 months (4 years) post -procedure which may be conducted either in 
the office/clinic or via telephone contact.

 IMPERIAL: A randomIzed trial coMParing the E LUVIA™ dRug -elutIng stent versus Zilver® 
PTX® stent for treatment of superficiAL  femoral and/or proximal popliteal arteries  
 PK substudy subjects will have baseline venous blood drawn followed by 
blood draws at  10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours  and 
one final blood draw at either 48 hours or 72 hours after placement of the 
ELUVIA stent.  Angiography during the index procedure to assess 
technical success and procedural success.  
 DUS at 6 months, 12 months (1 year), 24 months (2 years), and 60 
months (5 years) visits to assess lesion and vessel patency.  
 X-rays at 12 months (1 year), 24  months (2 years), and 60 months (5 
years) visits to assess stent integrity.  
Study  Duration  The trial will be considered complete (with regard to the primary endpoint) 
after all subjects have completed the 12 month follow -up visit, were 
discontinued prior  to the 12 month follow -up visit, have died, or the last 12 
month follow -up visit window is closed.  
The trial will be considered complete (with regard to all follow -up) after all 
subjects have completed the 60 month (5 year) follow -up visit, were 
discontin ued prior to the 60 month (5 year) follow -up visit, have died, or the 
last 60 month (5 year) follow -up visit window is closed.  
It is estimated that it will take approximately 7 years to complete this trial.  
Required 
Medication 
Therapy  Investigators must p rescribe concomitant anti -coagulant and anti -platelet 
medications consistent with current local clinical practice. Antiplatelet 
medication usage will be collected and reported for compliance for the 
duration of the trial.  
Minimum requirements  include:  
 Anti-coagulation therapy administered during the procedure should be 
consistent with current clinical practice.  
 Clopidogrel or ticlopidine starting at least 24 hours prior to the procedure 
or a peri -procedural loading dose (recommended loading dose of 300  mg 
clopidogrel or 200  mg ticlopidine) is given within 2 hours after the end of 
the procedure.   
 Daily administration of aspirin (recommended dose of at least 75  mg) and 
clopidogrel (75 mg) or ticlopidine (200 mg) for the first 60 days post -
index procedure.    
 Antiplatelet monotherapy is required through the 12 month (1 year) 
follow -up and recommended  through the 60 month ( 5 year ) follow -up 
(trial completion).

Procedure  Contralateral Limb  
 Iliac l esion(s) in the contralateral limb may be treated during the index 
procedure  under the following conditions:  
− Treatment with a commercially available device occurs prior to 
randomization /enrollment  of the target SFA/PPA lesion, and  
− Treatment of the iliac lesion(s) is deemed an angiographic success 
without clinical sequelae (success is mea sured as <30% residual 
stenosis by visual estimation)  
Target Limb  
 Additional non-target iliac lesions in the target limb  may be treated 
during the index procedure  under the following conditions:  
− Treatment with a non-drug-eluting commercially available de vice 
occurs prior to randomization /enrollment  of the target SFA/PPA 
lesion and  
− Treatment of the iliac lesion is deemed an angiographic success 
without clinical sequelae (success is measured as <30% residual 
stenosis by visual estimation)  
 Tandem lesions in the SFA/PPA may be treated during the index 
procedure, provided that the tandem lesions segment is  140 mm and can 
be covered with only one ELUVIA stent or up to two Zilver PTX stents 
according to each device’s Directions for Use /Instructions for Use  
(DFU /IFU ). (Refer to Inclusion criterion 4c.)

 If a second or third stent  is required due to complications (e.g., dissection, 
misplacement or under -sizing of the target lesion), the additional stent (s) 
placed should be a stud y stent of the same  type used to treat the target 
lesion.  
Statistical Methods  for the RCT  
Primary Safety 
Statistical 
Hypothesis  The primary safety hypothesis to be tested is that the 12-month MAE -free 
rate in subjects treated with ELUVIA is non -inferior to subjects treated with 
Zilver PTX by a margin of -10% (negative value) at one -sided significance 
level of 5%.  
Primary Safety 
Statistical Test 
Method  A Farrington -Manning test will be  used to assess the one -sided hypothesis of 
non-inferiority in proportions:  
H0: Pt - Pc   ∆ (inferior)  
H1: Pt - Pc  > ∆ (non -inferior)  
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month MAE -free rates for the ELUVIA (test) and 
Zilver PTX (control) groups, respectively, and  Δ (delta) is the non -inferiority 
margin of -10% . 
Primary 
Effectiveness  
Statistical 
Hypothesis  The primary effectiveness  hypothesis to be tested is that the 12-month 
primary patency in subjects treated with ELUVIA is non -inferior to subjects 
treated with Zilver PTX by a margin of -10% (negative value) at one -sided 
significance level of 5%.

RCT  if the one -sided lower 95% confidence bound on the difference between 
treatment groups (ELUVIA – Zilver PTX) in 12 -month MAE -free is greater 
than -0.1. 
Success Criteria for Primary Effectiveness  Endpoint  
ELUVIA will be concluded to be non -inferior to Zilver PTX for devic e 
effectiveness  if the one -sided lower 95% confidence bound on the difference 
between treatment groups (ELUVIA – Zilver PTX) in 12 -month primary 
patency is greater than -0.1. 
Success Criteria for the RCT  
If the primary safety and the primary effectiveness  endpoints are both met, 
the RCT will be considered a success and both device safety and 
effectiveness  will be claimed globally.  
Sample Size 
Parameters  The primary effectiveness  endpoint drives the overall sample size.  
Primary Effectiveness  Endpoint  
 Power ≥ 80%  
 One-sided significance level (alpha) = 5%  
 Expected ELUVIA 12 -month primary patency = 83%   
 Expected Zilver PTX 12 -month primary patency = 83%  
 Non-inferiority margin (Δ) = -10%*  
 Allocation (ELUVIA vs. Zilver PTX) = 2:1  
 Attrition rate in 12 months = 15%  
 N = 393 (total) evaluable subjects are required at 12 months (262 
ELUVIA, 131 Zilver PTX)  
 N = 465 (total) subjects are required to be randomized at enrollment (310 
ELUVIA, 155 Zilver PTX)  
*The 10% margin only allows at maximum a  3% difference in observed rates. Assuming 12 -
month primary patency of 83.2% (109/131) for Zilver PTX is observed, a minimum 12 -
month primary patency of 80.2% (210/262) for ELUVIA will be required to claim non -
inferiority with margin of -10%.   
Primary Safe ty Endpoint  
 One-sided significance level (alpha) = 5%  
 Expected ELUVIA 12 -month MAE -free rate = 90%   
 Expected Zilver PTX 12 -month MAE -free rate = 90%

 Non-inferiority margin (Δ) = -10%**  
 Overall sample size is driven by the primary effectiveness  endpoint to 
provide at least 92% power to assess the primary safety endpoint  
**The 10% margin only allows at maximum a  4% difference in observed rates. Assuming a 
12-month MAE -free rate of 90.1% (118/131) for Zilver PTX is observed, a minimum 12 -
month MAE -free rate of 85.9% (225/262) for ELUVIA will be required to claim non -
inferiority with margin of -10%.   
Sample Size 
and Statistical 
Method for PK 
Substudy  In order to support the stated objectives for the PK substudy, the sample size 
for this substudy will be 12 -20 subjects.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented to describe the PK substudy results.  
Sample Size 
and Statistical 
Method for 
Long Lesion  
Substudy  The primary effectiveness endpoint assesses the 12 -month primary patency . 
There is a non -statistically dri ven goal (60%) which was developed from the 
historical long stent performance (47.2%; 95% Confidence Interval [30.4%, 
64.5%]) in subjects treated with Innova Bare Metal Stent System and the 
expected enhanced performance (10%) for the ELUVIA Stent System.

Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is the third leading caus e of cardiovascular morbidity after 
myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Current estimates state that there are over 8 million 
US and 200 million global patients with PAD  (1) (2) with an age –adjusted prevalence ranging 
from 12 to 20 percent (3) (4). Less than twenty percent of patients with PAD have typical 
symptoms of intermittent claudica tion such as leg muscle discomfort on exertion that is 
relieved by rest, or critical limb ischemia  (CLI)  (i.e., rest pain, ulceration or gangrene); 
whereas, another third have atypical exertional leg symptoms. Notably, the risk of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is equally high in patients with PAD, regardless of 
the presence of symptoms (5).  Non-revascularized lower extremity PAD is the most common 
cause of lower extremity amputation (6). 
Endovascular Treatment  in SFA /PPA  
In general, the debate for state -of-the-art therapy in SFA disease involves endovascular 
intervention versus bypass surgery. Historically, surgery is generally reserved for resting pain 
and critical limb ischemia.  However, surgical therapy carries signifi cant morbidity, 
including wound infection, MI and even death. In addition, up to 17 percent of the post -
bypass surgery patients do not experience satisfactory clinical improvement (7). Over the past 
decade, percuta neous catheter -based techniques have improved such that acute procedural 
success is high even in complex anatomy. Patency rates have also increased with the use of 
atherectomy devices and drug -eluting stents  (DES) . Often, patients with PAD have 
comorbiditi es that increase the risk of cardiovascular complications with surgical procedures. 
These factors have led to the adoption of an endovascular first strategy with surgical 
management reserved for selected patients (2), (8).  
Patients with very short pain -free walking distance are typically candidates for 
revascularization. According to American College of Cardiologists/ American Heart 
Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, endovas cular treatment of SFA disease is indicated for 
individuals with significant disability due to intermittent claudication (IC) or CLI.  
The femoropopliteal segment is a challenging vascular territory and has been among the least 
effective of all endovascula r procedures in terms of long -term patency (9), (10), (11).  The SFA is 
the longest artery in the human body and is located between two major flexion points, the 
knee and the hip. The relatively small vessel lumen, in conjunction with a high plaque 
burden, slow flow, and a high frequency of primary occlusions, contributes to considerable 
technical difficulties. In recent years,  however, improvements in device technology and the 
skill-sets of the interventionalists  have facilitated the treatment of complex lesions, including 
long-segment chronic occlusions  with or without moderate calcification . In fact, the current 
evolution tow ards treating more complex femoropopliteal lesions as seen in the renewed 
TransAtlantic Inter -Society Consensus (TASC) II recommendations clearly reflects the 
continuous evolutions in femoropopliteal stent design (12). In most cases, the progression of 
atherosclerotic flow -limiting lesions in  the blood vessels of the legs frequently involves the  
infra -popliteal arteries , resulting in a worsening diagnosis of CLI.

 In the past, balloon angioplasty alone was the trea tment of choice for the femoropopliteal 
artery segment. The TASC working group suggested that primary success rates were above 
90% with a very low rate of complications ( < 4%). However, within one year, patency failure 
rates above 70% were observed after b alloon angioplasty in lesions longer than 10 cm (13). 
The application of self -expanding nitinol stent technology seemed to improve the safety and 
durability of stenting in the SFA (9), (14), (15), (16).  The theoretical basis for improved 
performance with the use of nitinol st ents is due to the unique properties of nitinol such as 
flexibility, persistent radial force when oversized to a vessel, and ability for crush recovery in 
these high flexion and torsion force areas in the femoropopliteal arteries. In addition, self -
expandi ng nitinol stents are not as prone to external compression as are balloon -expandable 
stents.  Moreover, due to its smaller arterial diameter and complex nature, the 
femoropopliteal segment does not respond well to rigid stents. As such, the most flexible 
nitinol stent is needed to mitigate stent fracture that often occurs in the femoropopliteal 
arteries.  
Although above the knee use of nitinol bare metal stents (BMS) is safe and feasible, it is 
evidently associated with significant neointimal hyperplasia and  early restenosis (17), (18) which 
may be due to th e chronic external forces on the vessel/stent interface resulting in a chronic 
stimulus for restenosis (19). Therefore, the interest of investigators turned towards the 
pharmaceutical ingredients such as paclitaxe l and everolimus to suppress neointimal growth 
and restenosis after stent deployment. DES  technology was developed to prevent early 
thrombosis and late luminal loss to potentially improve long -term patency rates for SFA (20).  
In a 2014 contemporary systematic review and meta -analysis, authors examined early 
outcomes of PTA, DESs, BMSs, or atherectomy for infrapopliteal atherosclerotic disease (8). 
A total of 42 studies with 52 treatment arms representing 3,660 unique patients were 
included. Technical success rates were hig her with bare metal stents (BMS ; 98.6%) than with 
atherectomy (92.2%; P <.05) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; 91.2%; P 
=.01), and highe r with drug -eluting stents (DES ) than with PTA (P <.001). DES use had 
higher primary patency rates than atherectomy (P <.05), BMS use (P <.001), and PTA (P 
<.01). The 30 -day rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) was significantly higher with 
PTA (8. 1%) than with BMS (2.2%; P <.05) and DES (1.1%; P <.05). Thirty -day rates of 
major unplanned amputation (range, 1.5% -4.4%) and mortality (range, 0.9% -3.3%) were 
comparable among treatment groups. Significant heterogeneity among studies was noted for 
most P TA outcomes. The authors concluded that early failure of percutaneous therapies in 
patients with infrapopl iteal atherosclerotic lesions was both  device - and technique -dependent. 
Specialty devices designed to reduce technical failure rates may therefore be of benefit in t his 
selected group of patients.  
Studies have shown that paclitaxel inhibits neointimal hyperplasia by disrupting normal 
microtubule function, thereby inhibiting smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation, and 
extracellular matrix secretion thus supporting short -term local delivery of paclitaxel for 
inhibiting restenosis in the SFA (21), (22). Zilver PTX is currently the only paclitaxel -eluting 
stent approve d for use in the SFA .

 Drug Eluting Peripheral Stent s: Zilver PTX   
Zilver PTX is a self -expanding nitinol stent with a polymer -free paclitaxel coating for 
treating the above -the-knee femoropopliteal segment.  Results from the Zilver  PTX 
randomized trial showed a positive effect of a paclitaxel -coated nitinol DES in treating 
lesions in femoropopliteal arteries (23). In the RCT, the primary DES group exhibited superior 
clinical safety and effectiveness  when compared to the group randomized to treatment with 
PTA alone.  Primary patency at 12 months post -treatment was determined to be 83.1% in the 
group treated with Zilver PTX vs. 32.8% in the group treated with PTA.  
Dake et al also evaluated the Zilver PTX stent  in a prospective, single -arm, multicenter 
clinical study (15). The study enrolled 787 patients  with symptomatic (Rutherford category 2 - 
6) de novo  or restenotic lesions of the above -the-knee femoropopliteal segment. The primary 
endpoint of the study was the event free survival (EFS), defined as freedom from major 
adverse events (MAE) and freedom from worsening of the Rutherford classification by 2 
classes or to class 5 or 6; secondary endpoint s were stent patency and stent integrity. Nine 
hundred  lesions (24.3% resten otic lesions ) were treat ed with 1,722 Zilver PTX stents ; the 
mean lesion length was 99.6  ± 82.1 mm. There were no procedural stent fractures, and the 6 -
month and 12 -month stent fra cture rates were 1.2% (17/1,438 stents) and 1.5% (22/1,432 
stents), respectively. During 12 months of follow -up, ABI and Rutherford classification were 
significantly improved (p=0.001); the mean ABI improved from 0.6 ±0.3 to 0.9±0.2, and the 
median Rutherf ord classification improved from 3 to 0.  
The combined studies documented high rates of event free survival and primary patency with 
a low incidence of stent fractures and no paclitaxel related adverse events, and supported the 
safety and effectiveness of t he Zilver PTX stent in patients with de novo or restenotic lesions 
of the above -the-knee femoropopliteal segment. The authors concluded that the Zilver PTX 
stent was effective in treating SFA lesions. Two -year outcomes from complimentary Zilver 
PTX studies  continue to support sustained safety and effectiveness in patients with 
femoropopliteal artery disease, including the long -term superiority of the DES to PTA and to 
provisional BMS placement  (24). Five-year outco mes presented at the 2014 VIVA  Congress  
showed a 5 -year primary patency of 66.4%, a 48% reduction in reintervention s and a 41% 
reduction in restenosis compared to standard care  (PTA or stenting data ). 
4.1. Clinical Development Program  
Similar to the Zilver  PTX stent system, an investigational paclitaxel -eluting, self -expanding 
nitinol stent purpose -built by Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) for use in the 
femoropopliteal arteries has been developed.  
The ELUVIA  Stent System leverages many successful BSC p rograms with global 
commercial approval for safe and efficacious use in subjects  and received CE M ark 
Certification  in February 2016 . The ELUVIA stent and stent delivery system (SDS) is 
leveraged from the Innova™  Stent System , the drug coating polymers are  leveraged from the 
PROMUS Element/PROMUS Element Plus  Stent System , while the active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (paclitaxel) is leveraged from the TAXUS Element/ION  Stent System .

  Innova Stent  System  4.1.1.
The Innova (bare metal) Stent System has CE Mark Certific ation for the treatment of 
peripheral vascular lesions . The delivery system is a triaxial design with an outer shaft to 
stabilize the stent delivery system, a middle shaft to protect and constrain the stent, and an 
inner shaft to provide a guidewire lumen.  The delivery system is compatible with 0.035 in 
(0.89 mm) guidewires. The self -expanding stent is made of a nickel titanium alloy (nitinol).  
The SuperNOVA clinical trial is currently investigating the Innova Stent System in the 
superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or proximal popliteal artery (PPA) for worldwide 
regulatory approval.  The SuperNOVA clinical investigation is in the long term follow -up 
phase  and is expected to be complete in 2016 . Analysis of the 12 month primary endpoint 
data, related to bot h safety and effectiveness  of the Innova Self -Expanding Stent System, is 
complete.  
The Innova Stent System demonstrated a good safety profile. Long -term (12 month) safety 
was evaluated using major adverse events (MAEs) defined as all causes of death throu gh 1 
month, target limb major amputation through 12 months and/or target lesion 
revascularization through 12 months. The primary safety endpoint, MAE -free rate at 12 
months, is 85.8%  with a 95% lower confidence bound of 81.1% . The established 
performance g oal (PG) was 59.6%. The composite rate of MAEs, including all causes of 
death through 1 month, target limb major amputation and TLR  through 12 months, was 
14.2% (38/268). MAEs occurred within acceptable and expected ranges and consisted of no 
deaths, 1 tar get limb major amputation (0.4%), and 38 TLRs (14.2%).  
The co -primary effectiveness  analysis (1) assessed vessel primary patency in stented 
segments treated with the core matrix of stents (20 to 150 mm). The 12 month primary 
patency rate in the core stent  matrix is 69.5%  with a 95% lower confidence bound of 63.0% . 
The established PG was 66%.  
The co -primary effectiveness  analysis (2) assessed vessel primary patency in stented 
segments treated with the entire stent matrix (20 to 200 mm). The 12 month primary  patency 
rate in the entire stent matrix is 6 6.4%  with a 95% lower confidence bound of 60.3% . The 
established PG for the entire matrix was 63%.  
Patency rates were influenced by a number of factors including the lesion length, lesion 
location, degree of cal cification, and challenging outflow conditions. Treatment with the 
Innova Stent System provided significant improvement in the symptoms and quality of life of 
the subjects enrolled in the SuperNOVA study. The therapy showed a good safety profile and 
remark able clinical outcomes despite the challenging anatomical characteristics of the 
lesions.  
 PROMUS Element /PROMUS Element Plus  4.1.2.
The ELUVIA  stent system leverages the same drug coating polymers  used in the PROMUS 
(XIENCE V) and PROMUS Element/PROMUS Element Plus coronary stent platforms; the 
primer polymer of poly (n -butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) and active layer matrix polymer poly

 (vinylidene  fluoride -co- hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF -HFP). These polymers have a robust 
profile with long -term safety and effectiveness for use in drug delivery with coronary stents 
as studied in the PLATINUM clinical trial s (25). 
Promus Element received CE Mark certification in October 2009 and PMA approval in 
November 2011 for coronary use.  PMDA approval for work horse (WH) stents was received 
in February 2012 followed by approval for Promus Element Plus stents (2.25 -3.5 mm)  
including long lesion (LL) size in September 2012.  
 TAXUS Element/ION  4.1.3.
BSC’s  TAXUS I, TAXUS II and III trials provided proof of concept that paclitaxel -eluting 
stents reduces clinical, angiographic and IVUS indices of restenosis with a comparable safety 
profile to bare -metal stents. The results of the TAXUS IV, V & VI clinical tri als led to the 
worldwide approval of the TAXUS2 Express Stent System, followed by, the ATLAS trial for 
the TAXUS Liberté and the PERSEUS trial for TAXUS Element/ION stents. This series of 
clinical trial data has demonstrated long -term clinical safety and effectiveness  of paclitaxel -
eluting stent technology.  
In support of these findings, the TAXUS registries (for example, WISDOM, MILESTONE 
II, and OLYMPIA) sponsored by Boston Scientific provide real -world data on paclitaxel -
eluting stents for treatment of c oronary lesions in over 34,000 patients worldwide.  
TAXUS Express obtained CE Certification in January 2003 and US PMA Approval in March 
2004.  TAXUS Liberté was CE Certified in September 2005 and US PMA approved in 
October 2008.  TAXUS Element/ION received  CE certification in Nov 2008 and FDA 
approval in April 2011.  
 MAJESTIC First Human Use Trial  4.1.4.
It was expected that paclitaxel would provide similar long-term safety and effectiveness  
outcomes when evaluated in SFA/PPA atherosclerotic lesions. The MAJESTIC c linical trial 
was the first BSC  clinical study to evaluate a paclitaxel -eluting stent on a nitinol platform for 
use in SFA and/or PPA atherosclerotic lesions from 30 mm to 110 mm in length.   
MAJESTIC is a prospective, single arm, multicenter clinical tria l. A total of 57 patients were 
enrolled at 14 centers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Eligibility for the study 
included chronic lower limb ischemia defined as Rutherford categories 2, 3, or 4, and de 
novo  or restenotic lesions ( ≥70% stenosis) located in the native superficial femoral artery or 
proximal popliteal artery with reference vessel diameter 4 -6 mm and total lesion length ≥ 30 
mm and ≤ 110 mm. The primary effectiveness  endpoint is core laboratory -adjudicated 9 -
month primar y patency (ie, duplex ultrasound PSVR  ≤ 2.5 and absence of TLR  or bypass). 
Safety assessments include major adverse events defined as Clinical Events Committee  
(CEC) -adjudicated all -cause death through 1 month, target limb major amputation through 9 
months , and TLR through 9 months.

 Enrollment was completed in March 2014. Mean age ( ±SD) of the patients was 69.3 ±9.3 
years and 83% were male; 35% had diabetes and 88% had a history of smoking. Rutherford 
category was 2 for 35%, 3 for 61%, and 4 for 4% of enrol led patients. Mean baseline lesion 
length was 70.8 ±28.1  mm and percent stenosis of the target lesions was 86.3% ±16.2%.  As 
recently presented at the 2015 Charing Cross  Congress , the primary effectiveness  endpoint of 
primary patency at nine months was 94.4%,  with a one -sided lower 95% confidence bound of 
86.3% that exceeded the performance goal of 75%. The nine -month composite MAE rate 
was 3.6%. The 3.6% MAE rate consisted of two TLR events through 9 months, with no all -
cause death through 1 month, and no tar get limb major amputation through 9 months.  At 12 
months, primary patency was 96.1% and the MAE rate was 3.8%; both MAEs were TLRs. 
No stent fractures were identified.  
In conclusion, the MAJESTIC study of the ELUVIA Drug -Eluting Stent in the 
femoropoplite al arteries met its primary effectiveness  endpoint with a 9 -month primary 
patency rate of 94.4%, accompanied by a low MAE rate (3.6%). The MAJESTIC results 
showed that patients whose femoropopliteal arteries were treated with the Eluvia stent 
sustained a h igh patency and low MAE rate through 12 months.  
The trial is currently in long term follow up and is expected to be complete in 2017.  
 Summary  4.1.5.
There is a large set of clinical data available for devices from which components have been 
leveraged for the ELUV IA Stent System.  Successful results have been seen to date 
demonstrating safety and effectiveness  for a variety of indications in coronary and peripheral 
artery stenosis.  The first results of the ELUVIA Stent System (MAJESTIC study) 
demonstrate a favorab le effectiveness  and safety profile.  
Overall, the ELUVIA stent based on the Innova stent platform with additional paclitaxel 
coating is expected to reduce restenosis and improve long -term vascular patency and quality 
of life (QOL) compared to balloon angio plasty, balloon expandable stents, and nitinol BMS.  
5. Device Description  
5.1. ELUVIA Drug -Eluting Stent System ( Investigational Device)  
The Innova self -expanding nitinol stent platform has been CE Mark approved and is the stent 
platform used for ELUVIA .  The same drug -eluting product (paclitaxel) has been widely 
used in coronary stents including the TAXUS Express and TAXUS Liberté programs 
(displayed below).  The ELUVIA  stent system will use the same proven polymers as in the 
established PROMUS and PROM US Element coronary stents. The stent delivery system 
(SDS) is the same used for delivery of the Innova SFA/PPA stent.  Table 5-1 provides an

6. Objectives  
The objective of the IMPERIAL Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of the Boston Scientific (BSC) ELUVIA drug e luting stent for 
treating Superficial Femoral (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions up to  140 
mm in length .  
7. Endpoints  
The primary endpoints and additional assessments will be evaluated on an intent -to-treat 
analysis and a per -treatment analysis.  If a subject is randomized/ enrolled but the stent is not

Page 34 of 103 
 implanted, the subject will be followed t hrough the 1 month follow -up visit only.  Data to 
assess 1 month MAE rate will be collected for these subjects; other testing is not required.  
7.1. Primary Endpoints  
Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint assesses the occurrence of Major Adverse Ev ents (MAEs) 
defined as all causes of death through 1 month, target limb major amputation through 12 
months and/or target lesion revascularization (TLR) through 12 months.  This safety 
endpoint is designed to demonstrate that the 12 -month MAE -free rate for the ELUVIA  
treatment group is non -inferior to the Zilver PTX control group.  
Primary Effectiveness  Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness  endpoint assesses primary patency at 12 months post -procedure. 
This effectiveness  endpoint is designed to demonstrate that the 12 -month primary patency for 
the ELUVIA treatment group is non -inferior to the Zilver PTX control group.  
Primary vessel patency is defined as a binary endpoint and will be determined to be a success 
when the duplex ultrasound (DUS) Peak Systolic Veloc ity Ratio (PSVR) is ≤ 2.4 at the 12 -
month follow -up visit, in the absence of clinically -driven TLR or bypass of the target lesion.   
Notes:  
 Vessel patency is defined as freedom from more than 50% stenosis based on DUS PSVR 
comparing data within the treated  segment to the proximal normal arterial segment.  
 A PSVR >  2.4 suggests >50% stenosis (26). 
 The stented segment will be assessed for patency as a single segment regardless of the 
number of tandem lesions within the stented segment.  
 All DUS  will be assessed  by an independent core laboratory.  
 Clinically -driven: A reintervention within 5 mm proximal or distal to the original 
treatment segment for ≥50% angiographic diameter stenosis in the presence of recurrent 
sympt oms ( ≥ 1 change in Rutherford class) or associated with decreased ABI/TBI of 
≥20% or ≥ 0.15 in the treated segment. Tibial brachial index (TBI) a llowed in cases of 
incompressible vessels.   
7.2. Additional Endpoints  
Additional endpoints that will be evaluated, but are not necessarily powered to make 
statistically based conclusions are as follows:  
 Technical success defined as delivery and deployment of the assigned study stent to the 
target lesion  to achieve residual angiographic stenosis no greater than 30%  assessed  
visually

Page 35 of 103 
  Procedural success  defined as technical success with no MAEs noted within 24 hours of 
the index procedure  
 MAE rate at 1 month post -index procedure defined as all causes of death, target limb 
major amputation and/or TLR  
 Primary Patency an d Assisted Primary Patency at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 
60 months using different PSVRs  
 Clinically -driven TLR and Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) Rate at each time 
point  
 Adverse Event Rates (unanticipated, major, serious, device/procedure -related) at each 
time point  
 Non-serious non -device/procedure -related Adverse Event Rates at each time point  
through 12 months  
 Stent Fracture Rate at 12 months, 24 months and 60 months  utilizing VIVA definitions 
(27) 
 Distribution of Rutherford Class ification  during follow -up as compared to baseline at 1 
month, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months  
 Rate of Primary and Secondary Sustained Clinical Improvement as assessed by changes 
in Rutherford Classification fr om baseline at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months 
and 60 months  
 Rate of Hemodynamic Improvement as assessed by changes in Ankle -Brachial Index 
(ABI) from baseline at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months  
 Walking Improvement at 12 months  assessed by change in Six Minute Hall Walk 
(6MHW) from baseline  
 Walking Improvement and Patient Utility Values assessed at 1 month, 6 months, 12 
months, 24 months and 60 months assessed by change in Walking Impairment 
Questionnaire and EQ -5D from baseline  
 Changes in healthcare  utilization over time  
 PK parameters calculated for subjects in the PK substudy  
8. Design  
The IMPERIAL Trial consists of a prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs 
Zilver PTX), controlled, single -blind, non -inferiority trial ( RCT) and a concurrent, non -
blinded, non -randomized, single -arm, pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy.  
A subject can be enrolled in the RCT or the PK substudy. A subject cannot be enrolled in 
both of these studies.

 8.1. Scale and Duration  
Approximately 477 - 485 subje cts will be enrolled in the IMPERIAL trial.  
 465 subjects to receive treatment with either an investigational test device (ELUVIA, 
N=310 subjects) or a control device (Zilver PTX, N=155 subjects) in the RCT  
 12-20 subjects to receive treatment with the investigational test device (ELUVIA) in the 
PK substudy  
The RCT  will be conducted in up to 75 sites worldwide in the United States (US), Europe, 
Japan , New Zealand  and Canada  with a minimum of  465 subjects  planned for randomization . 
All subjects will be screened according to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Subjects meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 
allocation to either ELUVIA or Zilver PTX, r espectively.  
 N = 465 subjects randomized at enrollment (310 ELUVIA, 155 Zilver PTX)  
 Minimum of  393 evaluable subjects required at 12 months (262 ELUVIA, 131 Zilver 
PTX)  
Clinical follow -up will be required at the following time points: pre -discharge, 1 mont h, 6 
months, 12 months, 2 4 months, 36 months, 48 months and 60 months  post index procedure.  
In addition, 12-20 subjects (United States  only)  will be enrolled in the PK substudy and will 
have  baseline venous blood drawn followed by blood draws at 10 minute s, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 6, 12, 24 and either 48 or 72  hours after placement of the ELUVIA study stent  to 
evaluate plasm a paclitaxel levels through a pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study . 
The e nrollment  period is expected to last approximately  12 months. Fifty  percent of 
enrollment is anticipated in the United States.  No investigative site will be allowed to enroll 
more than 20 percent of the total  study  population. The trial will be considered complete 
(with regard to the primary endpoint) after all randomize d/enrolled  subjects have completed 
the 12 month follow -up visit, were discontinued prior to the 12 month follow -up visit, have 
died, or the last 12 month follow -up visit window is closed.  
The study will be considered complete (with regard to all follow -up) after all randomized 
subjects have completed the 60 month (5 year) follow -up visit, were discontinued prior to the 
60 month (5 year) follow -up visit, have died, or the last 60 month (5 year) follow -up visit 
window is closed.  
It is estimated that it will t ake approximately 7 years to complete this study.

 8.2. Treatment Assignment  
Once the subject has signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) /Research Ethics Board (REB) -approved study informed consent form 
(ICF), and has met all clinical inclusion and no clinical exclusion criteria, the subject will be 
considered eligible to be enrolled in the RCT or PK substudy.  
If the subject is found to meet exclusion criteria during  the angiographic eligibility 
assessment, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not be randomized or 
receive an investigational device, nor should the subject be followed post -procedure per 
protocol.  
For the RCT, if the subject is fou nd to meet the eligibility criteria during the angiographic 
phase of the procedure, the subject will be considered eligible to be randomized (2:1 
allocation treatment versus control). Randomization will be stratified by site. After the 
guidewire successful ly crosses the target lesion, a randomization custom function within the 
Rave EDC database  will be used to assign subjects to the test or control treatment group. 
Subjects will be considered enrolled after they have been successfully randomized (i.e. when 
a treatment assignment is received by the study center).  
In the PK substudy, subjects will not be randomized; all subjects will be treated with the 
ELUVIA stent.  Subjects will be considered enrolled when the ELUVIA stent is introduced 
into the subject’s va sculature.  
IMPERIAL RCT is a single blind trial. Subjects will be blinded to treatment assigned and 
treatment received. All subjects must remain blinded until completion of all 12 -month 
follow -up visits (primary endpoint). Packaging of the investigational control and test devices 
are different, therefore the Investigator performing the procedure will not be blinded to the 
assigned treatment arm or resulting treatment. Study center personnel will be trained not to 
disclose the treatment assignment to the sub ject to minimize the potential unblinding of the 
subject.  Site personnel conducting clinical follow -up assessments will be blinded to a 
subject’s treatment assignment whenever possible, except when clinical follow -up visits are 
performed by the implanting Investigator. Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) Core Laboratory  
personnel,  Angiography Core Laboratory personnel and the Clinical Events Committee 
(CEC) will be blinded to a subject’s treatment assignment during the trial.   Those involved in 
data analysis for the Sp onsor  will remain blinded until the primary endpoint analysis .  
Instructions regarding the unblinding of a subject for a medical emergency can be found in 
the Manual of Operations.

 8.3. Multiple Interventions Using Same Access Site During Index Procedure  
 Cont ralateral Limb  8.3.1.
Iliac Lesion  
Using the same access site, iliac lesion(s) in the contralateral limb may be treated during the 
index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a commercially available device occurs prior to 
randomization /enrollm ent of the target SFA/PPA lesion,  
 Treatment of the iliac lesion(s) is deemed an angiographic success without clinical 
sequelae (success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by visual estimation).  
 If the above criteria are not met, the subject may not be r andomized into the RCT or PK 
substudy but may be rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.  
 Target Limb  8.3.2.
Iliac  Lesion  
Using the same access site, additional non -target iliac lesions in the target limb may be 
treated during the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a non -drug-eluting commercially available device occurs prior to 
randomization /enrollment  of the target SFA/PPA lesion, and  
 Treatment of the iliac lesion is deemed an angiographic success without clinical sequelae 
(succ ess is measured as <30% residual stenosis by visual estimation).  
 If the above criteria are not met, the subject may not be randomized into the RCT or PK 
substudy but may be rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.  
Target Lesion  
The target lesion is a lesion selected by the Investigator for treatment with either the 
investigational device or control device. The target lesion must meet all angiographic 
selection criteria.  The target lesion may include two or more tandem lesions, provided that 
the entire segment of tandem lesions is  140 mm and can be covered with only one 
ELUVIA stent or up to  two Zilver PTX stents according to each device’s DFU /IFU .  For 
occlusive lesions requiring the use of a re-entry device, the target lesion length must be ≤ 120 
mm allowing the target lesion and re -entry area to be covered with one ELUVIA stent or up 
to two Zilver PTX stents (Refer to Inclusion criterion 4c  and 4d ). 
NOTE:  If a second or third stent  is required due to complications (e.g., dissection, 
misplacement or under -sizing of the target lesion), the additional stent placed should be a 
study stent of the same type used  to treat the target lesion.

 8.4. Justification for the Study Design  
The IMPERIAL RCT  will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ELUVIA stent for the 
treatment of atherosclerotic lesion(s) in native SFA and/or PPA vessels compared with the 
Zilver PTX stent. The Z ilver PTX stent was chosen as the control device because it is the 
only commercially available self-expanding nitinol  drug-eluting stent approved for treatment 
of SFA and/or PPA lesions. As reported in Table 5-3, the test  and control stent platforms 
have many similarities and deliver the same drug, paclitaxel. Safety and performance has 
been demonstrated for the ZILVER PTX stent which  is CE Marked, has received FDA and 
PMDA approval and is commercially available in the reg ions included in this RCT. The 
study design is consistent with the Draft FDA Guidance for Industry: “Coronary Drug -
Eluting Stents – Nonclinical an d Clinical Studies,” March 2008  as there is no published draft 
guidance for peripheral drug -eluting stents. Si milar to coronary DES studies, a  PK sub -study 
will further evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of the ELUVIA stent for the treatment 
of atherosclerotic lesion(s) up to 140 mm in length in  the SFA/PPA.  
During the trial, dual anti -platelet therapy (DAPT ) is required for at least 60 days  post index 
procedure, with antiplatelet monotherapy required through the 12 month (1 year) follow -up 
and recommended through the 60 month (5 year) follow -up (trial completion ). Ongoing 
dynamic data safety monitoring will be performed throughout the trial to minimize subject 
risk. All enrolled subjects receiving the study stent will be followed for  5 years post index 
procedure.

10. Subject Accountability  
10.1. Point of Enrollment  
Once the subject has signed the IRB/IEC /REB -approved study ICF, and has met all clinical 
inclusion and no clinical exclusion criteria, the subject will be considered eligible to be 
enrolled in the trial. If the subject is found to meet exclusion criteria during the angiographic 
eligibility assessme nt, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not be 
enrolled/randomized or receive an investigational device, nor should the subject be followed 
post-procedure per protocol.  
If the subject is found to meet the eligibility criteria during  the angiographic phase of the 
procedure, the subject will be cons idered eligible to be randomized/ enrolled . After the 
Investigator successfully crosses the target lesion with the guidewire, a randomization 
custom function within the Rave EDC database will  be used to assign RCT subjects to the 
test or control treatment group. Subjects will be considered enrolled in the RCT after they 
have been successfully randomized (i.e. when a treatment assignment is received by the 
study site).  
For s ubjects enrolled in the PK substudy , the point of enrollment occurs  when the ELUVIA 
stent is introduced into the subject’s vasculature . 
10.2. Withdrawal  
All subjects randomized  in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical 
study or lost to f ollow -up) shall be accounted for and documented.  
While trial withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may choose to withdraw from the trial at any 
time, with or without reason and without prejudice to further treatment. Withdrawn subjects 
will not undergo any additional trial follow -up, nor will they be replaced (the justified sample 
size considers an estimated allowance for attrition). The reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded (if given) in all cases of withdrawal. The Investigator may discontinue a subject 
from participation in the trial if the Investigator feels that the subject can no longer fully 
comply with the requirements of the trial or if any of the trial procedures are deemed 
potentially harmful to the subject. Data that have already been collected o n withdrawn 
S2063   Confidential

Page 45 of 103 
 subjects will be retained and used for analysis but no new data will be collected after 
withdrawal.  
10.3. Enrollment Controls  
The IMPERIAL trial will implement a formal Enrollment Communication Plan .  The plan 
will outline the specific activities an d responsibilities of BSC employees and representatives, 
and nature and timing of communications to Investigators during the enrollment period and 
as enrollment draws to a close.  
The objective of the plan is to minimize the risk of enrollment beyond the pr otocol -specified 
overall enrollment cap , including regional and site -specific caps.

A Screening Log will be maintained by each investigational site to document selected 
information about subjects who fail to meet the IMPERIAL trial eligibility criteria, including 
the reason for screen failure.  
11.3. Informed Consent  
Before any study specific tests or procedures are performed, subjects who meet the clinical 
eligibility criteria will be asked to sign the IRB/IEC /REB -approved study ICF. Subjects must 
be given ample time to review the ICF and have question s answered before signing. For 
subjects less than 20  years of age at Japanese site s, the subject and the subject’s legal 
representative must sign the study ICF.  
Study personnel should explain to the subject that even if the subject agrees to participate in  
the trial and signs the ICF, catheterization may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable 
candidate for the trial.  
Refer to section 10.1 for definition of point of enrollment.  
11.4. Pre-Procedure Assessments  – Up to 30 Days  
The following pre -procedure data must be collected within 30 days prior to the index

The followin g pre -procedure data must be collected within 7 days prior to the index 
procedure (unless otherwise specified) for all subjects:  
 Pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential with analysis per local practice 
(serum and/or urine)  
 Antiplatelet medicat ion usage (if applicable)  
11.6. Required Concomitant Medications  
Protocol -required concomitant medications must be reported in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) from the time of the pre -procedure visit through the 60 month (5 year) follow -
up visit. Informat ion pertaining to the use of antiplatelet medications including dose changes, 
medication interruptions, and medication cessation, must be documented. Additional 
concomitant medications may be prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician 
according  to standard of care.  
Minimum antiplatelet medication requirements include:  
Antiplatelet medication usage will be collected and reported for compliance for the duration 
of the trial.  
Minimum requirements include:  
 Anti-coagulation and anti -platelet therapy administered during the procedure should be 
consistent with current clinical practice (28).  
 Clopidogrel or ticlopidine starting at least 24 hours prior to the procedure or a peri -
procedural loading dose (recommen ded loading dose of 300  mg clopidogrel or 200  mg 
ticlopidine) is given within 2 hours after the end of the procedure.   
 Daily administration of aspirin (recommended dose of at least 75  mg) and clopidogrel (75 
mg) or ticlopidine (200 mg) for the first 60 da ys post -index procedure.   
 Antiplatelet monotherapy is required through the 12 month (1 year) follow -up and 
recommended  through the 60 month ( 5 year ) follow -up (trial completion).  
A subject could be exempt of antiplatelet requirements if he/she requires Co umadin or other 
similar anti -coagulant due to known comorbidities and in the opinion of the investigator the 
combination of dual anti -platelet therapy (DAPT) and anticoagulation could pose an 
intolerable bleeding risk.  
Note: The same strategy for selection  of antiplatelet therapy should be used for ELUVIA and 
Zilver PTX subjects (i.e., treatment assignment should not influence antiplatelet agent 
selection or duration of therapy ). Refer to the assigned stent’s DFU /IFU for antiplatelet 
information.

Investigators will manage the cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities for all patients 
according to standard care.  Investigators should ensure close monitoring of the amount of 
contrast for subjects with elevated serum creatinine levels an d consider preventive measures 
(medication and hydration) to reduce the risk of contrast -induced nephropathy (CIN).  
Diagnostic angiography of the lower extremities must be performed using standard 
techniques to confirm angiographic eligibility of the targ et lesion.  Visual angiographic 
assessment may be used to determine if criteria are met . 
Angiographic images must be sent to the Angiographic Core Laboratory for evaluation.  
 Non-Target Limb (Contralateral)  11.7.1.
Using the same access site, non -target iliac lesion (s) in the contralateral limb may be treated 
during the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a commercially available device occurs prior to 
randomization /enrollment  of the target SFA/PPA lesion,  
 Treatment of the iliac lesion(s) i s deemed an angiographic success without clinical 
sequelae (success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by visual estimation).  
 If the above criteria are not met, the subject may not be randomized into the RCT or PK 
substudy but may be rescreened for elig ibility after 30 days.  
 Target Limb (Treatment of Non -Target Lesions)  11.7.2.
Using the same access site, additional non -target  iliac lesions in the target limb may be 
treated during the index procedure under the following conditions:  
 Treatment with a non -drug-eluting commercially available device occurs prior to 
randomization /enrollment  of the target SFA/PPA lesion, and  
 Treatment of the iliac lesion is deemed an angiographic success without clinical sequelae 
(success is measured as <30% residual stenosis by visual estimation).  
 If the above criteria are not met, the subject may not be randomized into the RCT or PK 
substudy but may be rescreened for eligibility after 30 days.  
 Randomization   11.7.3.

Target Lesion.  
 Perform angiography according to the Angiographic C ore Laboratory procedure 
guidelines . 
 Confirm angiographic eligibility criteria of the target lesion or tandem lesion(s).  
 Cross target lesion using guidewire or re -entry device.  
 After t arget lesion is crossed by the guidewire , access the randomization custom 
function in Rave EDC to randomize subject in the RCT  or enroll subject in the PK 
substudy . 
 If randomized to ELUVIA, retrieve an appropriately sized investigational stent to 
adequately cover the target lesion with one stent.  
 If randomized to Zilver PTX, retr ieve one or two appropriately sized control stent(s) 
from commercial inventory.  
 For PK substudy subjects, obtain baseline blood draw prior to ELUVIA stent system 
advancement into the subject’s vasculature.  
Note: If difficulties are encountered when accessi ng the randomization custom function in 
the Rave EDC system that may put the subject at risk, the subject should not be enrolled in 
the trial. The subject should be treated per standard of care but must not receive an 
investigational study stent.  
Note: Byp assing the randomization process and manually assigning treatment type is not 
allowed.  
 Target Lesion  Stent Placement  11.7.4.
Procedural information must be reported (specific data fields are noted in the electronic 
database). Refer to the DFU /IFU for detailed inst ructions about delivery system preparation 
and placement of the ELUVIA stent or the Zilver PTX stent.  
Procedural recommendations:  
 Use of a radiopaque ruler or other standard is recommended to help with calibration.  
 Optimal target lesion/vessel preparation is recommended.  
 Pre-dilation of the target lesion with optimally sized balloon (s) (nominal size of artery)  is 
recommended before stent placement, but is at the discretion of the implanting 
Investigator.  Record the following information on pre -dilation balloon(s) used:  
o Maximum balloon diameter (mm) inflated

Page 51 of 103 o Maximum pressure (atmospheres) inflated  
o Maximum length of time (seconds) inflated  
 After stent placement, the Investigator should ensure that the stent  is in full contact with 
the arterial wall. In order to achieve full contact, post -dilatation may be performed at the 
discretion of the Investigator.   Record the following information on post -dilation 
balloon(s) used:  
o Maximum balloon diameter (mm) inflated  
o Maximum pressure (atmospheres) inflated  
o Maximum length of time (seconds) inflated  
 Peri-stent dissections should be treated conservatively, with low pressure prolonged 
balloon inflation, or with additional study stent implantation per standard practice. 
Haziness, lucency, or filling defects within or adjacent to the stent, and angiographic 
complications such as distal thromboemboli or no reflow,  should also be treated per 
standard practice. All angiograph ic complications that occur should  be documented by 
angiography  and submitted to the Angiographic Core Laboratory for analysis.  
ELUVIA  
The D irections For Use (DFU)  for the ELUVIA Stent System is provided in the Manual of 
Operations. Prior to use of the device, the treating physician must carefully read and b e 
familiar with the entire DFU.  The ELUVIA DFU must be followed for implanting the 
investigational stent. Anticoagulant therapy should be consistent with guideline practices and 
the hospital standard of practice during the procedure.  
Zilver PTX  
As a refere nce, a  sample Instructions for Use (I FU) for the Zilver PTX Stent System is 
provided in the Manual of Operations. Prior to use of the control device, the treating 
physician must carefully read and be familiar with the entire IFU packaged with the 
commercial stent.  Anticoagulant therapy should be consistent with guideline practices and 
the hospital standard of practice during the procedure.  
11.8. Post-procedure Angiogram  
Perform  the post -procedure  angiography according to the Angiographic Core Laboratory 
procedure guidelines.  The final angiogram must be performed and recorded, including distal 
run-off. Angiographic images must be sent to the angiographic core laboratory for 
evaluation.

The end of the index procedure is defined as  the time the guide (catheter  or sheath)  is 
removed (post final angiography). The introducer(s) sheaths should be removed as per 
standard local practice. The following procedures must be completed:  
 Document procedural, target lesion, pre -dilatation, post -dilatation (if applicable), and 
study stent information on the appropriate eCRFs  
 Record antithrombotic medications  
 Complete AE assessment  
 Finalize angiographic procedure film and related required documentation to submit to the 
Core Laboratory per instruct ions set in the Manual of Operations.  
11.10.  Post-procedure/Pre -hospital Discharge  
The subject may be discharged from the hospital when clinically stable at the Investigator’s 
discretion. The following assessments must be completed prior to hospital discharge.  
 Venous blood draws for subjects enrolled in the PK substudy as described in  Section 
11.12 . 
 Medication assessment  
 AE assessment  
It is important that trial site personnel review the trial requirements with the subject to 
maximize compliance with the follow -up schedule and required medication regimen. It is 
also important that trial site personnel instruct subjects to return for follow -up assessments 
according to the trial event schedule in  Table 11-1. Study staff should establish a date for the 
follow -up visit with the subject and if possible, schedu le the visit at the time of hospital 
discharge.  
Note: Randomized subjects will be blinded to treatment assigned and treatment received. All 
subjects must remain blinded until completion of all 12 -month follow -up visits (primary 
endpoint).  
11.11.  Angiography  
All RCT and PK substudy  subjects will undergo angiographic assessment during the index 
procedure per standard of care. Subjects requiring reintervention of the target vessel during 
the 60 month  follow -up period will undergo angiographic assessment at the time o f 
reintervention as standard of care.  
Angiographic data and images collected during the index procedure and during any 
reinterventions of the target vessel during the 60 month  follow -up period must be forwarded 
to the Angiographic Core Laboratory for analy sis. Angiograms performed at outside 
institutions should also be sent to the Core Laboratory. Angiograms will be centrally assessed 
by the Angiographic Core Laboratory, for qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Page 53 of 103 11.12.  Assessment of Whole Blood Paclitaxel  Levels  
The PK profile of the ELUVIA  stent will be analyzed for subjects enrolled in the PK 
substudy. A total of 11 venous blood samples will be attempted and drawn according to the 
schedule shown in Table 11-2. 
SFA stenting is most often performed as an out -patient procedure and sampling time points 
greater than 12 hours post -procedure will require most subjects to return to the research site 
for blood draws b eyond the 12 hours post -stenting.   
To encourage all enrolled PK  subject s to return to the research site for blood draws scheduled 
after release from the out -patient procedure, approximately 50% of subjects will return 48 
hours after placement of the study stent and approximately 50% will return 72 hours after 
placement of the study stent.  
A stipend will be provided to cover lodging or travel expenses incurred by subjects as a result 
of participation in the  PK sub study in accordance with pertinent country la ws and regulations 
and per the study site’s regulations . 
All samples must be forwarded to the PK core laboratory for analysis of whole blood 
paclitaxel  levels . 
Instructions for blood sample collection, storage, and shipment are provided in the PK core 
laboratory Instruction Manual.

effort to collect evaluable data for the primary endpoint . 
11.16.  Follow -up Visits (Japan only)  
Data from the IMPERIAL trial collected through 12 months will be submitted as the primary 
data set for Japanese market approval. Follow -up beyond 12 months will continue as planned 
in this protocol. Once the investigational device is granted regulatory approval in Japan, 
subjects will continue protocol required follow -up as part of a postmarket clinical trial (by 
interpreting the word “trial” in this protocol as “post -market clinical trial”).  
11.17.  Source Docume nts 
It is preferable that original source documents ( see Table 27-2 for definition) are maintained, 
when available. Where copies of the original source document as well as printouts of original 
electronic source documents are retained, it is required that the  copies be signed and dated by 
a member of the investigation center team with a statement that it is a true reproduction of 
the original source document.  
12. Statistical Considerations  
The sample size justifica tion and the powered analyses for the primary endpoints  descr ibed 
in this section are mainly for the RCT. For the PK substudy, t he sample size determination is 
arbitrary  and the analysis is based on  observation . The details of all statistical analyses will 
be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
12.1. Primary Endpoints  
The overall sample size in the RCT is justified by hypothesis parameters and driven by the 
primary effectiveness  endpoint  to preserve adequate statistical testing power for both primary 
effectiveness  and safety endpoints .  
The primary hypotheses are planned for being tested simultaneously at the specified one-
sided significance level of 5% each without adjustment.  
There is no primary endpoint for the PK substudy.

Page 58 of 103  Primary  Effectiveness  Endpoint  12.1.1.
The 12 -month primary patency  is chosen to be assessed for the primary effectiveness  
endpoint in the RCT . The goal is set to demonstrate that the primary patency for the 
ELUVIA treatment group (i.e. Test) is non -inferior to the Zilver PTX treatment group  (i.e. 
Control) through 12 months  post-procedure . For t he definition of primary patency , refer to 
the section 7.1 Primary Endpoints . 
12.1.1.1.  Hypotheses  for RCT  
The primary effectiveness  hypothesis to be tested is that the 12-month primary patency in the 
Test Group  is non -inferior to the Control  Group by a margin of -10% (negative  value) at one -
sided significance level of 5%.  
The null hypothesis (H 0) states that there is no marginal treatment effect of the Test Device 
vs. the Control Device as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H1) which states that there  is 
a marginal treatmen t effect.  The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt - Pc   ∆ (inferior)  
H1: Pt - Pc  > ∆ (non -inferior)  
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month primary patency for the Test Device and Control  Device , 
respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non -inferiority margin of -10%. 
12.1.1.2.  Sample Size for RCT  
The primary effectiveness  endpoint  drives the overall sample size . Approximately 465 
subjects are planned to be enrolled in the RCT. The sample size justification for the RCT  is 
based on the following  assumptions.  
 Expec ted ELUVIA (test) rate = 83.0%  
 Expected Zilver PTX  (control) rate = 83.0%  
 Non-inferiority margin (Δ) = ( -10%)  
 Test significance level ( ) = 0.05 (1 -sided)  
 Power (1) > 0.80  
 Expected rate of attrition = 15%  
The expected 12 -month primary patency for both the Test Group and Control  Group  are 
estimated to be 83%  based on the recent publication . Given a margin of -10% for the 
treatment effect ( Test minus Control ) and a sample size allocation (Test vs. Control) of 2 to 
1, a minimum of total 393 subjects ( 262 i n the Test Group  and 131 in  Control  Group ) will be 
required at 12 months to provide at least 80% power under  a one -sided 5% s ignificance level.  
Using a margin of -10% only allows the Test Group  to be inferior to the Control  group  in 
terms of 12 -month obser ved primary patency by a maximum of  3%. That is, assuming that 
the observed primary patency in the Control  Group  is 83.2% (109/131),  the observed 12 -

Page 59 of 103 month primary patency in the Test Group  will need to be at least  80.2% (210/262) in order to 
claim non-inferiority  in the RCT .  
Considering no more than 15% attrition rate in 12 months, approximately 465 subjects are 
required in a 2:1 randomized  scheme  in the RCT to achieve 393 subjects to be evaluable at 
12 months.  
12.1.1.3.  Statistical Methods  for RCT  
A non-inferiority  test for the difference in 12 -month primary patency  will be used to assess 
the effectiveness  hypothese s. The standard error will be estimated by the solution to the 
maximum likelihood equation (Farrington and Manning, 1990). The p -value and /or 95% 
confidence interval  will be constructed based on statistics under this approach.  
The non -inferiority for device effectiveness  will be claimed if the one-sided lower 95% 
confidence bound on the observed difference between treatment groups (Test minus Control) 
in 12 -month prima ry patency is greater than -0.1. This corresponds to the p -value from the 
one-sided non -inferiority test is less than 0.05.   
 Primary Safety  Endpoints  12.1.2.
The 12 -month MAE -free rate is selected to be assessed for  the primary safety composite 
endpoint. The safety goal is designed to demonstrate that Test Group  is non -inferior to 
Control Group in terms of  MAE -free rate through 12 months  post-procedure . The 
components of MAE refer to the section 7.1 Primary Endpoints . 
12.1.2.1.  Hypotheses  
The primary safety hypothesis to be assessed is tha t the 12 -month MAE -free rate in the Test 
Group  is non -inferior to Control Group by a margin of -10% (negative value) at a one-sided 
significance level of 5%.  
The null hypothesis (H 0) states that there is no marginal treatment effect of the Test Group  
vs. the Control Group as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) states that there is a 
marginal treatment effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt - Pc   ∆ (inferior)  
H1: Pt - Pc  > ∆ (non -inferior)  
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month MAE -free rate for the Test Group and Control  Group , 
respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non -inferiority margin of -10%. 
12.1.2.2.  Sample Size  
The overall sample size determined by the primary effectiveness  endpoint is to provide at 
least 92% statistical power to assess the primary safety endpoint. The statistical power for the 
primary safety endpoint is calculated by the succeeding assumptions.

91064058 Rev/Ver AC  
Page 60 of 103 The expected 12 -month MAE -free rate for both Test and Control Groups are estimated to be 
90% based on the recent publication. Gi ven a margin of -10% for the treatment effect, the 
total 393 evaluable  subjects  at 12 months  will provide at least 92% power for the primary 
safety endpoint at  a one -sided 5% significance level.  
The margin of -10% only allows the Test Group  to be inferior to the Control Group in terms 
of 12 -month observed MAE -free rate  by a maximum of  4%. That is, assuming that  the 12 -
month MAE -free rate in the Control Group is  90.1% (118/131) , the observed12 -month MAE -
free rate  in the Test Group will need to be at least 85.9% (225/262) in order to claim non -
inferiority in the RCT.  
12.1.2.3.  Statistical Methods  
The non -inferiority test described in the primary effectiveness  endpoint will be used  for the 
primary safety endpoint.   
The non -inferiority for the device safety  will be concluded  if the one-sided lower 95% 
confidence bound on the observed difference between treatment groups (Test minus Control)  
in 12 -month MAE -free rate  is greater than -0.1. This corresponds to the p -value from the 
one-sided non -inferiority test is less than 0.05 . 
 Success Criteria  12.1.3.
The following success criteria are defined for the RCT.  
ELUVIA will be concluded to be non -inferior to Zilver PTX for device safety if the one -
sided lower 95% confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups ( ELUVIA – 
Zilver PTX) in 12 -month MAE -free is greater than -0.1. 
ELUVIA will be concluded to be non -inferior to Zilver PTX for device effectiveness  if the 
one-sided lower 95% confidence bound on the difference between treatment groups 
(ELUVIA – Zilver PTX) in 12 -month primary patency is greater than -0.1. 
If the primary safety and the primary effectiveness  endpoints are both met, the RCT will be 
considered a success and both device safety and effectiveness  will be claimed.  
12.2. General Statistical Methods  
 Analysis Sets  12.2.1.
The as -randomized (i.e. intent -to-treat or ITT) population will be the primary analysis set for 
assessing non-inferiority  of the Test Group  to the Control  Group . The per -protocol and/or the 
as-treated population will be assessed for reference . 
For the as -randomized analysis, all subjects who sign the written ICF and are randomized in 
the trial will be included in the analysis population, regardless of whether the subjects receive 
the assigned treatment. For the per -protocol analysis, only rand omized subjects receive the 
assigned treatment will be included in the analysis population. For as -treated analysis, all

IMPERIAL Clinical Trial Protocol  
91064058 Rev/Ver AC  
Page 61 of 103 subjects in the per -protocol population will be included based on the actual Test or Control 
Device that  each subject  received (i.e. in cluding cross -over subj ects). 
 Randomization Scheme  12.2.2.
Randomization to treatment will be stratified by study site. A computer generated list of 
random treatment allocations (i.e., a randomization schedule) will be used to assign subjects 
to treatments in a 2: 1 ratio of Test  Group  to Control  Group . This list will be specific to the 
subject’s site. Random permuted blocks of varying sizes will be employed to ensure 
approximate balance of treatment allocation within each site . 
 Control of Systematic Error/Bias  12.2.3.
Selection of subjects will be made from the Investigators’ general or professional referral 
population. All subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and have signed the 
protocol -specific ICF will be eligible for enroll ment  in the trial. Consecutively eligible 
subjects should be enrolled into the trial to minimize selection bias. Study subjects will be 
randomly assigned to a treatment group within the investigational site. In determining subject 
eligibility for the study, the investigator’s assessment o f imaging will be used. However, the 
Angiographic Core Laboratory will indep endently analyze the angiograms and the data 
obtained from the core laboratory will be used for analyses. An independent CEC composed 
of medical experts will adjudicate safety asse ssments, as defined in the CEC Charter.  
 Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  12.2.4.
Study sites will not be a llowed to randomize more than 10% (N=46) of the total number of 
randomized subjects without prior approval from the sponsor.  No study site will b e allowed 
to enroll more than 20% (N=93) of the tota l number of randomized subjects .   
12.3. Baseline Data Analyses  
Baseline covariates  will be summarized for the  RCT and the PK substudy . Subject  baseline  
demographics  and clinical characteristics , site-reported and core lab reported lesion 
characteristics, procedure assessment, device information, and medication compliance will be 
summarized us ing descriptive statistics . The analysis unit may be (but will not be limited to) 
by subject, lesion, procedure, or devic e.  
The selected baseline covariates  may be compared for ‘like -to-like’ in the Test Group verses  
the Control Group with appropriate statistical tests for discrete and continuous variables . 
 Additional  Assessments /Measurements  12.3.1.
Additional assessments may ref er to (but not limit to) technical/procedural success, 
safety/ effectiveness  endpoints, stent fracture, any type of AE rates, distribution of Rutherford

No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for additional assessments. Statistical 
comparisons may be performed for exploratory purposes. No formal inferences are planned 
on the additional assessments and therefore alpha -adjustments for multiple comparisons w ill 
not be used.  
  Pharmacokinetics Parameters  12.3.2.
Values for the following paclitaxel PK parameters will be calculated by a standard non -
compartment analysis for subjects in the PK substudy.  
 Maximum observed blood concentration (C max) 
 First time of occurrence of C max (tmax) will be the actual observed values  
 Terminal phase rate constant (λz) will be estimated from log -linear regression analysis of 
the terminal phase of the blood concentration -time profile  
 Associated apparent terminal ph ase half -life (t ½) will be calculated as t ½ = ln(2/λz)  
 Area under the blood concentration versus time curve from time zero to 1 hour (AUC 0-1), 
time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24), time zero to the time of the last quantifiable 
concentration (AUC 0-t) and extrap olated to infinite time (AUC 0-∞) will be calculated by a 
combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods  
 Percentage of AUC 0-∞ obtained by extrapolation (%AUC ex) will be calculated as [(AUC0 
∞ – AUC 0-t)/AUC 0-∞] × 100  
 Total blood clearance (CL)  
For AUC calculation, the linear method will be employed for all incremental trapezoids 
arising from increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal method will be used 
for those arising from decreasing concentrations.  
Descriptive statistics (mean, s tandard deviation, sample size, 95% confidence interval) will 
be used to summarize these parameters for subjects in the PK substudy. No formal statistical 
testing will be done for these parameters.  
 Interim Analyses  12.3.3.
No formal interim analyses are planned f or the purpose of stopping this study early for 
declaring effectiveness or for futility . 
 Subgroup Analyses  12.3.4.
Primary endpoints and/or additional assessments will be sum marized and treatment groups 
may be compared in each subgroup identified by the following categories (but not limit to) : 
 Region

 Gender (male vs. female)  
 Age (≥  65 and <  65) 
 Diabetic status (medically -treated vs. non -diabetic)  
 Lesion characteristics (vessel diameter/lesion length)  
 Stent matrix (stent diameter/length)  
 Other significant predi ctors identified by regression models  
No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for subgroups and therefore alpha -adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will not be used . 
 Justification of Pooling  12.3.5.
The poolability analysis regarding the primary safety endpoint across sites will be assessed. 
Due to the 2:1 randomization scheme using random permuted blocks employed within each 
site, there will  be at least 2  subjects from the Test Group  and one subject from the Control  
Group . Therefore the poolability  method is described as below.  
The sites with enrollment of 6 subjects or more are reported individually.  
The sites with enrollment of 5 or less subjects are pooled into super -sites according to their 
geographical closeness so that the combined super -sites would have 6 or more enrolled 
subjects. If a super -site has 6 or more subjects and at least 2 subjects in each treatment group, 
the pooling of this super -site should stop and the pooling of the next super -site should start.  
If the p-value of poolability t est in the logistic regression model  for the primary safety 
endpoint  is > 0.15, the treatment effect will be presented for overall across all sites. If the p -
value is  0.15, the treatment effect will be presented by each site or super -site in addition to 
the overall across all sites . 
 Sensitivity Analysis for Missing Data  12.3.6.
Sensitivity analyses for the primary safety and effectiveness  endpoint s assessment will be 
conducted to assess the impact of missing data on the result’s robustness. In addition to the 
use of the worst -case analysis , the tipping point analysis will  be performed for the ITT 
analysis  set to consider  all combinations of present/absent  for all subjects with missing 
primary outcome in the Test Group and the Control  Group .  
 Multivariable Analyses  12.3.7.
Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to assess the effect of potential 
predictors for the prima ry safety/ effectiveness  endpoint in a logistic  regression model.  
Clinically meaningful baseline c ovariates will be selected in the regression model .

All statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), 
version 9.2 or later (Copyright © 2002 -2010 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina 
27513, USA. All rights reserved).  
 Changes to Planned Analyses  12.3.9.
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the primary 
analyses (i.e. unblinding) will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan 
approved prior to performing the analyses. Changes from the planned statisti cal methods 
after performing the analyses will be documented in the clinical study report along with a 
reason for the deviation . 
13. Data Management  
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic dat a capture (EDC) 
system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by Medidata. All changes 
made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review 
by Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) or its  representative. The associated RAVE software 
and database have been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a 
validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical 
studies pertaining to the use  of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are 
performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on pri ntouts 
of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data 
previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator 
acknowledging and approving the changes.  
Visual and/or electronic data rev iew will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will 
be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all 
queries in the databa se. 
13.2. Data Retention  
The Investigator or Investigational site will maintain, at the investigative site, in original 
format all essential study documents and source documentation that support the data 
collected on the study subjects in compliance with ICH/GCP  guidelines.  Documents must be 
retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or until at least 2

91064058 Rev/Ver AC  
Page 65 of 103 years (at least 3 years in Japan) have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical 
investigation of the produc t. These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by 
agreement with BSC or in compliance with other local regulations. It is BSC’s responsibility 
to inform the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be maintained. The 
Investigato r will take measures to ensure that these essential documents are not accidentally 
damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the Investigator withdraws responsibility for 
maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who  will 
assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change.  
In Japan, BSC must maintain necessary essential documents for 5 years from the date of the 
marketing application approval (or during the period of user-results  evaluation , if applicable 
and if longer than 5 years) or until 3 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
the clinical investigation of the device, whichever is longer.  
If study follow -up is continued beyond 5 years in Japan as part of a postmarket clinical trial 
after receiving marketing approval, the Investigator and Site must retain essential documents 
during the period of user -results evaluation , and BSC must retain essential documents in 
accordance with Good Postmarketing  Surveillance Practice and Test of Medical Devices 
(Ministrial Ordinance 38, 23 March, 2005).  
13.3. Core Laboratories  
Core laboratories will be established for the central assessment of key data collected during 
the IMPERIAL  trial.  Detailed guidelines for the c ollection, analysis, and interpretation of the 
following data will be provided in the Manual of Operations.  The following core 
laboratories have been assigned for this trial:  
 Angiographic: to assess angiograms taken during the index procedure and during a ny 
subsequent revascularization procedure . 
 Ultrasound: to assess duplex ultrasounds taken during the follow -up period (6 -month, 12 -
month, 24 -month, and 60 -month visits) for primary patency . 
 X-Ray: to assess x -rays taken during the follow -up period (12 -mont h, 24 -month and 60 
month visits) for stent integrity . (Note: Additional X -rays will be collected at Japanese 
sites in the event of a TLR /TVR  and in those cases when, in the opinion of the 
investigator, an X -ray should be performed ). 
 Pharmacokinetics : to as sess whole blood baseline paclitaxel  levels and at defined time 
points through 48/72 hours post -index procedure . 
14. Amendments  
If a protocol revision is necessary which affects the rights, safety or welfare of the subject or 
scientific integrity of the data,  an amendment is required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., 
IRB/ IEC/REB/ FDA/CA) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation.

Page 71 of 103 18. Monitoring  
Monitoring will be performed during the study , according to the study Monitoring Plan,  to 
assess continued compliance wit h the current, approved protocol /amendments  and applicable 
regulations. In addition, the monitor verifies that study records are adequately maintained, 
that data are reported in a satisfactory manner with respect to timeliness, adequacy, and 
accuracy, and that the Investigator continues to have sufficient staff and facilities to conduct 
the study safely and effectively. Pre-defined thresholds for protocol deviation and 
compliance once met or exceeded, can also trigger increased monitoring frequency and/or t he 
implementation of corrective action plans at clinical sites. For the IMPERIAL trial, source 
documents include, at a minimum but are not limited to, the ICF; patient medical records, 
including nursing records and catheterization laboratory records; diagn ostic imaging records; 
laboratory results; reports of SAEs; and device accountability logs. Data documented in the 
eCRF relevant to device deficiencies, relationship of AE to study device(s), index procedure, 
antiplatelet medication; and the anticipated  assessment of ADEs, may be considered source 
data for the study.  
The Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original source documents by BSC 
personnel, their designees, and appropriate regulatory authorities.  In the event that the 
original m edical records cannot be obtained for a subject that is seen by a non -study 
physician at a non -study institution, all reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
photocopies of the original source documents for review. Photocopies of original source 
documen ts related to MAEs that are adjudicated by the CEC  (from either the study site or a 
non-study institution, if applicable) must also be made available for submission to the BSC 
Safety  Group . 
The study may also be subject to a quality assurance audit by BSC or its designees, as well as 
inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the Investigator and 
relevant study personnel are available during on -site monitoring visits or audits and that 
sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
19. Potential Risks and Benefits  
19.1. Anticipated Adverse Events and Risks Associated with Use of the ELUVIA Stent 
System and Implantation of the ELUVIA Stent  
The risks associated with the implantation of a stent in the SFA/PPA  may include , but are not 
limited to th e following : 
 Allergic reaction (to drug/polymer, contrast, device or other)  
 Bleeding/Hemorrhage  
 Death  
 Embolization (air, plaque, thrombus, device, tissue or other)  
 Extremity ischemia/amputation

Page 72 of 103  Hematoma  
 Need for urgent intervention or surgery  
 Pseudoaneury sm formation  
 Renal insufficiency or failure  
 Restenosis of stented artery  
 Sepsis/infection  
 Thrombosis / thrombus  
 Tissue ischemia  / necrosis  
 Transient hemodynamic instability (hypotensive/hypertensive episodes)  
 Vasospasm  
 Vessel injury, including perforation,  trauma, rupture and dissection  
 Vessel occlusion  
19.2. Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  Unique to Paclitaxel  
Certain side effects and discomforts have been reported in subjects that have received 
paclitaxel in intravenous forms as part of chemotherapy t reatment.  These subjects may have 
other comorbid conditions and/or have received concomitant medications that may also 
contribute to the reported side effects.  Under these circumstances the dose is delivered 
throughout the body by the blood and in doses hundreds of times higher than the total amount 
on the coated stent for use in the proposed clinical trial. Potential adverse events that may be 
unique to the paclitaxel drug coating are:  
 Allergic/immunologic reactions to drug (paclitaxel or structurally -related compounds) 
or the polymer stent coating (or its individual components)  
 Alopecia  
 Anemia  
 Gastrointestinal symptoms  
 Hematologic dyscrasia (including leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia)  
 Hepatic enzyme changes  
 Histologic changes in the vessel w all, including inflammation, cellular damage or 
necrosis  
 Myalgia/arthralgia  
 Peripheral neuropathy  
It is unlikely with the total dosages and the way paclitaxel is coated onto the stent and 
delivered in the vessel that the side effects associated with intravenous, high dose 
chemotherapy would occur. There may be other potential adverse events that are unforeseen 
at this time.

Page 73 of 103 19.3. Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
There may be additional risks linked to the procedure, and follow -up te sting which are 
unforeseen at this time. All testing planned for the follow -up period is standard of care  with 
the exception of the x -ray requirements during follow -up. These additional requirements 
should not create additional risk to the subject over tre atment with an already approved stent 
system.  
In addition, risks associated with venipuncture and the additional blood draws required in the 
PK substudy  include, but are not limited to:  
 Ecchymosis  
 Hematoma  
 Infection/inflammation  
 Pain 
19.4. Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments  
In addition to the aforementioned risks associated with the implantation of stents and the use 
of paclitaxel, the use of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy after stent implantation may 
increase the risk of bleeding. Refer to the local package insert for further information on drug 
interactions and side effects associated with paclitaxel  or antithrombotic/antiplatelet 
medications.  
19.5. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through complia nce with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject 
selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and by promptly supplying BSC with all pertinent information 
required by this protocol.  
19.6. Anticipated Benefits  
Potential anticipated benefits include the effective treatment of atherosclerotic SFA/PPA 
lesions with improvement in the symptoms of disease. However, the ELUVIA stent is an 
investigational device and these potential benefits may or may not actually be present.  
19.7. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The ELUVIA stent is expected to be suitable for its intended purpose. There are no 
unacceptable residual risks/intolerable risks and all applica ble risks have been addressed 
through the provision of appropriate Directions for Use (DFU). Evaluation of the risks and 
benefits that are expected to be associated with the use of the ELUVIA stent demonstrate that

stent should outweigh the risks.  
20. Safety Reporting  
20.1. Reportable Events by investigational site to Boston Scientific  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to BSC any event which occ urs 
in any of following categories:  
 All Adverse Events (until 12 month follow -up) 
 All Device Related Adverse Events/Device Related Serious Adverse Events  
 All Serious Adverse Events  
 All Device Deficiencies  
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated  Serious Adverse Device Effects  
 New findings/updates in relation to already reported events  
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms.  
If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the a bove categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or 
device deficiency.  
Any AE experienced by the study subject after randomization/enrollment, whether during or 
subsequent to t he procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigational trial. For centers in Austria cancer must 
always be reported as a Serious Adverse Event.  
Death should not be recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of a 
specific SAE (see Table 20-1 for AE definitions) .  
Refer to Section 19 for the known risks associated with the study device(s).  
Device deficiencies and other device issues should not be reported a s AEs. Instead, they 
should be reported on the appropriate eCRF per the study CRF Completion Guidelines. If an 
AE results from a device deficiency or other device issue, the AE should be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
In-patient hospitalization is defin ed as the subject being admitted to the hospital (≥ 24 hours), 
with the following exceptions.  
 A hospitalization for routine follow -up per standard of care.

 If complications or AEs occur during an elective/planned (i.e., planned prior to 
enrollment) hospitalization after enrollment, the complications and AEs must be reported 
as AEs or SAEs if they meet the protocol -specified definitions. However, the original 
elective/planned hospitalization(s) itself should not be reported as an SAE.

AE 
Classification  Description  
Not Related  Relationship to the device or procedure can be excluded when:  
- the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedure;  
- the event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device  (if the response 
pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase  of 
the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the event;  
- the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by the device or 
procedure; the event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent 
illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by the device used for diagnosis, when 
applicable; harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error;  
- In orde r to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at 
the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the event.  
Unlikely 
Related  The relationship with the use of the device or procedure seems not relevant and /or the event 
can be reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained.  
Possibly Related  The relationship with the use of the device or procedure is weak but cannot be ruled out 
completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent 
illness/clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were 
relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be 
classified as possible related.  
Prob ably 
Related  The relationship with the use of the device or procedure seems relevant and/or the event 
cannot reasonably be explained by another cause, but additional information may be 
obtained.  
Causal 
Relationship  The event is associated with the device or with procedure beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar 
devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with device use/application or procedure;  
- the e vent involves a body -site or organ that  
o the device or procedure are applied to;  
o the device or procedure have an effect on;  
- the event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern 
is previously known);  
- the discontin uation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible);  
- other possible causes (e.g. an underl ying or concurrent illness/clinical condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;  
- harm to the subject is due to error in use;

20.6. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / IECs / REBs / Investigators  
BSC will notify all participating study centers if  SAEs/SADEs occur which imply a possible 
increase in the anticipated risk of the procedure or use of the device or if the occurrence of 
certain SAEs/SADEs demands changes to the protocol or the conduct of the study in order to 
further minimize the unantici pated risks.  
BSC is responsible for reporting AE and device deficiencies information to all participating 
investigators, IRBs/IECs /REBs , and regulatory authorities as applicable according to local 
reporting requirements.  
BSC, Investigator, or Site must not ify the IRB/IEC /REB  of any UADEs, USADEs, SADEs, 
SAEs, device deficiencies, and other CEC events as applicable according to local reporting 
requirements (refer to Section 22.3 for information pertaining to the CEC and CEC Events). 
A copy of the Investigator’s reports and other relevant reports (if applicable) to the 
IRB/IEC /REB  must be provided to BSC in accordance with local requirements.  
Safety rep orting on the control device, which is approved in all regions at the time of the trial 
initiation, will be handled separately according to local regulations.  
21. Informed Consent

applicable.  
Boston Scientific will provide a study -specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the 
investigative center’s IRB/ IEC/REB . Any modification requires approval from BSC  prior to 
use of the form. The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, 
BSC will assist the center in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms 
must also have IRB/ IEC/REB  approval prior to their use. Privacy language shall be included 
in the body of the form or as a separate form as applicable.  
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall  at a minimum include the following steps, 
as well as any other steps requir ed by applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines : 
 be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee aut horized to conduct the process,  
 include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to pa rticipate throughout the clinical study,  
 avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate,  
 not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
 use native language that is non -technical and understandable to the subject or his/her 
legal representative,  
 provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
 ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the 
clinical study.  
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative  
competent to sign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by 
the investigator and/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed 
consent process. If  a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed 
consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original 
signed ICF will be retained by the center and a copy of the signed and dated documen t and 
any other written information must be given to the person signing the form. In Japan, 
Informed Consent signature can be replaced by printed  name and seals of appropriate  
individuals.  
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the ap plicable regulatory body 
according to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning 
of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as 
deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory author ities (e.g. IRB/ IEC/REB ), as appropriate.

the trial and signs the ICF, catheterization may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable 
candidate for the trial. A Screening Log will be maintained by the investigational site to 
document select information about candidates who fail to meet the trial eligibility criteria, 
including, but not limited to, the reason for screen failure.  
22. Committees  
22.1. Executive Committee  
An Executive Committee composed of BSC  Clinical Management and selected  Coordinating 
Principal Investigator (s) will be convened. This committee will be responsible for  the overall 
conduct of the study which will include protocol development, study progress, subject safety, 
overall data quality and integrity, and timely dissemination of study results through 
appropriate scientific sessions and publications. As appropriat e the Executive Committee 
may request participation of IMPERIAL Investigators on the committee.  
22.2. Safety Monitoring Process  
To promote early detection of safety issues, the independent Clinical Events Committee  
(CEC)  and Independent Data Review  (IDR)  will pr ovide evaluations of safety events. 
Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event 
is reported. This is expedited through BSC’s  Safety Group , which is responsible for 
coordinating the collection of information for the subject dossier from Medidata Rave EDC 
database that is entered by the centers and core laboratories. During regularly scheduled 
monitoring visits, clinical research monitors will support the dynamic reporting process 
through their review of source  document information.  
22.3. Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  
The CEC is an independent group of individuals with no affiliation with BSC. Committee 
membership will include practitioners of peripheral endovascular procedures, as well as other 
experts with the nec essary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to review and adjudicate 
the following endpoints and major adverse events reported by the trial Investigators:  
 All Deaths  
 TLR

Page 83 of 103  TVR  
 Target limb amputations  
 Stent Thrombosis  
CEC members  will be blinded to a subject’s treatment assignment during the trial. 
Responsibilities, qualifications, membership, and committee procedures are outlined in the 
CEC charter.  
Contact information for the CEC is included in the Manual of Operations for Japan ese sites.  
22.4. Independent Data Review (IDR)  
The independent data reviewer (IDR) provides external oversight and review for potential 
safety concerns. The IDR is a physician expert in peripheral interventional therapy who is not 
participating in the clinical s tudy and has no affiliation with BSC.  
Aggregate accumulating safety data will be reviewed to monitor for the incidence of MAEs  
and other trends that would warrant modification or termination of the trial. During the 
course of the trial, d ata will be suppli ed to and reviewed by the IDR in blinded fashion (i.e., 
group A and group B).  If, after review of blinded data, the IDR wants to review unblinded 
data, a request will be made to the Executive Committee for consideration and final decision.  
Any IDR recommen dations for clinical study modification or termination because of 
concerns over subject safety or issues relating to data monitoring or quality control will be 
submitted in writing to BSC  for consideration.  
Contact information for the IDR is included in th e Manual of Operations for Japanese sites.  
23. Suspension or Termination  
23.1 Premature Termination of the Study  
BSC  reserves the right to terminate the study at any stage but intends to exercise this right 
only for valid scientific or administrative reasons a nd reasons rel ated to protection of 
subjects.  Investigators, associated IRBs/ IECs/REBs , and regulatory authorities, as applicable, 
will be notified in writing in the event of study termination.  Possible reasons for premature 
study termination include, but are not limited to, the following.  
 The occurrence of unanticipated adverse device effects that present a significant or 
unreasonable risk to subjects enrolled in the study.  
 An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudic es the conclusion of the stud y. 
 A decision o n the part of BSC to suspend or discontinue development of the device.

IRBs/ IECs/REBs  Approval  
Any investigator or  IRBs/ IECs/REBs  in the IMPERIAL trial  may discontinue participation in 
the study or withdrawal approval of the study, respectively, with suitable written notice to 
BSC . Investigators, associated IRBs/ IECs/REBs , and regulatory authorities, as applicable, 
will be notified in writing in the even t of these occurrences.  
23.3 Requirements for Documentation and Subject Follow -up 
In the event of premature study termination a written statement as to why the premature 
termination has occurred will be provided to all participating centers by BSC . The 
IRB/IEC/REB  and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified. Detailed information 
on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be provided.  
In the event an IRB /IEC/REB  terminates participation in the study, participating 
investigators , associated IRBs/ IECs/REBs , and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be 
notified in writing. Detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter 
will be provided by BSC . 
In the event an investigator terminates participation in the study, study responsibility will be 
transferred to a co -investigator, if possible. In the event there are no opportunities to transfer 
investigator responsibility; detailed information on how enr olled subjects will be managed 
thereafter will be provided by BSC . 
The investigator must return all documents and investigational product to BSC , unless this 
action would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects.  
23.4 Criteria for Suspendi ng/Terminating a Study Center  
BSC  reserves the right to stop the inclusion of subjects at a study center at any time after the 
study initiation visit if  no subjects have been enrolled , if enrollment is significantly slower 
than expected, or if the study center has multiple or severe protocol violations  and 
noncompliance without justification and/or fails to follow remedial actions.  
In the event of termination of investigator participation, all study devices will be returned to 
BSC unless this action would j eopardize the rights, safety or well -being of the subjects. The 
IRB/ IEC/REB  and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified. All subjects enrolled 
in the trial at the center will continue to be followed. The Principal Investigator at the center  
must make provision for these follow -up visits unless BSC notifies the investigational center 
otherwise.

ankle level, i.e. forefoot or toes.  
ANKLE -
BRACHIAL INDEX 
(ABI)  The ratio between the systolic pressure measured at the ankle and 
the systolic pressure measured in the arm as follows:  
• Ankle: The systolic pressure will be measured in the target limb 
at the arteria dorsalis pedis and/or the arteria tibialis posterior. If 
both pressures are measured, the highest pressures will be used 
for the ABI calculation.  
• Brachial: The systolic pressu re will be measured in both arms, 
and the highest of both pressures will be used for the ABI 
calculation.  
ARRHYTHMIA  Any variation from the normal rhythm of the heartbeat, including 
but not limited to, sinus arrhythmia, premature beats, heart block, 
ventricular or atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or atrial 
flutter.  
ASSISTED 
PRIMARY 
PATENCY  Percentage (%) of lesions without clinically -driven TLR and those 
with clinically -driven TLR (not due to complete occlusion or by -
pass) that reach end point without restenosis.  
BLEEDING 
COMPLICATION  Includes, but is not limited to, intracranial hemorrhage, GI bleeding, 
hematoma, bleeding at percutaneous catheterization site, and/or 
retroperitoneal bleeding. Bleeding that requires surgery qualifies as 
an SAE.

STENT 
THROMBOSIS  The occurrence of either of the following:  
1. Angiographic documentation (or any other imaging modality if 
angiography not available) of an acute, complete occlusion of a 
previously successfully treated lesion  and/or  
2. Angiographic documentation (or any other imaging modality if 
angiography not available) of a flow -limiting throm bus within, or 
adjacent to, a previously successfully treated lesion

the clinical study procedure.  
Subacute  stent thrombosis is defined as occurring >  24 hours to  30 
days following the  clinical study procedure.  
Late stent thrombosis is defined as >  30 days to 365 days following 
the clinical study procedure.  
Very late  stent thrombosis is defined as >  365 days following the 
clinical study procedure.  
TARGET LESION  A target lesion is identified as a clinical study lesion intended to be 
treated with a clinical study device during the index procedure.

TARGET LESION 
REVASCULARIZATION  
(TLR)  Any surgical or percutaneous intervention to the target lesion(s) after 
the index procedure when one of the following situations is present:   
 
 A target lesion revascularization will be considered clinically -
driven if it occurs within 5 mm proximal or distal to the original 
treatment segment with diameter stenosis  50% by quantitative 
angiography (QA) and the subject has recurrent symptoms (≥ 1 
change in Rutherford Classification or associa ted with decreased 
ABI/TBI of ≥ 20% or ≥ 0.15 in the treated segment. TBI allowed 
in cases of incompressible vessels.)  
 A target lesion revascularization for an in -lesion diameter 
stenosis less than 50% might also be considered a MAE by the 
CEC if the subject has recurrent symptoms (≥ 1 change in 
Rutherford Classification or associa ted with decreased ABI/TBI 
of ≥20% or ≥ 0.15 in the treated segment. TBI allowed in cases 
of incompressible vessels.)  
TARGET VESSEL  
 Target vessel is defined as the  vessel containing the target 
lesion(s).   If the target lesion is entirely within the right superficial 
femoral artery, then the target vessel is the right superficial femoral 
artery.  If the target lesion extends from the right superficial femoral 
artery into the right proximal popliteal artery, then both the right 
superficial femoral artery and right proximal popliteal artery would 
be considered part of the target vessel.  
TARGET V ESSEL 
REVASCULARIZA
TION (TVR)  
 Any surgical or percutaneous intervention to the target vessel(s) 
after the index procedure when one of the following situations is 
present:   
  
 A target vessel revascularization will be considered as clinically -
driven if the culprit lesion stenosis is 50% by QA and the subject 
has recurrent symptoms (≥ 1 change in Rutherford Classification or 
associa ted with decreased ABI/TBI of ≥ 20% or ≥ 0.15 in  the treated 
segment. TBI allowed in cases of incompressible vessels.)  
 A target vessel revascularization for a culprit lesion diameter 
stenosis less than 50% might also be considered a MAE by the CEC 
if the subject has recurrent symptoms (≥ 1 change in Rut herford 
Classification or associa ted with decreased ABI/TBI of ≥ 20% or ≥ 
0.15 in the treated segment. TBI allowed in cases of incompressible 
vessels.)

28.1. Objectives  
The objective of the Long Lesion Substudy is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 
Boston Scientific (BSC) ELUVIA drug eluting stent for treating Superficial Femoral (SFA) 
and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions > 140 mm and ≤ 190 mm in length . 
28.2. Design  
The IMPERIAL Trial c onsists of a prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs 
Zilver PTX), controlled, single -blind, non -inferiority trial (RCT) , a concurrent, non -blinded, 
non-randomized, single -arm, pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy  and a concurrent, non -blinded, 
non-randomized, single -arm, Long Lesion substudy .  
This section describes the Long Lesion substudy only.  
 Scale and Duration  28.2.1.
Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in the IMPERIAL Long Lesion substudy.  
All subjects will receive treatment with the investigation al test device (ELUVIA) in the Long 
Lesion substudy . 
The Long Lesion substudy will be conducted in any site already participating in the 
IMPERIAL Trial that is interested in adding this substudy group.  
Clinical follow -up will be required at the following t ime points: pre -discharge, 1 month, 6 
months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months and 60 months post index procedure.  
Testing required at these visits is described in Section 11.13  of the IMPERIAL protocol.  
If patients are enrolled at a site conducting the PK substudy and are willing to undergo PK 
testing, they will have baseline venous blood drawn followed by blood draws at 10 minutes, 
30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4 , 6, 12, 24 and either 48 or 72 hours after placement of the final 
ELUVIA study stent to evaluate plasma paclitaxel levels.  
The enrollment period will run concu rrent with the IMPERIAL Trial.  
Figure 28.2-1 show s the schematic of the Long Lesion substudy design.

Page 101 of 103  Treatment  Assignment  28.2.2.
Once the subject has signed the IRB/IEC/REB -approved study informed consent form (ICF), 
and has met all clinical inclusion and no clinical exclusion criteria, the subject will be 
considered eligible to be enrolled in the Long Lesion substudy.  Subjects can  be 
simultaneously consented for the RCT and the Long Lesion substudy as the lesion groups do 
not overlap.  Once the lesion length is determined via angiographic assessment, the subject 
would be placed into the appropriate group (i.e. the RCT for lesions 4 0-140 mm in length or 
the Long Lesion substudy for lesions from 140 -190 mm in length).  
If the subject is found to meet exclusion criteria during the angiographic eligibility 
assessment, the subject will be considered a screen failure and should not be rand omized or 
receive an investigational device, nor should the subject be followed post -procedure per 
protocol.  
All subjects will be treated with the ELUVIA Stent System.  It is expected that two Eluvia 
stents will be overlapped in order to cover the entire lesion.  Subjects will be considered 
enrolled when the first ELUVIA stent is introduced into the subject’s vasculature.   
 Multiple Interventions Using Same Access Site During Index Procedure  28.2.3.
Target Limb  
The target lesion may include two or more tandem lesio ns, provided that the entire segment 
of tandem lesions is > 140 mm and  190 mm and can be covered with two  ELUVIA stent s 
according to the Directions for Use (DFU).  For occlusive lesions requiring the use of a re -
entry device, the target lesion length must be > 120 mm and  ≤ 170 mm allowing the target 
lesion and re -entry area to be covered with two  ELUVIA stent s (Refer to Inclusion criterion 
4c and 4d).  
28.3. Subject Selection  
Study Population and Eligibility  
 
Clinical and angiographic inclusion criteria are included in  Table 28-1. Exclusion crit eria are 
identical to the IMPERIAL Trial population and are detailed in Section 9.3 of the 
IMPERIAL protocol.  Prior to enrollment, a subject must meet all of the clinical and 
angiographic inclusion criteria and none of the clinical and angiographic exclusion criteria.

> 120 mm and ≤ 170 mm  
e. Target lesion located at least three centimeters above the inferior 
edge of the femur  
5. Patent infrapopliteal and popliteal artery, i .e., single vessel runoff or 
better with at least one of three vessels patent (<50% stenosis) to the 
ankle or foot with no planned intervention.  
28.4. Subject Accountability  
Subject accountability is as described in Section  10. 
28.5. Study Methods  
Subjects enrolled in the Long Lesion substudy will follow the Data Collection schedule 
outlined in Section  11.1.  If a subject in the Long Lesion substudy is enrolled at a PK 
substudy site and consents to PK testing, assessment of whole blood paclitaxel levels will be 
completed as described in Section 11.12 .  Follow -up visits will continue through 5 years 
post-procedure.

Page 103 of 103 28.6. Statistical Considerations  
Statistical considerations are as defined in Section  12.  The details of all statistical analyses 
will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 Primary  Endpoints  28.6.1.
The sample size determination for the long lesion substudy is arbitrary and not statistically 
driven.  
28.6.1.1.  Primary  Effectiveness  Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint assesses the 12 -month primary patency. There is a non -
statistically driven goal (60%) which was developed from the historical long stent 
performan ce (47.2%; 95% Confidence Interval [30.4%, 64.5%]) in subjects treated with 
Innova Bare Metal Stent System and the expected enhanced performance (10%) for the 
ELUVIA Stent System.  
Statistical Methods  
The non -statistically driven performance goal will be co mpared against the observed 12 -
month primary patency in the evaluable long -lesion subjects. If the observed 12 -month 
primary patency is greater than or equal to 60%, the ELUVIA Stent System will be 
considered to have acceptable effectiveness performance in  the long lesion population.  
28.6.1.2.  Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoint assesses the 12 -month MAE -free rate.  It is expected that the 
MAE -free rate will be similar to the rates observed by the ELUVIA stent group observed in 
the RCT.  The MAE -free Rate as well as its individual components will be rep orted 
separately for this subgroup.  
 Additional Endpoints  28.6.2.
All additional endpoints described in Section 7.2 will be reported separately for this 
subgroup.

Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 5 of 341.0 OBJECTIVES
1.1 Primary objectives
1.1.1 Perform a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib, 
based on overall response rate, in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R TIL).
1.2 Secondary objectives
1.2.1 To determine the tolerability of chronic ibrutinib therapy in this patient 
population.
1.2.2 To determine the disease control rate of this regimen.
1.2.3 Evaluate the complete response rate, overall survival, and progression-free 
survival to single-agent ibrutinib in this patient population.
1.2.4 Determine response rate relative to the underlying B-cell histology.
2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 Transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are comprised of several histologic subtypes, 
including follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and marginal 
zone lymphoma (MZL). As a disease class, it is incurable short of allogeneic 
transplantation and shows a variable natural history. The course is typically slowly 
progressive at the outset and responsive to cytotoxic and immunologic therapies. Most 
patients eventually relapse with a disease phenotype that is increasingly resistant to 
treatment, with shorter intervals of response, over time [1, 2]. At a rate of approximately 
3% per year, indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas transform into more aggressive 
malignancies that share a clonal relationship with the original disease [3]. 
Transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (TIL) is classically diagnosed with 
histologic demonstration of an increased proportion, compared with the original specimen, 
of large neoplastic cells. Though typically transformation is to DLBCL, other subtypes, 
including to unclassifiable B cell lymphoma (BCLU), lymphoblastic lymphoma, and acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) also occur [4]. Clinically, transformation is often reflected 
by a rapid rise in LDH, discordant localized nodal growth, or new B-type symptoms [4, 5]. 
Treatment paradigms for TIL are dictated by prior therapies and patient characteristics. 
High dose therapy (HDT) followed by consolidation with autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT) appears to benefit select patients, with estimates of 5-year overall 
survival ranging from 37 – 65% [6-9], but this procedure is generally limited to a subset of 
patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease and in good physical condition. Involved-
field radiotherapy is beneficial in the subset of patients with early stage disease. For cases 
of relapsed or refractory TIL (R/R TIL), few therapeutic strategies of proven benefit are 
available. Radioimmunotherapy has activity in a subset of patients with R/R TIL and is 
approved for this indication; however its role is not yet clearly defined [10].

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 6 of 342.2 Ibrutinib in lymphoma 
The B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) transmits proliferation signals during normal B cell 
development and its signaling activity has been shown to play a role in a variety of B cell 
malignancies, including follicular lymphoma [11, 12]. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) 
is an essential component of the BCR pathway; its absence results in the arrest of normal 
peripheral B cell maturation and, consequently, low levels of circulating immunoglobulin 
[13, 14]. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is a small molecule that selectively and covalently inhibits 
BTK and has shown activity in several B cell malignancies, including previously treated 
mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, for which its administration is 
FDA approved [15]. Early data also suggest a benefit in FL, with an overall response rate 
in 6 of 11 patients treated on PCYC-04753, and in DLBCL [16]. Ibrutinib is not currently 
FDA approved for these diseases nor for RR/TIL. Ibrutinib has been shown to modulate 
B-cell chemotaxis and migration and promote apoptosis [17]. It is taken orally and, to date, 
has demonstrated a very good safety profile with reported adverse events mostly grade 1 
and 2 in severity and typically self-limited in duration [15, 18].
2.3 Summary
R/R TIL presents a great therapeutic challenge and requires novel strategies. Ibrutinib has 
shown significant promise in treating several B-cell malignancies, and its oral 
administration and favorable toxicity profile make it an especially attractive candidate in 
advanced, previously treated disease. We hypothesize that its use will achieve significant 
and durable responses in a subset of patients with R/R TIL, thus adding to the limited 
selection of therapeutic options for this disease.
3.0 DRUG INFORMATION
  
3.1 General Information
Ibrutinib is an orally-administered, covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor of 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, currently being co-developed by Pharmacyclics, Inc. and 
Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC in B-cell malignancies.
3.2 Administration 
Each capsule contains 140 mg of ibrutinib. The capsules are to be taken once daily 
around the same time each day. They should be swallowed whole and should not 
be opened, broken, or chewed. If a dose of ibrutinib is not taken at the scheduled 
time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal 
schedule the following day. Extra capsules of ibrutinib should not be taken to make 
up for the missed dose.
3.3 Toxicity
3.3.1 Adverse events
Refer to the current FDA-approved package insert or the Physician Desk Reference. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with MCL were 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal

Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 7 of 34pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, bruising, dyspnea, 
constipation, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and decreased appetite.
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with CLL were 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, bruising, neutropenia, anemia, upper respiratory
tract infection, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, pyrexia, constipation, peripheral 
edema, arthralgia, nausea, stomatitis, sinusitis, and dizziness. 
3.3.2 Hemorrhage
Five percent of patients with MCL and 6% of patients with CLL had Grade 3 or 
higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, ecchymoses, gastrointestinal bleeding, 
and hematuria). Overall, 4 bleeding events including bruising of any grade occurred 
in 48% of patients with MCL treated with 560 mg daily and 63% of patients with 
CLL treated at 420 mg daily. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well 
understood. Ibrutinib may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving 
antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding 
ibrutinib for at least 3 to 7 days pre and postsurgery depending upon the type of 
surgery and the risk of bleeding.Subjects in the current study will be monitored 
closely for hemorrhagic adverse events. Guidance on use of antiplatelet agents and 
anticoagulants is provided in Section 3.4.3. 
3.3.3 Other Malignancies 
Other malignancies have occurred in 5% of patients with MCL and 10% of patients 
with CLL who have been treated with ibrutinib. Four percent of patients with MCL, 
had skin cancers and 1% had other carcinomas. Eight percent of patients with CLL 
had skin cancers and 2% had other carcinomas.It is not clear whether or not these 
events are attributable to ibrutinib. 
3.4 Drug Interactions
3.4.1 Metabolism
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A. In healthy volunteers, co-
administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased Cmax and 
AUC of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. The highest ibrutinib dose 
evaluated in clinical trials was 12.5 mg/kg (actual doses of 840 – 1400 mg) given 
for 28 days with single dose AUC values of 1445 ± 869 ng ⋅ hr/mL which is 
approximately 50% greater than steady state exposures seen at the highest indicated 
dose (560 mg). Avoid concomitant administration of ibrutinib with strong or 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short-term (e.g., 
antifungals and antibiotics for 7 days or less, e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin) consider interrupting 
ibrutinib therapy during the duration of inhibitor use. Avoid strong CYP3A 
inhibitors that are needed chronically. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, 
reduce the ibrutinib dose. Patients taking concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of ibrutinib toxicity. Avoid 
grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A.

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 8 of 34Administration of ibrutinib with strong inducers of CYP3A decrease ibrutinib 
plasma concentrations by approximately 10-fold. Avoid concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin and
St. John’s Wort). Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
Appendix C outlines some of the inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A.
 
3.4.3 Concomitant Use of Ibrutinib and Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants 
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
both with and without thrombocytopenia. These include minor hemorrhagic events 
such as contusion, epistaxis and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events including 
gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. Also, patients 
with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. Warfarin or vitamin K 
antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Supplements 
such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided. Ibrutinib should be 
withheld at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of 
surgery and the risk of bleeding (see Section 5.3). Ibrutinib should be used with 
caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit 
platelet function. It is possible that treatment with ibrutinib may increase the risk of 
bruising or bleeding, particularly in subjects receiving antiplatelet agents or 
anticoagulants. Subjects receiving antiplatelet agents in conjunction with ibrutinib 
should be observed closely for any signs of bleeding and ibrutinib should be held 
in the event of major bleeding events defined as adverse event of special interest 
(Section 12). 
3.5 Lymphocytosis
MCL:
Upon initiation of ibrutinib a temporary increase in lymphocyte counts (ie >= 50% 
increase from baseline and above absolute lymphocyte count of 5,000/mcL) 
occurred in 33% of patients in the MCL study. The onset of isolated lymphocytosis 
occurs during the first few weeks of ibrutinib therapy and resolves by a median of 
8 weeks.
Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have 
developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. 
However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression.
CLL:
Upon initiation of ibrutinib a temporary increase in lymphocyte counts (ie >= 50% 
increase from baseline and above absolute lymphocyte count of 5,000/mcL) in 77% 
of patients in the CLL study. The onset of isolated lymphocytosis occurs during the 
first month of ibrutinib therapy and resolves by a median of 23 weeks (range 1 - 
104+ weeks).

7.4.5 The patient may withdraw from the treatment at any time for any reason.
7.4.5 Taking prohibited medications concurrent with ibrutinib therapy may result 
in removal from protocol treatment.
7.5 Continuation of therapy after disease progression
Anecdotal reports indicate that cessation of ibrutinib in patients with B-NHL may 
contribute to rapid tumor progression. Consequently, it may be beneficial for 
patients to begin a new treatment regimen after a minimal interval off ibrutinib. 
To facilitate this, ibrutinib may be continued for up to 4 weeks after 
documentation of disease progression provided that all other criteria for 
continuation of treatment re met. Ibrutinib must be stopped at least 24 hours prior 
to the initiation of the new B-NHL treatment regimen.
8.0       DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS
8.1 Dose Modification and Dose Delay
Treatment with ibrutinib should be held for any of the toxicities listed below:
8.1.1 Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3) 
8.1.2 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/mm3) in the presence of 
significant bleeding (≥  Grade 2 bleeding) 
8.1.3 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25,000/mm3) 
8.1.4  Grade 3 or Grade 4 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (if persistent despite optimal 
antiemetic or antidiarrheal therapy) or any other Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade 3 
drug-related toxicities.
The following actions should be taken for drug-related toxicities: 
Occurrence of the 
Same Adverse Event Action 
First Hold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; may 
restart at original dose level
Second Hold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; 
restart at 1 dose level lower (420 mg daily) 
Third Hold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤1 or baseline; 
restart at 1 dose level lower (280 mg daily) 
Fourth Discontinue ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib may be held for a maximum of 21 consecutive days. Ibrutinib should 
be discontinued if the treatment cannot be resumed within 21 days. Once the
ibrutinib dose is reduced because of toxicity, it cannot be re-escalated. No dose 
escalation of ibrutinib (above 560 mg) is allowed in this study. Refer to section 
3.4 for subjects requiring the initiation of anticoagulants while receiving study

concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.  Refer to section 5.3 
for guidance on dose delays during the perioperative period for subjects who 
require surgical intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving study drug.
If there is a rapid increase in disease burden leading to an "apparent" response of 
PD after the study drug has been held for at least 7 consecutive days, an 
assessment response of tumor flare may be assigned instead of PD. Should this 
occur the patient may remain on study drug if they otherwise meet criteria to 
continue until the next restaging exam unless there is ongoing evidence of 
progressive disease before that time despite ongoing treatment. If there is further 
documented PD on or before the next restaging evaluation the patient will be 
considered to have PD and the date of PD will be assigned to the initial date 
tumor flare.

modification recommendations may reduce the occurrence of additional serious events and are intended to improve 
tolerability for continued Imbruvica treatment. 
 
Summary of updated dosage modification recommendations:
Resume ibrutinib treatment at a reduced dose for patients who experience 
specific non-hematologic and hematologic adverse drug reactions, including 
Grade 2 cardiac failure and Grade 3 cardiac arrhythmias, as outlined in Table 
1
Evaluate the benefit-risk before resuming ibrutinib treatment following Grade 
2 cardiac failure, Grade 3 cardiac arrhythmias, or other Grade 4 non-
hematological adverse reactions
Discontinue treatment for patients who experience adverse drug reactions of 
Grade 3 or 4 cardiac failure or Grade 4 cardiac arrhythmia
8.3 Concomitant Therapy
8.3.1 Medications used during the course of the study should be documented.
8.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy: 
The administration of concurrent medications intended to treat the primary 
cancer is not allowed during protocol therapy.  This includes any 
chemotherapy, investigational agent, biologic agent or other anti-tumor 
agents.  Radiation therapy is also prohibited. 
8.3.3 Patients should be strongly discouraged from taking any “alternative” or 
“naturopathic” medications since these agents may interact with study 
treatment. Any use of these medications should be at the judgment of the 
treating physician and should be documented in the patient’s medical 
record.
8.3.4 Hematopoietic growth factors and transfusions are allowed.

1 Bone marrow studies include aspirate and unilateral or bilateral biopsy and should be performed at screening unless approved by 
the Sponsor-Investigator or Lead Sub-Investigator.  If all bone marrow studies are negative at screening, these do not need to be 
repeated.  If bone marrow status is unknown or positive at screening, patients will need to a have bone marrow study to confirm a 
suspected CR.
2  Pregnancy test is only required in women of childbearing potential.
3 May be obtained up to 8 weeks in advance of initiation of therapy (provided no additional anti-cancer therapies are administered 
during the interval). A Deauville score should be assigned [19].
4 At the beginning of therapy (within 3 days), on completion of every cycle (+/- 3 days) during first 9 cycles, then on completion 
of every 4 cycles (+/- 6 days thereafter. For the first day of therapy, pre-entry H&P, PS, disease assessment, and adverse event 
assessment may be used (these do not need to be repeated within 3 days) and labs done within 14 days are acceptable.
5 During treatment restaging CT (preferred) or MRI will be performed on completion of every 3 cycles of therapy (+/- 6 days) 
during the first 9 cycles and on completion of every 8 cycles of therapy (+/- 12 days) thereafter, or as indicated to evaluate clinical 
suspicion of disease progression. Restaging PET/CT will be performed once during therapy on completion of the first 6 cycles (+/- 
6 days). A Deauville score should be assigned [19] when restaging PET is performed.
6 Post therapy studies should be done within 28 days after the last dose of ibrutinib. A CT (preferred) or MRI will be obtained if 
prior imaging was > 21 days of therapy’s completion.
7 Routine, long-term follow-up should be done approximately every 3 months or as clinically indicated. This can be done in 
conjunction with the patient’s local MD; patients do not need to return to the SCCA. Long-term follow-up will assess survival and 
disease progression for up to 5-years after completion of treatment; subjects will be contacted until death, subject withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow-up, or study termination by the sponsor-investigator, whichever occurs first.

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 17 of 3410.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS
Definitions of Disease, Criteria for Evaluation and Endpoint Definitions – response will be 
based on standard criteria for lymphoid malignancies .
10.1 Selection of Indicator (Target) Lesions
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes or tumor masses selected according to all 
of the following: 
• Clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions 
Abnormal lymph nodes are those that are either 
>15 mm in the greatest transverse diameter (GTD) regardless of the 
short axis diameter, or 
> 10 mm in short axis diameter regardless of long axis
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body 
• Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these 
sites are involved 
• Extranodal lesions within the liver or spleen must be at least 1.0 cm in two 
perpendicular dimensions.
10.2 PET Scans
Visual assessment currently is considered adequate for determining whether a 
PET scan is positive. A Deauville score should be reported. In brief, a positive 
scan is defined as focal or diffuse FDG uptake above background in a location 
incompatible with normal anatomy or physiology. 
10.3 Response Criteria
For measurement of response, standard 2014 criteria as described in 
“Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response Assessment of 
Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification” will be used 
(see Appendix D) [20].
10.4 If a subject who had radiological evidence of PD is clinically stable or improving 
or exhibiting signs of tumor flare without confirmation of PD by PET or biopsy, 
the subject may continue treatment with ibrutinib upon approval by the sponsor-
investigator.. If tumor flare is suspected, the PI may continue ibrutinib and obtain 
additional radiological and clinical evaluation at a subsequent disease evaluation 
visit within 6 weeks, with a determination as to whether ibrutinib should be 
discontinued (in subjects with evidence of further progression at repeat 
evaluation) or further treatment provided (in subjects with signs of subsequent 
tumor shrinkage or stable disease without clinical deterioration).
10.5 Progression-free survival (PFS): PFS will be measured as time from first study 
drug administration to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from 
any cause. Data for subjects without disease progression or death will be censored 
at the date of the last tumor assessment and before the initiation of alternative

Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 18 of 34anticancer therapy. The estimates will be formed using the all treated population. 
Progression-free survival will be calculated using assessments by investigators. 
Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves and 
corresponding quartiles (including the median).
10.6 Assessment inadequate, objective status unknown: Progression has not been 
documented and one or more target lesions or other sites of disease have not been 
assessed or inconsistent methods of assessment were used.
10.7 Bone Marrow Status: Bone marrow status is evaluated as follows: 
Positive: Unequivocal cytological or architectural evidence of malignancy.  
Negative: No aggregates or only a few well-circumscribed lymphoid 
aggregates.  
Indeterminate:  Does not qualify for either Positive or Negative Status.  *Note this 
typically consists of increased number or size of aggregates without cytological or 
architectural atypia.
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1 The primary objective is to gain a preliminary (pilot) assessment of the efficacy of 
this regimen based on overall response rate (ORR) (see section 10.2).  Analyses of 
secondary endpoints will be primarily descriptive. Patients with R/R TIL have a 
poor prognosis and short median survival; therefore an ORR of ≥ 30%, a disease 
control rate of ≥ 50% (defined as ORR plus stable disease, as defined in section 
10.2), or a median PFS of ≥  6 months will be considered a success.
11.2 Anticipated accrual: We anticipate that accrual will take 1-2 years.     
11.3 Estimated* distribution of study population by gender and race and ethnicity:
Ethnic Category Females Males
American Indian/Alaska Native
Asian 1 1
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
Black or African American 1 1
White 8 8
More than one race
Unknown or not reported
Racial Categories: Total of all subjects 10 10
*The exact sample size is not known since it is dependent on the number of 
evaluable patients, but we estimate the total enrollment will be 20.

accrue an additional 20 patients.
12.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES
12.1 Adverse Event Reporting 
Complete and timely reporting of adverse events (AEs) is required to ensure the 
safety of patients.  Reporting requirements are determined by the characteristics of 
the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study 
therapy (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse 
event, and whether the event is of interest  to Janssen Scientific Affairs.  The 
guidelines outlined in this section, as well as the specific direction on each report 
form must be followed.  The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTCAE) will be used to classify and grade toxicities.
12.2 Definitions and descriptions of terms used in adverse event reporting.
12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medical treatment or procedure.
12.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)
A Serious Adverse Event or Adverse Drug Reaction means any AE/ADR 
occurring at any dose that results in:
Death;
A life-threatening AE/ADR (i.e, the patient/subject was, in the view of the 
initial reporter/investigator, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred. It does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if more severe);
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (i.e, 
hospitalization was required to treat or diagnose the AE/ADR: excludes 
hospitalization for unrelated reasons (e.g., social reasons such as pending 
placement in long-term care facility) OR surgery or procedure planned 
before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF). Note: 
Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and 
where the underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned 
has not worsened, will not be considered serious adverse events. Any 
adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned 
hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event;
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
6/28/2023
 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 20 of 34A persistent or significant disability or incapacity (disability here means 
that there is a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal 
life functions;
A congenital anomaly/birth defect;
An important medical event (i.e., AEs/ADRs that might not be 
immediately life-threatening, or result in death or hospitalization might be 
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, they might jeopardize the patient/subject or might require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed above);
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.
Sponsor-Investigator shall use his/her judgment to determine the relationship 
between the Serious Adverse Drug Experience and the Study Drug.
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease 
progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event 
definition.
12.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Specific adverse events or groups of adverse events will be followed as part of 
standard safety monitoring activities. These events will be reported to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs within 24 hours of awareness irrespective of seriousness (ie, 
serious and nonserious adverse events) following the procedure described above 
for serious adverse events and will require enhanced data collection.  Specific 
adverse events of interest include:
1. Major Hemorrhage
Major hemorrhage is defined as any hemorrhagic event that is Grade 3 or greater 
in severity or that results in 1 of the following: intraocular bleeding causing loss 
of vision, the need for a transfusion of 2 or more units of red cells or an equivalent 
amount of whole blood, hospitalization, or prolongation of hospitalization.
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage
Any intracranial hemorrhage adverse event, including subdural 
hematoma/hemorrhage, epidural hematoma/hemorrhage and intracerebral 
hemorrhage, of any grade severity, will be captured as an event of special interest.
3. Other Malignancies 
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumors, including solid 
tumors, skin malignancies and hematologic malignancies, are to be reported for 
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
6/28/2023
 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 21 of 34the duration of study treatment and during any protocol-specified follow-up 
periods including post-progression follow-up for overall survival.
12.2.4 Pregnancy 
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs by 
the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and 
congenital anomaly) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported 
as a Serious Adverse Event. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study 
must discontinue further study treatment. 
Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners 
of male subjects included in the study will be reported by the study-site personnel 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. 
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal 
sequelae in the infant will be required.
12.2.5 Grade
Grade is defined as the severity of the adverse event.  The CTCAE Version 4.0 
must be used to determine the grade of the adverse event. If toxicity is not listed 
in the CTCAE use the following general criteria for grading.  
0 – No adverse event or within normal limits
1 – Mild adverse event
2 – Moderate adverse event
3 – Severe adverse event
4 – Life-threatening or disabling adverse event
5 – Fatal adverse event
12.2.6 Attribution
Attribution is defined as the determination of whether an adverse event is related 
to a medical treatment or procedure.  Attribution categories are as follows:
Unrelated The adverse event is clearly NOT related to therapy
Unlikely The adverse event is doubtfully related to therapy
Possible The adverse event may be related to therapy
Probable The adverse event is likely related to therapy
Definite The adverse event is clearly related to therapy
12.2.7 Unexpected Adverse Event
An adverse event is considered unlisted (unexpected) if the nature or severity is 
not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For 
ibrutinib, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or 
not it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure and US package insert.

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 22 of 3412.2.8 Product Quality Complaint
A product quality complaint may allege an injury or malfunction associated with 
the use of the drug product. It may involve the design, literature, packaging, 
advertising, availability, physical appearance or promotion of the drug product. It 
may also involve any discrete concern that questions the identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, efficacy or intended performance of a drug product.
12.2.9 J&J Medicinal Product
J&J medicinal product includes the specific drug under study and other J&J 
medicinal product.
12.3 Routine Reporting
Routine reporting is required for all adverse events.  
All applicable adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or 
non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained 
until30 days following the last dose of study drug.  Serious adverse events, 
including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug, must be reported. 
All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be reported as 
serious adverse events, regardless of whether they are protocol-specific 
assessments.
All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to 
study drug, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document 
and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and 
symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore 
throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respiratory infection"). 
Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of 
the adverse event to study therapy. All measures required for adverse event 
management must be recorded in the source document.
The sponsor-investigator assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of 
adverse events to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs all serious adverse events that are unlisted (unexpected) and 
associated with the use of the study drug. The sponsor must report these events to 
the appropriate IRB that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and 
documented by the IRB.
12.4 Expedited Reporting 
All unexpected adverse events,  serious adverse events, and adverse events of 
interest which may be due to study treatment or intervention, must be reported to 
the Sponsor-Investigor as soon as possible. Expedited reporting will be conducted 
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
6/28/2023
 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 23 of 34in accordance with FHCRC/Cancer Consortium IRB policies, applicable FDA 
regulations, and agreements with Janssen Scientific Affairs.
Expedited reporting additionally applies to any death occurring during protocol 
therapy or within 30 days of completing protocol therapy and any death that occurs 
more than 30 days after completing protocol treatment that is thought to be 
treatment-related and is not due to disease recurrence. Expedited reporting further 
applies to the occurrence of pregnancy or, new diagnosis of cancer during treatment 
or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, or overdose of study drugs 
(regardless of adverse outcome).
     
12.5      Follow-up of serious adverse events
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that 
have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, 
must be followed until any of the following occurs:
The event resolves
The event stabilizes
The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors 
unrelated to study conduct
It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be
obtained (subject or health care practitioner refusal to provide additional 
information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of due diligence with follow-
up efforts)
12.6      Reporting to Janssen Scientific Affairs
All serious adverse events and adverse events of interest occurring during the study 
must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs by the sponsor-investigator within 24 
hours of learning of the event.
The Sponsor-Investigator will initially notify Janssen Scientific Affairs within 24 
hours, by facsimile or e-mail, upon learning of the occurrence during the Study of:
All serious AE/ADRs, regardless of causality (see 12.2);
AEs of special interest (see 12.2.3, 12.2.4);
Special reporting situations (see 12.11);
Product quality complaints (see 12.13);
Any exposure of a pregnant Study participant to the Study Drug within thirty 
(30) days of exposure;
A female partner of a male Study participant becoming pregnant within thirty 
(30) days of exposure;   
Any medical event which may reasonably be believed to impair the integrity, 
validity or ongoing viability of the Study.

Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 24 of 34All such occurrences listed in this section shall be reported in final form to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs using a MedWatch form.  An aggregate listing of all SAEs and 
AEs will also be sent yearly and at the end of the study to Janssen Scientific Affairs 
electronically.
In the event the IRB requests additional safety information from the investigator, 
the investigator shall notify Janssen Scientific Affairs of such request within one 
(1) business day of learning of the request.
12.7     Maintenance of Safety Information
Safety information will be maintained in a clinical database/repository in a 
retrievable format. At a minimum, at the end of the treatment phase as well as the 
end of the follow-up phase of the Study, the Sponsor-Investigator shall provide all 
adverse events, both serious and non-serious, in report format. However, in certain 
circumstances more frequent review of the safety data may be necessary.
12.8      Reconciliation of SAEs
At a minimum, on a quarterly basis and at the end of the Study, Janssen Scientific 
Affairs will provide to the Sponsor-Investigator, a listing of all SAEs reported to 
Janssen Scientific Affairs.  The Sponsor-Investigator will review this listing and 
provide any discrepancies to Janssen Scientific Affairs.
Upon request, the Sponsor-Investigator shall provide Janssen Scientific Affairs 
with a summary list of all SAEs, and AEs of Special Interest and Special Reporting 
Situation reports to date, for reconciliation purposes.
12.9      Dissemination of Safety Information from Janssen Scientific Affairs to 
theSponsor-Investigator
Janssen Scientific Affairs will provide to the Sponsor-Investigator IND safety 
reports/SUSAR (Serious Unexpected Suspect Adverse Reaction) reports generated 
by the Janssen Scientific Affairs for the Study Product as they become available 
until all subjects in the Protocol have completed their last Study visit according to

12.12 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan
All serious adverse events are communicated to the study Sponsor-Investigator,  
and regulatory agencies as described above.  A status report including accrual, 
adverse events, and death information will be reviewed by the Sponsor-Investigator 
every 6 months and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) 
Protocol Data Monitoring Committee (PDMC) annually.  In addition, the study will 
be monitored by the Research Trials Office according to the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center monitoring plan.
12.13  Product quality complaint handling
All initial PQCs must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs by the study-site 
personnel within 24 hours after being made aware of the event.
If the defect is combined with a serious adverse event, the study-site personnel must 
report the PQC to Janssen Scientific Affairs according to the serious adverse event 
reporting timelines.  A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for 
further investigation if requested by Janssen Scientific Affairs.
 12.14 Required Records and Materials
Original signed informed consent form will be retained with the study records.  A

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 29 of 34Appendix A: Ann Arbor staging system for lymphomas
Principal stages
The principal stage is determined by location of the tumor:
Stage I indicates that the cancer is located in a single region, usually one lymph node and the 
surrounding area. Stage I often will not have outward symptoms.
Stage II indicates that the cancer is located in two separate regions, an affected lymph node or 
organ and a second affected area, and that both affected areas are confined to one side of the 
diaphragm - that is, both are above the diaphragm, or both are below the diaphragm.
Stage III indicates that the cancer has spread to both sides of the diaphragm, including one organ 
or area near the lymph nodes or the spleen.
Stage IV indicates diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, 
including any involvement of the liver, bone marrow, or nodular involvement of the lungs.
These letters can be appended to some stages:
A or B: the absence of constitutional (B-type) symptoms is denoted by adding an "A" to the 
stage; the presence is denoted by adding a "B" to the stage.
E: is used if the disease is "extranodal" (not in the lymph nodes) or has spread from lymph nodes 
to adjacent tissue.
X: is used if the largest deposit is >10 cm large ("bulky disease").
S: is used if the disease has spread to the spleen.

unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours)
3 – Symptomatic, >50% in bed, but not bedbound (Capable of only limited self-care, confined to 
bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours)
4 – Bedbound (Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or 
chair)

the following)
Score 1, 2, or 3* with or without a residual mass on 5PS†Target nodes/nodal masses must regress 
to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi
Lymph nodes and 
extralymphatic 
sitesIt is recognized that in Waldeyer's ring or extranodal sites 
with high physiologic uptake or with activation within 
spleen or marrow (eg, with chemotherapy or myeloid 
colony-stimulating factors), uptake may be greater than 
normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this circumstance, 
complete metabolic response may be inferred if uptake at 
sites of initial involvement is no greater than surrounding 
normal tissue even if the tissue has high physiologic 
uptake No extralymphatic sites of disease

Lymph nodes and 
extralymphatic 
sitesScore 4 or 5† with reduced uptake compared with baseline 
and residual mass(es) of any size≥ 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 target 
measurable nodes and extranodal sites
At interim, these findings suggest responding diseaseWhen a lesion is too small to measure 
on CT, assign 5 mm × 5 mm as the 
default value
At end of treatment, these findings indicate residual 
disease When no longer visible, 0 × 0 mm
For a node > 5 mm × 5 mm, but smaller 
than normal, use actual measurement 
for calculation

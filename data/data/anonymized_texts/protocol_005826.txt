Description of Intervention : 
Normothermic EVLP for extended preservation, assessment and transplantation of donor lungs.   
Study  Title : 
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Open -Label Study to Measure the Safety of Extending Preservation and Assessment 
Time of Donor Lungs Using Normothermic Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion and Ventilation (EVLP) as Administered by 
the Sponsor Using the Toronto EVLP System  
Study Number:  
PXUS 14 -001 
Study Type :  Traditional Feasibility  
Primary Objective (s):  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the short -term safety of subjects receiving a lung transplant, 
where the lung(s) was perfused by the Sponsor using the T oronto EVLP System (T ES). Assessment of Primary 
Graft Dysfunction ( PGD) Grade 3 at 72 hours post -transplant ( T72) and 30- day mortality will represent the 
outcome measures, and the primary endpoints are the fol lowing two measures:  
• The proportion of recipient s with PGD  Grade 3 (PGD3) assessed at T72  
• 30-day mortality post -transplant.  
 The above information will also be collected on patients enrolled in a contemporaneous control group to provide 
context for EVLP results and to inform control measures for future research.
 
Secondary Objective (s): 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the short -term safety of subjects receiving a lung transplant 
where the lung(s) has been perfused via the TES performed by the Sponsor by assessment of the following:  
• PGD S core (Grades 0 -3) measured at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post -transplant  
• Time to first extubation  
• Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), measured as total number of days post -transplant in the ICU 
until first hospital discharge, inclusive of ICU readmissions during that hospitalization.  
• Hospital LOS measured as total number of days in the hospital prior to discharge post -transplant  
• Total preservation time (TPT), defined as the elapsed time between first allograft lung removal from cold 
storage  time prior to transplant in the recipient and the donor aortic cross clamp time at procurement  
• Assessment of the overall safety of TES lung transplants during subject's participation in the study, as 
reported through adverse events (AEs).  
 
The above information will also be collected on patients enrolled in a contemporaneous control group to provide 
context for EVLP results and to inform control measures for future research.  
 
Study Design : 
This is a Phase 2, unblinded, non -randomized, traditional feasibility study to evaluate the safety of subjects 
undergoing lung transplant using lungs after EVLP, and performed exclusively by the Sponsor at the Sponsor’s 
facility using the Toronto EVLP Syst em (TES).  
 
Once the donor lung is accepted following EVLP, the eligible recipient, who has provided written informed 
consent, and receives the lung transplant, is enrolled into the study. Patients who consent for the current EVLP

Confidential  Page 4 of 89 study (PXUS 14 -001) but receive a conventional (i.e., non -EVLP) lung transplant will be considered for a 
contemporaneous control group matched to the EVLP treatment group ( 66 subjects each). This matching will take 
place on a patient -by-patient basis and only after an  EVLP subjec t has been enrolled  at that Study Center . 
Investigators and their team will be notified by the Sponsor on a real -time basis of the specific matching criteria 
required for a control subject as EVLP subjects are enrolled. In order to be considered for eligib ility, the control 
patient must “match” a priori to at least one EVLP subject who has already been enrolled at that Study Center 
based on the following criteria:  SLT versus DLT  and Lung Allocation Score Disease Diagnosis Group 
(LASDDG) . 
The post -intervent ion phase of the study will then be split into two phases:  1) the Analysis Phase, which includes 
follow -up within one year post -intervention and 2) Long -term Follow -up, which will capture outcome data 
annually from 1 -year post -intervention until 5 -years p ost intervention. Although the study will continue after one 
year, the database will be locked for analyses of endpoints after the last subject has his/her study visit at 1 Year. 
The Long -term Follow -up data will be summarized when the study has completed in support of long -term 
evaluation.  
Analysis Phase  
Following transplantation, subjects will be admitted to the ICU, and the initial PaO 2 and PGD Score will be 
recorded. The subject’s PGD Score will be recorded every 24 hrs for the next 72 hrs. The ICU disc harge date will 
be documented. Study visits will occur 30 days (±5), 90 days (±10), 6 months (±2 weeks), and 1 year (±4 weeks) post-transplant. Study assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 , Table 
3). 
 
Long -term Follow -up 
Although the database will be locked and analyses of endpoints performed after the last subject has his/her study 
visit at 1 Year, the Sponsor will continue to collect specified outcome parameters that are required to be reported 
by transplant centers to OPTN/ United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Collection will be annually for 5 -
years post -intervention; outcome collection is outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1, Table 4 ). 
 
Study Population :  
The study will be open to all eligible male and female patients, aged 18 years or older, with end -stage lung 
disease listed for lung transplantation at a participating Study Center. These participants may not be receiving mechanical ventilation, ECMO or ECLS, at the time of initial lung offer prior to EVLP.  
 A sample size of 132  subjects, receiving either SLT or DLT, is planned for this study, where 66 subjects receive 
donor lung(s ) after EVLP (EVLP Group) and 66  subjects are in a contemporaneous control group (Control 
Group). No more than two -thirds of the subjects who are enrolled (4 4 subjects per group) will have received a 
single -lung transplant (SLT) or double -lung transplant (DLT).  
 
Subject (recipient) Inclusion Criteria  
 
Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male or f emale patients.  
2. All patients, 18 years of age or older.  
3. Patient already on or added to the active waiting list for a single or bilateral lung transplant.  
4. Patient or patient’s representative provides informed consent for participation in the study prior to 
participating in any study -related assessments or procedures . 
5. Patient or patient’s representative reconfirms informed consent for the study on the day of lung transplant if

infection.  
5. Patients in the ICU at the time of the initial lung offer requiring venti lation, ECMO or other extracorporeal 
life support (ECLS). [Note: The decision to place the recipient on ECMO or other ECLS for post -transplant 
prophylaxis at time of or immediately prior to transplant is not considered an exclusion]  
6. Patient receives a conv entional (non -EVLP) lung transplant but does NOT match to an EVLP subject based 
on the criteria for control matching outlined above . 
 
Study Intervention :  
EVLP is a novel technology that allows extended assessment of lungs whose suitability for transplant ation is 
initially uncertain. By protocol design, EVLP -treated lungs undergo a longer period of total preservation, 
including an initial cold ischemic time (CIT -1), a period of normothermic EVLP assessment, and a final round of 
CIT (CIT -2). The extended do nor lung preservation time may enable better logistical coordination of the recipient 
and donor hospital transplant teams.  
 
Upon retrieval, donor lungs will be packaged and transported to the Sponsor’s EVLP facility. The EVLP 
procedur e will be performed by  specifically -trained  Ex Vivo Lung Specialists under remote video supervision by 
one of the Sponsor’s Expert Medical Consultants. The Sponsor will perfuse the lung using the TES for up to 6 
hrs, collecting and relaying lung function assessment data hourly,  or as requested by the Study Center 
Investigator/team. Additionally, the Study Center surgeon will have access to remote monitoring capabilities at the Sponsor EVLP Center for evaluating lung function data and monitoring the procedure through a dedicated 
audio/video link.  
 The Study Center Investigator/team, together with the Sponsor’s Expert Medical Consultants, will monitor the 
donor lung(s) for EVLP inclusion criteria and collaborate to determine the timing of EVLP termination. However, final decisions reside with the Study Center Investigator/team. Upon acceptance of an EVLP donor lu ng by the 
Study Center, the single lung or lung block is cooled according to TES methodology to 10°C, and perfusion and ventilation are stopped. This point marks the start of CIT -2. The end of CIT -2 is defined as the time the organ is 
removed from cold sto rage to begin the implantation phase of the transplantation procedure. The time between 
the organ’s removal from cold storage to reperfusion in the recipient is known as warm ischemic time (WIT). 
Total preservation time for the first lung transplanted from  donor lung retrieval to the end of CIT -2 must not be 
greater than a combined 22 hrs and individual phase limits as follows:  
(≤ 10 hrs CIT -1) + (3 - 6 hrs EVLP)  + (≤ 6 hrs CIT -2) ≤ 22 hrs 
Total preservation time for the second lung transplanted from donor  lung retrieval to the end of CIT -2 must not be 
greater than a combined 26 hrs and individual phase limits as follows:   
(≤ 10 hrs CIT -1) + (3 - 6 hrs EVLP)  + (≤ 10 hrs CIT -2) ≤ 26 hrs 
Duration of Subject Participation :  
Data will be collected from the organ donor, EVLP procedure  (if applicable) , and each subject from the time of 
lung transplantation and up to one year post -transplant  for the Analysis Phase . In addition, outcome data will be 
collected annually up to 5 years post -transplant.  
 
The study duration  for the Analysis Phase  (from first patient, first visit [FPFV] to last patient, last visit [LPLV]  
prior to database lock ) is expected to be 3  years. The estimated time to complete enrollment is approximately 24 
months.

Confidential  Page 6 of 89 Safety  Assessments : 
Medical History and concomitant medications will be collected for each subject. Physical examinations, including 
specific tests to assess lung function, will be performed at Baseline, Day  30, and Month 6. Vital signs will be 
assessed at each study visit.   
 
The subject’s PGD Score is to be determined by the Investigator at Baseline (Day  0) after transplantation and 
upon admission to the ICU, as well as 24, 48, and 72 hrs post -transplant. Subject arterial blood gases must be 
determined by the Investigator, in orde r to calculate PGD grade. Graft survival will be evaluated by the 
Investigator (or his/her designee) at Day  30, Day  90, Month  6, Year  1 post -transplant, and premature termination 
(if applicable).  
 
Subject survival, measured as living or dead, will be recorded Day  30, Day  90, Month  6, and Year  1 
post-transplant. If the subject expires within first year post -transplant, the date of death and primary cause of 
death will be collected.  
 Evaluation of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS), physical capacit y, and work status will be conducted at 
Day 90, Month 6, Year  1 post -transplant, and premature termination (if applicable).  
 
In addition, after completion of the Analysis Phase, survival will be recorded annually until 5 -year post -
transplant. If survival i s confirmed, then FEV 1 and oxygen at rest will be collected annually, along with BOS, 
physical capacity, work status, graft survival, by the Sponsor for the Long- term Follow -up Phase (Year 2, 3, 4, 
and 5).  
Statistical Methods:   
Statistical analysis will b e performed primarily on data collected during the Analysis Phase (1 year 
post-intervention) . The database will be locked for analysis of endpoints after the last subject completes his/her 
study visit at Year 1, and all queries have been resolved.   
 
All su bject s are included in the analyses to the extent data are available.  
 The primary endpoint of PGD3 T72 will be calculated from PGD T72 as follows:  PGD T72 = {0, 1, & 2} will be 
coded to PGD3 T72 = 0 and PGD T72 = {3} will be coded to PGD3 T72 = 1. The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects with PGD3 T72 by Transplant Group (EVLP and Control). A one -sided 
95% CI will be calculated around the proportion. A two -sided 95% CI will also be calculated.  
 
The primary endpoint of 30- Day mortality will be derived as follows:  Living at Day 30 will be coded to 0, and 
Dead before or on Day 30 will be coded to 1. The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects with 30- Day mortality, summarized by Transplant Group. A o ne-sided 95% CI will be calculated around 
the proportion. A two -sided 95% CI will also be calculated.  
 
All secondary endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics along with two sided 95% CIs by Transplant 
Group. Other supportive endpoints may b e provided to supplement the secondary analyses.  
Results may be displayed graphically. There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
 
All exploratory endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics along with two sided 95% CIs by 
Transplant Gro up. There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
 
A contemporaneous Control group will be entered into this study. This Control group will provide context of the 
EVLP results and estimation of Control group parameters for design of future studies. All analyses of the Control 
group will be descriptive and no formal statistical comparison will be made between the EVLP and Control 
groups.

1.1 Lung Transplantation and E x Vivo Lung Perfusion Background  
Lung transplantation is often the only available therapy for patients suffering end -stage lung 
disease, and the number of patients who can appropriately benefit by  lung transplantation far 
exceeds the donor lungs  available. Importantly , the mismatch between demand for transplantable 
lungs and the supply of available organs is substantially higher than other solid organs , with the 
lungs being used for transplantation among  only 20% of brain dead donors who are used for 
transplant ing other solid organs.[Munshi 2013; SRTR 2011] T he described reason for declining 
the majority of the available donor lungs by transplant programs has been listed as being due to 
“Poor Organ Function” and “No Recipient Found.” [SRTR 2011]  
It has been suggested  that over 4 0% of the lungs rejected by the United States ( US) lung 
transplant programs could have be en transplanted if better information was available at the time 
of procurement , or additional time w as available to meet the complex logistical demands of 
procurement and transplantation. [Ware 2002] Introduction of technologies , such as Ex vivo  Lung 
Perfusion (EVLP ), might facili tate more in- depth assessment of lung condition, thereby enabling  
transplant programs to use  lungs for transplant  that are currently discarded.   
Evidence linking the pathophysiology of brain death to early organ dysfunction after transplantation continues to accumulate and seems especially relevant when considering donor lungs. L ung injury begins soon after a catastrophic event  associated with massive brain injury 
with a massive sympathetic outflow , then an associated release of  inflammatory cytokines . These 
mediators of inflammation then  remain within  the donor lung(s), ultimately being released into 
the recipient circulation after transplantation, potentially reflecting an important etiology of  early 
graft dysfunction.[ Fisher 2001]   
Also, cerebral edema leading to b rain stem herniation effects  irreversible cessation of brain  
function (e.g., death). This is associated with complete loss of autonomic tone with massive 
vasodilation and hypotension. T his is generally treated  by administration of large volumes of 
fluids t o maintain  adequate circulation and end organ perfusion.[Power 1995; Hayek 1990; 
Tropmann 2008] Together with neurogenic pulmonary edema , another consequence of brain 
death, the overall clinical picture can obscure assessment of pulmonary function.[Avlonitis  2007]  
Steen et al., described an ex vivo  perfusion technique in 2001, seeking  to better evaluate lungs 
from non- heart beating donors (Donation after Circulatory Death [ DCD]).[Steen 2001]. This 
method demonstrated the proof- of-concept evidence that donor lungs could be assessed ex vivo , 
then successfully transplanted, initially into large animals, and later into humans.  
Keshavjee’s group in Toronto extended those observations , applying a modified, normothermic 
(37°C) EVLP technique,  using an acellular , albumin- based solution (STEEN Sol ution™ ), lower 
perfusion flow rates (40% of normal cardiac output), and a protective ventilation strateg y to 
permit longer perfusion with excellent physiologic function after transplantation .[Cypel 2008a ; 
Cypel 2008b; Cypel 2009] The method, called the Toronto EVLP System (TES) was demonstrated as  technically feasible and safe, permitting  perfus ion of donor lungs for up to

preservation  period, TES extended the time available for  assessment of donor lungs  under 
near-physiologic conditions.  
1.1.1 Toronto Clinical Experience:  Toronto EVLP System  
Human studies were started  during 2008 in Toronto with the Human Ex Vivo  Lung Perfusion 
(HELP) trial. HELP was a prospective, non- randomized, single -center study of outcomes of 
lungs not meeting conventional lung donor criteria, receiving 4  hrs of extended preservation and 
assessme nt using  EVLP . The EVLP treated lungs were compared to all other lungs transplanted  
(Control) during the same time period. In addition to the 4 hrs of extended preservation ti me, 
EVLP -treated lungs received an obligatory second cold ischemic period during  transport after 
completion of ex vivo  assessment.  
The first three HELP recipients received bilateral lung transplants from a  standard criteria donor 
(SCD) with one lung preserved using  conventional hypothermic cold storage, and the second 
lung using  one hour of TES . After no adverse consequences were identified in this initial 
experience, declined lungs from 23 donors were then assessed using the TES.  Among those 20 
lung transplants (86% utilization), 11 originated from  brain -dead donors , and the remaining 9 , 
from DCD cases. Selection criteria were not used to determine which recipient would receive the 
EVLP or conventional donor lung. Rather, s election was determined based on an algorithm 
where  available lungs  were assessed to establish i f they met the standard for transplantation 
using  conventional donor lung criteria. Donor lungs deemed not appropriate for transplantation 
using  ‘conventional’ criteria were placed on  EVLP the n made available to potential recipients 
who previously provided informed consent for this study .   
Upon trial completion, Health Canada permitted ongoing access through compassionate use, resulting in 39 additional EVLP transplants (total of 61 EVLP transplants prior to final marketing approval). STEEN Solution™ recei ved full marketing approval by Health Canada on 
06 Nov  2012 as a stand -alone device (i.e. , could be used with any off -the-shelf perfusion 
equipment).  
The i nitial study results suggested that t ransplantation of donor lungs that were physiologically 
stable during 4 hrs  of EVLP , resulted in  similar outcomes to those obtained with conventionally 
procured and hypothermically -treated  lungs. [Cypel 2011a ]  
By protocol design, EVLP -treated lungs underwent a longer period of total prese rvation, 
including an initial cold ischemic time (CIT- 1), a period of normothermic  EVLP assessment , and 
a final round of CIT (CIT -2).[Cypel 2011a ]  
Ethical concerns limited the study design in that it was not possible to randomize the initially rejected donor lungs to ‘EVLP’ or ‘no EVLP’ study groups to determine post -transplantation 
success. However, review was possible from a clinical perspective as to whether the post-transplant outcomes were satisfactory for both groups. After 4 hrs  of EVLP, the donor lung 
was evaluated to determine a number of parameters including the difference in pulmonary venous and arterial oxygen partial pressure (PO
2) (delta PO 2 = pulmonary vein O 2 - pulmonary 
artery O 2), pulmonary vascular resis tance ( PVR ), peak airway pressure (P AwP), and lung

transplantation during  years  1 through 5 post -transplant .[Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012] 
In the first six years after the HELP study  began, the overall lung utilization rate in Toronto 
increased to 36% [S Keshavjee, personal communication ] without significant changes to lung 
transplant volumes in surrounding regions .[Tiwari  2014] Therefore , it seems reasonable to infer 
that EVLP played a relevant role in the observed lung transplant volume increase.  Long-term 
outcomes for the lung recipients in  the HELP (and compassiona te extension) trial , suggest that 
the lu ngs transplanted after EVLP had  similar long -term outcomes compared to conventionally 
procured lungs .[Cypel 2012] 
Taken together , more than 225 donor lung sets  have been evaluated by the Toronto group with a 
consistent increase in the lung utilization rate approximating 80% .[C Jaynes , personal 
communication ]. Overa ll, one -, three -, and five -year  outcomes after lung transplantation have 
been similar to results obtained among  lung recipients  who received standard lung transplants 
without using EVLP .[Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2011b; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012;  Munshi 2013; 
Cypel 2013] 
 
1.1.2 Sponsor Clinical Experience:  Toronto EVLP System  
In 2015, Lung Bioengineering Inc (the Sponsor) merged with PERFUSIX USA, the previous 
Sponsor of this study , and S tudy PXUS 14 -001 continues under the new sponsorship. The 
Sponsor’s predecessor company, PERFUSIX  USA , had considerable experience with the TES , in 
that its employees and consultants consis ted of team members who  developed the technology, 
validated the protocols through the HELP clinical trial ,[Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 
2012] and designed the s ingle- use disposable products used in the EVLP procedure. 
Additionally, a  separate Canadian corporation, PERFUSIX Canada, has  been responsible for 
running all of the EVLP lung procedures in Ontario, Canada, as a service for Toronto General 
Hospital ( TGH) since April  2013.  
1.1.3  Report of Prior Investigations  
A full  report of prior investigation s detailing the above and other EVLP studies will be provided 
to the Study Center I nvestigators and submitted to each reviewing IRB. One copy shall be filed 
in the Investigator Study File. 
1.2 Potential Risks and Benefits  
For many patients who choose evaluation and listing for lung transplantation, the inherent risks are outweighed by the benefit that transplantation is the only life prolonging therapy for  
end-stage lung  disease. Factors underlying the exaggerated imbalance between lung donor 
supply and recipient mismatch compared with other solid organs have been reviewed earlier. 
EVLP -specific potential risks and benefits are presented below.

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 18 of 89 1.2.1 Potential Risks  
The specif ic additional risks associated with EVLP  beyond those encountered in lung transplant  
general ly include extend ing ischemia beyond the initial cold ischemic period, increased potential 
for contamination due to additional handling and manipulation of the lung s, and potential lung 
damage that might result from  the perfusion process and associated procedures, such as  
cannulation, bronchoscopy, and repackaging, among others . Specific risks and mitigation 
strategies are addressed in Appendix 3.  
1.2.2 Potential Benefits  
The p otential benefits of extended evaluation provided by EVLP include:  
• Evaluation under fixed/ideal hemodynamics outside of the confounding influence of the 
pathophysiology resulting from  brain dea th and accompanying somatic injury , 
• Extended time enabling more careful examination/evaluation of donor organs . 
 Assessment  of lung and recipient risk profiles is based largely on the individual experience of the 
transplanting surgeon, which varies program -to-program and becomes even more important 
when lungs from unconventional or DCD donors are assessed. Ex vivo  assessment at the 
Sponsor’s dedicated EVLP facility can therefore add a level of consistency (and therefore safety) 
in lung assessment, removing inherent variability between centers and surgeons. The additional expertise provided by S ponsor’s specifically trained  EVLP Specialists  and Expert Medical 
Consultants  can help the transplant  surgeon make the most accurate judgment when  evaluating 
the risk profile of an EVLP lung as compared to the risk profile of a potential recipient. 
1.2.2.1 Increased Donor Lung Utilization  
Strategies which increase the use of lungs from currently available donors provide the best 
opportunity to meaningfully increase the availability of lungs for end stage patients currently waiting for transplantation. In 2012, there were 8144 eligible donors recorded in the US and a total of 1634 lung transplants, resulting in a donor utilization rate of 20.1% [SRTR 2012]. E VLP 
is anticipated to increase the number of donor lungs used for transplantation by both enabling additional evaluation and increasing preservation time. Based on the experience at TGH, the lung utilization rate from deceased donors has increased to 36% following the introduction of EVLP in the form of the TES (cf. section 1.1.1). In the event that these results were extended to the US, an additional 1298 lung transplants might be expected to result from the introduction of EVLP (for a total of 2932 transplants). Importantly, to achieve a similar increase in lung transplants by increasing the donor pool, 6458 additional donors would have to be identified, a 79% increase over the current pool. Despite targeted campaigns to increase public awareness of the im portance 
of organ donation, the annual number of donors has remained static. Thus, the low likelihood of 
significantly increasing the number of lungs available to patients with end -stage lung disease 
through currently available approaches argues that novel  technologies to increase donor lung 
utilization such as the TES are needed.

1.2.2.2 Shorter Recipient Waiting Times  
Because EVLP may  result in making more lungs  available for transplantation, an additional 
potential benefit to lung candidates listed  at a center participating in this study could be a 
shortened waiting time for a suitable donor (not typically evaluated by the center prior to EVLP) 
to become available.

This traditional feasibility study will generate preliminary safety and effectiveness information , 
evaluat ing th e TES  at a central facility for extended donor lung preservation . This information 
may be used to plan an appropriate future pivotal study , as part of efforts to inform further 
development.   
2.1 Primary Objective(s)   
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the short -term safety of subjects receiving a 
lung transplant , where the lung(s) was  perfused by the Sponsor using  the TES . Assessment of 
Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD ) Grade  3 at 72 hrs post -transplant ( T72) and 30- day mortality  
will represent the outcome measures , and t he primary endpoint s are the following two measures:  
• The proportion of recipients with PGD Grade  3 (PGD3) assessed at T72  
• 30-day mortality  post -transplant.  
 
The above information will also be collected on patients enrolled in a contemporaneous control 
group to provide context for EVLP results and to inform control measures for future research.  
2.2 Secondar y Objective(s)   
The secondary object ives of this study are to evaluate the short -term safety of subjects receiving 
a lung transplant where the lung(s) has been perfused via the TES performed by the Sponsor by  
assessment of the following:  
• PGD S core ( Grades 0 -3) measured at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post -transplant  
• Time to first extubation  
• Intensive care unit ( ICU) length of stay  (LOS) , measur ed as total number of days 
post-transplant in the ICU  until first hospital discharge, inclusive of ICU readmissions during 
that hospitalization   
• Hospital LOS  measured as total number of days in the h ospital prior to discharge 
post-transplant  
• Total preservation time (TPT) , defined as the elapsed time between first  allograft lung  
removal from cold storage time prior to transplant in the recipient and the donor aort ic cross 
clamp  time at procurement  
• Assessment of the overall safety of TES lung transplants during subject’s participation in the 
study, as reported through adverse events (AEs).  
 
The above information will also be collected on patients enrolled in a contemporaneous control 
group to provide context for EVLP results and to inform control measures for future research.

Additional objectives of this study include evaluation of intermediat e and long er-term safety and  
preliminary  efficacy in  subjects receiving a lung transplant where the lung(s) was  perfused using  
the TES performed by the Sponsor. Assessment s will include the following:  
• Initial ICU partial pressure of oxygen in arterial bloo d (PaO 2):  Evaluated as first PaO 2 
measured after ICU admission.  
• Forced Expiratory Volume  in one second (FEV 1) evaluated at time of discharge, 30 days, 90 
days, 6 m onths and 1 year post -transplant. FEV 1 is measured as a percentage of predicted 
normal value.  
• Oxygen requirement at rest evaluated at time of discharge, 30 days, 90 days, 6 m onths and 1 
year post -transplant. Oxygen required at rest is measured in liters per minute (L/min).  
• Subject  survival  evaluated at 90 days, 6 m onths , and 1 year post -transplant. Measured as 
living  or dead. If the subject  expires within first year post -transplant, the date of death and 
primary cause of death will be collected.  
• Graft s urvival  evaluated at 30 days, 90 days, 6 m onths , and 1 year post -transplant. Measured 
as functioning  or failed. If the graft fails within first year post -transplant, the date of graft 
failure will be collected.  
• Primary c ause of graft failure e valuated at 30 days, 90 days, 6 m onths , and 1 year post -
transplant on all  failed grafts.  
• Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) Grade  evaluated at 90 days, 6 m onths , and 1 year 
post-transplant.  
• Number of re -hospitalizations after transplant  evaluated at 6 m onths and 1 y ear 
post-transplant. Measured as total number of hospitalizations since initial discharge.  
• Physical c apacity  evaluated at 90 days, 6 months , and 1 y ear post -transplant.  
• Working for i ncome after transplant  evaluated at 90 days, 6 m onths , and 1 year

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is an unblinded, non- randomized, traditional feasibility study to evaluate the safety of 
subjects undergoing lung transplant using lungs after EVLP , performed exclusively by the 
Sponsor at the Sponsor’s facility using the TES . The study will include male and female adult 
lung transplant recipients , requiring a SLT  or DLT  who are  at least 18  years of age, and who are 
not receiving mechanical ventilat ion, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) or other 
Extracorporeal Life S upport (ECLS) at the time of the initial lung offer. Subjects who  have 
signed informed consent  (Section  10.4), match to a donor lung offer through the standard Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN ) allocation system, and meet the other 
eligibility criteria ( Section 4 ), including matching with and undergoing  a transplant with a Donor 
Lung , may participate. Patients who consent for this  study (PXU S 14-001) but receive a 
conventional (i.e., non- EVLP) lung transplant will be considered for a contemporaneous control 
group matched to the EVLP treatment group.  The control group will be selected to best match 
the EVLP group with respect to the following criteria:  SLT / DLT, and Lung Allocation Score 
Disease Diagnosis Group  (LASDDG ). LASDDG is assigned according to OPTN Policy 10.1.F.i. 
into one of four groups:  
• Group A:  Obstructive Lung Disease  
• Group B:  Pulmonary Vascular disease  
• Group C:  Cystic Fibrosi s or Immunodeficient Disorders  
• Group D:  Restrictive Lung Disease 
 
The goal is to provide a control group with similar characteristics and risk as the experimental group receiving EVLP. 
A sample size of 132 subjects , receiving either SLT or DLT,  is planned  for this study , where 
66 subjects have received donor lung(s) after EVLP (EVLP Group) and 66 subjects have 
received a conventional (i.e., non -EVLP) lung transplant and qualify for a contemporaneous 
control group (Control Group). Further, no more than two- thirds of the subjects enrolled 
(44 subjects per group) will have received a SLT or DLT.   
Acceptance or rejection of donor lungs for EVLP will follow the process outlined in Figure 2 and 
detailed in Section  3.1.1.

Once the donor lung is transplanted  following EVLP (see Section 5.2.3), the eligible recipien t, 
who has provided written informed c onsent, is enrolled into the study. Patients who consent for 
the current EVLP study  (PXUS 14 -001) but receive a conventional (i.e. , non- EVLP) lung 
transplant will be considered for a contemporaneous control group matched to the EVLP

Confidential  Page 24 of 89 The post -intervention phase of the study will then be split into two phases:  1) the Analysis 
Phase, which includes f ollow -up wi thin one year post -intervention  and 2) Long -term Follow -up, 
which will capture outcome data annually from 1-year post -intervention until 5 -years 
post-intervention. Although the study will continue after one year, t he database will be locked for 
analyses of endpoints  after the last subject has his/her study visit at 1 Year .  The Long- term 
Follow -up data will be summarized when the study has completed in supp ort of long -term 
evaluation .  
Analysis Phase  
Following  trans plantation, subject s will be admitted to the ICU, and the initial PaO 2 and PGD 
Score will be recorded. The subject ’s PGD Score will be recorded every 24 hrs for the next 
72 hrs. The ICU discharge date will be documented. Study visits will occur 30  days (±5), 90 days 
(±10), 6 months (±2 weeks), and 1 year (±4 weeks) post -transplant. Study assessments will be 
performed as outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1, Table 3).  
Long -term Follow -up 
Although the database will be locked and analyses  of endpoints  performed after the last subject 
has his/her study visit at 1 Year, the Sponsor will continue to collect specified outcome 
parameters that are required to be reported by transplant centers to OPTN/ United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Collection will be annually for 5 -years post -intervention; outcome 
collection is outlined in the Sched ule of Events ( Appendix 1, Table 4).  
3.1.1 Lung Collection and EVLP Procedure 
3.1.1.1 Lung Referral  
All donor lungs are allocated to transplant centers according to OPTN Policy 10.  Once an acute care hospital identifies a potential organ donor, at or near death, the regional OPO is contacted to coordinate the organ donation. The OPO enters specific donor demogra phics into a single 
national data base of all persons needing an organ transplant to generate a match run list of patients for each organ to be donated from deceased individuals.  In match run order, the OPO contacts a transplant center to offer the matched organ to a specific patient, and provides details of the donor’s medical history and other relevant information. The transplant center has one hour to accept the lung for the matched patient, otherwise the lung offer continues in match run sequence order for additional patients until a center accepts the lung(s), the match run list is exhausted or there are timing issues which may cause the OPO to suspend subsequent lung offers.  The lung acceptance by a center is based on a number of factors, but primari ly depends 
on the transplant center’s staff decision that a specific donor lung is suitable for the intended recipient. If the transplant center accepts, the lung is shipped to the transplant center for a standard of care transplant. 
If the transplant cent er is also a Study Center in this trial, they then have the ability to enroll a 
consented patient into this study.  The lung(s) is sent to the Study Center as normal, and if the 
designated recipient is also consented for this study, they may be eligible fo r enrollment in the 
control group.  This eligibility is based on meeting the overall study inclusion criteria, not

Confidential  Page 25 of 89 meeting any exclusion criteria, and matching to an already enrolled EVLP recipient at that Study 
Center based on the criteria found in Section 5.3. 
If the referred organ is not suitable for standard of care transplantation, and meets the inclusion 
criteria for the EVLP group in this study, and does not meet any of the exclusion  criteria, the 
Study Center may refer the lung(s) to the LB-1 facili ty for EVLP.  This decision is based on the 
protocol criteria as well as the medical expertise of the Study Center staff and the details of the particular case.  The Sponsor does not make recommendations for referring an organ to the LB- 1 
facility for perfusion. The Sponsor will, however, verify that the inclusion/exclusion criteria for referred lungs are followed by the Study Center prior to accepting lungs for EVLP.  The verification process will happen when the OPO contacts the Sponsor facility to notify  them that 
an organ has been referred for EVLP by a Study Center, and to discuss lung transportation logistics and other case details. If it is determined that an error has been made by the Study Center in determining study eligibility, the lung(s) will no t be sent to the Sponsor for EVLP.  
3.1.1.2 Lung Retrieval  
Upon retrieval, donor lungs will be packaged and transported to the Sponsor’s EVLP facility in Silver Spring, MD, according  to standard procedures, following  OPTN Policy  16. Upon arrival  
at the Sponsor’s facility , lungs will  be placed onto the TES  by a specifically -trained  Ex Vivo  
Lung Specialist.  Prior to starting perfusion, the duration of CIT -1 will be confirmed to be less 
than or equal to 10 hrs. 
The EVLP procedure will be performed b y Ex Vivo  Lung Specialists under remote v ideo 
supervision by one of Sponsor’s Expert M edical Consultants :  Drs. Keshavjee, Cypel, or 
Waddell. The Sponsor will perfuse the lung using the TES  for up to 6 hrs, collecting and relaying 
lung function assessment data hourly , or as requested by the Study Center transplant surgeon. 
Additionally, the Study Center surgeon will have access to remote monitoring capabilities at the 
Sponsor EVLP Center for evaluat ing lung function data and monitor ing the procedure through a 
dedicated audio/ video link. 
Perfusion Data Parameters  
EVLP begins once lung cannulation and extracorporeal perfusion circuit priming is complete. The EVLP procedure shall run for 3 to 6 hrs. At any time between 3 and 6  hrs of perfusion, the 
EVLP Specialist, in consultation with the Study Center transplant physician , and in collaboration 
with an Expert Medical Consultant, can stop the  procedure, at which time the lung will be 
packaged for the Study Center or the procedure will be stopped without transplantation. The following perfusion parameters will be collected for internal  monitoring every 10 min during the 
initial 1 -hr warm -up phase , then hourly thereafter:  
• Pulmonary arterial flow (P AF), L/min  
• Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), mmHg 
• Left atrial pressure (LAP), mmHg

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 26 of 89 PVR will be calculated using the following formula, b eginning at the first hour time point , then 
hourly for the duration of the EVLP : 
PVR ( dynes x sec x cm-5) = [PAP -LAP] x 80  / PAF  
and measured with a LAP set to 5 and at end of ventilator expiration.  
Ventilation Data Parameters  
Ventilation shall begin when  the lung temperature reaches 32°C measured from the temperature 
probe connected to the heat exchanger. Then, before e ach hourly oxygen challenge, the ventilator 
should be set at a tidal volume of 10  mL/kg (based on donor ideal body weight [IBW]) for 5 min 
at a fraction of inspired oxygen ( FiO 2) of 100% (1.0) prior to obtaining perfusate gas samples. 
After the perfusate g as sample has been collected, the ventilator tidal volume is set back to the 
maintenance settings of 7  mL/kg and FiO 2 of 21% (0.21). 
The following ventilation parameters will be measured and recorded hourly at the end of each 
oxygen challenge:  
• Mean, peak a nd plateau airway pressure (mAwP, PA wP, platAwP), cm  H2O 
• Static and dynamic compliance (mL/cm H 2O) 
• Perfusate gas analysis  at lung inflow and outflow:  PO 2, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 
(PCO 2), pH , glucose, and lactose. 
 
Other Data Parameters  
Bronchoscopy:   Bronchoscopy is performed with visual assessment observations recorded, 
including a description of secretions, at the one- , three -, and if necessary, five -hour marks of the 
EVLP procedure. A bronchoscopy may be performed following initial ve ntilation to clear the 
airways a s indicated. Additional bronchoscopies can be performed upon request by the Study 
Center physician or the Expert Medical Consultant . All bronchoscopic evaluations will be 
recorded digitally and transmitted to the Study Cente r Investigator for review . 
X-ray:  A digital radiograph of the lung is taken after the first , third, and fifth (if necessary) hour 
marks  to detect edema, consolidations, or other abnormalities; and the resulting image will be 
transmitted digitally to the S tudy Center Investigator and Expert Medical  Consultant  for review . 
3.1.1.3 Transfer of EVLP Data to the Study Center  
All lungs referred to and accepted by the S ponsor for EVLP must  have been previously allocated 
by an OPO to a Study Center recipient in compliance with OPTN Policy  10.   
Throughout the EVLP procedure, donor lung parameters are communicated by the EVLP Specialist for transplant suitability and evaluation by the Study Center I nvestigator, who will 
make the final determination of EVLP lung  transplant suitability , based on the same set of donor

assessment.  
3.1.1.4 Acceptance of EVLP Lung for Transplant  
The EVLP procedure must  run between 3 and  6 hrs to qualify the lung s for inclusion in to the 
study. The  Expert Medical Consultants , working with the Study Center surgeon/team will 
monitor and evaluate the quality of the perfusion procedure data remotely . Together, they will 
serve as a collaborative team regarding t he EVLP procedure , including the timing of the EVLP 
termination.  The Expert Medical  Consultant (s) will answer questions, provide guidance , and as 
requested offer perspectives based upon their considerable experience with EVLP and lung 
transplantation.  How ever, final decisions reside with the Study Center surgeon/team.  The 
Expert  Medical Consultants will not issue a recommendation regarding transplanting or not 
transplanting  the lung(s). Specifically, i f the donor lung meets EVLP study inclusion criteria 
(Section  5.2), the Study Center Investigator /team  will make the final determination of transplant 
suitability per OPTN Policy  5.7. Study Center Investigators will provide feedback on the utility 
of the da ta parameters assessed for determining transplant suitability via CRF. These data will be 
used solely to inform future study design.  
Upon acceptance of an EVLP donor lung by the Study Center, the single lung or lung block is cooled according to  TES  method ology  to 10°C. Thereafter, perfusion and ventilation are 
stopped.  
This point marks the start of CIT -2. The lung (s) is prepared for hypothermic storage by flushing 
with 500 mL cold (4°C) STEEN Solution, maintain ing lung  inflat ion (trachea is clamped). 
Accepted lung(s) will be repackaged by the Sponsor according to OPTN Policy  16, stored at 4°C 
in low potassium dextran cold storage solution  and transported to the Study Center using 
methods to minimize CIT- 2.  
Total preservation time (TPT) for the first lung transplanted from donor lung retrieval to end of 
CIT-2 must not be greater than a combined 2 2 hours and individual phase limits as follows:   
(≤ 10 hours CIT -1) +  (3 - 6 hours EVLP)  + (≤ 6 hours CIT -2) ≤  22 hours  
Total preservation time (TPT) for the second lung transplanted in DLT procedures from donor lung retrieval to end of CIT -2 must not be greater than a combined 2 6 hours and individual phase 
limits as follows:   
(≤ 10 hours CIT -1) +  (3 - 6 hours EVLP)  + (≤ 10 hours CIT -2) ≤  26 hours  
EVLP lungs that exceed 10  hrs of CIT -1, or are perfused for less than 3 hrs or more than 6 hrs  
will be discarded by the Sponsor according to the responsible OPO’s directions.  
First lung CIT -2 is the elapsed time between the end of the EVLP procedure and removal  of the 
first lung from cold storage , marking the beginning of the implantation phase of the transplant 
procedure. Th is CIT-2 may not exceed 6 hrs. Prior to shipping EVLP lungs to the Study Center, 
an estimated time of arrival at the Study Center will be c alculated by the EVLP Specialist in 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 28 of 89 consultation with the Study Center to ensure the criterion for CIT -2 will be met. Therefore, if the 
anticipated first lung CIT -2 will exceed 6  hrs due to logistical considerations (projected flight 
time and/or surgical s taff schedule, etc.), the lungs shall  not be transported to  the Study Center. 
Similarly, if after leaving the EVLP facility, prolonged transport time or patient logistical or 
other issues compromise the ability to ensure actual first lung CIT -2 is less than 6 hours, the  
transplant sh all not proceed.  
The implantation phase of the transplant procedure begins upon removal of the first lung from cold storage , marking the end of CIT -2. The warm ischemic time (WIT) period then begins, 
which lasts until the lung is reperfused in the recipient. This time period is expected to be no longer than the typical WIT at each Study Center for standard lung transplants.  
For DLT procedures, the second lung must remain in cold storage in low potassium dextran 
solution while the first lung implantation is being performed.  T he time of removal of the second 
lung from cold storage  after the first lung is implanted and the second lung WIT should be 
consistent with historical surgical experience for sequential DLT at each Study Ce nter. However, 
if the time between the start of CIT -2 and removal of the second lung from cold storage exceeds 
10 hrs, a protocol deviation shall be documented on a CRF and shall be reported to the Sponsor. The reason for the delay and an assessment of the second lung’s condition prior to transplant shall be recorded in the CRF. These subjects will continue enrollment in the study and will be followed in the EVLP Group.   
3.1.1.5 Request for Reallocation of Lungs After EVLP  
In the event the Study Center initially accepting , declines  the lungs during or after completion of 
the EVLP assessment,  where  the lungs meet the inclusion criteria,  the EVLP Specialist must 
contact the coordinating OPO (the “host” OPO) and provide the following information:  
• OPTN/UNOS  donor iden tification number ( ID#); 
• Name of the transplant Study Center and surgeon declining lungs after EVLP;  
• Reason the lungs were declined;  
• Names of all other Study Centers participating in the clinical trial;  
• Current status of the lung (s) (i.e., still on EVLP, p ackaged on ice, in transit); and  
• Contact information for the EVLP S pecialist on call for the specific case.  
 If the lungs meet the trial acceptance criteria (see Section  5.2.3), the Sponsor personnel will 
recommend the host OPO resume lung allocation according to their internal policies and procedures, reminding  the OPO  of the Study Centers participating in Study PXUS 14 -001, and 
stressing that the EVLP procedure is investigational, and potential recipients must have signed the EVLP trial informed consent prior to participating in any study -related assessments or 
procedures .   
In the event the host OPO is able to reallocate the lungs to another participating Study Center, the host OPO will contact the EVLP Specialist, who will then contact the i nterested physician 
(Study Center Investigator) to facilitate Case Management Exchange (CMX) access and

Confidential  Page 29 of 89 information exchange about th e case. The Investigator  at the reallocated Study Center will 
assume the role of the transplant center for the EVLP case and will accept or decline the lungs 
upon review of the EVLP assessment data and in consultation with the Expert Medical 
Consultant on cal l.  
In the event the host OPO cannot reallocate the lungs to a participating Study Center, the EVLP Specialist will discuss with the host OPO the option of contacting TGH to determine if there is a 
need at that facility. The decision to reallocate to TGH w ill rest solely with the host OPO and 
will be in accordance with their internal policies and procedures. The reallocation will be documented in CMX and on the EVLP facility’s CRF. In the event the lungs cannot be 
reallocated, they will be discarded accordi ng to the Sponsor’s procedures for handling 
biomedical waste.  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
As described in Section  1, EVLP is a novel technology that allows extended assessment of lungs 
whose suitabi lity for transplantation is initially uncertain.  The extended donor lung preservation 
time may also  enabl e better logistical coordination of the recipient and donor hospital transplant 
teams.  
This study is an unbli nded, non- randomized, traditional feasibil ity multi -center study to evaluate 
the safety of subjects undergoing lung transplant after EVLP , as performed by the S ponsor using 
the TES . This study was  built on the single -center experience including  >100 EVLP -treated lung 
transplants  at TGH , where  similar survival to the contemporaneous (non -EVLP) lung transplant 
recipient s was demonstrated .[ Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2011b; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012; Munshi 
2013; Cypel 2013] Importantly, the contribution of EVLP was associated with  a 36% increase in 
total lungs transplanted at TGH in 2013,[S  Kesha vjee, personal communication ] without 
negatively impacting transplant volumes at surrounding hospitals  [Tiwari  2014], supporting the 
notion that the adoption of EVLP technology resulted in transplantation of lungs that would have otherwise been discarded. [S Keshavjee, personal communication ; Munshi 2013] 
This study  proposal seeks to evaluate the feasibility  of reproducing the TES  at a central US 
facility  where  the d onor lungs require  an additional travel leg  (after concluding the EVLP 
procedure) compared to standard lung transplant ation. This second period of cold preservation 
will be evaluated by assessing safety measures  of subjects with lungs transplanted followin g 
EVLP  and comparing with subjects who have undergone a traditional lung transplant (i.e., 
contemporaneous control group). The p rimary safety endpoint s of PGD 3 at T72 and 30- day 
mortality ha ve been selected. PGD3 has been shown to be a good predictor of transplanted organ 
function, as it has a significant impact on short - and long- term recipient survival in DLT  [Suzuki 
2013], and 30- day mortality has been included as part of the primary endpoint, given the lesser 
degree of ce rtainty of the prognostic significance of PGD 3 in SLT  (see also Section  6.16). 
Randomization is not possible in this study , as lung transplant is co nsidered a life- saving 
procedure , and donors must match in size and blood type to potential recipients, so withholding a 
potentially -matched lung transplant is not ethical.  Patients not receiving an EVLP lung will be

will be selected to best match the EVLP group with respect to the following criteria:  
• SLT versus DLT  
• LASDDG 
 
In order to be considered for eligibility, the control patient must “match” a priori to an EVLP 
subject who has already been enrolled. Because the ratio of standard lung transplant to EVLP transplant is expected to be approximately 4: 1, it is feasible to obtain a control -EVLP match 
within the anticipated duration of the study.  
At the request of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), long- term post -intervention 
follow -up has been included to assess outcome parameters within the 5 years after either 
standard or EVLP lung transplant. 
3.3 Study Duration and Dates  
Data will be collected from the organ  donor, EVLP procedure  (if applicable) , and each subject 
from the time of lung transplantation and up to one year post -transplant  for the Analysis Phase. 
In addition, outcome data will be collected annually up to 5 years post -transplant.  
The study duration for the Analysis Phase  (from first patient, first visit [FPFV] to last patient, 
last visit [LPLV]  prior to database lock ) is expected to be 3 years. The estimated time to 
complete enrollment is approximately 24 months.

4.1 Study Population  
The study will be open to all eligible male and female patients, aged 18 years or older, with 
end-stage lung disease listed for lung transplantation at a participating S tudy Center . These 
participants may not be receiving mechanical  ventilation , ECMO or ECLS, at the time of initial 
lung offer prior to EVLP .  
Study Center s will offer the opportunity to participate in the study to its own listed recipients 
during time of listing  for transplant or during periodically scheduled patient v isits. It is expected 
that enrollment and recruitment activities between male and female recipients will approximate a similar gender mix compared to the Study Center’s general lung waitlist.  
A sample size of 132  subjects, receiving either SLT or DLT, is planned for this study, where 
66 subjects receive donor lung(s ) after EVLP (EVLP Group) and 66 subjects are enrolled in a 
contemporaneous control group (Control Group). No more than two- thirds of the subjects 
enrolled (44 subjects per group) will have recei ved a SLT or DLT.  
4.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Each patient  must meet the following criter ia to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male or female patients.  
2. All patients, 18 years of age or older. 
3. Patient already on or added to the active waiting list for a single or bilater al lung transplant.  
4. Patient or patient’s representative provides informed consent for participation in the study  
prior to participating in any study -related assessments or procedures . 
5. Patient or patient’s representative reconfirms informed consent for the study on the day of lung transplant  if initial consent is >  24 hrs . 
6. Patient matches with and undergoes a transplant with a donor l ung. 
 
4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Patient s who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:  
1. Patients listed for same -side lung re -transplantation.  
2. Patients listed for multiple- organ transplantation including lung and any other organ. 
3. Patients listed for live donor lobar transplant. 
4. Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active Hepatitis B or C, or  
Burkholderia c epacia  infection .

[Note: The decision to place the recipient on ECMO or other ECLS for post -transplant 
prophylaxis at time of or immediately prio r to transplant is not considered an exclusion] 
6. Patient receives a conventional (non -EVLP) lung transplant but does not match to an EVLP 
subject based on the criteria for control matching  outlined in Section 3.1.  
 
4.4 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
This study will be offered to eligible end -stage lung recipients at Study Centers . Recipients will 
not be compensated for participation, but it is p ossible that a subject  could receive an 
EVLP -treated lung transplant sooner than they would if they were waiting for a standard lung 
transplant.  EVLP lungs have also been more extensively physiologically assessed than a 
conventionally procured lung. 
Follow ing lung transplant, subject s require  routine follow -up visits for immunosuppression 
monitoring and infection control regimens. For this reason, it is unlikely that subjects will be lost 
to follow -up unless he/she withdraws consent to participate in the study  or changes the 
healthcare facility where he/she receives follow -up care .

5.1 Description of Intervention  
The TES  and has been used by the Toronto group for more than 225 clinical EVLP procedures 
(including at least 176 completed lung transplants). Nearly all of the hardware and disposables 
used in the TES  are 510(k)- cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for human 
clinical use, indicating appropriate and safe manufacturing procedures. The exception to this is 
the organ chamber and the lung cannulas, which are both made from medical -grade materials 
and are currently being used in clinical EVLP under th e Humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE) 
#H120003. There are two classifications of system components :  Non-Fluid Path Hardware and 
Single-Use Fluid Path Disposables. A schematic that represents each classification component in relation to the other is shown in Figure  3. 
 
Figure 3.  System Components of the Toronto EVLP System  
The Toronto Ex Vivo  Lung Perfusion System (“Toronto EVLP System”  or TES ) comprises a 
combination of FDA -approved, off- the-shelf hospital equipment, including: a centrifugal bypass 
pump, heater/cooler, ICU ventilator, and a disposable bypass perfusion circuit. In addition, the following non- FDA -approved single -use disposables are necessary:  disposable organ chamber, 
disposable lung cannulas, and the perfusate STEEN Solution.  
The proposed TES  indication  is for extending preservation and assessment of donor lungs using 
normothermic lung perfusion and ventilation in a controlled environment outside the body (ex vivo). The device is intended to be used to  perfuse lungs for male and female first -time, SLT  or 
DLT recipients, aged 18  years or older with end- stage lung disease, not requiring ECMO, ECLS, 
or ventilation at the time of initial organ referral  prior to EVLP .

established exclusively for the purpose of perfusing and ventilating lungs ex vivo . The T ES is 
NOT intended to be sold to any other entity nor used by an enti ty other than the Sponsor. 
Detailed description s of all system components currently in use can be found in Appendix 4.  
5.2 Lung Transplantation  
Donor lungs are evaluated to assess if they meet the donor lung inclusion criteria (Pre -EVLP; 
Section  5.2.1). If the donor lungs meet criteria, they proceed through EVLP. After EVLP, the 
donor lungs are again evaluated for transplant suitability and must meet the donor lung inclusion  
criteria (Post -EVLP; Section  5.2.3.1) in order to be transplanted into a subject who meets the 
recipient eligibility criteria.  
5.2.1 Donor Lung Inclusion Criteria (Pre-EVLP) 
Lungs are eligible for use in this study when an OPO documents that without EVLP, the lungs 
would not otherwise be used for transplantation. Data will be collected on the match run, includin g the recipients’ position on the list, the number of refusals prior to and after a study 
center’s acceptance, and the reason(s) for refusal. The OPO will also document the decision to either discontinue further standard allocation, or expedite allocation directly to a Study Center for EVLP if circumstances so dictate either approach to make the organ available for further evaluation and potential transplant via EVLP.  
Examples of such circumstances include:  
• Match run exhausted: Attempts to place the lungs via the match run sequence have yielded 
refusal responses to standard (non- EVLP) offers, and the OPO decides that the remaining 
allocation time supports the decision for EVLP;  
• Logistical challenges: The OPO  does not have time to perform a lung -specific match run; for 
example, if the overall organ donation process is being accelerated due to donor 
deterioration, limited OR availability, donor family request, procurement teams for other organs with recipient u rgency, other competing issues requiring donor surgery to be 
scheduled prior to lung placement, or allowing another procurement team to recover the lungs for an accepting center;  
• Donation after circulatory death (DCD): Refusal rates by transplant centers is high in these cases because evaluation of the donor lung function is limited, and donor expiry after withdrawal of care is unpredictable, often not occurring within the time limits established by the transplant centers or donor hospitals. Because of the se factors, many transplant centers do 
not entertain DCD offers at all, meaning that they would not normally be used for transplant;  
• OR decline: An unexpected suitability issue is identified at time of procurement resulting in 
the decision that the previou sly designated recipient is no longer appropriate; frequently this 
severely limits the available time for the OPO to reallocate the lungs; or

Confidential  Page 35 of 89 1. Recipient availability: After procurement has started, the original intended recipient is 
unable to receive the transplant, again, creating a critical timing challenge for the OPO to allocate the lungs to another recipient . 
 
5.2.2 Donor Lung Exclusion Criteria (Pre-EVLP)  
The donor lung is excluded from EVLP if at least one of the following criteria have been met:  
• The donor l ung has confirmed pneumonia and/or persistent purulent secretions identified via 
bronchoscopy  prior to donor lung excision.  
• Any purulent secretions not considered persistent identified in the donor lung  prior to 
excision that do not clear by the hour 3 as sessment  of EVLP.  
• The donor lung has confirmed evidence of aspiration.  
• The donor lung has significant mechanical lung injury or trauma . 
• The donor has HIV or an active infectious disease such as Hepatitis B or C.  
• The CIT, starting at donor aortic cross clam p/initial flush (CIT -1), required to transport the 
lung from the donor site to start of the EVLP procedure at the Sponsor’s facility was 
> 10 hrs . 
 
5.2.3 Donor Lung Criteria Post -EVLP Assessment  
Throughout each EVLP procedure, the donor lungs are evaluated for t ransplant suitability by the 
Study Center Investigator (i.e., transplant surgeon), in consultation with the Expert Medical 
Consultants . The Study Center Investigator will make the final determination of EVLP lung 
transplant suitability based on the same se t of donor lung and recipient risk profiles used to 
evaluate and accept organs during  standard in  vivo donor assessment.  
In addition to the real -time review of the EVLP procedure by at least two lung transplant 
physicians , the Sponsor will conduct post -EVLP quality reviews of case data to ensure policies 
and procedures are adhered to. 
5.2.3.1 Donor Lung Inclusion Criteria (Post -EVLP)  
The donor lung must meet each of the following conditions post -EVLP for transplant suitability 
consideration by the Study Center I nvestigator:  
• Partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood (P vO2)/FiO 2 ≥350 mmHg at final EVLP 
evaluation time period  
•  < 15% increase from baseline value (defined as the first hour collection point) to final value 
of PVR, 
• < 15% increase from baseline value to final value of P AwP, 
• < 15% decrease from baseline value to final value of static lung compliance (Cstat) , 
• TPT does not exceed the following:

- the estimated CIT -2 from EVLP cool down to the start of the implantation phase of the 
transplant procedure (time of removal of first lung from cold storage) must be ≤  6 hrs , 
- the estimated CIT- 2 from EVLP cool down to the time of removal of the second  lung 
from cold storage must be ≤  10 hrs,

5.3 Method of Assigning Patient s to Intervention 
A patient who is a potential candidate for this study may be approached by his/her treating 
physician regarding the patient’s interest and desire for study information. This may take place during a Screening Visit up to one year prior to transplant, or during the Baseline visit on the day of transplant. Refer to Section  10.4 for informed consent procedures. 
All patients who have provided informed cons ent to participate in this study will be screened and 
eligibility will be assessed according to applicable Inclusion (Section  4.2) and Exclusion Criteria 
(Section  4.3). Each Study Center will maintain a Screening Log where the applicable patient 
information will be captured, including their  LASDDG  and whether he/she is listed for SLT or 
DLT. Screening logs will be provided to the Sponsor on a regular basis so that patient matching criteria can be tracked . This will allow identification of potential control subjects as EVLP 
subjects become activ e in the study upon transplantation.  
When lungs are matched from donor to recipient, the Study Center will make the determination if the lung qualifies for EVLP or not (Section 5.2). Based on the outcome of that decision and then review of criteria of that lung, either a standard transplant takes place or the lung undergoes EVLP for transplantation.  
After at least one EVLP subject has been enrolled  at a Study Center , that site’s Investigators and 
their team will be notified that  a Control Group slot is available for their Study Center  based on 
the control  matching criteria (SLT / DLT and LASDDG ). Study Centers will be notified again 
once that Control  Group slot is filled at their site pending the next EVLP transplant. In this way, 
each Study Center will provide a matching Control Group subject for each EVLP Group subject enrolled at their site.  
Identification of potential control subjects will be done prospectively. Retrospective matching of 
control patients after standard lung transplantation is prohibited. Study enrollment commences upon lung transplantation, and enrollment will be tracked separately at each participating center 
by the clinical research organization (CRO), using site -specific identification and coding  
assigned per the CRF Instructions . Recipient data provided to the Sponsor or the CRO will 
include Subject ID#, but will not include patient -identifying information (name, social security  #, 
etc.).  
Each participating lung transplant center will maintain a screening and study participant log, recording whether the subject received an EVLP -treated or non- EVLP -treated lung transplant , as

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 37 of 89 well as SLT or DLT and LASDDG, with subsequent screenin g identification numbers, dates of 
informed consent, and transplant dates. 
In order that no more than two- thirds of the subjects enrolled (44 subjects per group) will have 
received either a SLT or DLT, Study Centers will be kept informed regarding the numbers and 
types of transplants that have taken place and if any one type of transplant (single or double) will 
be limited to enrollment as the proportion reaches two -thirds  in the overall study . 
Furthermore, to ensure the contemporaneous enrollment of Control Group subjects, Study Centers may not enroll more than three EVLP subjects prior to enrolling at least one matching control subject. In this way, at no time should a site have more than three enrolled EVLP subjects without matched control subjects. The Sponsor will notify any Study Center that reaches this three EVLP patient threshold to remind them that a control patient must be enrolled next.  
5.4 Blinding  
This study cannot be blinded to the intervention ( standard lung transplant  vs. EVLP ).  
5.5 Restrictions  
There are no protocol -specific restrictions with respect to fluid, food, prior or concurrent 
medications, or subject  activity during this study.  
5.6 Intervention and Study Procedure  Compliance  
Once a subject receives a lung transplant, he/she is subject to ro utine follow -up visits due to 
life-long requirements for immunosuppression monitoring and infection control regimens. For 
this reason, it is unlikely that subjects will be lost to follow -up unless he/she withdraws consent 
to participate in the study or changes the healthcare facility where he/she receives follow -up 
care.  
Refer to Section 10.9 regarding deviations from the study protocol. 
5.7 Packaging and Labeling 
Invest igational devices will contain the following label according to 21  Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) 812.5(a):  
“CAUTION -Investigational Device Limited by Federal (or US) Law to Investigational Use”  
5.8 Storage and Accountability  
The TES  is comprised of perfusi on cart hardware (centrifugal pump, heater/cooler, pressure 
monitor, ICU ventilator), fluid path and non- fluid path disposables (see  Appendix 4 ). 
Additionally, STEEN Solution is the acellular perfusate used during the EVLP procedure.

All study procedures post -transplant for subjects  enrolled in this study  will follow the Study  
Center’s standard of care . 
6.1 Donor and Donor Lung Information  
Data from the donor and donor lung that goes through EVLP will be captured by the EVLP 
Specialist on a donor/donor lung -specific CRF (termed the EVLP CRF).  
During the EVLP  lung evaluation, perfusate blood gas  will be collected by the EVLP Specialist 
hourly to assess PCO 2, PO 2 and pH both distally and proximally to the lung to assess the lung’s 
capacity to effectively exchange gas  (see Section 5.2.3 and Section 6.12).  
The Sponsor will collect the following donor information once a donor lung becomes available for EVLP:  
- Date of Birth  
- Gender  
- Ethnicity  
- Race  
- Weight  
- Height  
- Blood group  
- Date and Time of Death  
- Cause of Death  
- Mechanism of Death  
- Circumstances of Death  
- Donor type (donation after brain death [DBD ]/DCD)  
- Donor next of kin consent for research  
- Hospital information  
- PaO
2:FiO 2 
 For Control Subjects, donor information will not be re adily available to the Sponsor; therefore, 
the donor information listed above must be obtained by the Investigator (or designee) and forwarded to the Sponsor for data entry.  
6.2 Informed Consent  
The informed consent process is described in Section  10.4.  
6.3 Medical History  
Medical history  should be obtained by the S tudy Center for all patients as standard of practice.  
Subject (recipient) medical history of diseases or conditions ongoing in the year prior to the Screening Visit will be recorded. Medical history will be reviewed with the subject at the

Confidential  Page 40 of 89 Baseline (Day 0) visit, wi thin 24 hrs prior to transplant, to include  any updates since the 
Screening Visit.   
6.4 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed with the subject  at Baseline (Day  0; within 24 hrs of 
transplant), 30 days post -transplant, and 6 months post -transplant. Eligibility to participate i n the 
study will not be prohibited based on medication alone.  Concomitant medications will also be 
captured for the 2- week period prior to the onset of a serious adverse event (SAE).    
6.5 Physical Examination  
Physical examination (s) should be performed by th e Study Center for all patients as a standard of 
practice prior to listing patient for transplantation.   
A physical examination should be performed at the Baseline Visit . Symptom -directed p hysical 
examinations will be performed again at Day  30 and Month 6 post -transplant. Any values judged 
by the Investigator to be clinically significant abnormal changes from Baseline (before study 
intervention ) should also be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF as an AE.  
Specific tests to assess lung capacity will also be ob tained and recorded on the CRF.  Upon 
admission to the ICU, the subject’s initial PaO 2 is to be recorded.  
FEV 1, measured as a percentage of predicted normal value, and oxygen required at rest are to be 
recorded at the time of hospital discharge (if prior to 30 days post -transplant), Day  30, Day  90, 
Month 6, and Year  1 post -transplant , and premature discontinuation (if applicable).  
In addition, after completion of the Analysis Phase, FEV 1 and oxygen at re st will be collected 
annually by the Sponsor for the Long -term Follow -up Phase (Year 2, 3, 4, and 5). 
6.6 Vital Signs  
Assessment s of vital signs are to  be collected at each scheduled study visit . The following vital 
sign parameters should be recorded:  height (baseline only), weight, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation. 
Heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and oxy gen saturation will be measured after the 
subject has been seated at rest for at least 5 minutes. Systemic blood pressures may be obtained 
by cuff, and systemic arterial oxygen saturation may be obtained by pulse oximetry.  
6.7 Primary Graft Dysfunction Score  
The subject’s PGD Score is to be determined by the Investigator at Baseline (Day  0) after 
transplantation and upon admission to the ICU , as well as 24, 48, and 72 hrs 
post-transplant. [Christie 2005]  
PGD Score will be as grad ed using the parameters in Table 2, where the P/F ratio is PaO 2/FiO 2.

2 200-300 Diffuse allograft infiltrates  
3 <200  Diffuse allograft infiltrates  
 
If the subject is on ECMO at any time point, the PGD grade is automatically assessed as “3”.  
If the subject has been extubated prior to assessment , the presence or absence of radiographic 
infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema w ill be reviewed and graded as follows for the PGD 
Grade :   
• If subject is extubated AND the chest x -ray is “Absent” of infiltrates, then the PGD Score is 
0. 
• If subject is extubated AND the chest x- ray is “Present” of infiltrates, then the PGD Score is 
1. 
 Graft survival will be evaluated by the Investigator (or his/her designee)  at Day  30, Day  90, 
Month 6, Year 1 post -transplant, and premature termination (if applicable). Graft survival will be 
measured as functioning or failed. If the graft fails within first year post -transplant, the date of 
graft failure will be collected. The primary cause of graft failure will also be captured as one of the following:  
- Primary Non -Function 
- Acute Rejection  
- Chronic Rejection  
- or Other: (if Other, Specify)  
After completion of the Analysis Phase, Graft Survival will be evaluated and collected annually by the Sponsor for the Long- term Follow -up Phase (Year 2, 3, 4, and 5).  
6.8 Survival  
Subject survival, measured as living or dead, will be recorded Day  30, Day 90, Month  6, and 
Year  1 post -transplant. If the subject expires within first year post -transplant, the date of death 
and primary cause of death will be collected.  
After completion o f the Analysis Phase, subject survival will be collected annually by the 
Sponsor for the Long- term Follow -up Phase (Year 2, 3, 4, and 5).

6.12.1 Laboratory Parameters  
During the EVLP  lung evaluation, perfusate blood gas  will be collected by the EVLP Specialist 
hourly to assess PCO 2, PO 2 and pH both distally and proximally to the lung to assess the lung’s 
capacity to effectively exchange gas  (see Appendix 4, ABG Ana lyzer ). The S ponsor’s facility 
will test perfusate blood gas  samples using a Siemens RapidPoint 500 ABG analyzer . 
Subject (recipient post -transplant) arterial blood gases (A BGs) must be determined by the 
Investigator, in order to calculate PGD grade (Secti on 6.7), at Baseline (Day 0, within 24  hrs of 
transplan t), and 24, 48, and 72 hrs post -transplant . Laboratory results for tests performed as part 
of PGD scoring for this study  and will be recorded on the Primary Graft Dysfunction CRF with 
the date and the time the assessment  was performed.  
6.12.2 Sample Collection, Storage, and Shipping  
The Sponsor will collect pre - and post -EVLP donor lung biopsies for future analysis or quality 
assurance (QA), and/or if requested/ required by transplanting center. Additionally, perfusate 
samples will be collected from the EVLP perfusion circuit for QA and future analysis.  Samples 
will be identified by donor ID number. Consent for collecting and storing donor lung samples 
pre-transplantation for future research purposes will be obtained from the donor’s Legal Next of 
Kin (Section  10.4.1). 
6.13 Safety Reporting  
This study is designed to evaluate the safety of extending the preservation and assessment time of donor lungs using the TES  as administered by the Sponsor in a dedicated and c entralized 
facility. Subjects enrolled in this study suffer from end -stage lung failure where the only 
available treatment is lung transplantation.  
6.13.1 Definitions  
Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease or i njury , or any 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in a clinical investigation subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship  to the investigational medical 
device. All AEs are assessed by the Study Centers for severity, causality, outcome, seriousness, 
and if unanticipated, documented as such (see below) . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as a ny AE that results in any of 
the following outcomes: death, life- threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 44 of 89 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitali zation, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
Any serious adverse device effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death 
caused by or associated with a device, if that effect, pr oblem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that r elates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Anticipated  Adverse Events  not Related to EVLP  
Anticipated  Adverse Events not related to EVLP are events inherent to the lung transplant 
surgical procedure and immunosuppressant medications that are expected to occur throughout the initial post -hospital stay in all subjects .[Lyu 2009] These events do not require reporting  and 
are not considered AEs as defined or described elsewhere in this protocol . For the purposes of

Events Related to Study Endpoints 
Any adverse events  that are also defined within the primary and secondary endpoints do not 
require reporting as AEs since these are reported within the CRF. For example, PGD within the 
first 72 hrs or subject death does not require separate AE reporting from the Study Center since these events are captured via CRF.  However, if a subject death was the outcome of a fatal SAE, 
then that SAE should be captured on the CRF. Additionally, if an AE defined as a primary or 
secondary endpoint meets the UADE criteria, expedited reporting is  required.

Confidential  Page 47 of 89 6.13.2 Performing Adverse Events Assessments  or Recording of Adverse Events  
The Study Center staff will record and monitor all AEs throughout the Analysis Phase of the 
study  (1-year post -intervention) , from the time of transplanted lung reperfusion until the end of 
the subject’s study participation. At all study visits, reports of AEs will be elicited by  a verbal 
probe (“How are you feeling?”). Subjects will be encouraged to contact the Study Center to 
report an AE at any time. Appropriate measures, including medical intervention and/or procedures, will be instituted if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator.  
All AEs occurring during the study must be documented , and a ny AEs occurring during the first 
90 days post -transplant must be reported in the CRFs for AEs. For each AE, the Investigator will 
evaluate the severity  and seriousness, as well as the relationship  of the AE to the device and 
procedure . Information relating to the AE, such as onset and cessation date and times, 
seriousness, severity , relationship to device/procedure, action taken, and outcome will also be 
documented in the subject’s source documentation for assessment . Where possible, AEs should 
be recorded using standard medical terminology. If several signs or symptoms are clearly related 
to a medically defined diagnosis or syndrome, the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded, not the individual signs and symptoms.  
6.13.3 Timing  of Adverse Event Collection  
All AEs are collected from the time of  transplant ed lung reperfusion through subject 
participation duration (1 year post -operative). Reporting procedures are  described in 
Section  6.13.7. 
Subjects with AEs that are ongoing at the subject’s last Study Center visit must be followed until 
resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s last Study Center visit, whichever comes first. Adverse event s that are recorded during the 7 days following the subject’s last Study Center visit 
will b e followed until resolution or for up to the 30 days after the subject’s last Study Center 
visit, whichever comes first. All AEs that are ongoing after follow -up for 30 days ’ time will b e 
recorded as ongoing . The  Investigator is expected to provide or arrange appropriate supportive 
care for any subject with ongoing AE(s). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) should be followed until they resolve or the event or their 
sequelae stabilize. Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations may be necessary to 
investigate f ully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE. Such supplementary assessments 
may include additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other healthcare professionals. The subject’s source documents and CRFs for AEs should be updated with any new or additional information as appropriate.  
If the subject reports or the Investigator learns of any new SAE that occurs up to 30 days after 
the subject’s last clinical site visit, the clinical site personnel will ensure that these data are 
report ed on the AE CRF. 
6.13.4 Severity  
The Investigator will use  the following scale to grade the severity of any AEs:  
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 48 of 89 • Mild:  no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Moderate:  minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention ind icated; moderate impact on ADL  
• Severe:  significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical 
attention, needs major assistance with ADL 
 
6.13.5 Relationship 
The relationship of an AE to EVLP procedure and lung transplant  must be assessed by  the 
Investigator using the following guidelines:  
• Related :  The event is associated with the use of the investigational device or with 
procedures beyond a reasonable doubt   
• Possibly Related :  The relationship with the use of the investigational device or procedure is 
weak but cannot be ruled out completely; alternative causes are also possible.  
• Unlikely:  The relationship with the use of the investigational device or procedure seems not 
relevant and/or the event can be reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained. 
• Not related:   There is no temporal relationship between the investigational device or 
procedure and the event onset, an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
6.13.6 Expectedness  
The S ponsor, Independent Medical Monitor, and the Study P rincipal Investigator  will be 
responsible for determining whether an SAE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with t he 
risk information previously described for the intervention. Anticipated  adverse events not related 
to EVLP as listed in Section  6.13.1 are for purposes of this study considered to be “expected” 
events and do not require AE reporting. 
6.13.7 Reporting  Procedures  
The S ponsor will report all AE’s  occurring during the first 90 days post -transplant, and al l SAEs 
occurring during the one -year Analysis Phase of the study  to the FDA in the annual  
Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE) report. Each reported AE  will include date of onset , 
actions taken , severity , seriousness of the event , relationship of the event to the EVLP procedure 
or lung transplant , and the outcome of the event.  
6.13.7.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs , including subject deaths,  are reported to the CRO  within one  working day  after 
awareness  via the Adverse Event CRF. The Sponsor shall review  all SAEs to assess if related or 
anticipated. Any event that meets the serious criteria, is unanticipated, and related to the device 
system is reviewed by the  Sponsor Independe nt Medical Monitor and subject to expedited 
reporting to FDA and participating IRBs  in accordance with the Unanticipated Adverse Device 
Effect requirements  (21 CFR 812.150). The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representative will report any

Investigators within 10 business days following receipt of notice of the event(s).  
All other SAEs  for the Analysis Phase of the study will be reported to FDA in the annu al IDE 
report. 
In addition to the above, i t is the responsibility of the Study Investigator to abide by the AE 
reporting requirements stipulated by the IRB.  
6.13.7.2 Reporting Procedure for Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE meeting the specified SAE criteria will be submitted on an AE CRF  to the CRO. This 
report may be sent by fax or email. Once submitted, the CRO will send a confirmation email to 
the Investigator within one business day. The Investigator should contac t the CRO if this 
confirmation is not received. This process applies to both initial and follow -up SAE reports. 
SAE Reporting Contact Information:    
Safety Fax Line (US):   1-800-673-7523 
Product Safety Email:   ctisafety@ctifacts.com 
General questions ab out SAE reporting can be directed to the Safety Help Line (available 
8:00AM – 5:00PM Eastern Time):  1-800- 755-0742 
The Study Investigator will complete an AE CRF with fax cover sheet found in the study manual  
and submit via fax or email within the followi ng timelines:   
• All SAEs , including deaths, regardless of relationship, will be reported by fax or email within 
24 hrs of site awareness.  
• All SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
 
6.13.8 Initial Safety Review  
The Sponsor will temporarily paus e the study after the twentieth (#20)  subject  has been enrolled 
to allow time for the FDA to review safety data on the first 10 EVLP subjects and any control 
subjects enrolled who ha ve reached 90- days post -transplant.  
Data from the first 10 subjects through their 90- day visit will be submitted  to FDA  as an IDE 
Supplement for review . Submitted data will  include graft survival, aggregate PGD scores, FEV 1, 
oxygen required at rest, and BOS Grade. The study will be on hold during this review  with the 
exception of Subjects 11 through 20 who are “ongoing”; these subjects will continue to come to the Study Center as specified in the protocol . Upon satisfactory review, the FDA will permit the 
continuation of the study to the full subject enrollment. If the FDA has c oncerns, the Sponsor 
will address these in a satisfactory manner.

Confidential  Page 50 of 89 6.13.9 Halting Rules  
The S ponsor shall implement an immediate enrollment pause if there is  any of the following:   
• a third subject  death within the first 30 days post - transplant ; 
• if the PGD3 rate at T 72 ≥ 50% in the first 10 subjects ; or  
• the M edical M onitor shall review all UADEs and deaths in the study and will make a 
determination if an unreasonable risk to subjects  exist. If an unreasonable risk has been 
determined based on the  opinion of the M edical M onitor, the trial, or the parts that cause the 
risk, shall be stopped until an alternate solution can be devised by the S ponsor and accepted 
by each IRB and FDA.  
 
6.14 Removal of Subject s from the Study  
Subjects may withdraw voluntarily  from the study or the I nvestigator may terminate a subject's 
participation. Withdrawing from the study will not affect subject’s status/ability to receive a 
standard lung transplant. 
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any tim e upon request. 
The I nvestigator may withdraw a subject  from the study  for any reason, including but not limited 
to, the following:  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such 
that continued participation in  the study would not be in the best interest of the subject.  
• The subject meets an exclusion criterion (either newly -developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation.  
• A protocol violation occurs.  
• The S ponsor or I nvestigato r terminates the study.  
 
It is unlikely that a subject will discontinue study participation after receiving a lung transplant , 
as a lifetime of required follow -up, immunosuppression monitoring , and infection control is 
required after transplantation to min imize the chance of graft failure and/or death. Every effort 
will be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures to capture AEs, SAEs, 
and UADE s.   
6.15 Premature Termination o r Suspension of the Study  
This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to Study Investigators, the  IDE Sponsor, and all 
regul atory authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal 
Investigator will promptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.

Confidential  Page 51 of 89 Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are n ot limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable.  
• Determination of futility.  
 
6.16 Appropriateness of Measurements  
PGD 3 at T72  and 30- day mortality  are the primary safety endpoint s measured for subjects in this 
study (Section  2.1).  
PGD3 has been shown in the liter ature to be a very good predictor of transplanted organ function 
as it has a significant impact on short - and long- term recipient survival including:  
• PGD3 at T72 demonstrated a significantly higher risk of 30- day mortality, accounting for 
50% of all -cause deaths compared to PGD0 at T72.  
• PGD3 at T72 is associated with an increased 90 -day mortality rate of 18% and an increased 
1-year mortality rate of 23%.  
• PGD3 at T72 has the strongest association with long -term mortality compared to PGD scores 
at other time points post -transplant even after 1 year. [Suzuki 2013]  
 
 Over  100 lung transplants using lungs after undergoing EVLP  at TGH and show ed similar 
30-day, 1 -year, and 3-year survival outcomes compared to the contemporaneous (non -EVLP) 
recipient populations.[ Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2011b; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012; Munshi 2013; 
Cypel 2013] Similarly, in this study, short -term and long -term survival will be documented for 
all subject s.  
While the prognostic value of PGD grading in DLT has gained clinical acceptance, the experience with PGD scores in SLT is more limited. In DLT, the measurement of oxygenation reflects the contribution of both transplanted lungs. In contrast, measured oxygenation reflects contributions from both a diseased, native lung and a transplanted graft when only a single lung is transplanted. The Lung Transplant Outcomes Group found the SLT itself was a risk factor for adverse PGD scores and was associated with worse long -term outcomes [Diamond 2013], 
although the reasons for this association are not understood. Thus , to address the lack of clinical 
clarity, the measurement of 30 -day mortality is included as a co -primary endpoint, and is 
intended to account for the uncertainty provided by PGD scoring of SLT. Both co- primary 
endpoints will be considered t o inform on prediction of long -term survival in SLT recipients. 
The contemporaneous control group will be used to provide context for interpreting these results.

Confidential  Page 57 of 89 8 QUALITY CON TROL AND ASSURANCE  
Quality Management is the overall process of establishing and ensuring the quality of processes, 
data, and documentation associated with clinical research activities. It encompasses both quality control (QC), and QA activities. All sites  conducting research under the sponsorship of the 
Spons or are required to have a plan in place for assuring the quality of the research being 
conducted.  
Each site should have standard operating procedures (SOPs) and/or a quality management plan that descr ibe:   
• How data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and for accuracy in relation to source documents.  
• The documents to be reviewed (e.g., CRFs, clinic notes), who is responsible, and the frequency for reviews.   
• Who will be responsible for addressing QA issues (correcting procedures that are not in 
compliance with protocol) and QC issues (correcting errors in data entry).  
• Staff training methods and how such training will be tracked.  
• If applicable, calibration exercises conducted prior to an d during the study to train examiners 
and maintain acceptable intra-  and inter- examiner agreement.  
 
8.1 Sponsor’s Quality Process  
The Sponsor will conduct the EVLP lung assessment procedure exclusively at the Sponsor’s dedicated facility. All post -EVLP procedu res will be reviewed by an in -house QA manager for 
compliance with the TES User Manual and clinical trial protocol, as well as for accuracy in 
relation to source documents. 
In addition, the Sponsor will use an independent CRO to oversee its activities. Fin ally, 
Independent Medical Monitors  will review all UADE to verify if they are related to the EVLP 
procedure, the lung transplantation, or other controllable/ uncontrollable event  (Section  10.8). 
8.2 Training for Study Interventionalists  
Training will be completed prior to participation in the clinical trial as outlined in the follow ing 
sections.  
8.2.1 Transplant Center Research Personnel  
Study Center site personnel will be trained on study activities, provided a review of Good 
Clinical Practice ( GCP ), obtaining informed consent, and the study protocol.

8.2.3 Lung Transplant Surgeons  
All Study Center I nvestigators will be experienced practitioners of lung transplantation. Current 
licensure will be maintained in the study records for each participating surgeon.  
8.2.4 EVLP Specialists  
Ex Vivo  Lung Specialists , specifically trained  to perform EVLP by University Health Network in 
Toronto, Canada, will perform all EVLP procedures exclusively at the Sponsor’s dedicated site 
in Silver Spring, MD. Each donor lung, meeting study Inclusion Criteria (Section 5.2 ) and 
offered to the Sponsor by a participating transplant center, will be perfused normothermically b y 
the EVLS for up to 6 hours according to the procedures described in the TES User Manual.  
All EVLP Specialists performing procedures at the Sponsor’s site will have extensive training in the TES  through a 6- month in- residence program at TGH, culminating i n successful completion 
of the Ex Vivo  Lung Specialist Certification and Privileging Exam administered through 
University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario. This training program is the first of its kind, and the most comprehensive for the newly emerging fi eld of EVLP.  
The didactic portion of the EVLS training includes lectures and self -guided reading of applicable 
medical literature in the following areas:  
a. Lung transplantation - history and overview  
b. Lung allograft donation and procurement  
c. Legislative framewo rk 
d. Lung anatomy and physiology 
e. Perfusion concepts  
f. Ventilation strategies  
g. TES 
 The practical, hands -on experience includes observing a minimum of five research (animal) 
EVLP procedures and actively participating in at least 25  research EVLP procedures. 
Addi tionally, a minimum of five clinical (human) EVLP procedures will be observed and at least 
five more clinical cases will be performed with active participation, of which three must be transplanted at the end of the procedure.  
The final exam includes writt en, oral and practical assessments while independently performing 
a 12- hour long research procedure using the TES  to perfuse bilateral swine lungs while being 
evaluated by a preceptor for the following skills:  
a. Cannulation of the pulmonary artery and left a trium without leaks.

Confidential  Page 60 of 89 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL  METHODS  
9.1 General Consideration s 
This section describes the planned statisti cal analyses in general terms. A complete description of 
the methodology will be specified in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized 
prior to database lock. Any changes in the statistical met hods described in this protocol that 
occur prior to database lock will be documented in the statistical analysis plan and will not require a protocol amendment.  
Statistical analysis will be performed primarily on data collected during the Analysis Phase (1-year post -intervention ). The database will be locked for analysis of endpoints after the last 
subject completes his/her study visit at Year 1, and all queries have been resolved. The Long -term Follow -up data will be summarized when the study has completed  in support of long -
term evaluation.   
No statistical hypotheses will be tested in this study. For ease of presentation, contextual review and statistical programming, the descriptive statistics of the contemporaneous Control group will be presented with t hose of the EVLP group. Descriptive statistics will be presented as means, 
standard deviations (SD), medians, and ranges for the continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Tabulations will be used to summarize result s from 
descriptive summaries and statistical analyses. A one-sided 95.0% CI  will be provided, as 
appropriate, for the primary endpoints, and two sided 95.0% CI  will be presented for all 
endpoints , as appropriate . 
9.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
In order to provide a sufficient number of subjects for reliable estimation of the primary endpoints, sample size was calculated based on a primary endpoint of PGD3 at T 72. Estimates of 
PGD3 at T 72 were based on historical data from EVLP transplant studies where EVLP su bjects 
had rates of PGD3 at T72  ranging from 0% to 15% and conventional transplant subjects ranging 
from 16.8% to 30% [XVIXO Perfusion Inc. 2014; Cypel  2012; Cypel  2011a ; Machuca 2014; 
Aigner  2012; Diamond  2013]. Assuming a PGD3 at T72 of 10% and a one -sided 95.0% 
confidence interval (CI) for a single proportion using the large sample normal approximation adjusted for a finite population of size 2057 (number of lung transplants performed in the US in 2015 [OPTN  2015]), 66 subjects will be needed for the expected upp er bound of the CI  to not 
exceed a rate of 16% (nQuery Advisor 7.0, 2007). A tot al of 66 EVLP subjects and 66 Control 
subjects will be included in this study.  
Rates of 30- day mortality in the EVLP transplant studies have been low, ranging from 3% to 4%. 
For a sample size of 6 6, the  probability of observing at least on e event will be approximately 
87% to 93% if the true probability of 30 -day mortality is 3% to  4% (nQ uery Advisor 7.0, 2007). 
Subjects will be entered into the study as EVLP transplants occur; however, enrollment to either  
transplant subtype (single -lung, double -lung) will be limited to 44  subjects to provide a 
reasonable number of subjects of both subtypes for subgroup examinations.

Confidential  Page 61 of 89 A contemporaneous Control group will be entered into this study. This Control group will 
provide context of the EVLP results and estimation of Control group parameters for design of future studies. All analyses of the Control group will be descriptive and no formal statistical comparison will be made between the EVLP and Control groups. As such,  the sample size for  
the Control group will be 66 subjects , and subjects will be matched to the EVLP Group for 
similarity . Because the ratio of standard lung transplant to EVLP transplant is estimated to be 
approximately 4:1 , it is feasible to obtain a con trol-EVLP match within the anticipated duration 
of the study. 
9.3 Analysis Populations  
All subject included in the analyses to the extent data are available. Planned  exceptions will be 
noted in the SAP.  
Deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria will be listed  by subject . 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic  data  and baseline characteristi cs for all subjects collected prior to transplant will be 
listed and summarized overall , by Transplant Group (EVLP or Control), as well as  by transplant  
subtype (SLT or DLT) using descriptive statistics.  
Medical history (medical conditions ending prior to EVLP transplant) will be coded using the 
WHO -drug dictionary, presented as a listing and summarized overall and by transplant subtype 
using the system organ class (SOC). 
9.5 Primary Endpoint(s)  
9.5.1 Primary Graft Dysfunction Grade 3 at 72 hours Post-transplant  
The PGD 3 Score  at 72 hrs post -transplant (T72), as defined in Section  6.7, will be used as the 
basis for the primary safety endpoint for analysis . The primary endpoint (PGD3 T72) will be 
calculated from PGD T72 as follows:  PGD T72  = {0, 1, & 2} will be coded to PG D3 T72 =  0 
and PGD T72 =  {3} will be coded to PGD3 T72 =  1. 
If a subject dies prior to the T72 measurement,  they will be coded to PGD3 T72  = 1. If the T72 
value is missing (not collected, not reported, not properly documented), then PGD3 will be coded to P GD3 T72 =  1 for the primary safety analysis.   
 
The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects  with PGD3 T72  by 
Transplant Group (EVLP and Control). A one -sided 95% CI will be calculated around the 
proportion. A two -sided 95% CI wil l also be calculated . 
There will be no inferential testing conducted.

Confidential  Page 62 of 89 9.5.2 30-Day Mortality  
Subject survival, measured as living or dead, will be recorded for Day 30, Month 6, and Year 1 
post-transplant (see Section  6.8). The primary endpoint of 30-Day m ortality will be derived as 
follows:  Living at Day 30 will be coded to 0, and Dead before or on Day 30 will be coded to 1. 
If the vital status of the subject is missing ( not collected, not reported, not properly documented), 
then 30- Day Mortality will remain missing for the primary analysis.  
The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects with 30 -Day mortality , 
summarized by Transplant Group. A one -sided 95% CI will be calculated around the proportion. 
A two -sided 95% CI will also be calculated.  
Other supportive endpoints may be provided to supplement the primary analysis, including, but not limited to, median number of days to death and primary cause of death.  
Results may be displayed graphically. There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
9.6 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Secondary endpoints included the following:  
• PGD Score (Grades 0 -3) measured at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post -transplant  
• Time to first extubation  
• ICU LOS, measured as total number of days post -transplant in the ICU  until first hospital 
discharge, inclusive of ICU readmissions during that hospitalization   
• Hospital LOS, measured as total number of days in the hospital prior to discharge 
post-transplant

transplant on all failed grafts.  
• Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) Grade:  Evaluated at 90 days 6 months and 1 year 
post-transplant.  
• Number of Re -hospitalizations after Transplant:  Evaluat ed at 6 months and 1 year 
post-transplant. Measured as total number of hospitalizations since initial discharge.  
• Physi cal Capacity:  Evaluated at 90 days, 6 months and 1 year post -transplant.  
• Working for Income after Transplant:  Evaluated at 90 days, 6 months and 1 year post -
transplant.   
 
All exploratory endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics along wi th two sided 95% 
CIs by Transplant Group. Other supportive endpoints may be included as needed.  
Results may be displayed graphically. There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
In addition, supplemental  analyses comparing the EVLP group and the Cont rol Group may  be 
performed to provide context of results observed in this study (details will be described in  the 
SAP).  
9.8 Missing Data  
The primary safety analysis is the proportion of subjects with a PDG3 at T7 2. PGD is measured 
in all lung transplant subjects at specific intervals following transplantation, including 24, 48, 
and 72 hrs. Protocol training will focus on the importance of obtaining PGD at T72 in every study subject.   
If a subject dies prior to the T72 measurement, they will be counted as a “failure” and classified 
as PGD3 for the primary safety analysis. If the T72 value is missing (not collected, not reported, not properly documented), then PGD3 will be assumed (“failure”), and they will be classified as such for the primary safety analysis.

9.9.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study, but only thos e occurring within the first 
90 days post -transplant will be reported to the Sponsor, unless they are c onsidered SAEs . All 
SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor throughout the Analysis Phase . Adverse 
events and medical conditions will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary. Intervention -emergent AEs will be defined as those 
events, which are newly occurring or worsening from Baseline (Day  0). In all cases only 
intervention -emergent AEs will be summarized.  
Intervention -emergent AEs will b e summarized by Transplant Group as the number and 
percentage of subject s having any intervention -emergent AE, having an AE in each body system, 
and having each individual AE. Adverse events will further be categorized by severity, relationship to study intervention , and action taken. Other information collected will be listed , as 
appropriate.  
9.9.2 Physical Examination  and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations will be performed as described in Section  6.5, and vital signs will b e 
recorded as described in Section  6.6. 
Vital sign data will be listed for each subject. Clinically sig nificant values will be flagged . 
Any clinically significant abnormality prior to enrollment is to be recorded as medical history, and tabulation of those events will occur within medical history summaries. Any clinically significant abnormal change from baseline post -transplant is to be r ecorded as an AE and 
tabulation of those events will occur within AE summaries.  
9.9.3 Laboratory Data 
Laboratory data will be collected as described in Section  6.12.  
Laboratory data will be listed for each subject. Laboratory data will be summarized for overall  
and Transplant Group by presenting the proportions of subjects with clinically significant 
abnormalities; shift tables, baseline to most extreme p ost-baseline value, using normal ranges; 
summary statistics of raw data and change from baseline values (means, medians, standard 
deviations, ranges), as appropriate. 
9.10 Interim Analysis  
There are no formal interim analyses planned for this study. However, as  described in 
Section  6.13.8, the Sponsor will temporaril y pause the study at EVLP subject  #20 to allow time 
for the FDA to review safety data on th e first 10 subjects enrolled who reach 90 days 
post-transplant.

10 ADMINISTRATIVE CONSI DERATIONS  
10.1 Investigators and Study Administrative Structure  
The term “Investigator” as used in this protocol and in the CRFs refers to the Principal Investigator at each study site, or an other staff member listed as a s ubinvestigator on the study 
site delegation log . The site Principal Investigator is ultimately responsible for the conduct of all 
aspects of the study at that site. The site Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring 
that all site staff working on the study are appropriately trained and supervised; staff training and delegation of responsibilities should be documented in the files.   
Prior to site activat ion, the Investigator must read, understand, and sign the Investigator 
Agreement in the protocol. The Investigator Agreement documents agreement to conduct the 
study according to the protocol, International Conference on Harmonization / Good Clinical Pract ice (ICH/GCP), and Code of Federal Regulat ions (CFR). Additional requirements must be 
met by the Investigator and institution, as described below.  
10.2 Institutional Review Board  (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
Approval  
The protocol, informed consen t form (s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be 
submitted to each participating study site’s local IRB for review and approval. In addition, the Sponsor will operate its EVLP site under the review of an independent third party IRB  
(Appendix 2).  
Approval of both the protocol and the ICF must be obtained before any subject is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented in the study.   
Each IRB must operate in compliance with 21  CFR  56, including being registered with the FDA. 
The IRB is to provide some form of documentation of compliance via a Statement of Compliance and/or a  Federal Wide Assurance Number. If any member of the research team is a 
member of the IRB, written documentation is required that he/she did not vote or participate in the approval process  
10.3 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The I nvestigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set 
forth in The Belmont Report:  Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, as drafted by the US National Commission for t he Protection of Human 
Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR  Part 46 and/or the ICH  E6; 62 Federal Regulations 25691 (1997).

Confidential  Page 66 of 89 10.4 Authorization and Consent  
10.4.1 Donor Next of Kin Authorization  
Authorization for organ donation will be obtained by the federally -designated OPO in 
accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act in the state of the donor 
hospital and in compliance with OPTN Policy  2. The OPO also must comply with its internal 
policy regarding donor (or donor family) authorization for additional lung assessment using 
EVLP.  
10.4.2 Subject (Recipient) Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout study participation. Subjects listed for single or bilateral lung 
transplantation with UNOS may be offered the option to participate in this  study. A legal 
authorized representative may be used to consent for a subject that is unable to sign/ consent for them selves. The Study Center must adhere to IRB and State law requirements as to who is an 
acceptable Legal Authorized Representative. The Study Center will also obtain documentation that person signing consent is authorized to do so. 
Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of study participation will be provided to 
subjects and their families. A consent form describing in detail the study procedures and risks will be given to the subject. Each participating S tudy Center  will be provided with a model 
informed consent form (ICF ). Each institution may revise or add information to comply with 
institution consent templates, but may not remove procedural or risk content from the model form. Consent forms will be IRB- approved, and the subject is required t o read and review the 
document or have the document read to him or her. The I nvestigator or designee will explain the 
research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise.  
The subject will sign the ICF  prior to any study -related assessmen ts or procedures. Study -related 
assessments are defined as any study activities in which data are specifically collected from a potential subject that could later be used for analysis under this protocol. Pre- screening of 
potential subjects based on previo usly known medical histories or other information is not 
considered a study -related assessment. Study -related procedures are any medical procedures 
performed to screen or prepare a subject for lung transplantation under this protocol. Screening 
or other procedures performed for the purposes of general lung transplantation suitability or 
compatibility are not considered study -related procedures.  
If consent is obtained the same day that the subject begins study -related assessments or 
procedures, the subject’s  medical record should document that consent was obtained prior to 
these activities . Subjects will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates 
or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The consent may be signed during an extended 
period of time prior to the transplant. This extended period timeframe shall be determined by the 
local IRB in reference to the timeframe before a subject is re- consenting versus reaffirming the 
original consent. The consent obtained prior to the day of transplant shall be reconfirmed at day of transplant by subject or subject’s legal representative. This shall be documented in the source

Confidential  Page 67 of 89 document by the site staff and will not involve the resigning of the consent unless requested by 
the IRB. A subj ect may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study.  
A copy of the signed ICF will be given to subjects for their records. The rights and welfare of the 
subjects will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their clinic al care will not 
be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
The consent process will be documented in the clinical or research record.  
A subject is only considered enrolled in the study when he/she has signed the ICF and, at an approved Study Center, is transplanted with a donor lung. 
10.5 Subject  Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the I nvestigators, study staff, and the Sponsor 
and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biolo gical samples and 
genetic tests in addition to any study information relating to subjects.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the Sponsor may inspect all study 
documents and records required to be maintained by the Investigator, inclu ding but not limited 
to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for the study subjects. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
Donor records will be redacted for any identifying donor information and instead will only use a pre-assigned UNOS Donor ID# to connect donor to recipient. The Sponsor will use the UNOS 
ID# to request baseline donor, 6-  and 12- month recipient post -transplant reports from 
OPTN/ SRTR to maintain recipient privacy.  
10.6 Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored  according to the guidelines summarized below. The S ponsor may 
choose to perform random inspections throughout the study as an element of quality assurance. Investigators shall allow auditing of their clinical investigation procedures and data.  
Data will b e collected from EVLP lung transplant recipients and the non -EVLP lung transplant 
recipients included in the Control Cohort . These data will include basic lung transplant 
information along with primary and secondary endpoints as listed in this protocol.  
The monitor(s) will visit the site soon after the first subject  is enrolled to assist in any questions 
the site might have concerning the study or CRF  completion . Monitoring visits will occur based 
on number of subjects enrolled at a Study Center, duration of the study, level of compliance or a significant change in compliance, or a change in Study Center  staff.

The I nvestigator is required to permit monitoring and study record access in order for the 
monitors to perform their responsibility. The I nvestigator(s), co -investigator(s), and other study 
staff must be available during onsite visits by the study monitor. The S ponsor may choose to 
perform random inspections throughout the study as an element of QA . Investigators shall allow 
auditing of their clinical investigation procedures.  
10.6.2 Summary of Monitoring Procedures & Responsibilities  
It is the responsibility of the st udy S ponsor to ensure that proper monitoring of the investigations 
is conducted and that IRB review and approval of the investigation is obtained. Monitoring visits 
will occur based on transplant volume at the center or at least annually. Trained personnel  or 
delegates appointed by the study S ponsor will perform study monitoring in order to ensure that 
the investigation is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with: the aforementioned agreements, plans, and regulations. The S ponsor (or designee) m ust be allowed access to the 
subjects’ files as per the informed consent at the investigator’s site when so requested.  
10.6.3 Routine Monitoring  
The following factors will be taken into account when determining the frequency of the monitoring visits: subject accr ual rate at each center, total number of subjects enrolled at each 
center, protocol violations, risk -based assessments for the primary and secondary endpoints and 
study protocol  compliance at each center. Monitors will require direct access to subject medi cal 
records pertinent to the study (and study inclusion criteria), study management documents, regulatory documents and Subject Informed Consent documents, as well as other potential applicable records not listed here.  
Monitors may ensure the Study  Investi gators maintain staff and facilities to conduct the clinical 
investigation safely and effectively. Monitors may conduct the following monitoring activities throughout the study:  
• Verification that the current IRB -approved informed consent was signed and dat ed by each 
subject.

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 69 of 89 • Verification of documentation in the subject’s record that informed consent was signed prior 
to participating in any  study -related  assessments or procedures and that a copy of the signed 
and dated consent form was provided to the subjec t. 
• Source documentation verification by reviewing the CRFs against source documentation for 
accuracy and completeness of information.  
• Verification that subjects and donor lung met study enrollment criteria.  
• Confirmation that the study is being conducted ac cording to the study protocol  and 
applicable regulations.  
• Verification that study deviations are documented and reported.  
• Verification that the procedures for recording and reporting adverse events to the S ponsor are 
followed. 
• Ensuring proper error correct ion. 
• Verification of training documentation of all study personnel participating in study related 
activities.  
• Reviewing all correspondence and regulatory documents, including confirmation of 
IRB-approved study protocol  or amendments. 
• Resolution of outstanding issues and completion of assigned tasks will be documented by the monitors. 
 
10.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
Case report forms (CRFs) are used to transmit the information collected in the performance of this study to the Sponsor (or its designee) a nd to governmental agencies. CRFs must be 
completed for each subject enrolled. This study may use paper  or electronic CRFs. All  paper 
CRFs must be legible and completed in black ball point ink. Data entries for paper CRFs may be 
corrected only by drawing a  single line through the incorrect entry and writing in the correct 
entry. Incorrect entries are not to be obliterated by blacking out or use of correction fluid or erasers. All corrections must be initialed and dated.  Systems for electronic CRFs will be p roperly 
designed, validated, and implemented prior to use.   
A selected number of donor and subject variables are required data collected by the transplant center via the OPTN and UNOS. A data sharing agreement may be developed with the OPTN and/or UNOS for electronic transfer of those data elements directly to the Sponsor for each enrolled subject/donor. 
CRF general guidelines will be used to complete all CRFs. Subjects will be given identification 
numbers so that their identity cannot be determined by the S ponsor and donor data will be 
identified for use by their UNOS ID. The research coordinator will keep a Master Subject List that will equate the identifiers to the actual donors and subjects that are a part of this study. This  
list will be kept in a secur e location and will not be part of the S ponsor’s regulatory documents. 
This information will only be made available to the S ponsor and/or their designee for routine 
verification of CRFs and also to the FDA if required for regulatory affairs.

Confidential  Page 70 of 89 The Investigator will review the CRFs for completeness and accuracy and sign and date the 
forms where indicated. Q uestions regarding missing or uninterpretable data will be 
communicated to the Principal Investigator/study coordinator for resolution and ent ered into a 
CRF correction form. The CRF correction form(s), after resolution of discrepancies, will be signed by the Principal Investigator and the revised data entered into a database. All records which support CRFs of this study or follow -up must be ret ained in the files of the Principal 
Investigator for a minimum of two years or until notification by the Sponsor, whichever is earlier.  
10.8 Independent Medical Monitor  
In addition to the Principal Investigator’s responsibility for oversight, study oversight wi ll be 
under the direction of I ndependent Medical Monitor s. The first Independent Medical Monitor is 
Dr. Martin Zamora, lung transplant pulmonologist at the University of Colorado, who has direct experience taking care of post -EVLP lung recipients. He is al so the author of the medical journal 
article Medical Complications of Lung Transplantation. [Lyu 2009] Dr. Zamora is considered an 
expert in this area and well qualified to make a determination of unreasonable risk in relation to lung transplantation and EVLP.  
The second Independent Medical Monitor is Dr. Michael Mulligan, cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Washington. Dr. Mulligan is clinically active with lung transplantation and lung  
volume reduction surgery . 
The I ndependent Medical Monitor s are independent of the study and will be available in real 
time to review and recommend appropriate action regarding AEs and other safety issues.  Their  
contact information is located in Appendix 2. 
10.9 Protocol Violations/ Deviations  
A study deviation is defined as an event where the Study Investigator or site personnel did not conduct the study according to the study protocol, applicable laws or regulations or the Investigator agreement.  
Prior approval by the Sponsor is expected in those situations in which the Investigator anticipates, contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to depart from procedures specified in the study protocol, except when necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject 
in an emergency. Prior approval is not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control (e.g., inadvertent mistakes, equipment failure, subject unable to do required testing due to illness).  
All study deviations will be recorded on a  Protocol Deviations form , including a  description of 
the deviation, justification for the deviation, and corrective action for the deviation. Study deviations may be discovered through a variety of sources, such as during the CRF review, telephone conversations, and site monitoring. Study dev iations should be reported to the 
applicable IRB in accordance with IRB policies and/or local laws. When relevant, ethics committees, competent authorities or the appropriate regulatory bodies should be informed. The 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 71 of 89 Sponsor will review all deviations from  the study protocol. Corrective action and preventative 
action will be performed after protocol deviations are discovered during monitoring visits.  
Deviations will be reported to the CRO and the Sponsor regardless of whether medically 
justifiable, pre- approved by the Sponsor or taken to protect the subject in an emergency. Study 
deviations should be reported as soon as possible upon notification of the deviation. Investigators must notify the Sponsor and reviewing IRB within five working days. Examples of d eviations 
from the study protocol  may  include:  
• No informed consent prior to transplant within a study subject. 
• Incorrect version of consent provided to subject.  
• Enrollment of subject prior to IRB approval.  
• Enrollment of subject during an IRB approval lapse . 
• Subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Required testing and/or measurements not performed.  
• Source data permanently missing.  
• Adverse event not reported by Investigator in the required regulatory time frame.  
• Unauthorized physician performed study procedures (e.g. implanting physician was not an Investigator).  
 
10.10  Access to Source Documentation  
Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study, in compliance with ICH E6, Section  4.9 and regulatory and inst itutional requirements for the 
protection of confidentiality of subjects. Each site will permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor and regulatory agencies to examine (and when required by applicable law, to copy) research records for the purposes of QA reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress and data validity.   
Procedures and data collection will be documented utilizing site SOP or will be captured in site generated worksheets and data collection forms considered source documentation.

Confidential  Page 72 of 89 During the study, the use of the CRF as the original entry or source may occur if approved by the 
Sponsor. This agreement shall be documented in writing and filed with the protocol in the 
Investigator study file. The original data will be collected onto source documents (either the 
subject’ s chart or a separate research subject  chart that is kept in the research department) by the 
research site coordinator. This information will then be tran scribed to the CRFs provided by the 
Sponsor for use in this study.  
10.11  Data Generation and Analysis  
The Investigators are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be comp leted in a neat, legible 
manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data (Section  10.10). The Investigators will maintain 
adequate case histories of study subjects , including accurate CRFs, (Section  10.7) and source 
documentation. 
All donor identifying data will be redacted for the Sponsor and participating Investigators 
according to OPTN Policy  16 and only unique UNOS ID# shall be used to connect the donor to 
the recipient (subject).  
10.11.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
Data collection and accurate documentation are the responsibility of the study staff under the supervision of t he Investigator. All source documents and laboratory reports must be reviewed 
by the study team and data entry staff who will ensure that they are accurate and complete. Unanticipated problems and AE s must be reviewed by the I nvestigator or designee.  
10.11.2 Data Capture Methods  
10.11.2.1 Donor Data  
Donor lung data will be provided by the OPO  and/or Study Centers  through secure -access (read -
only) online database (‘DonorNet’) and/or through a paper- based medical record that 
accompanies the lung , or copies of donor information forwarded via electronic mail or facsimile.  
10.11.2.2 EVLP Data 
EVLP procedure data will be recorded by the S ponsor during the clinical EVLP procedure. Data 
will be collected electronically in a secure online medical database (CMX).  
10.11.2.3 Subject (Recipient Data)  
Subject data for the Analysis Phase , post -lung transplantation, will be collected by participating 
study site using the Sponsor’s CRF . Long-term follow -up data (Year 2 through Year 5) will be 
collected via the OPTN/UNOS database (TIEDI
®) recipient foll ow-up forms.

Confidential  Page 73 of 89 10.12  Retention of Data  
10.12.1 Retention of Study Documents  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of two  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applicati ons in an ICH region or until at least two  years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational device. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the S ponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the I nvestigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
10.12.2 Future Use of Stored Specimens and Other Identifiable Da ta 
Donor lung biopsies and EVLP perfusate samples will be obtained and stored for potential future use. Donor lung biopsies and perfusate samples will be identified only by UNOS ID#.  
Donor next of kin will provide authorization for research use of the donor lung tissue and samples taken during the EVLP process. Additionally, subject consent includes a statement that pre-transplant donor lung “biopsies (about the size of your small finger) may be taken using a 
surgical stapler,” and that “Pieces of lungs may  also be removed with staplers from standard 
organ donors as well.”  
10.13  Financial Disclosure  
Per 21 CFR 54, all Investigators are required to complete a Financial Disclosure form prior to site activation, attesting to the fact that they are unaware of any financial conflicts of interest, or disclosing potential conflicts, including payments, proprietary interests and/or equity interests. Completed forms will be maintained in the Trial Master File.  
10.14  Publication and Disclosure Policy  
The International Committee of  Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted 
a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or conc urrent comparison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a 
medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care changes, and the l ike. Health 
outcomes include any biomedical or health -related measures obtained in patients or participants, 
including pharmacokinetic measures and AEs. The ICMJE policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as Cl inicalTrials.gov , which is sponsored by the 
National Library of Medicine. The Sponsor will register this study in ClinicalTrials.gov within 30 days of study start, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJ E does not review specific studies to determine whether registration 
is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journ al in 
which they wish to publish.

Principal Investigator) register and repor t results of certain "applicable clinical trials:"  
The Sponsor will develop subsequent publication policies prior to locking of the study data. 
10.15  Study Closure  
Study closure is defined as a specific date that is determined by study completion and/ or regulatory requirements have been satisfied per the study protocol  and/or by decision of the 
Sponsor or FDA. Study closure visits will be conducted at all enrolling Study Centers  in order to 
review record retention requirements with site personnel. A telephone contact may take the place of a study closure visit if appropriate (e.g., low subject enrollment, recent monitoring visit). Monitoring visits will be conducted by trained monitors and designees. A detailed  Monitoring 
Plan will be developed identif ying the frequency of monitoring and training requirements of the 
monitors.

Confidential  Page 82 of 89 Appendix 4  System Components of the Toronto EVLP System  
A schematic of the TES was shown in Figure  3. There are two classifications of system 
components :  Non -Fluid Path Hardware and Single -Use Fluid Path Disposables.  
Non-Fluid Path Hardware  
None of the following perfusion machine hardware used in the TES  touches the fluid path. 
Therefore, each can  be reused  with minimal risk of contamination.  
1. Centrifugal Pump  
The benefit of using a centrifugal pump over a roller pump for ex vivo  lung circulatory support is 
profound. Unlike a roller pump that pumps at a continuous pressure, a cent rifugal pump will 
automatically back down its pressure when the internal resistance of the lungs increases. This is 
critical when warming up a hypothermically -preserved lung which is very cold (4°C) and thus, 
very stiff. A centrifugal pump will allow more flow and pressure to go through the lung only as its vascular resistance decreases during the warm -up phase. A roller pump cannot make these 
adaptations and can only pump a constant pressure through the lung, cold or warm, potentially over-pressurizing it and causing irreparable harm. The Stöckert Centrifugal Pump (“SCP”, 
FDA#  K011838) and the Stöckert Centrifugal Pump Console (“SCPC”, FDA# K020571) are 
used by the Toronto Group for all EVLP procedures and will be the centrifugal pump used in the TES. The r eason  this pump was chosen over any other available pump is that the integrated flow 
sensor can be connected close to the pulmonary artery cannula, giving a much more accurate reading of flow rate at the point going into the lung.  
2. Extracorporeal Heater/Coo ler 
The TES requires controlled, step -wise heating to warm up the lung to normothermic 
temperatures (37°C) from the wet ice storage and transportation temperatures. This allows the lung to be assessed at normal physiologic temperature and full metabolic activity. After the lung is determined to be transplantable, it is rapidly re -cooled down to 10°C, then placed back into a 
wet ice shipping container for delivery to the Study Center. Thus, the extracorporeal 
heater/cooler must be capable of delivering contr olled liquid temperatures between 10  to 37°C. 
The Stöckert 3T (FDA#  K052601) is a full -sized, compressor -cooled cardiac perfusion 
temperature- control device. It is capable of providing up to 23 L/min of flow into the heat 
exchanger and can deliver water te mperatures from 0 to  50°C to maintain the temperature of an 
entire person during cardiac bypass. The 3T is used by the Toronto Group for all EVLP procedures and will be the heater/cooler used in the TES. The advantage that this device gives to the System i s precise, digital control of temperatures and the ability to rapidly cool the assessed 
lung, minimizing warm ischemia.  
3. Volume -Controlled ICU Ventilator  
The TES requires an ICU -type ventilator to ventilate the lungs once they are at normal 
temperatures. Th e primary purpose of the ventilator is to allow physiologic respiration to occur 
within the lung tissue (O
2 in, CO 2 out) in order to measure the lung’s ability to exchange these 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc  
Clinical Trial Protocol :  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
 
Confidential  Page 83 of 89 gasses. A volume- controlled ventilator is a critical component of the TES, because since there is 
no thoracic cavity to prevent excessive volumes from being applied to the lung, the ventilator 
itself must provide the protection. The Maquet Servo -i (FDA#  K010925) is considered the 
gold-standard of volume -control ICU ventilators, allo wing precise control of tidal volumes to 
minimize stretch injuries and pressures to protect against high airway pressures. The Servo -i is 
used by the Toronto Group for all EVLP procedures and will be the ventilator used in the TES.  
4. ABG Analyzer  
The ability  of the lung to exchange CO 2 with oxygen can be measured using a traditional blood 
gas analyzer (known as “ABG analyzer”). The Siemens RapidPoint 500 ABG Analyzer (FDA#  K113216 and calibration cartridge K122398) measures PO
2, PCO 2, pH, glucose, and 
lactose, among other analytes (note:  this device is not directly connected to the TES, and therefore, is not shown in the above perfusion diagram). The Siemens RapidPoint 500 Analyzer 
analyzes samples of the STEEN Solution perfusate, measuring dissolved gas levels using a 
disposable sample cartridge that is replaced monthly according to manufacturer’s instructions. The Siemens RapidPoint is used by the Toronto Group for all EVLP procedures and will be the base analyzer for the TES.  
Single -Use Fluid Path Disposabl es 
All devices that come into direct contact with the fluid path will be single- use and pre -sterilized 
by the manufacturer.  
1. Organ Chamber  
The design of the organ container must ensure that the organ is protected in an aseptic environment and allowed to res pire within the container, creating a slightly humid atmosphere to 
prevent the lung tissue from drying out. Additionally, there should be interfaces through the container to aseptically connect the lung to the perfusion circuit. Finally, as the lung starts  to 
warm -up to normothermic temperatures, the bronchial arteries will start to perfuse and slowly 
trickle the perfusate out into the container, so it must be designed to collect the leaks aseptically and to connect back to the perfusion circuit to recircul ate the captured perfusate. Currently, the 
XVIVO Organ Chamber™ is designed as a sterile, single- use container intended to be used as a 
temporary receptacle for isolated donor lungs in preparation for eventual transplantation into a recipient, and therefore, fits the requirement . If other Organ Chambers become available, they 
may be used if they meet these criteria.  
2. Lung Cannula Set  
There are two required cannulas to connect the lung to the perfusion circuit. The first attaches to the left atrial appendage (also called a ‘cuff’) at the point where the left atrium of the heart typically connects to the lung. The objective of this cannula is to connect the soft cuff of tissue to a device that tents (keeps open) the pulmonary veins, allowing the perfusate to fl ow out of the 
veins back into the perfusion circuit. In addition, there is a pressure cannula connected to the inside (lumen) of the cannula to collect accurate left atrial pressures to ensure a slight positive pressure (3- 5 mmHg) in the atrium is maintain ed, preventing the veins from collapsing upon

circuit. In most cases, the pulmonary artery cannula can be a straight tube going into the pulmonary artery proximal t o the point of bifurcation and therefore, perfuse both the left and 
right lungs simultaneously. However, in some cases when the heart is also procured for transplant, the pulmonary artery may not be long enough for a straight cannula and therefore, would need another flexible cannula (similar to the left atrium cannula) to be customized and anastomosed directly to the available pulmonary artery, ensuring a tight fit.   
Currently, the XVIVO Lung Cannula Pack™ fits this requirement as a sterile, single- use pa ck 
intended to be used to connect isolated donor lungs to the disposable perfusion circuit for ex- vivo 
assessment. There are three cannulas included in the Pack:  one cone- shaped left atrial cannula 
(green tape), one straight pulmonary artery cannula (yell ow tape), and one cone -shaped cannula 
(white tape) to use either as a left atrial or as a pulmonary artery cannula back -up. If other Lung 
Cannula Sets become available, they may be used if they meet these criteria.  
3. Disposable Perfusion Circuit  
The Disposab le Perfusion Circuit is a single- use, pre -sterilized, disposable extracorporeal 
perfusion circuit intended to connect to the perfusion hardware to facilitate perfusion of perfusate 
through isolated donor lungs during EVLP assessment. The components are provided by Maquet in a preassembled, sterilized surgical pack.  
Component Overview  
The Disposable Perfusion Circuit is made up of the fluid -path components. Any part that comes 
in direct contact with the fluid path is manufactured as single- use and packaged together as much 
as possible. In EVLP, the disposable circuit acts as the artificial circulatory system, interfacing with the centrifugal pump motor (via magnetic drive), a hollow -fiber oxygenation membrane that 
works in reverse to deoxygenate the perfusat e by adding carbon dioxide and nitrogen and 
removing oxygen, a leukocyte filter to remove activated leukocytes, perfusion tubing, and a hard shell fluid reservoir to hold the excess perfusate. By running the oxygenator essentially in reverse, a mix of gases enters the lungs in a similar proportion as physiologic venous gas. This allows the lung itself to act as the ‘oxygenator’ in the circuit, and the resulting PO
2 coming out of 
the lung can be measured and trended over time as part of the overall lung evaluation strategy. These components are used in an identical assembled combination every day in nearly every hospital in the world to support extracorporeal circula tion during cardiac surgery and ECMO 
procedures. In fact, tens of thousands of these procedures using identical perfusion disposables occur each year in the US alone.  
Perfusion Circuit Function  
The perfusion circuit delivers the normothermic, deoxygenated perfusate to the lungs, then returns oxygenated perfusate to the reservoir for sampling and recirculation. The steps are summarized as follows:  
1. STEEN Solution perfusate is added into the disposable circuit through a standard aseptic interface on the hard s hell reservoir.

Confidential  Page 85 of 89 2. The centrifugal pump head draws the Solution out through the reservoir and pumps it through 
the membrane oxygenator, which is connected to a venous gas mix (86% nitrogen, 8% carbon dioxide, 6% oxygen) where the dissolved oxygen in the circuit is displaced to a lower physiologic level prior to entering the lungs. This is also where perfusate is heated/cooled during the EVLP procedure via conduction by the extracorporeal heater/cooler.  
3. The Solution passes through a leukocyte reduction filter t hat traps activated leukocytes, 
preventing them from circulating back through the lung and from being transplanted into the recipient.  
4. The (non- disposable) flow sensor monitors flow rate (L/min) going into the lung via interface 
from the centrifugal pump c ontrol.  
5. The deoxygenated Solution enters into the lung through the pulmonary artery.  The pulmonary artery Lung Cannula records pressure at the point of interface between the cannula and lung. This is the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).  
6. The oxygenated So lution exits the lung through the LA. The LA Lung Cannula records 
pressure at the point of interface between the cannula and left atrium. This is the left atrium pressure (LAP). 
7. The Solution drains back into the hard shell reservoir where it can be sampled  for testing of 
pH, glucose, lactose, PO
2 and PCO 2 to assess lung function. 
8. Solution temperature is monitored exiting the lung at the reservoir and entering the lung at the oxygenator. 
9. The cycle repeats until the determination is made to either transplant or turn down the lung.

STEEN Solution is a clear, sterile, non- pyrogenic, non- toxic physiological salt solution 
containing HSA and dextran 40. This solution is a low potassium (extracellular) electrolyte 
solution with physiological colloid -osmotic pressure (COP) designed for use as a temporary 
continuous normothermic machine perfusion solution for assessment and extended preservation of isolated donor lungs. 
The composition of STEEN Solution was designed to simulate the COP and crystalloid -osmotic 
properties of human plasma to permit safe, continuous ex- vivo lung perfusion at normothermia 
(37°C) for at least 12 hrs without the development of either tissue edema or dehydration. The 
COP and osmotic pressure of the solution were chosen to maintain optimal water balance between the cellular and the intra-  and e xtra-vascular spaces. The optimal COP is provided by a 
proprietary combination of HSA (FDA -approved source) and dextran 40. The electrolyte 
composition is essentially extra- cellular (low potassium) with a phosphate buffer. The 
composition and physical properties of STEEN Solution are shown in Table 5.

The primary mode of action  for STEEN Solution is its ability to provide optimal COP, 
permitting stable fluid compartment homeostasis for sufficient time to allow meaningful functional evaluation of the lung at 37° C. STEEN Solution, therefore mimics the in vivo  
environment without t he risk of edema formation in the absence of harmful pro- inflammatory 
cytokines and activated leucocytes associated with trauma, stress and brain death. This mode of action is primarily related to the water binding properties of albumin and its distributio ns across 
semi -permeable membranes between the intra-  and extra -vascular spaces within the lung, and is 
not based on any metabolic or pharmacological action of either colloid. Additionally, it has been shown that red blood cells are not required for STEEN Solution to carry oxygen to the lung tissue as oxygen dissolves well in this Solution , and the lung is very efficient at removing 
oxygen from the Solution.[Cypel 2007] Acellular STEEN Solution has been used by the Toronto 
Group for all of their clinical EV LP procedures to date and will be the base perfusate used in the 
TES. 
The disposable EVLP perfusion circuit is primed with 1.5 L  of STEEN Solution prior to use. 
STEEN Solution is allowed to warm -up to room temperature d uring the priming procedure 
pre-perfusion. The medications (and dosages) are added to the 1.5 L STEEN Solution prime are

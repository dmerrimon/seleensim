8.2.6.3 , 10.2.3.1, 15.1).   
• The following changes were made to the controlled 
fasting challenge assessment (Section s 1.3.1 , 3.1, 
3.2.2.1 , 8.1.1, 8.2.6.1, 8.2.6.3 , 8.2.6.4, 15.1): 
o The schedule was updated to remove the CFC 
assessment at Week 6, and make it optional at 
Week 12 to ensure the safety of subjects who 
are taking steroids. This is a specific 
amendment for Cohort 4 where all subjects 
will be receiving a prophylactic steroid regimen between Day 0 and Week 8. Steroids  
can be responsible for adverse events in GSDIa patients, and require caution in any situation 
that could cause metabolic stress such as a 
fasting challenge. 
o The co mposition of the dinner meal was 
updated from a prespecified carbohydrate 
range (15– 20 g) to a personalized meal for 
each subject, including a target carbohydrate range and overall composition in protein, fats 
and dietary fiber that is as close as possible to 
the subject’s most current dinner prescription but not higher than the carbohydrate content of 
the dinner consumed at their baseline fasting 
challenge  
o The prefasting cornstarch dose was updated from 5 g to match the respective subject’s most 
recent co rnstarch prescription and timing post 
dinner  
o Blood sample assessments at the beginning and 
end of the controlled fasting challenge were 
updated to include  cortisol, ACTH, free fatty 
acids, glucagon, insulin, C -peptide, growth 
hormone, IGFB P1, alanine and ketone levels 
(3-hydroxy butyrate) , and the instructions 
regarding laboratory sample collection before 
and during the controlled fasting challenge 
have been revised for clarity.  
o A final sample for glucose, lactate, growth hormone, IGFBP1, A CTH, and cortisol 
measurement has been added  30 minutes after 
the end of the controlled fasting challenge.  
o Capillary glucose measurement has been added , to be performed at the same time points 
as blood collection for STAT analyse.

• Week 12  was change d from IP to OP if the subject is 
still receiving  prednisone at the time of the Week 12 
Visit. ( Section  15.1)  
• Language has been added to Section  8.2.6.2.2  to 
provide guidance on additional prednisone use after the 
protocol -specified prednisone taper has been compet ed, 
and guidance regarding the timing of routine vaccinations relative to prednisone use.   
• Targeted physical examinations were added to 
outpatient visits at Weeks 4, 6, and 36  (Figure  2, 
Section  15.1)  
• Language was added to specify that  will be 
conducted after the controlled fasting challenge is 
complete (Figure  2, Sections 3.2.2.1, 3.2.3.3 , 8.1.4, 
15.1)  
• The contact information for SAE and pregnancy 
reporting was updated ( Section  Sections  9.1.2.2  and 
Section  9.2.1)  
• A new section, Section  3.3, was ad ded to address 
changes to the study schedule and/or  study operations 
due to the CO VID-19 pandemic.  
• A new section, Section  8.1.6 , has been added to 
provide  details regarding the telephone interviews that 
are conducted at Weeks 24 and 52.  Text related to these interviews has been removed from Section  8.1.5 . 
• The definition of dose -limiting toxicity was revised to 
include events based on the Sponsor’s evaluation of 
relatedness to DTX401, as well as the Investigator’s. (Section  9.1.1.1 ) 
• Text was added to specify that the dose of DTX401 in 
this study is in genome copies as measured by  
(Section  10.2.2) 
• Statistical analysis methodology sections were revised and reference to the Statistical Analysis Plan added  
(Sections  10.2.3.2 , 10.2.3.3 , 10.2.3.6 )

Confidential  Eligible subjects may be enrolled into  1 of the following cohorts of 3 subjects each and 
receive a single IV infusion of DTX401. 
• Cohort 1:  Dose 1 (2.0 × 1012 genome copies [ GC]/kg) with a reactive steroid regimen 
(prednisone starting dose of 40 mg/day)  
• Cohort 2:  Dose 2 (6.0  × 1012 GC/kg) with a reactive steroid regimen ( prednisone 
starting dose of 40 mg/day)  
• Cohort 3:  Dose 2 (6.0  × 1012 GC/kg) with an optimized reactive steroid regimen 
(prednisone starting dose of 60 mg/day)  
• Cohort 4:  Dose 2 (6.0  × 1012 GC/kg) with a prophylactic steroid regimen  
A cohort may  be expanded  to include additional subjects to confirm the findings for the 
cohort. 
Subjects i n Cohorts 1 and 2 were dosed at a minimum of 2 weeks (14 days) apart. Subjects 
in subsequent cohorts will be dosed at a minimum of 1 week (7 days) apart.  
For Cohorts 1 and 2, there was a minimum of 12  weeks (84  days) between dosing of the 
last subject in a  dosing cohort and the first subject in the next dosing cohort. After the third 
subject in each cohort rea ched the 12 -week time point, the continual reassessment method 
(CRM) propose d a dose for the next cohort using the collected data from the previous 
cohort. The decision to proceed was made after the data monitoring committee (DMC) 
evaluated at least 12 weeks of safety data for all subjects in the dosing cohort.  
After reviewing Week 12 data from all subjects in Cohort 1, the DMC concluded that it 
was saf e to enroll 3 additional subjects into Cohort 2 at Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) . After 
reviewing Week 12 data  from all subjects in Cohort 2, the DMC concluded that it was safe 
to enroll 3 additional subjects into Cohort 3 at Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) with an 
optimized reactive steroid regimen. An optimized reactive steroid regimen is expected to 
manage the elevations in liver aminotransferase levels observed in Cohorts 1 and 2 
following DTX401 administration. If the optimized reactive steroid regimen does not 
sufficiently  manage elevations in liver aminotransferase levels  in Cohort 3 , then Cohort 4 
will be enrolled. Subjects in Cohort 4 will receive a prophylactic steroid regimen . 
Enrollment into Cohort 4 may be gin following completion of enrollment into Cohort  3. 
The controlled fasting challenge w as also modified following DMC review of Week  12 
data from subjects in Cohort 2. To minimize a potential insulin spike that could result in 
abrupt hypoglycemia and normalize baseline glucose levels , the recommended tar get 
carbohydrate range of the prefasti ng challenge dinner meal was decreased from 20  g to 
30 g to 15  g to 20  g and the prefasting challenge cornstarch dose was decreased from 35  g 
to 5 g. 
However, further analysis and review of fasting challenge data after  changing the 
prefasting cornstarch dose to 5g showed significantly lower fasting times in cohorts 2 (W52 and W78) and 3 (W24, W32 and W52). In most instances, low post -prandial levels 
of blood glucose associates, persistence of high circulating insulin levels, and an 
inadequate adrenergic res ponse exemplified by the absence of a cortisol increase  to 
hypoglycemia make it challenging to interpret these results. Available CGM recordings have shown an absence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in these subjects despite  an overall 
reduced frequency and total amount of cornstarch. The reason that several subjects can now sleep through the night at home without experiencing hypoglycemia in the absence of 
cornstarch consumption, but have shorter time to hypoglycemia  during the inpatient fasting 
challenge is unclear. It could be attributed to the artificial threshold of 60 mg/dL for 
stopping the fasting challenge. This threshold may not allow adequate glucose release to be 
induced in subjects with higher insulin and lower cor tisol levels. In the home setting, in the 
absence of prolonged fasting, subjects clearly do better as their glucose release seems to be 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
26 
Confidential  better induced  under their personalized dietary management , thereby preventing their 
glucose levels from falling to dangerous levels . 
With Protocol Amendment 6 , the dinner meal will be personalized for each subject, and 
will include a target carbohydrate range and overall composition in protein, fats and dietary 
fibers that is as close as possible to the subject’s most curr ent dinner prescription but not 
higher than the carbohydrate content of the dinner consumed at their baseline fasting challenge. The prefasting cornstarch dose and time of consumption will be per the respective subject’s most recent cornstarch prescription  and daily regimen at home. In 
addition, the threshold for stopping the test was lowered to 54 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) or when 
the subjects present signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia associated with an adrenergic reaction and cerebral glucopenia and most 
physiological hormonal and metabolic  responses to hypoglycemia may not occur in these 
subject s until they reach these levels of blood glucose values . CGM recording during the 
fasting test will provide continuous glucose measurement data that will allow Investigators 
to closely monitor subject s when they reach the lower range of blood glucose (ie, below 60 
mg/dL) . 
Subjects enrolled in Study 401GSDIA01  will be monitored for 52 weeks  following  
DTX401 administration . After completion  of the Week  52 visit or early withdrawal, 
subjects will be offered enrollment into a 4-year extension study in accordance with 
regulatory authority regulations and ICH GCP . During the informed consent process for 
this study, subjects will be informed of t he 4-year extension study in order to maximize 
subject enrollment into the extension study.  
Study Methodology:  Screening Period  
After a subject has provided written informed con sent and within the 56 days prior to 
Day 0, the Investigator or other qualifie d study personnel will determine if the subject is 
eligible for the study. This will be accomplished by reviewing the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and completing all of the screening assessments. Screening assessments may b e 
performed on more than 1 day; all assessments must be completed and results available and 
reviewed within the 56-day Screening Period prior to Day  0. 
Screening assessments include recording of the following: demographic data; medical and 
GSDIa history; p rior medications, therapies, and procedures; vital sign measure ments; and 
height and weight. A  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and a complete physical 
examination will be performed. Blood s amples will be collected for hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency vi rus status; serum pregnancy testing (for 
females of childbearing potential only); G6PC  genotyping; AAV8 neutralizing antibody 
testing; AAV8 binding antibody immunoglobulin  G (IgG) testing; and clinical laboratory 
assessments (clinical chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, and 
coagulation panel ). It is recommended that blood samples for G6PC  genotyping and AAV8 
neutralizing antibody testing be collected at the time written informed consent is provided. A urine s ample will be collected for urinalysis.  
An ultrasound of the liver will be performed. Adverse events and SAEs will be monitored after the subject has provided written informed consent. The number of symptomatic 
hypoglycemic events with documented glucose of <  60 mg/dL (<  3.0 mmol/L) that 
occurred during the previous 52 weeks will be recorded . The subject’s daily prescribed 
diet, daily diet intake, daily prescribed cornstarch (or equivalent), and daily cornstarch (or equivalent) intake will be recorded during scheduled study visits and, if possible, on a 
weekly basis through the Week 52 visit or ear ly withdrawal . 
The site will provide copies of the GSDIa Morning Diary and GSDIa Evening Diary to 
subjects and instruct them to bring the completed assessments to the Day 0 and Weeks 12, 
24, and 52 visits. 
The site will provide a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to the subject after 
determining that the subject is eligible for the study. Subjects will be educated on the 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
27 
Confidential  appropriate care and use of the CGM device and sensors, and instr ucted to wear the CGM 
device through the Week 52 visit or early withdrawal . 
Day 0 – Baseline Assessments  
Subjects will be admitted to the study site or hospital on Day  0 and discharged 
approximately 24  hours after administration of DTX401 (on Day  2). Each subject will 
remain on his or her prescribed diet for the duration of the inpatient stay.  A blood sample 
for measurement of lipid levels  will be collected on the morning of hospital admission . The 
sample should be collected at least 2 to 4 hours after the subject’s last meal.  
A urine pregnancy test will be administered (for females of childbearing potential only) . 
Blood  samples will be collected for clinical laboratory assessments (clinical chemistry 
[including liver function tests], hematology, and coagula tion panel), AAV8  neutralizing 
antibody testing, AAV8 binding antibody IgG testing, cell -media ted immune response to 
AAV8 and G6Pase testing, and anti -G6Pase antibody testing. A urine sample will be 
collected for urinalysis. Saliva, urine, and stool samples will be collected to provide a 
baseline for assessment of vector shedding. A 12-lead ECG and  a targeted physical 
examination will be performed. Vital sign measurements and weight will be recorded. 
Adverse events and SAEs will be monitored. The number of symptomatic hypoglycemic 
events with documented glucose of <  60 mg/dL (<  3.0 mmol/ L) that occu rred since the last 
visit; concomitant medications, therapies, and procedures; and the subject’s daily 
prescribed diet , daily diet intake, daily prescribed  cornst arch (or equivalent) , and daily 
cornstarch (or equivalent)  intake will be recorded.  
Subject s will complete the  
 prior to invasive 
asses sments being conducted.  Subjects will complete the GSDIa Morning Diary and 
GSDIa Evening Dia ry daily for 7 days leading up to and including the Day 0 visit . 
Subjects will participate in a controlled fasting challenge. The Investigator or delegated 
sub-investigator will review the results of all laboratory assessments performed on the first 
day of  the inpatient visit , including morning cortisol. Subjects should wear  their CGM 
device throughout the fasting challenge, and should not  change the sensor prior to the 
assessment . Before the controlled fasting challenge begins, the study site will provide 
dinner for the subject. The dinner meal will be personalized for each subject and will 
include a target carbohydrate range and overall composition in protein, fats and dietary 
fibers that is  as close as possible to the subject’s most current dinner dietary prescription.  
The content of the dinner and quantities consumed will be recorded.  
After dinner, s ubjects will be given an oral dose of cornstarch equivalent  per th eir most 
recent cornstarch  prescription  at approximately the same time that they typically take it , but 
no later than 3 hours post dinner.  The time of ingestion of prefasting cornstarch and the 
amount consumed will be recorded. After the cornstarch is inge sted, the controlled fasti ng 
challenge will begin, and the  start time will be recorded  accordingly . If subjects  do not 
receive cornstarch overnight , or receive continuous overnight feedings , the fasting test will 
begin after they complete  their dinner . Subjects will be instructed to minimize activity after 
they finish eating dinner until the end of the fasting challenge.  
During the fast, subjects may not ingest any food or drink other than water. The controlled 
fasting challenge will end when the subjec t’s glucose level decreases to < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 
mmol/L) or when the subjects present signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, or the fast 
reaches 15 hours without hypoglycemia, whichever occurs first . The stop time of the 
controlled fasting challenge will be r ecorded. At the end of the controlled fasting challenge, 
the subject’s hypoglycemia should be treated per the institution’s standard procedure, 
which may include providing the subject with a meal, cornstarch, or IV glucose, if 
medically indicated.   
Blood s amples for measurement of cortisol, fatty acid, glucagon, insulin, C -peptide, growth 
hormone, insulin -like growth factor -binding protein 1 ( IGFBP1 ), alanine and ketone levels

Confidential  will be collected at the beginning and end of the fasting challenge, or more freq uently at 
the Investigator’s discretion.  A final sample  for glucose, lactate, growth hormone, IGFBP1 , 
ACTH, and cortisol measurement will be collected 30 minutes after the end of the 
controlled fasting challenge. Samples should be prepared and transported to the local 
laboratory in accordance with the site’s standard procedures.  Blood samples for STAT 
analysis of glucose and lactate will be collected per the schedule of events. Capillary 
glucose will also be assessed.   
Urine will be collected ov er 24  hours for  the determination of total protein, microalbumin, 
and creatinine. The collection of urine can overlap with the controlled fasting challenge.  A

For subjects enr olled in Cohort 4, the Investigator will initiate a prophylactic steroid 
regimen  after completion of the controlled fasting challenge (Section  8.2.6.2.2 ). 
Day 1 – DTX401 Infusion  
Subjects will receive a single IV infusion of DTX 401. The start of the DTX401 infusion 
should be after all samples and procedures specified for Day  1 predose have been 
completed. Subjects will be discharged after a 24 -hour observation period.  
Prior to dosing with DTX401, blood samples will be collected f or clinical chemistry 
(including liver function tests) and vector genome determination. A 12 -lead ECG will be 
performed, and vital sign measurements will be recorded. Adverse events and SAEs will be 
monitored. The number of symptomatic hypoglycemic events with documented glucos e of 
< 60 mg/dL (<  3.3 mmol/L) and concomitant medications, therapies, and procedures will 
be recorded.  
After dosing with DTX401, a blood sample will be collected approximately 22  hours after 
the start of the infusion for clinical chemistry (including live r function tests) and vector 
genome determination. Vital sign measurements will be recorded approximately 5  minutes 
after the start of the infusion and approximately 0.5, 1, 4, 8, and 22  hours after the start of 
the infusion. Adverse events and SAEs will b e monitored. The number of symptomatic 
hypoglycemic events with documented glucose of <  60 mg/dL (<  3.3 mmol/L) and 
concomitant medications, therapies, and procedures will be recorded. At the end of the 
visit, the Morning Glucose Leve l monitoring worksheet  and instructions for completing it 
will be provided to the subject (Section  8.1.3 ). 
Subjects in Cohort 3 will be discharged with prednisone  to allow rapid treatment of 
possible vector -induced hepatitis if it occurs following treatment with DTX401  
(Section  8.2.6.2.1 ). Subjects in Cohort  4 will be discharged with prednisone per the 
prophylactic steroid regimen  (Section  8.2.6.2.2 ). 
Outpatient Study Site or Home Visits  
Subjects will be asked to provide clinical laboratory samples at a minimum of every 
3 to 4 days through Week  12 of the study, or longer if clinically indicated . Subjects may 
have the option of havin g these samples collected at their homes by clinically tra ined and 
qualified personnel (if arranged by the Investigator), unless there is a scheduled study site 
visit that the subject must attend in person.  
A blood sample will be collected for determinatio n of clinical chemistry (including liver 
function tests) a nd sent to the central laboratory. A second blood sample will be collected 
for liver function tests and sent to the local laboratory (STAT sample). A blood sample will 
be collected for determination  of cell-mediated immune response to AAV8 and G6Pase 
testing approximately weekly.  
Saliva, urine, and stool samples will be collected for assessment of vector shedding until at least 3  consecutive negative results are obtained from each sample matrix.

Confidential  Week s 12 and 24 (Inpatient Visits)  
Subjects will be admitted to the study site or hospital for approximately 24  hours for all 
assessments. Each subject will remain on his or her prescribed diet for the duration of each 
inpatient stay.  
If the subject  is off ste roid treatments and the Investigator considers it is safe to proceed 
with the inpatient W eek 12 visit , approximately 1 week before the Week 12 visit, a blood 
sample for measurement of ACTH and cortisol levels will be collected  if possible . A blood 
sample f or measurement of lipid level s will b e collected on the morning of hospital 
admission  at approximately the same time as collected on Day 0. The sample should be 
collected at least 2 to 4 hours after the subject’s last meal.  If the subject  continues to be on 
steroid regimen and the Investigator determines that it is not safe to proceed with the CFC, 
the W eek 12 visit will be come  an outpatient visit. Investigator s should try to complete  an 
ad hoc CFC assessment as soon as the subject  has completed steroid tre atment  and within 8 
weeks of the Week 12 visit , as an unscheduled visit.

Treatment for 
Vector- Induced 
Hepatitis:  Reactive Steroid Treatment for Possible Vector- Induced Hepatitis  
Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will receive reactive oral steroid treatment for possible 
vector -induced hepatitis if liver aminotransferase levels increase following treatment with 
DTX401. The Investigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead, will consider 
starting oral steroid treatment for possible vector -induced hepatitis if a subject’s ALT 
level s increase from the subject’s baseline  or recently drawn levels, and are considered by 
the Investigato r to be possibly related to treatment with DTX401. If repeat testing is 
deemed necessary, every effort should be made to repeat the testing within 24  hours from 
receipt of test results indicating elevated levels of ALT.  
Based on available evidence, it is expected that vector -induced hepatitis will be 
self-limiting. Therefore, prednisone (or prednisolone) will be used to treat vector -induced 
hepatitis  according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines , 
which  have been modified fo r subjects with GSDIa so that the starting dose/duration is 
lower/shorter:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The Investigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead, may consider modifyin g 
this regimen if a subject’s ALT levels do not normalize during the steroid taper.  The 
Investigator should document the agreed upon steroid regimen i n the subject’s source 
documentation.  
Prophylactic Steroid Treatment for Vector- Induced Hepatitis  
Subjects  in Cohort 4 will receive prophylactic oral steroid treatment to prevent possible 
vector -induced hepatitis. Prophylactic oral steroid regimens have been used in 
AAV -mediated gene transfer clinical trials for other indications (eg,  Clinicaltrials.gov 
identi fiers: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Oral prednisone (or prednisolone) will be initiated on Day 1 following completion of the 
Day 0 controlled fasting challenge and before  DTX401 administration as follows:

The Investigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead,  may consider modifying 
this regimen if a subject’s ALT levels do not normalize during the steroid taper.  If, in the 
Investigator’s medical judgment, the subject may not safely tolerate initiation of oral 
steroid treatment on Day 1, the steroid regimen may be modified based on discussion 
between the Investigator and the Ultragenyx medical lead.  The Investigator should 
document the agreed upon steroid regimen i n the subject’s source documentation.  
The Investigator may consider additional assessments or medical care, such as 
hospitalization or daily clinic visits, during steroid administration if, in the Investigator’s 
medical judgment, these measures would provide additional safety benefits.  
Safety Stopping 
Criteria:  Enrollment will be stopped and the DMC and regulators will be notified if, at any time during the study, any of the events listed be low occur following administration of 
DTX401:  
• Death of a subject  
• An event with an intensity ≥ Grad e 3 (according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) develops  
• Occurrence of a hepatic malignancy  
If a stopping rule  is met, enrollment will be paused and the DMC will meet to review 
available data. If a decision i s made to resume enrollment, this decision will be 
communicated to and, if required, approved by regulatory authorities according to country requirements.  
An event that meets any of the above criteria will be reported immediately and captured as 
an AE/SAE in the electronic case report form by the study site. If a stopping criterion is 
met and study enrollment is suspended, all subjects who have been enrolled wi ll remain in 
the study and will continue to be monitored through their completion or withdrawal fr om 
the study.

Confidential  Estimated Study 
Duration:  The duration of the s tudy for each subject is defined as the date the subject provides written 
informed consent through the Week 52 visit. Subjects will be in the study for 
approximately 60 weeks (including the Screening Period).  
After completion of the Week  52 visit or early withdrawal, subjects will be offered 
enrollment in to a 4-year extension study to evaluate the long- term (for a total of 5  years) 
safety and efficacy of DTX401.  
Study Pro duct, 
Dose, and Route of Administration:  DTX401 will be administered as a single perip heral IV infusion.  The following doses may 
be evaluated using a CRM to estimate the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of DTX401  
regardless of the steroid approach  used (ie, re active vs prophylactic ): 
Dose 1:  2.0 × 10
12 GC/kg 
Dose 2:  6.0 × 1012 GC/kg 
Dose 3:  1.0 × 1013 GC/kg 
Statistical Methods:  Determination of the Maximum Tolerated and Optimal Biological Doses  
The optimal biological dose ( OBD ) will be based on the MTD and an assessment of 
clinical benefit.  
A CRM will be used for dose escalation to estimate the MTD of DTX401. The CRM uses the Bayesian method to model the probability of experiencing a DLT for each given dose in order to recommend  the dose for the next cohort. The CRM will evaluate subjects based 
on the dose administered regardless of the steroid appro ach used (ie, reactive vs 
prophylactic ). A DLT is defined as any AE/SAE ≥ Grade  3 that is considered by the 
Investigator  and/or Sponsor  to be related to DTX401.  The MTD is defined as the highest 
dose where the predicted probability of experiencing a DLT is less than or equal to the target toxicity rate. In this study, the targ et toxicity rate is 0.25.  
Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted when a minimum of 12 -week data are available for 
all subjects from at least 2 dosing cohorts.  Additional interim analys es may be conducted at 
the Sponsor ’s discretion . 
Safety An alyses  
All statistical analyses of safety outcomes will be descriptive, with the exception of the CRM modelling. The incidence of AEs and TEAEs will be summarized for each dose by 
system organ class and preferred term. Additionally, TEAEs may be summariz ed for each 
dose by severity and relationship to study product, if applicable. SAEs  will be presented for 
each dose by relationship to study product. Summary tables will present the total numbers 
of TEAEs as well as the number of subjects with TEAE inciden ce by system organ class 
and preferred term. Subjects experiencing an event more than once with varying severity 
will be counted only once in the maximum severity within each system organ class and 
preferred term. For incidence of relationship to study product, subjects will be counted only once in the category of the strongest relationship to study product within each system organ class/preferred term.  
Other safety data , including vital sign  measurement s, complete and targeted physical 
examination finding s, ECG results, documented symptomatic hypoglycemi c events, 
clinical laboratory data, vector shedding, vector genome determination, measurement of neutralizing antibody titer to AAV8, measurement of AAV8 binding antibody IgG, assessment of any cell  mediated  immune responses to AAV8 and G6Pase, and 
measurement of antiG6Pase  antibodies will be summarized.

Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
Glucose-6- phosphatase is a glucose -6-phosphate (G6P) hydrolase located in the endopla smic 
reticulum that is primarily expressed in the liver, kidneys, and intestine. It is a highly 
hydrophobic protein with 9 transmembrane domains ( Pan et al., 1998) . The amino and carboxyl 
termini of the glucose -6-phosphatase (G6Pase) protein are located on opposite sides of the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane, with the active site of the enzyme facing the endoplasmic 
reticulum lumen (Lei et al., 1993; Lei et al., 1995b; Lei et al., 1995c ). Glucose-6- phosphatase is 
respo nsible for catalyzing the  terminal step in hepatic and renal glycogenolysis and 
gluconeogenesis ( Figure 1) : the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and inorganic 
phospha te provides a significant amount of circulating glucose ( Foster and Nordlie, 2002) . In 
patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa), free glucose molecules are not generated 
for export into the body’s circulation, and as a result, glucose from glycogen stores is unavailable during periods of fasting, resulting in severe hypoglycemia. The excess glucose-6-phosphate molecules are shunted toward the production of triglycerides (eventually stor ed as fat) and the 
pentose-phosphate pathway (leading to increased uric acid production). Additionally, during periods of prolonged hypoglycemia, an increased rate of glycolysis and catabolism of muscle and fats results in a build -up of lact ate (Chou and Mansfield, 1999; Chou, 2001; van Schaftingen and 
Gerin, 2002) . 
Figure  1: Overview of Glycogenesis and Glycogenolysis 
 
Glycogen storage disease type Ia, also known as von Gierke disease, is a severe autosomal 
recessive inborn error of metabolism that is caused by mutations of the G6PC  gene located on 
chromosome 17q21 ( Lei et al., 1993 ; Chou, 2001) . Patients with GSDIa present with severe 
hypoglycemia and seizures at a few months of age. Like many other inherited disorders, GSDIa can be readily detected by screening a bloodspot sample for one of several common mutations 
(Lei et al., 1995a ). The importance of diagnosing and treating GSDIa earl y is emphasized by the 
severe complications that arise when the disease is left untreated, including life-threatening 
hypoglycemia, severe lactic acidosis, growth failure, renal Fanconi syndrome, and pancreatitis. 
Acute complications of GSDIa, such as hypoglycemia, severe metabolic acidosis, and renal 

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0

Confidential  tubular- dysfunction, respond favorably to and can be prevented with strict dietary restrictions  
and frequent consumption of uncooked cornstarch. However, these restrictions have significant 
limitations and re quire constant vigilance to avoid acute metabolic decompensation that is 
accompanied by life-threatening hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. In addition, dietary 
restri ctions are often not an effective means of preventing the long- term clinical complications  
associated with GSDIa, including proteinuria (that may progress to renal failure), growth retardation, osteopenia, and the formation of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (Chen et al., 1988; Wolfsdorf and Crigler, 1997; Wolfsdorf et al., 1997; 
Wolfsdorf et al., 1999) . 
Complications, such as hepatomegaly (resulting from the pathological accumulation of glycogen in the liver), an increase in the number and size of HCAs, and the development of HCCs become 
more common as individuals with GSDIa age ( Franco et al., 2005) . For example, HCAs are 
present in 70% to 80% of GSDIa patients over the age of 25 years (Lee et al., 2012 ), with up to 
10% of HCAs developing into life-- threatening HCCs ( Franco et al., 2005; Reddy et al., 2007; 
Lee et al., 2012) . Orthotopic liver transplantation has become a treatment option for patients and 
has been shown to correct hypoglycemia and other biochemical abnormalities associated with 
GSDIa, as well as result in an increase in body height ( Matern et al., 1999 ; Boers et al., 2014) . 
These results provide evidence for the efficacy and benefit of restoring G6PC  expression in the 
liver of patients with GSDIa. However,  given that liver transplantation is limited by donor 
availability and is associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality including a very 
high rate of renal failure (Davis and Weinstein, 2008; Boers et al., 2014 ), there is a significant 
unmet medical need  for a treatment that allows for sustained euglycemia and prevention of the 
long- term complications and life -threatening hypoglycemia that are associated w ith GSDIa. In 
nonclinical studies, adeno- associated virus (AAV) serotype 8- mediated delivery of G6PC in 
mice and dogs with GSDIa has restored G6Pase activity and ameliorated disease sequelae (Koeberl et al., 2008; Koeberl et al., 2009; Weinstein et al., 2010; Chou and Mansfield, 2011) , 
providing evidence that gene transfer could have significant benefit in patients with GSDIa. 
1.1. Adeno- Associated Viral Vectors 
Adeno- associated virus is a nonenveloped, icosahedral, single-stranded DNA virus. Given that 
wild-type AAV displays wide tissue tropism and is capable of persisting in tissues for long 
durations without pathogenic effects, the use of recombinant AAV vectors has become a popular tool for gene delivery. Additionally, recombinant AAV vectors are nonreplicating and the vector 
genomes exist as an episome following tissue transduction, minimizing the risk of insertional 
mutagenesis (Nakai et al., 2001) . Since the first genetic engineering of wild -type AAV as a gene 
delivery vector in the early 1980s, recombinant AAV has shown great promise as an effective 
and safe gene delivery vehicle for treatment of diseases (Gao et al., 2005 ; Mingozzi and High, 
2011) . 
Adeno- associated virus seroty pe 2 (AAV2) was the first AAV that was used for gene transfer 
applications and has been used in numerous studies for a variety of diseases such as 
alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency, Batten disease, and cystic fibrosis (Mingozzi and High, 2011) . In 
animal models, AAV2 -mediated gene transfer was shown to treat the underlying disease for 
many years (Snyder et al., 1999; Mount et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005; Nichols et al., 2010) . 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
39 
Confidential  However, in humans, AAV2- mediated d elivery was either subtherapeutic or only lasted a few 
months ( Manno et al., 2003; Manno et al., 2006 ). This was att ributed to several limitations of 
AAV2 vectors including low transduction efficiency ( Yan et al., 2002) , high seroprevalence of 
neutralizing antibodies against AAV2 in humans ( Boutin et al., 2010) , and potentially destructive 
T-cell responses to capsids (Gao et al., 2009; Vandenberghe et al., 2006 ; Wang et al., 2007) . 
There has also been evidence of B -cell responses against the transgene product in an animal 
model of hemophilia ( Herzog et al., 2001) . 
1.2. Selection of the AAV Clinical Candidate 
The host immune response (ie, neutralizing antibodies and T- cell responses)  limiting the efficacy 
of AAV2 -media ted gene transfer ( Section  1.1) was not predicted in the initial animal studies, due 
to AAV2 not being endemic to the nonhuman species under investigation. Novel AAV 
serotypes, isolated from nonhuman primates, a re divergent enough from endemic human 
serotypes to circumvent the neutralizing antibodies that exist in most humans while retaining 
similar tissue tropism (Gao et a l., 2002) . 
One of these serotypes, AAV serotype 8 (AAV8), displays strong tropism for the liver (Gao et 
al., 2002)  and has been tested extensively as a vector fo r gene transfer in nonclinical and clinical 
models of hemophilia (Davidoff et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2006; Nathwani et al., 2011b; Nathwani 
et al., 2006 ; Nathwani et al., 2007) . 
These studies have shown that AAV8 has clear advantages over AAV2 including excellent transduction efficiency; liver- specific tropism; stable transgene expression; a lack of 
hepatotoxicity as measured by peak serum aminotransferases; a lack of liver histop athology; a 
lack of T-cell activation to the transgene product; and low levels of pre- existing neutralizing 
antibodies in humans, minimizing their inhibition of in vivo transduction. Furthermore, AAV8 
has shown impressive efficacy and safety in clinical st udies for hem ophilia B ( Nathwani et al., 
2011b; Nathwani et al., 2014)  and is being studied in multiple indications , including hemophilia 
A (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), hemophilia B (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), late-onset ornithine 
transcarbamylase deficiency (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), Pomp e disease 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and Crigler-N ajjar s yndrome (Clinicaltrials.gov 
identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The  study product, DTX401, contains a codon-optimized human 
wild-type G6PC with expression driven by both the native G6PC -specific promoter and 
enhancer elements encapsidated within a nonreplicating recombinant AAV8 vector. In G6pc  
knockout ( G6pc
 -/-) mice, a vector similar to DTX401 showed a sustained, dose-dependent 
improvement in plasma glucose levels following a single intravenous (IV) injection that was similar to the improvement in wild -type mice ( Yiu et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012) . Furthermore, 
restoring G6Pase activ ity (from 3% to 63% of wild -type levels) prevented the formation of HCA 
for up to 90 weeks, which had previously been reported in a liver-specific knock out model (Mutel et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012 ). These data provide support for the feasibility of this 
therapeutic approach in humans.  
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
40 
Confidential  DTX401 offers the following advantages f or patients with GSDIa: 
• The liver is a natural site of G6Pase synthesis. The AAV8 serotype demonstrates high 
liver tropism and can achieve efficient liver gene transfer following IV infusion (Gao 
et al., 2002 ). 
• The AAV8 serotype is not thought to be endemic in the human population; therefore, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to AAV8 that would prevent efficient 
transduction of the liver is expected to be low in pati ents with GSDIa (Calcedo and 
Wilson, 2013) . 
1.3. Study Rationale  
The use of gene transfer for treating GSDIa in G6pc-/- mice and in a naturally occurring canine 
model of GSDIa has been tested using both adenoviral (murine model only) ( Koeberl et al., 
2007)  and AAV delivery systems (both murine and canine models) (Beaty et al., 2002 ; Sun et al., 
2002; Ghosh et al., 2006; Koeberl et al., 2006 ; Koeberl et al., 2008; Chou and Mansfield, 2007; 
Kishnani et al., 2010; Yiu et al., 2010; Chou and Ma nsfield, 2011; Lee et al., 2012) . These 
studies demonstrated long- term corr ection of the disease sequelae, including correction of fasting 
hypoglycemia; reduction of uric acid, triglycerides, and cholesterol; improved growth; reduction in hepatomegaly and nephromegaly; and a reduction in lactic acidosis (canine model). 
Histologically, there was also a reduction in glycogen deposition in the liver, and recent data 
demonstrated prevention of both HCAs and HCCs ( Lee et al., 2012) . 
Glucose-6- phosphatase gene transfer is expected to be effective for the treatment of GSDIa 
because the disease is caused by mutations within a single gene (Lei et al., 1995a ; Lei et al., 
1993; Chou, 2001) . Currently, no gene transfer product has been approved for the treatment of 
GSDIa. Based on previous clinical experience wit h AAV8, DTX401 is expected to result in 
sustained (at  least 3 years following vector infusion) expression of G6PC (Nathwani et al., 
2011b; Nathwani et al., 2014) . Therefore, unlike current treatment options (ie, strict dietary 
restrictions and frequent consumption of uncooked cornstarch), G6PC gene transfer offers the 
potential to correct the underlying deficiency for a prolonged period of time with a single IV 
infusion. Furthermore, increasing G6Pase activity should allow patients with GSDIa to avoid hypoglycemic episodes and long-term complications associated with GSDIa, which should 
greatly improve their health -related quality of life (HRQoL).  
1.3.1. Design Rationale 
The design of this first -in-human study is consistent with global regulatory guidelines for 
protocol design, including subject selection, dose estimation, precautions applied between dosing cohorts, risk mitigation, and study stopping criteria. 
Study 401GSDIA01 is a Pha se 1/2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety and dose-finding 
study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DTX401 in adults with GSDIa. 
The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of single IV doses of DTX401, 
inclu ding the incidence of dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs). The secondary objective of the study 
is to establish a dose of DTX401 that achieves symptom- free euglycemia (glucose ≥ 54  mg/dL 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
41 
Confidential  [≥ 3.0 mmol/L]) in a setting of a controlled fasting challenge to allow further clinical 
development. 
Patients with GSDIa will typically develop hypoglycemia within 2 to 4 hours of a meal in the 
absence of treatment (ie, cornstarch) (Bali et al., 2016) . Ingestion of uncooked or modified 
cornstarch has been shown to maintain glucose above 3.0 mmol/L for up to 10  hours (median 
7 hours) in patients with GSDIa during a controlled fasting  challenge (Bhattacharya et al., 2007) ; 
however, there are limited data to estimate intraperson v ariability in time to reaching 
hypoglycemia. Patients with GSDIa have a mo re consistent fasting profile than patients with 
other glycogen storage diseases (Wolfsdorf et al., 1999) . Therefore, a conservative estimate for 
intraperson variability would be ± 2 hours. In thi s study, subjects will be administered a 5 g oral 
dose of cornstarch just prior to starting the controlled fasting challenge. This  dose of cornstarch 
is expected to minimize a potential insulin spike following dinner that could result in abrupt hypoglycemi a, normalize baseline glucose values, allow subjects to fast for a few hour s, and 
minimize intraperson variability. In nonclinical studies,  G6pc
-/- mice were able to survive a 
24-hour fast following treatment with a vector similar to DTX401 (Lee et al., 2012 ). Based on 
these data, it is expect ed that DTX401 gene transfer should prevent hypoglycemia for at least 
8 hours during the controlled fasting challenge. This clinically meaningful change from baseline 
(ie, 2 to 4 hours ( Bali et al., 2016) ) would represent a clear  efficacy signal outside an effect that 
can be attributed to anticipated intraperson variability (ie, ±  2 hours). 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in to cohorts of 3 subjects each and receive a single IV infusion 
of DTX401. Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 w ere dosed at a minimum of 2  weeks (14  days) apart. 
Subjects in subsequent cohorts will be dosed at a minimum of 1 week (7  days) apart. 
The proposed dosing interval of 14 days between subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2, followed by a 
dosing interval of 7 days in subsequent cohorts, is supported by the safety profile and lack of 
serious adverse reactions reported in AAV-mediated gene transfer in human subjects, including a 
hemophilia B clinical study using an AAV8 vector ( Manno et al., 2006 ; Nathwani et al., 2011b; 
Nathwani et al., 2014)  and this study (Derks et al., 2019; Weinstein et al., 2019) . Moreover, a 
Phase 1/2 clinical study in hemophilia B that used AAV- mediated gene transfer at a starting dose 
of 5.0 × 1012 genom e copies (GC)/kg (higher than the proposed DTX401 st arting dose of 
2.0 × 1012 GC/kg) at multiple European study sites dosed subject s within a cohort at a minimum 
of only 1 day (24 hours) apart (uniQure, 2014) (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; 
EudraCT Number: 2013-005579-42). 
The most common product- related adverse event (AE) observed in clinical studies w ith 
AAV- mediated gene transfer to subjects with moderate to severe hemophilia B has been an 
asymptomatic transient increase in liver aminotransferase  level s (though still within the normal 
reference range for these laboratory para meters) and concurrent dec line in transgene expression 
approximately 7 to 10 weeks following vector administration (Manno et al., 2006; Nathwani et 
al., 2011b; Nathwani et al., 2014) . In all cases, the transient increase in liver aminotransferase  
level s resolved without clinical sequelae. It has been hypothesized that this vector-induced 
hepatitis is due to the activation of capsid -specific cytotoxic T  lymphocytes and destruction of 
transduced liver cells ( Mingozzi et al., 2007) . As this is the only identified AE with AAV gene 
transfer,  and given that subjects in this study will be closely monitored for vector-induced 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
42 
Confidential  hepatitis and treated with corticosteroids if needed (Section  8.2.6.2), having an interval of more 
than 14 days between subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 and more than 7 days between subjects in 
subsequent cohorts does not change either safety evaluations or the medical management of 
study subjects. To date, no related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) or DLTs have been reported for 
DTX401. Consistent with previous experience ( Manno et al., 2006; Nathwani et al., 2011b; 
Nathwani et al., 2014) , mild, transient, asymptomatic increases in liver amino trans ferase levels 
have been observ ed foll owing DTX401 administration that resolved with steroids (Derks et al., 
2019; Weinstein et al., 2019) . 
Subject safety will be closely monitored throughout the study, including assessment of hypoglycemic events, frequent monitoring of liver enzymes, and inpatient observation following dosing and at multiple time points throughout the 52-week study duration. 
For Cohorts 1 and 2, t here was a minimum of 12 weeks (84 days) between dosing of the last 
subject in a dosing cohort and the first subject in the next dosing cohort. After all subjects in 
Cohorts 1 and 2 complete d Week  12, the continual reassessment method (CRM) proposed a dose 
for the next cohort using the collected data from the previous cohort. The DMC met to review 
safety data (ie, AEs/SAEs, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, 
electrocardio gram [ECG] results, and clinical laboratory assessments [including assessment of 
liver function]) and provide a recommendation for progressing to the next dosing level (Section  9.3). The CRM will be used for dos e escalatio n to estimate the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of DTX401 (Section  10.2.1).  
After reviewing Week 12 data from all subjects in Cohort 1, the DMC concluded that it was safe to enroll 3 additional subject s into Cohort 2 at Dose 2 (6.0 × 10
12 GC/kg). After reviewing 
Week  12 data from all subjects in Cohort 2, the DMC concluded that it was safe to enroll 
3 additional subjects into Cohort 3 at Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) with an optimized reactive 
steroid regimen . An optimized reactive steroid regimen is expected to manage the elevations in 
liver aminotransferase levels observed in Cohorts 1 and 2 following DTX401 administration. 
If the optimized reactive steroid regimen does not sufficiently manage elevations i n liver 
aminotransferase levels in Cohort 3, then Cohort 4 will be enrolled. Subjects in Cohort 4 will 
receive a prophylactic steroid regimen. Enrollment into Cohort 4 may begin following 
completion of enrollment into Cohort 3 ( Section  3.1). 
In Cohort 4, oral prednisone (or prednisolone) will be initiated on Day 1 after completion of the Day 0 controlled fasting challenge and before DTX401 administration, sustained for 4 weeks, 
and then tapered  (Section  8.2.6.2.2) . Prophylactic oral steroid regimens have been used in 
AAV- mediated gene transfer clinical trials for other indications (eg,  Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
The contro lled fasting challenge was also modified following DMC review of Week 12 data 
from subjects in Cohort 2. To minimize a potential insulin spike that could result in abrupt 
hypoglycemia and normalize baseline glucose levels, the recommended target carbohydra te 
range of the pre fasting challenge dinner meal was decreased from 20  g to 30 g to 15 g to 20 g 
and the prefasting challenge cornstarch dose was decreased from 35  g to 5 g. 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
43 
Confidential  However, further analysis and review of fasting challenge data after changing the prefasting 
cornstarch dose to 5g showed significantly lower fasting times in cohorts 2 (W52 and W78) and 
3 (W24, W32 and W52). In most instances, low post-prandial levels of blood glucose associates, 
persistence of high circulating insulin levels, and slow cortisol response to hypoglycemia make it 
challenging to interpret these results. Available CGM recordings have shown an absence of 
nocturnal hypoglycemia in these subjects despite an overall reduced frequency and total amount 
of cornstarch. The reason that several subjects can now sleep through the night at home without experiencing hypoglycemia in the absence of cornstarch consumption, but have shorter time to 
hypoglycemia during the inpatient fasting challenge is unclear. It could be attributed to the artificial threshold  of 60 mg/dL for stopping the fasting challenge. This threshold may not allow 
adequate glucose release to be induced in subjects with higher insulin and lower cortisol levels. 
In the home setting, subjects clearly do better as their gluc ose release seems t o be better induced, 
thereby preventing their glucose levels from falling to dangerous levels. 
With Protocol Amendment 6, the dinner meal will be personalized for each subject, and will 
include a target carbohydrate range and overall com position in protein, fats and dietary fibers 
that is as close as possible to the subject’s most current dinner prescription but not higher than 
the carbohydrate content of the dinner consumed at their baseline fasting challenge. The 
prefasting cornstarch d ose and time of con sumption will be per the respective subject’s most 
recent cornstarch prescription and daily regimen at home. In addition, the threshold for stopping 
the test was lowered to 54 mg/dL (3 .0 mmol/L) or when the subject experiences signs and 
symptoms of hypoglycemia.  The new threshold is justified by the fact that signs and symptoms 
of hypoglycemia associated with an adrenergic reaction and cerebral glucopenia and most 
physiological hormonal and metabolic responses responses to hypoglycemia may not occur in 
GSDI a subject s until they reach these levels of blood glucose values. CGM recording during the 
fasting test will provide continuous glucose measurement data that will allow Investigators to closely monitor subject s when they reach the lower range of blood glucose (ie, below 60 mg/dL). 
The DMC will meet at the end of the study and may, at any time, recommend modifying or 
pausing enrollment due to safety concerns based on the ir periodic data reviews. Additionally, if 
an Investigator reports an AE/SAE that meets a ny of the s afety stopping criteria (Section  3.2.4) , 
enrollment will be paused  and the DMC will meet to review available data. If a decision is made

AAV vectors represent a class of viral vectors that are nonreplicating, nonintegrating, and present a low risk for gene therapy -related delayed adverse reactions. Recommended long -term 
safety monitoring for subject s enrolled in AAV gene therapy c linical trials is a minimum of 
5 years (FDA, 2006; CHMP, 2009) . 
Subjects enrolled in Study 401GSDIA01 will be monitored for 52 weeks following DTX401 
administration . After completion of the Week  52 visit or ear ly withdrawal, subjects will be 
offered enrollment into a 4-year extension study in accordance with regulatory authority

1.3.2. Dosing Rationale 
The clinical target for DTX401 is to achieve euglycemia in the fasting state (defined as glucose 
≥ 54 mg/dL [ ≥ 3.0 mmol/L]). The determination of a clinical starting dose is b ased on available 
nonclinical data with DTX401, including the minimal effective dose (MED) and optimal 
effective dose of DTX401 in mice, clinical experience with other AAV8 products, and known 
limitations when scaling between species.  
To provide information to support the selection of a safe clinical starting dose, Ultragenyx 
Pharmaceutical Inc. (Ultragenyx) conducted a pharmacology proof-of-concept efficacy study in 
G6pc-/- mice to characterize the biological activity of 2 different transgenes in an animal  model 
of GSDIa and a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity and biodistribution study in male and female wild -type C57 black  6 (C57BL/6) mice.  
In order to estimate the allometric scaling needed for AAV8 -mediated delivery of the G6PC 
transgene in this stu dy between mice and humans, the following 2 data sets using AAV- mediated 
transfer of human factor IX were examined: the uniQure data set (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) 
(uniQure, 2015; uniQure, 2016)  and the Nathwani data set (Nathwani et al., 2007; Nathwani et 
al., 2011a ; Nathwani et al., 2011b) . The AAV serotype 5 vector used in the uniQure studies was 
shown to have a 10-fold scaling between mouse and human ( uniQure, 2015; uniQure, 2016) . The 
AAV8 vector used in the Nathwani studies supports a 10-fold scaling from mouse to nonhuman primates and a 4 -fold scaling between nonhuman primates and humans, for a total of 40 -fold 
between mouse and human ( Nathwani et al., 2007; Nathwani et al., 2011a ; Nathwani et al., 
2011b) . Therefore, when considering a clinical dosing rationale, in light of the available 
comparison data between mice and humans, it seems reasonable to consider a 10 - to 40-fold 
increase in dose from mice to humans to achieve similar target levels for the expression and activity of G6Pase. The MED for DTX401 was 5  × 10
11 GC/kg in neonatal G6pc-/- mice that 
were observed  for a 2 -week period. Due to the growth of the animals during this time, vector 
dilution in the liver also needs to be considered and was estimated to be approximately 2.5- to 5-fold ( Wang et al., 2012 ). Similar results were reported in G6pc
-/- mice treated at 2 weeks of age, 
where there was an approximate 2.7- fold decrease in G6Pase activity between 4 and 6 weeks 
after dosing (from 243.3% to 87.6% of wild- type activity) (Yiu et al., 2010) . Therefore, both the 
increase in dose due to allo metric scaling from mice to humans and vector dilution were 
considered when choosing candidate doses of DTX401 for this study. The use of these correction 
factors provides a range for the potential MED in humans (Table 1). The mi nimum dose that 
could provide benefit in humans is estimated to fall between 1.0 × 1012 GC/kg (ie, a 2-fold 
increase) and 8.0  × 1012 GC/kg (ie, a 16- fold increase).

Abbreviations: GC  = genome copies; MED  = minimal effective dose; NHP  = nonhuman primate.  
In comparison to the clinical development of traditional small molecule and biologic therapies, 
clinical studies for AAV -mediated gene transfer have an additional consideration: after initial 
dosing, it is expected that subjects who are administered DTX401 will develop neutralizing 
antibodies to AAV8 and will likely receive limited benefit from subsequent dosi ng with this 
vector. Therefore, unlike classic dose -escalation studies, there is a greater focus on targeting 
efficacy in addition to safety. Taking into consideration the uncertai nty in projecting a human 
dose, as noted in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance ( FDA, 20 15), a dose of 
2.0 × 1012 GC/kg, which is twice the minimum projected human MED (1.0 × 1012 GC/kg), was 
selected as the starting dose for the Phase 1/2 study (Table  1). This dose is expected to provide a 
reasonable chance fo r study subjects to achieve a clinically meaningful normalization of glucose 
and will provide critical safety information in humans for DTX401.  
A standard approach for dose finding in gene transfer studies is to adjust the dose (up or down) in half- log inc rements; therefore, if 2.0 × 10
12 GC/kg is projected to provide G6Pase activity at 
the minimum level to prevent hypoglycemia, a dose that is a half-log more is 6.0 × 1012 GC/kg. 
The highest clinical dose planned is 1.0 × 1013 GC/kg. The candidate doses of 2.0 × 1012 GC/kg, 
6.0 × 1012 GC/kg, and 1.0 × 1013 GC/kg in this study (Study 401GSDIA01) are also being 
studied in the DTX301 Phase 1/2 clinical study (Study 301OTC01) for ornithine transcarbamylase, another gene transfer study in an inborn error of metab olism condition, based 
on similar allometric scaling derived from mouse MED da ta. 
Based on existing safety data from clinical studies using AAV- mediated gene transfer (including 
multiple hemophilia programs), substantial toxicity in the predicted therapeutic range is not anticipated. Ultragenyx is also taking into account the amount of DTX401 Chemistry, 
Manufacturing, and Controls material that can be produced over the anticipated timeline of this 
Phase 1/2 study and the maximal feasible dose of vector that can be administered to mice in GLP 
toxicology studies (based on dose volume and concentration of vector). Assuming that an MTD 
is not identified in nonclinical studies, the proposed dose-finding approach for this Phase 1/2 
study is consistent with the FDA  Guidance for Industry on the Considerations for the Design of 
Early -Phase Cli nical Trials of Cellular and Gene Therapy Products, which indicates that 
achieving a specified target range of exposure is the focus of a cellular or gene therapy program when “t here are significant practical limits of the dose of the product that can be p roduced or 
delivered” (FDA, 2015) .

3.1. Study Overview  
Study 401GSDIA01 is a Phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety and dose-finding 
study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DTX401 in adults with GS DIa. 
The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of single IV doses of DTX401, 
including the incidence of DLTs. The secondary objective of the study is to establish a dose of DTX401 that achieves symptom- free euglycemia (glucose ≥ 54  mg/dL [≥ 3.0 mmol/L]) in a 
setting of a controlled fasting challenge to allow further clinical development.  
DTX401 will be administered as a single peripheral IV infusion. Th e follo wing doses (per 
kilogram of body weight) may  be evaluated using a CRM to estimate the MTD  of DTX401: 
• Dose 1 : 2.0 × 10
12 GC/kg  
• Dose 2 : 6.0 × 1012 GC/kg  
• Dose 3 : 1.0 × 1013 GC/kg  
Eligible subjects may be enrolled into 1 of the following cohorts of 3 subjects each and receive a 
single IV infusion of DTX401. 
• Cohort 1: Dose 1 (2.0 × 1012 GC/kg)  with a reactive steroid regimen (prednisone 
starting dose of 40 mg/day) 
• Cohort 2:  Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) with a reactive steroid regimen (prednisone 
starting dose of 40 mg/day) 
• Cohort 3:  Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) with an optimized react ive steroid regimen 
(prednisone starting dose of 60 mg/day) 
• Cohort 4:  Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) with a prophylactic steroid regimen  
A cohort may be expanded to include additional subjects to confirm the findings for the cohort.  
Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 w ere dosed at a minimum of 2 weeks ( 14 days ) apart . Subjects in 
subsequent cohorts will be dosed at a minimum of 1 week (7 days) apart. 
For Cohorts 1 and 2, t here was a minimum of 12 weeks ( 84 days ) between dosing of the last 
subject in a dosing cohort and the first subject in the next dosing cohort. After the third subject in 
each cohort reache d the 12-week time point, the CRM ( Section  10.2.1)  proposed a dose for the 
next cohort using the collected data from the previous cohort. The decision to proceed w as made 
after the DMC evaluated at least 12  weeks of safety data for all subjects in the dosing cohort, as 
outlined in the DMC chart er (Section  9.3). There w ere no intracohort dose escalations. 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
49 
Confidential  After reviewing Week 12 data from all subjects in Cohort 1, the DMC concluded that it was safe 
to enroll 3 additional subjects into Cohort 2 at Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) . After reviewing 
Week  12 data from all subjects in Cohort 2, the DMC concluded that it was safe to enroll 
3 additional subjects into Cohort 3 at Dose 2 (6.0 × 1012 GC/kg) with an optimized reactive 
steroid regimen. An optimized reactive ster oid regimen is expected to manage the elevations in 
liver aminotransferase levels observed in Cohorts 1 and 2 following DTX401 administration. 
If the optimized reactive steroid regimen does not sufficiently manage elevations in liver aminotransferase level s in Cohort 3, then Cohort 4 will be enrolled. Enrollment into Cohort 4 
may begin following completion of enrollment into Cohort 3. 
Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will receive reactive oral steroid treatment for possible 
vector-induced hepatitis if liver aminotransferase levels increase following treatment with 
DTX401. The Investigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead, will consider 
starting oral steroid treatment for possible vector- induced hepatitis if a subject’s ALT levels 
increase from  the subject’s baseline or recently drawn levels, and are considered by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to treatment with DTX401 ( Section  8.2.6.2.1).  For Cohort  3, 
the reactive steroid regimen was modifie d to include a higher prednisone starting dose of 
60 mg/day vs  40 mg/day. 
Subjects in Cohort  4 will receive a prophylactic oral steroid regimen to prevent possible 
vector- induced hepatitis ( Section  8.2.6.2.2).  The Investigator may consider addi tional 
assessments or medical care, such as hospitalization or daily clinic visits, during steroid 
administration if, in the Investigator’s medical judgment, these measures would provide 
additional safety benefits.  
The contro lled fasting challenge was also  modified  following DMC review of Week 12 data 
from subjects in Cohort 2. To minimize a potential insulin spike that could result in abrupt 
hypoglycemia and normalize baseline glucose levels, t he recommended target carbohydra te 
range of the prefasting challenge dinner meal was decr eased from 20 g to 30 g to 15 g to  20 g, 
and the prefasting challenge cornstar ch dose was decreased from 35  g to 5 g. 
However , further analysis and review of fasting challenge data after changing the prefasting 
cornstarch dose to 5g showed significantly lower fasting times in cohorts 2 (W52 and W78) and 
3 (W24, W32 and W52). In most instances, low post-prandial levels of blood glucose associates, 
persistence of high circulating insulin levels, and slow cortisol respo nse to hypoglycemia make it 
challenging to interpret these results. Available CGM recordings have shown an absence of 
nocturnal hypoglycemia in these subjects despite an overall reduced frequency and total amount of cornstarch. The reason that several subjects can now sleep through the night at home without experiencing hypoglycemia in the absence of cornstarch consumption, but have shorter time to 
hypoglycemia during the inpatient fasting challenge is unclear . It could be attributed to the 
artificial threshold of 60 mg/dL for stopping the fasting challenge . This threshold may  not allow 
adequate glucose release to be induced in subjects with higher insulin and lower cortisol levels. 
In the home setting, subjects clearly do better as thei r glucose release seems to be better induced , 
thereby preventing their glucose levels  from falling to dangerous levels. 
With Protocol Amendment 6, t he dinner meal will be personalized for each subject, and will 
include a target carbohydrate range and overa ll composition in protein, fats and dietary fibers  
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
50 
Confidential  that is  as close as possible to the subject’s most current dinner prescription but not higher than 
the carbohydrate content of the dinner consumed at their baseline fasting challenge. The 
prefasting cornst arch dose and time of consumption will be per the respective subject’s most 
recent cornstarch prescription  and daily regimen at home . In addition, the threshold for stopping 
the test was lowered to 54  mg/dL (3  mmol/L) or when the subjects present signs and symptoms 
of hypoglycemia. Justification of the new threshold is based on the fact that signs and symptoms 
of hypoglycemia associated with an adrenergic reaction and cerebral glucopenia and most 
physiological hormonal and metabolic responses to hypoglycemia may not occur in GSDIa 
subject s until they reach these levels of blood glucose values. CGM recording during the fasting 
test will provide continuous glucose measurement data that will allow Investigators to closely 
monitor subjects when they reach the lower r ange of blood glucose ( ie, below 60 mg/dL) 
(Section  8.1.1).  
Study enrollment will be stopped and the DMC and regulators will be notified if, at any time during the study, any of the safety stopping criteria are m et (Section  3.2.4 ). 
Subjects will be followed for 52  weeks following DTX401 administration. After completion of 
the Week 52 visit or early withdrawal, subjects will be offered enrollment into  a 4-year extension 
study to evaluate the long- term (a total of 5  years) safety and efficacy of DTX401. 
3.2. Overall Study Duration and Follow -Up 
The study is anticipated to enroll approximately 12  subjects at up to 12 study sites globally. The 
duration of the study for each subje ct is defined as the date the subject provides written informed 
consent through the Week 52 visit. Subjects will be in the study for approximately 60 weeks 
(including the S creening Period).  
Subjects will be ask ed to complete up to 4 inpatient study site visits (each approximately 24 to 
48 hours in length) and 23  outpatient or home study visits (each approximately 1.5 to 2 hours in 
length). Outpatient or home study visits may be performed  at a second participating study site 
other than the dosing site. The s chedule of study visits and the assessments and procedures to be 
performed at each study visit are listed in the Schedule of Events (Table  6).

Confidential  Subjects with screening assessment resul ts that do not fulfill eligibility requirements may have 
those assessments repeated if the study team determines that the underlying issue may resolve or 
reverse during the Screening P eriod (eg, S creening laboratory assessments, such  as liver function 
tests and triglyceride levels). Only the screening assessments that do not meet eligibility 
requirements need to be repeated, but any or all screening procedures may be repeated at the Investigator's discretion.  
Subjects who do not meet eligibility requirement s within the Screening P eriod are  considered 
screen failures. Subjects who are screen failures may be rescreened once during the study.  In this 
case, only AAV8 neutralizing antibody testing ( Section  8.2.6.6) and the screening assessment s 
that did not me et eligibility requirements need  to be repeated , but any or all screening procedures 
may be repeated at the Investigator's discretion.  
3.2.2. Baseline Period  
Subjects will be admitted to the study site or hospital on Day 0 and will be discharged 
approximately 24 hours after administration of DTX401 (on Day 2). Each subject will remain on his or her prescribed diet for the duration of the inpatient stay.  
A blood sample for measurement of lipid level s will be collected on the morning of hospital 
admission. The sample should be collected at least 2 to 4 hours after the subject’s last meal.  
3.2.2.1. Baseline Visit – Day 0 
The assessments and procedures to be performed during the Baseline (Day  0) visit are listed in 
the Schedule of Events (Table  6).  will be 
performed after the cont rolled fasting challenge is complete to avoid having to replace the sensor  
prior to the fasting challenge . (Section  8.1.4).  
Subjects will participate in a controlled fasting challenge. The Investigator or delegated sub-
investigator will review the results of all laboratory assessments performed on the first day of the inpatient visit, including cortisol. Subjects should wear their CGM device throughout the fasting 
challenge, and should not change the sensor prior to the assessment . Before the controlled fasting 
challenge begins, the study site will provide dinner for the subject. The dinner meal will be 
personalized for each sub ject and will include a target carbohydrate range and overall 
composition in protein, fats and dietary fibers that is as close as possible to the subject’s most current dinner dietary prescription. The content of the dinner and quantities consumed will be recorded.  
After dinner, subjects will be given an oral dose of cornstarch equivalent per their most recent cornstarch prescription at approximately the same time that they typically take it, but no later than 3 hours post dinner. The time of ingestion of prefasting cornstarch and the amount 
consumed will be recorded. After the cornstarch is ingested, the controlled fasting challenge will 
begin, and the start time will be recorded accordingly. If subjects do not rece ive cornstarch 
overnight, the fasting test will begin after they complete their dinner. Subjects will be instructed 
to minimize activity after they finish eating dinner until the end of the fasting challenge .

Confidential  During the fast, subjects may not ingest any food or drink other than water.  The controlled 
fasting challenge will end when the subject’s glucose level decreases to < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0

hours without hypoglycemia, whichever occurs first. The stop time of the controlled fasting 
challenge will be recorded. At the end of the controlled fasting challenge, the subject’s 
hypoglycemia should be treated per the institution’s standard procedure, which may include 
providing t he subject with a meal, cornstarch, or IV glucose, if medically indicated.  
Blood samples for measurement of cortisol, fatty acid, glucagon, insulin, C -peptide, growth 
hormone, insulin- like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), adrenocorticotropic horm one 
(ACTH), alanine and ketone levels will be collected at the beginning and end of the fasting 
challenge, or more frequently at the Investigator’s discretion. A final sample for glucose, lactate, 
growth hormone, IGFBP1, ACTH, and cortisol measurement will  be collected 30 minutes after 
the end of the controlled fasting challenge. Samples should be prepared and transported to the 
local laboratory in accordance with the site’s standard procedures. Blood samples for STAT 
analysis of glucose and lactate will be collected per the schedule of event s. Capillary glucose will 
also be assessed.   
Urine will be collected over 24  hours for the determination of total protein, microalbumin, and 
creatinine. The collection of urine can overlap with the controlled fasting cha llenge. A  
will be performed after the controlled fasting challenge is complete.   
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 4, the Investigator will initiate a prophylactic steroid regimen after completion of the controlled fasting challenge and before DTX401 administration  
(Section  8.2.6.2.2).  
3.2.2.2. Baseline Visit – Day 1 
The assessments and procedures to be performed on Day  1 are listed in the Schedule of Events 
(Table  6). 
Following completion of the Day 0 assessments (ie, controlled fasting challenge and 24 -hour 
urine collection), subjects will receive a single, peripheral IV infusion of DTX401. Safety  (vital  sign measurements [ Sectio n 8.2.1] , clinical laboratory assessments [ Section  8.2.6] , 
and AEs and SAEs [ Section  9.1]) will be monitored over 24 hours following infusion of 
DTX401 ( Table 6) . Any AEs that occur during this 24-hour observation period will be treated 
with appropriate supportive and medical care deemed nece ssary for the well -being of the subject. 
Subjects will be discharged after a 24 -hour observation period. Subjects in Cohort 3 will be 
discharg ed with prednisone to allow rapid treatment of possible vector- induced hepatitis if it 
occurs following treatment with DTX401 (Section 8.2.6.2.1).  Subjects in Co hort 4 will be 
discharged with prednisone per the prophylactic steroid regimen (Section  8.2.6.2.2).  
3.2.3. Follow- up Period  
Subjects will be asked to visit the study site at a minimum of every 3 to 4 days through Week 12, 
or longer if clinically indicated  (Table  6). Following the Week 12 visit, subjects will visit the 

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
56 
Confidential  study site approximately once every 12 weeks through Week  36 and at Week  52 or their early 
withdrawal from the study  (Table  6). 
3.2.3.1. Outpatient Study Site or Home Visits  
Subjects will be asked to provide clinical laboratory samples at a minimum of every 3 to 4 days 
through Week 12 of the study, or longer if clinically ind icated  (Table  6). Subjects may have the 
option of having these samples collected at their homes by clinically trained and qualified 
personnel (if arranged  by the I nvestigator), unless there is a scheduled study site visit that the  
subject must attend in person ( Table  6). 
During these visits, a blood sample will be collected for determination of clinical chemistry 
(including liver function tests) and sent to the central laboratory . A second blood sample will be 
collected for liver function tests and sent to the local laboratory (STAT sample; Section  8.2.6.2) . 
Saliva, urine, and stool samples will also be collected during these visits for assessment of vector shedding until at least 3 consecutive ne gative results are obtained from each sample matrix 
(Section  8.2.6.10) . A blood sample will be collected for determination of cell-mediated immune 
response to AAV8 and G6Pase testing approximately weekly (Section  8.2.6.7).  
3.2.3.2. Outpatient Visits  
Subjects will visit the study sit e on an outpatient basis at Weeks 4, 6, and 36 for efficacy and 
safety assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Table  6). 
3.2.3.3. Inpatient Visits  
Subjects will be admitted to the study site or hospital at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 for an  
(Section  8.1.4) , the controlled fasting challen ge (Section  8.1.1) , and 24-hour urine 
collection (S ection  8.2.6.5) . Each inpatient visit will last approximately 24 hours. Each subject 
will r emain on his or her prescribed diet for the duration of each inpatient stay. The assessments 
and procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Schedule of Events (Table  6). The 
will be performed on the day after the controlled fasting challenge to avoid having to 
replace the sensor prior to the fasting challenge.  
A blood sample for measurement of lipid lev els will be collected on the morning of hospital 
admission at approximately the same time as col lected on Day 0. The sample should be collected 
at least 2 to 4 hours after the subject’s last meal.  
Subjects will participate in a controlled fasting challenge (Section  8.1.1) . The Investigator or 
delegated sub -investigator will review the results of all laboratory assessments performed on the 
first day of the inpatient visit, including the latest cortisol values. Subjects should wear their 
CGM device throughout the fasting challenge, and should not change the s ensor prior to the 
assessmen t. Before the controlled fasting challenge begins, the study site will provide dinner for 
the subject. The dinner meal will be personalized for each subject and will include a target carbohydrate range and overall composition in protein, fats and dietary fibers that is as close as 
possible to the subject’s most current dinner dietary prescription . The content of the dinner and 
quantities consumed will be recorded.  

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
57 
Confidential  After dinner, subjects will be given  an oral dose of cornstarch equivalent per their most recent 
cornstarch prescription at approximately the same time that they typically take it, but no later 
than 3 hours post dinner. The time of  ingestion of prefasting cornstarch and the amount 
consumed w ill be recorded. After the cornstarch is ingested, the controlled fasting challenge will 
begin, and the start time will be recorded accordingly. If subjects do not receive cornstarch overnight, the fasting test will begin after they complete their dinner. Subjects will be instructed 
to minimize activity after they finish eating dinner until the end of the fasting challenge . 
During the fast, subjects may not ingest any food or drink other than water. The controlled fasting challenge will end when the subject ’s glucose level decreases to < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 
mmol/L) or when the subjects experience signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, or when the fast reaches 15 hours without hypoglycemia, whichever occurs first. The stop time of the controlled fasting challenge wi ll be recorded .  
At the end of the controlled fasting challenge, the subject’s hypoglycemia should be treated per the institution’s standard procedure, which may include providing the subject with a meal, cornstarch, or IV glucose, if medically indicated. 
Blood samples for measurement of cortisol, fatty acid, glucagon, insulin, C-peptide, growth 
hormone, IGFBP1, ACTH, alanine and ketone levels will be collected at the beginning and end 
of the fasting challenge, or more frequently at the Investigator’s discretion.  A final sample for 
glucose, lactate, growth hormone, IGFBP1, ACTH, and cortisol measurement will be collected  
30 minutes after the end of the controlled fasting challenge. Samples should be prepared and 
transported to the  local l aboratory in accordance with the site’s standard p rocedures. Blood 
samples for STAT analysis of glucose and lactate will be collected per the schedule of events. Capillary glucose will also be assessed.  Urine will be collected over 24  hours (Section  8.2.6.5) 
for the determination of total protein,  microalbumin, and creatinine. The collection of urine can 
overlap with the controlled fasting challenge.  Subjects will be discharged following the completion of the 24- hour urine collection and the .

The study product and post treatment study samples should be handled using standard universal 
precautions.  
6.3. Treatment Schedule and Administration  
6.3.1. Administration of DTX401  
Subjects will receive a single peripheral IV infusion of DTX401 on Day 1, administered by qualified  study personnel, as designated by the I nvestigator (Table  6). The dose will be 
determined by the cohort and candidate dose ( Section  3.1). 
The dose of DTX401 to be administered will be calculated using the subject’s weight recorded at Screening. The subject’s weight will be verified on Day 0, prior to administration of DTX401, to ensure that their current weight is within 10% of their screen ing weight ( Section  8.2.1 ). 
Any subject weighing >  100 kg (> 220  lb) will be dosed as if his or her weight is 100 kg. Prior to 
infusion, all infusion bag labels will be checked by the study site pharmacist and a minimum of 
2 medical personnel charged with administration of DTX401. 
The study site must be equipped with emergency resuscitation capabilities. On Day 1, an IV 
catheter will be inserted into a peripheral vein and flushed with saline. 
Detailed instructions for dose preparation and subsequent infusion of DTX401 are provided in 
the pharmacy manual.

8.1. Efficacy Assessmen ts 
Planned time points for all efficacy measurements in the study are listed in  Table  6. 
8.1.1. Symptom -Free Euglycemia  (Controlled Fasting Chal lenge)  
The subjec t's ability to maintain symptom -free euglycemia during a controlled fasting challenge 
will be assessed at time points specified in the Schedule of Events. However, if clinically 
indicated, the c ontrolled fasting challenge can also be perfo rmed at an unscheduled visit.  
The controlled fasting challenge requires a 24 -hour inpatient stay in a hospital or research facility 
and will be performed after all other study visit assessments (except ) have been  completed 
and the required laboratory assessments (as specified below) have been  reviewed by the 
Investigator (or a subinvestigator assigned to review results and make clinical decisions per the 
site delegation log). Subjects should wear  their CGM device throughout the fasting challenge, 
and should not change the sensor prior to the assessment.   
If a subject is suspected to have HPA axis impairment (eg, due to prolonged steroid treatment ;  
may be confirmed by morning cortisol or stimulation tests ), the fasting challenge may have to be 
resched uled to a later date in order to ensure subject safety and provide interpretable results.  
Before the controlled fasting challenge begins, the study site will provide dinner for the subject. 
The dinner meal will be personalized for each subject, and will in clude a target carbohydrate 
range and overall composition in protein, fats and dietary fibers that is as close as possible to the 
subject’s most current dinner prescription , but not higher in  carbohydrate content than the dinner 
consumed at their baseline fasting challenge.  The start and stop time of the dinner meal and its 
full dietary composition including amount of carbohydrates consumed will be recorded. After dinner, subjects will be given an oral dose of cornstarch equivalent per their most recent corns tarch prescription, at approximately the same time that they typically take it, but no later 
than 3 hours post dinner. The amount of cornstarch administered should not be higher than that consumed by the subject at the baseline fasting challenge.  The tim e of ingestion of prefasting 
cornstarch and the amount consumed will be recorded. After the cornstarch is ingested, the 
controlled fasting challenge will begin, and the start time will be recorded accordingly. If a 
subject does not receive cornstarch befor e going to bed at the time of the CFC , the fasting 
challenge will start after they complete their dinner. Subjects will be instructed to minimize 
activity after they finish eating dinner until the end of the controlled f asting challenge .   
During the fast, s ubjects may not ingest any food or drink other than water. The controlled 
fasting c hallenge will end when the subject’s glucose level decreases to < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 
mmol/L) or when the subjects experience signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, or when the fast reaches 15 hours without hypoglycemia, whichever occurs first. The stop time of the c ontrolled 
fasting challenge will be recorded. At the end of the c ontrolled fasting c hallenge, the  subject’s 
hypoglycemia should be treated per the institution’s standard  procedure, which may include 
providing the subject with a meal, cornstarch, or IV glucose, if medically indicated.  

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
67 
Confidential  In cases where the controlled fasting challenge  is terminated prematurely before the subject 
reaches a glucose level of < 54mg/dL  or without the subject experiencing signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, or due to any deviation in the fasting challenge protocol, an ad hoc fasting 
challenge may be scheduled within 6 weeks from the scheduled fasting challenge .   
Laboratory sample collecti on befor e and during the controlled fasting c hallenge  
On the morning of inpatient visit for the controlled fasting c hallenge, after vital signs and other 
non-interventional assessments have been performed, samples will be collected for standard 
clinical ch emistry (including lipid levels), hematology, coagulation panel, and urinalysis. These 
samples should be collected at least 2 to 4 hours after the subject’s last meal prior to admission and sent to the central lab. A sample for STAT AST and ALT level analy sis will also be 
collected at this time and sent to the local laboratory; the Investigator or delegated 
subinvestigator should review the results before starting the controlled fasting challenge. 
All subjects should have a morning cortisol and ACTH measurement prior to their baseline 
fasting challenge. Cortisol and ACTH results should be reviewed by the I nvestigator or delegate 
before starting the fasting challenge. Abnormal morning cortisol results might require postponing 
the fasting challenge until further HPA axis testing is performed.   
For subjects with suspected HPA axis dysfunction (eg, after prolonged steroid treatment) 
supplemental tests can be conducted (eg , stimulation tests) before deciding if it is safe to conduct 
the fasting challenge.  In most cases, m orning cortisol and supplemental tests will be conducted 
one week prior to the visit. It is also possible to perform these tests at the site on Day 1 of the visit under the conditions that all results will be available prior to the beginning o f the CFC.  
Total urine voided over the 24- hour period starting at the time of inpatient admission will be 
collected during the controlled f asting challenge.  
Blood samples for measurement of cortisol, ACTH, free fatty acid s, glucagon, insulin, C-peptide, 
growth hormone, IGFBP1, alanine and ketone levels (3-hydroxy butyrate) will be collected at the 
beginning (ie, immediately after the post- dinner dose of cornstarch , or immediately after dinner 
for subjects who do not take a post-dinner dose of cornstarch ) and end of the controlled fasting 
challenge , or more frequently at the Investigator’s discretion. A final sample for glucose, lactate, 
growth hormone, IGFBP1,  ACTH and cortisol measurement will be collected  30 minutes after 
the end of the controlled fastin g challenge. Samples should be prepared and transported to the 
local laboratory in accordance with the site’s standard procedures. 
Blood samples for STAT analysis of glucose and lactate will be collected through an indwelling 
catheter (central or peripheral) at the following time points:  
• At the beginning of the fast (ie, immediately after the post-dinner dose of cornstarch, or 
immediately after dinner for subjects who do not take a post-dinner dose of cornstarch) 
• Approximately every 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) until the glucose level decreases to ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0

< 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) or when the subjects experience signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, or when the fast reaches 15 h ours without hypoglycemia, whichever occurs 
first 
Samples should be prepared and transported to the local laboratory in accordance with the site’s standard procedures. To ensure the safety of the study subjects, results from these test s should be 
available within 30 minutes after the blood sample collection. Capillary glucose will be 
performed at the same time points  as blood samples for STAT analysis of glucose and lactate. 
Results of the capillary glucose and readings from CGM at corr esponding time points will be 
noted on a controlled fasting challenge results sheet.  
8.1.2. Continuous Glucose Monitoring  
Supplemental information on glucose level trends will be collected using a continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device. The site will provide a CGM device to the subject during the 
Screening Period after determining that the subject is eligible for the study (Table  6). 
Subjects will be educated on the appropriate care and use of the CGM device and sensors, and 
instructed to wear the CGM device through the Week 52 visit or early withdrawal. D ata from the 
subject’s CGM  device will be trans ferred to the Sponsor throughout the study, including a f inal 
data transfer at the end of the Week 52 visit or early withdrawal. Details regard ing the care and 
use of the CGM device and sensors and data transfer to the Sponsor are provided in the Manual

If a subject is unable to use the assigned CGM, t he subject should collect morning glucose levels 
at least 2 mornings per week throughout the study ( Table  6). Subjects should adhere to their 
prescribed ove rnight cornstarch diet. Morning  glucose levels should be measured using the 
subject’s own glucose monitoring device be fore taking their morning dose of cornstarch . 
The collection date, collection time, glucose level, and prior day’s overnight cornstarch dose 
taken should be collected on the Morning Glucose Level monitoring worksheet provided by the 
site. Subjects will be instructed to bring the completed worksheets to each study visit. 
Data  collected on the worksheet will be captured on the appropriate page of the eCRF.

8.1.6. Endpoint Outcomes Interviews  
Up to two 30- minute scripted telephone interviews will be conducted during the Week 24 and 
52 study visits to better quantify the subject experience in the study. The interviews will be 
conducted by a third-party vendor, Endpoint Outcomes, specializing in the capture of caregiver 
and subject-reported data. Endpoint Outcome uses a script as an  interview guide to serve as a 
basis for the discussion. The  interview will be conducted by phone.  

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
70 
Confidential  The subject has consented to the interview per the study’s main ICF.  However, prior to the start 
for the interview, Endpoint  Outcomes  will verbally ask for the subject’s consent for the interview 
to be audio- recorded. With the subject’s verbal consent, the interv iew will be audio -recorded, 
and the interviewer will proceed through a script. If the subject does not give permission for the 
session to be audio- recorded, the interview will not proceed. Subjects  will be asked about their 
experience in the study. They may refuse to answer any question in the interview and may stop at 
any time.  
Site staff will facilitate the phone call so that the subject’s contact information remains 
anonymous. Personal  information (including subject’s name and telephone number) w ill rem ain 
anonymous and will not be provided to the Sponsor or Endpoint Outcomes. Subjects will be 
identified only by their study specific subject IDs.  
All digital recordings will be stored by Endpoint Outcomes in a secure place where only 
Endpoints Outc ome per sonnel directly related to this study will be able to access it. The audio 
interviews will be transcribed by a transcription company under contract and a confidentiality 
agreement, who will provide the written transcripts  that will be  further analyz ed by Endpoint 
Outcomes. The transcription company is also contracted to ensure that transcripts  will not 
contain any personal identifying information ( eg, reference of first names) that  may have been 
revealed during the interview process; personal  identifying in formation will be removed and will 
not appear in the final transcript. D ata from the interview will be shared with the Sponsor only 
after all identifying information has been removed . 
8.2. Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety ass essments are li sted in the Schedule of Events ( Table  6). 
Safety will be assessed based on AEs, SAEs, vital sign measurements, complete and targeted physical examination findings, ECG results, documented symptomatic hypoglycemic events, 
clinical laboratory assessments (clinical chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, coagulation panel, and urinalysis), vector shedding, vector genome determination, measurement 
of neutralizing antibody titer to AAV8, measurement of AAV8 binding antibody 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), assessment of any cell-mediated immune responses to AAV8 and G6Pase, and measurement of anti -G6Pase antibodies.  
8.2.1. Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will be made at the time points specified in the Sched ule of Events 
(Table  6). During the study, vital sign measurements are to be collected before any stimulating or 
anxiety-provoking procedures (eg, phlebotomy). Vital sign measurements will include heart rate, 
blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and respiratory rate. Height (at the Screening visit only) 
and weight will also b e recorded.  
• On Day  0, weight will be measured to ensure that the weight is within 10% of the 
screening weight used to calculate the dose of D TX401. Subjects with a confirmed 
change in weight that is >  10% from Screening should be further evaluated to exclude 
the presence of an acute condition or illness. If a benign explanation for the weight 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
71 
Confidential  change is identified and documented, DTX401 can be given and dosed using the 
weight obtained on Day 0. 
• Vital signs should be measured with the subject having rested for at least 5  minutes 
beforehand. It is preferred that the measurement be late with the subject rested, rather than on time with the subject not sufficiently rested. If the subject is not sufficiently 
rested, this needs to be stated in the source documents.  
• On Day  1, vital signs will be measured at predose, approximately 5 minutes, and 
0.5 (±  5 minutes), 1  (± 5 minutes), 4 and 8 hours (±  15 minu tes) after the start of 
DTX401 infusion. Vital signs will also be measured approximately 22 hours 
(± 1 hour) after the start of infusion, prior to subject discharge.  
• It is acceptable for heart rate to be captured from the 12 -lead ECG ( Section  8.2.3).  
Vital sign measurements will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The medical monitor should be notified of any clinically significant changes or abnormal value in vital sign measurements ( Section  9.1.2).  If, in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator, a 
clinically significant change or abnormal vital sign measurement is observed, it should be recorded as an AE or SAE, as defined in Section  9.1.2, on t he appropriate pages of the eCRF. 
8.2.2. Physical Examination  
A complete or targeted physical examination will be performed at the time points specified in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table  6). 
A complete physical examination will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; skin; abdomen with documentation of liver and spleen size; and the endocrine, metabolic, 
neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastro intestinal, and musculoskeletal systems.  
A targeted physical examination will include assessment of the skin, the abdomen with 
documentation of liver and spleen size, and the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems.  
Physical examination f indings will be captured on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
8.2.3. Electrocardiograms  
An ECG will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table  6). 
• A single 12- lead ECG will be obtained at Scr eening, on Day 0 (B aseline), predose on 
Day 1, and at Week  52, using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart 
rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT intervals.  
Twelve -lead ECGs should be measured with the subject having rested for at  least 5  minutes 
beforeh and. It is preferred that the measurement be late with the subject rested, rather than on 
time with the subject not sufficiently rested. If the subject is not sufficiently rested, this needs to 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
72 
Confidential  be stated in the source documents. Ele ctrocardiogram results w ill be recorded on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF.  
8.2.4. Liver Ultrasound  
An ultrasound of the liver will be conducted during the Screening Period. The ultrasound will be 
conducted and assessed at the study site. Ultrasound results will  be recorded on the appr opriate 
page of the eCRF.  
8.2.5. Hypoglycemic Events 
At each visit, the study site will instruct subjects on proper home glucose monitoring, the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, and supplemental glucose treatment if needed. During Scree ning, t he study site will record the number of symptomatic hypoglycemic events 
that occurred during the previous 52 weeks in the eCRF.  During each subsequent visit, the study 
site will record the number of symptomatic hypoglycemic events that occurred since the last visit in the eCRF  (Table  6). 
8.2.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory tests, including ALT, will be closely monitored throughout the duration of the study. Inves tigators will receive flagged notification  of any laboratory values that are outside of the 
normal range. Any abnormal laboratory test results (clinical chemistry [including liver function 
tests], hematology, coagulation panel, urinalysis, or other laboratory parameters), including those 
that worsen from baseline or are felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the I nvestigator, are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs (Section  9.1.2).  
However, any clinically significant safety  assessments that are associated with GSDIa are not to 
be reported as AEs, unless  they are judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected 
for the subject’s condition.  
All laboratory tests with results that are significantly abnormal during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline. If such values do not return to normal within a period judged reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified 
and the Sponsor notified. 
Samples of bl ood, urine, saliva, and stool will be collected for study assessments. Any samples 
remaining at the end of the study may be stored for up to 15 years and analyzed to better 
understand the effect of DTX401 on GSDIa or other metabolic deficiencies. The choice to allow 
retention and future analysis will be optional.  
8.2.6.1. Clinical Laboratory Parameters

standard procedures. Details for the preparation and shipment of all other samples will be 
provided by the central or specialty laboratory. Reference ranges for all parameters will be 
provided to the study site by the central or specialty laboratory. 
If additional nonprotocol- specified laboratory assessments are performed at the study site’s local 
laborato ry and result in a change in subject management or the results are considered clinically 
significant by the Investigator (eg, SAE or AE), the results must be captured and sent to the 
Sponsor along with other study data, as defined in Section  9.1.2. 
A laboratory parameter may be repeated if there is any concern about the values obtained. 
8.2.6.2. Elevation of Liver Function Tests  
In clinical studies with AAV -mediated gene transfer, a transient increase in liver 
aminotrans ferases and a concurrent decline in transgene expression have been observed (Manno 
et al., 2006 ; Nathwani et  al., 2011b; Nathwani et al., 2014) . This has been hypothesized to be due 
to the activation of capsid -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and destruction of transduced liver 
cells (Mingozzi et al., 2007) . However, in mice, T cells activated against AAV capsid were not 
able to target and eliminate transduced hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007a ; Li et al., 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
74 
Confidential  2007b; Siders et al., 2009)  unless the trans duced hepatocytes co -expressed t he wild -type AAV 
capsid protein ( Li et al., 2007a ). 
The inability to reproduce the observed effects in animal models has made it difficult to assess 
the validity of the hypothesis or to develop strategies to overcome or minimize aminotrans ferase 
elevations. Despite a lack of clear resolution that activation of cytotoxic T  lymphocytes leads to a 
reduction in transgene expression from hepatocytes, appropr iate precautions have been 
incorporated into this study. In addition to monitoring for capsid- specific and G6Pase- specific 
T-cell activation, subjects will receive oral steroid treatment for possible vector -induced hepatitis 
if liver function test s increase following treatment with DTX4 01 as outlined in Section 8.2.6.2.1. 
Subjects in Cohort  4 will receive prophylactic oral steroid treatment to prevent possible 
vector-induced hepatitis as outlined in Section 8.2.6.2.2. 
Liver function tests will be assessed as part of clinical chemistry ( Section  8.2.6.1) a t the time 
points specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table  6). Liver function tests will be assessed at the 
central laboratory and the local laboratory (STAT sample) at a minimum of every 3 to 4 days 
through Week 12, or longer if clinically indicated, to allow for a rapid detection of any liver 
aminotrans ferase elevatio ns following administration of DTX401. A n increase in liver function 
tests following treatment with DTX401 will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as defined in 
Section  9.1.2, on t he appropriate pages of the eCRF if i t is felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator.  
8.2.6.2.1. Reactive Steroid Treatment for Possible Vector- Induced Hepatitis  
Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will receive reactive oral steroid treatment for possible 
vector- induced hepatitis if liver aminotransferase levels increase following treatment with 
DTX401. The Investigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead, will consider 
starting oral steroid treatment for possible vector-induced hepatitis if a subject’s ALT level s 
increase from the subject’s baseline or recently drawn levels, and are considere d by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to treatment with DTX401. If repeat testing is deemed 
necessary, every effort should be made to repeat the testi ng within 24 hours from receipt of test 
results indicating elevated levels of ALT.  
Based on available evidence, it is expected that vector -induced hepatitis will be self -limiting. 
Therefore, prednisone (or prednisolone) will be used to treat vector-induced hepatitis  according 
to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines, which have been modified for subjects with GSDIa so that the starting dose/duration is lower/shorter:

Confidential    
  
The I
nvestigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead, may consider modifying this 
regimen if a subject’s ALT levels do not normalize during the steroid taper.  The Investigator 
should document the agreed upon steroid regimen in the subject’s source documentation. 
The use of prednisone will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
8.2.6.2.2. Prophylactic Steroid Treatment for Vector- Induced Hepatitis  
Subjects in Cohort 4 will receive prophylactic oral steroid treatment to prevent possible 
vector- induced hepatitis. Prophylactic  oral steroid regimens h ave been used in AAV- mediated 
gene transfer clinical trials for other indications (eg, Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers : 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
Oral prednisone (or prednisolone) will be initiated on Day 1 following completion of the Day  0 
controlled fasting challenge and before DTX401 administration  as follows:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
The Investigator, in conjunction with the Ultragenyx medical lead, may consider modi fying this 
regimen if a subject’s ALT levels do not normalize during the steroid taper.   
Additional oral prednisolone/placebo may be administered after completion of the taper if a 
subject’s alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) levels increase from Baseline and/or above the ULN of 
recently drawn levels repeated one more time as soon as possible.

If, in 
the Investigator’s medical judgment, the subject may not sa fely tolerate initiation of oral 
steroid treatment on Day 1, the steroid regimen may be modified based on discussion between 
the Investigator and the Ultragenyx medical lead.  The Investigator should document the agreed 
upon steroid regimen in the subject’s source documentation. 
The Investigator may consider additional assessments or medical care, such as hospitalization or 
daily clinic visits, during steroid administration if, in the Investigato r’s medical judgment, these 
measures would provide additional s afety benefits.  
The use of prednisone will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
Vaccination and Oral Prednisone  Regimen  
To comply with international and regional guidelines on vacci nation, as well as slight variations 
in regional schedules, where feasible, subjects’  vaccination schedules should be adjusted to 
accommodate prophylactic prednisone taper regimen administration prior to and following 
DTX301 infusion.  
Live vaccines (such as MMR and varicella) are contraindicated for patients on a substantially 
immunosuppressive steroid dose (ie, ≥ 2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg of prednisone , or 
equivalent or 1 mg/kg/day in children under 20 kg) for more than 14  days. Thus, Investigators 
should time adminis tration of live vaccines to at least 14 days prior to inception of the 
prednisone regimen, or after completion of the 8 -week prednisone regimen .  
Inactivated vaccines and seasonal influenz a prophylaxis vaccination are not precluded to patients 
treated with  immunosuppressive agents in accordance to international guidelines ( Ezeanolue et 
al.; Rubin et al., 2014; Public Health  England, 2020; ECDC, 2017; Public Health  England, 
2017) . All inactivated vaccines can be administered safely to persons with altered 
immunocompetence, whether the vaccine is a killed whole-organism or a recombinant, subunit, 
split-virus, toxoid, polysaccharide, or polysaccharide protein-conjugate vaccine.  
8.2.6.3. Lact ate 
At Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 12, 24, and 52, lactate levels will be measured during the 
controlled fasting challenge (Section  8.1.1) . A venous blood sample for lactate will be collected 
through an indwelling catheter (central or peripheral) as follows:  
• At the beginning of the fasting challenge (ie, immediately after the post-dinner dose 
of cornstarch, or immediately after dinner for subjects who do not take a post-dinner 
dose of cornstarch ) 
• Approximately every 60 minutes (±  5 minutes) until the glucose level decreases to 
≤ 70 mg/dL ( ≤ 3.9 mmol/L) 

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
77 
Confidential  • Approximately every 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) until the glucose level decreases to 
< 54 mg/dL (<  3.0 mmol/L) or when the subjects experience signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, or when the fast reaches 15 hours without hypoglycemia, whichever 
occurs first.  
Lactate samples should be sent to the local laboratory (STAT sample) and results should be 
available within 30 minutes or less of blood sample collection.  Samples should be prepared and 
transported to the local laboratory in accordance with the site’s standard procedures. 
8.2.6.4. Other Controlled Fasting Challenge Laboratory Assessments 
At Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 12, 24, and 52, blood samples for measurement of cortisol,  
ACTH,  free fatty acid s, glucagon, insulin, C-peptide, growth hormone, IGFBP1, alanine, and 
ketone levels will be collected at the beginning and end of the controlled fasting challenge, or 
more frequently at the Investigator’s discretion (Section  8.1.1 ). A final sample for glucose, 
lactate, growth hormone, IGFBP1 , ACTH, and cortisol measurement will be collected 30 
minutes after the end of the controlled fasting challenge. Samples should be prepared and transported to the local laboratory in accordance with the s ite’s standard procedures.  
Additionally, if possible, a blood sample for measurement of ACTH and cortisol levels will be  
collected approximately 1 week before the Week 12 visit. Details for the prepar ation and 
shipment of samples are included in the laboratory manual. 
8.2.6.5. 24-Hour Urine Collection  
The excretion of total protein, microalbumin, and creatinine in the urine will be determined over a 24-hour period. Timed 24-hour complete urine samples will be c ollected at Baseline (Day  0) 
and during inpatient visits as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table  6). Details for the 
preparation and shipment of samples are included in the laboratory manual. 
8.2.6.6. Neutr alizing Antib odies to Adeno -Associated Virus Serotype 8  
A blood s ample for determination  of neutralizing antibodies to AAV8 will be collected at the

9.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be assessed from the time the subject signs the ICF and for up to 30 days 
after the End of Study/Early Withdrawal visit. SAE s that occur more than 30 days after the End 
of Study/Early Withdrawal visit need not be reported unless the Investigator considers them 
related to study product. 
At every study visit, subjects will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any medically 
related changes in their well -being. 
In addition to subject observations, AEs identified from any study data (eg, laboratory values, physical examination findings, ECG changes) or from review of other documents that are relevant to subject safety will be documented on the AE page in the eCRF. 
9.1.1. Definitions  
9.1.1.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as any AE/SAE ≥ Grade 3 that is considered by the I nvestigator  and/or 
Sponsor to be related to DTX401, based on NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 ( NCI, 2018)  or later 
version. 9.1.1.2. Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to study product (ie, DTX401) or their clinical significance.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled into this study, 
regardless of its causal relationship to study product. Subject s will be instructed to contact the 
Investigator at any time after the  subject signs the ICF if any signs or symptoms develop. 
Abnormal clinically significant laboratory values (clinical chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, coagulation panel, and urinalysis) as assessed by the Investigator will be 
consider ed AEs.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure 
to study product or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or fr equency after 
exposure to the study product. 
9.1.1.3. Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life threatening  
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
81 
Confidential  • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/b irth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Nonemergent hospitalization for cornstarch management or glucose monitoring during steroid 
administration for vector- induced hepatitis ( Section  8.2.6.2) w ill not be considered an SAE.  
9.1.2. Safety Reporting  
9.1.2.1. Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes drug treatment, dose, event term, time of onset, 
Inves tigator-specified assessment of severity and relationship to study product, time of resolution 
of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. Adverse events 
resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedD RA) will be used 
to code all AEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
9.1.2.2. Serious Adverse Events 
Any AE that meet s SAE criteria ( Section  9.1.1.3)  or any of the safety stopping criteria 
(Section  3.2.4)  must be reported by the study site to Ultragenyx immediately (ie, within 
24 hours) after the time study site personnel first learn about the event (Table  3).  
The study site should record all SAE information on the SAE page in the eCRF and submit the 
report via the electronic data capture (EDC ) system. An event meeting any of the safety stopping 
criteria should only be reported as an SAE in the EDC if it meets the SAE criteria 
(Section  9.1.1.3).  
If, for any reason, it is not possible to report the SA E in the EDC system (eg, the EDC system is 
unavailable), the study site should record the SAE on the paper SAE Reporting Form and fax or 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
82 
Confidential  email  it to Ultragenyx ( Table  3). Any SAE reported via fax or email must be ent ered into the 
EDC system  as soon as it is possible.

9.1.2.2.1. Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor is re sponsible for reporting serious, unexpected, suspected adverse drug reactions 
(SUSARs) involving the study product to all regulatory authorities and participating 
investigators in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines 
and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable. It is the responsibility of the Investigator or 
designee to promptly notify the local institutional review board (IRB)/ independent ethics 
committee (IEC)/institutional biosafety committee (IBC) of all SUSA Rs involving risk to human 
subjects.  
Due to the limited clinical experience with DTX401, reference safety information for assessing whether an AE is a SUSAR is currently not available. Therefore, any SAE considered related to 
DTX401 will be considered a SUSAR and reported immediately, as detailed in Section  9.1.2. 
The SAE should be treated with appropriate supportive and me dical care deemed necessary for 
the well -being of the subject. 
9.1.3. Assessment of Severity/Toxicity  
The severity/toxicity, or intensity, of an AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the 
subject’s daily activities. The Investigator should rate the intensity of an AE as Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, 
or 5 based on the ir medical judgment . The most current ve rsion of the NCI CTCAE can be used 
to guide the rating of an AE . 
The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology that can be used to standardize AE reporting. A severity/ toxicity grade is provided for each AE term that is grouped by the highest level of 
MedDRA classification. Specific symptoms and medical conditions have a clinical description 
for each level of severity/toxicity.  
Increases in liver aminotrans ferase levels following DTX401 administration that are considered 
related to vector- induced hepatitis are  expected, transient, asymptomatic, and self -limiting based 
on available evidence. If considered clinically significant in the Investigator’s medical judgment 
(Secti on 8.2.6.2) , these events  should be recorded as an AE (Section  9.1.2.1) or SAE 
(Section  9.1.2.2) w ith an event term of elevated liver function tests  and graded according to the 
general guidelines outlined in Table  4. 
In the event that an AE occurs during the study that is not captured by the CTCAE, the AE 
should be graded according to the general guidelines outlined in Table  4. 

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
83 
Confidential  Table  4: General Guidelines for Grading Events Not Captured by the CTCAE  
Grade  Criteria  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL.a 
Grad e 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.b 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Abbreviations: ADL  = activities of daily living; AE  = adverse event; CTCAE  = Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events.  
a Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managi ng 
money, etc.  
b Self-care A DL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
Changes in the severity/toxicity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
9.1.4. Assessment of Causality  
The Invest igator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study product is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
The relationship or association of the study product in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized according to the classification and criteria  outlined in Table  5. 
Table  5: Classification and Criteria for AE Relationship to Study Product  
Classification  Criteria  
Unrelated  This relationship suggests that there is no association between the study product and the 
reported event.  
Possible This relationship suggests that treatment with the study product is causing or contributing to 
the AE; ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the study product administration or follows a known response pattern to the study produc t, but  could 
also be produced by other factors.  
Probable  This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the study 
product administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological action of the 
study product, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or cl ass of drugs, 
or judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event 
with the study product seems likely. The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the dose of study product.  
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
84 
Confidential  Classification  Criteria  
Unrelated  This relationship suggests that there is no association between the study product and the 
reported event.  
Definite  This relationsh ip suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between the study 
product administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent  medication reaction) do not appear to 
explain the e vent. The event reappears or worsens if the study product is re -administered.  
Abbreviation: AE = adverse event.  
9.1.5. Follow- Up of Subjects Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the a ppropriate page in the eCRF and followed to 
satisfactory resolution, until the Investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, or until the subject is considered to be stable. 
9.2. Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
9.2.1. Pregnancy and Birth Control  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all female study subjects of childbearing potential 
during screening. A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all female study subjects of childbear ing potential at each visit as specified in  the Schedule of Events (Table  6). 
Females of childbearing potential are defined as females physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. Females are considered postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (eg, age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy 
(with  or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6  weeks  prior to enrollment. In the case 
of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by 
follow -up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.  
Males and females of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception at the 
time of administration of DTX401 and for 52 weeks following administration of DTX401 to 
prevent the potential transmission of the AAV vector. For male subjects, appropriate 
contraceptive methods include t he use of a condom with spermicide. For female subjects, 
appropriate contraceptive methods include the use of a condom with spermicide plus at l east 1 of 
the following: 
• Hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device;  
• Use of a diaphragm or cervical/vault cap; or 
• Previous sterilization (surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal ligation) at least 6 weeks prior to DTX401 administration. In case of an 
oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the subject must have been confirmed 
by follow- up hormone level assessment.  
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
85 
Confidential  Abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control; however, appropriate contraception must be 
used if the subject becomes sexually active. Abstinence is defined as sexual inactivity consistent 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic a bstinence (calendar, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, a nd 
lactational amenorrhea methods are not acceptable methods of contraception. A condom with spermicide is required to be used by all sexually active vasectomized males in the study in order 
to prevent potential transmission of the vector via seminal fluid . 
Pregnancy is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive  medication. Any pregnancy in a female study 
subject that occurs during study participation must be reported using the paper Pregnancy Report 
Form. The study site should record the pregnancy on the paper Pregnancy Report Form and fax it 
to PrimeVigilance  (Table  3). To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a female study subject 
must be reported to PrimeVigilance  (contact information in Section  9.1.2.2) within 2  weeks of 
learning of its occurrence.  
The pregnancy in a female study subject must be followed up to determine outcome (including 
spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and status of mother and child, even if the subject discontinued from the study. Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons should be reported as an AE  or 
SAE. Spontaneous miscarriages or congenital abnormalities must be reported as an SAE. 
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported as an SAE. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy in a female study subject brought to the Investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study, and considered by the Investigator as possibly related to the study product, must be promptly rep orted to Ultragenyx. 
9.2.2. Treatment Noncompliance 
9.2.2.1. Overdose Managemen t 
An overdose is any dose of the study product given to or taken by a subject that intentionally or unintentionally exceeds the dose, based on body weight (kg), described in Section  3.1. 
Overdoses without signs or symptoms do not need to be recorded as AEs; in case of any AEs 
associated with the overdose, these should be reported in the ap propriate AE or SAE page of the 
eCRF. The actual dose infused will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  
There is n o treatment for overdose. All subjects will be closely monitored at the time of infusion 
for any adverse effects, and supportive c are will be administered at the discretion of the 
Investigator, as needed, should an overdose be suspected. 
9.2.2.2. Medication Errors 
A medication error is defined as a mistake made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, or 
use of the study product. The treat ment will be open -label and is to be administered by trained 
medical personnel at the study site. 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
86 
Confidential  9.3. Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent DMC will be responsible for monitoring safety data from the study. For Cohorts 
1 and 2, t he DMC met after all evaluable subjects in the dosing cohort completed Week 12 of the 
study to review the safety data and provide their recommendation for progressing to the next 
dosing cohort or enrollment of subjects into additional cohorts. 
The DMC will meet at the end of the study and may, at any time, recommend modifying or 
pausing enrollment due to safety concerns based on their periodic data review s. Additionally, if 
an Investigator reports an AE/SAE that meets any of the safety stopping criteria (Section  3.2.4) , 
enrollment will be paused and the DMC will meet to review available data. If a decision is made  
to resume enrollment, this decision will be communicated to and, if required, approved by 
regulatory authorities according to country requirements. 
The DMC  comprise s 2 independent medical professionals and an independent biostatistician 
who are qualified to review the data and provide recommendations for progressing to the next 
dosing level or enrollment of subjects into additional cohorts . The DMC charter details the 
members’ roles and responsibilities as part of the DMC, the process for each data review (scheduled or ad hoc) , and t he full scope of each review.

Confidential  10. STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and will provide a detailed description of the 
statistical methods and expand on the details provided in this protoc ol. Additional analyses may 
be added. 
10.1. Endpoints 
The primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoi nts are detailed in Section  2. 
The following general analysis summaries and listings will be conducted for subjects who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug. The MTD dose escalation evaluation will be performed for 
MTD evaluable subjects. Statistical analysis sets for all the tables, listings, and figures will be defined in the SAP. 
10.2. Statistical Analysis Methodology  
The CRM model will be used to eval uate each dose for dose escalation using software FACTS 
(Berry Consultants, Austin, Texas, United States) Version 6.0 or later. The OBD will be based on the MTD and an assessment of clinical benefit. SAS
® software (SAS Institu te, Inc, Cary, 
North Carolina, United States) Version  9.2 or later will be used for general data presentation and 
statistical analyses. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categor ical variables will be summarized using 
frequency counts and percentages. Data will be listed in data listings.  
Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the SAP.  
10.2.1. The Continual Reassessment Method  
Neuenschwande r’s CRM (or nCRM) (Neuenschwander et al., 2008)  will be used to make 
recommendations for the dos e to be admi nistered in each cohort using all evaluable subjects 
(ie, subjects who remain in the study for at least 12 weeks after dosing or for whom a DLT is 
observed within 12 weeks of dosing). The DLT assessment for each subject is based on the 
definition in Sectio n 9.1.1.1. T he DLT evaluation window for each subject starts on the date of 
administration of DTX401 and continues for up to 12 weeks (84 days) thereafter, or until all 
Week 12 safety assessments have been compl eted, whichever occurs later. 
The target toxicity rate is 0.25. The cohort size is 3 subjects. The dose levels that may be studied 
are specified in Section  3.1. The first cohort will be treated at 2  × 10
12 GC/kg . Subsequent doses 
will be treated at the lower of the current estimate of the MTD and the highest dose allowed by 
the escalation rule.  
A logistic model will be used to model the dose- toxicity curve; further details on that are 
provided in Section  15.2 , Appendix 2. 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
88 
Confidential  The CRM model will recommend that the study is stopped for having the MTD determined the 
first time any of the following criteria are satisfied after a CRM model update:  
• Six eval uable subjects have been  treated at 1 × 1013 GC/kg and the current estimate of 
the MTD is > 1 × 1013 GC/kg  
• Six evaluable subjects have been treated at the current estimate of the MTD  
• The current estimate of the MTD is < 2 × 1012 GC/kg (insufficient safety) 
The study will stop whe n the maximum sample size of 12 subjects have been enrolled  or at the 
Sponsor’s discretion . If 12 subjects have been enrolled and the definition of having an MTD 
determined has not been reached, then the highest dose considered at or below the MTD will be considered the MTD.  
Enrollment will be limited so that each dosing cohort initially includes no more than 3 subjects. 
A cohort may be expanded to include additional subjects to confirm the findings for the cohort. 
10.2.2. Sample Size Justif ication  
Simulations (res ult on file at PPD) show that if all 3  doses are safe and no DLTs occur, the CRM 
will recommend dose escalation to 1  × 10
13 GC/kg (genome copies measured by  ) and the 
recruitment of 12 subjects. Based on safety and efficacy observations in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 (3 
subjects each)  and a positive recommendation from the DMC, it was decided to enroll a fourth 
cohort of 3 subjects. The planned sample size of the study will therefore be 12 subjects including 
4 cohorts.  
The protocol allows multiple cohorts to be enrolled to assess varied  oral steroid regimens to 
manage the mild, asymptomatic elevations in liver aminotransferase levels that have been 
observed foll owing D TX401 administration (Derks et al., 2019; Weinstei n et al., 2019 ). The 
CRM model will evaluate subjects based on the dose administered regardless of the steroid 
approach used (ie, reactive vs pro phylactic ). 
10.2.3. Efficacy Analyses 
10.2.3.1. Symptom -Free Euglycemia  
The time (in minutes) to the first hypoglycemic event (defined as glucose < 54 mg/dL [< 3.0 mmol/L]) during a controlled fasting challenge will be determined for all subjects at Day  0 
and Weeks 12, 24, and 52. Full details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
10.2.3.2. Continuous Glucose Monitoring  
Continuous glucose monitoring device data will be summarized in table s, figures and provided in 
the listings. A ll analyses  details will be specified  in the SAP.

10.2.4. Safety Analyses 
All subjects who receive DTX401 will be included in the safety analysis. 10.2.4.1. Adverse Events  
With the exception of the CRM modelling described above, a ll statistical analyses of safety 
outcomes will be descriptive. The incidence of AEs and TEAEs will be summarized by system 
organ class and preferred term. Additionally, TEAEs may be summarized for each dose by 
severity and relationship to study product, if applicable. SAE s will be presented for each dose by 
relationship to study product. Summary tables will present the total number of TEAEs as well as 
the number of subjects with TEAE incidence by system organ class and preferred term. For 
summaries of TEAE s, subjects experiencing an event more than once wi th varying severity will 
be counted only once, using only the maximum severity observed within each system organ class 
and preferred term. For incidence of relationship to study product, subjects will be counted only 
once, in the category of the strongest relationship to study product within each system organ class and preferred term.  
10.2.4.2. Physical Examination Findings  
Complete and targeted physical examination findings will be summarized by visit and dose. 
10.2.4.3. Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements (heart rate, blood pressure [systolic and diastolic], and respiratory rate) 
will be summarized over time in terms of ab solute values and changes from B aseline by visit and 
dosing cohort. Height and weight will be summarized.

Confidential  10.2.4.4. Electrocardiogram Results  
Electrocardi ogram data will be summarized by visit and dosing cohort. Each ECG will be 
classified as “abnormal” or “normal,” and the relevance of the abnormality will be summarized 
as “clinically significant” or “not clinically significant.”  
10.2.4.5. Hypoglycemi c Events  
The number of symptomatic hypoglycemic events will be summarized by dose level of DTX401. 
Hypoglycemic events reported by the subject will be summarized separately for each dose of DTX401. 
10.2.4.6. Clinical Laboratory As sessment Results  
For all clinical laboratory para meters ( Section  8.2.6.1)  with continuous results, absolute values 
and changes from Baseline will be summarized by visit and dosing cohort. For laboratory 
paramete rs with categorical results, shifts from Baseline wil l be summarized by visit and dosing 
cohort. Laboratory values from the central laboratory and local laboratories will be analyzed.  
10.2.4.7. Other Laboratory Results  
Neutralizing antibodies to AAV8, cell -mediated immune response to AAV8 and G6Pase, AAV8 
binding antibody IgG assay, anti-G6Pase antibody assay, vector shedding, and vector genome 
determination will be summarized by time point and dosing cohort. Associations between these parameters and dose will be undertaken using tabular summaries and appropriate stati stical 
methods, as will be outlined in the SAP. 
10.2.5. Other Analyses  
Demographics and other background information will be summarized by dose group. 
Background information includes prior medications, medical conditions, GSDIa medical history 
(including number of hospitalizations for hypoglycemic events [total and in the year prior to 
enrollment]). Current medical conditions and concomitant medications will be summarized. A summary of subject disposition and treatment exposure will be prepared. 
Other data described in Section  8.4 will be summarized accordingly, including assessments of 
prescribed diet (including daily carbohydrate intake). 
10.2.6. Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted when a minimum of 12- week data are available for all 
subjects from at least 2  dosing cohorts. Additional interim analyses may be conducted a t the 
Sponsor ’s discretion . Results and their dissemination will be  at the Sponsor’s discretion. 
A detailed plan for the analysis of the safety and efficacy data will be presented in the SAP.

Confidential  10.3. Data Quality Assurance 
Study sites will maintain source documentation and enter subject data in the eCRF as accurately 
as possible and will rapidly respond to any reporte d discrepancies. The eCRFs are accessed 
through Oracle Health Sciences InForm. This EDC system is validated and compliant with US 
Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11. Each person involved with the study will 
have an individual username and password that allows for record traceability. Thus, the system, 
and subsequently any investigative reviews, can identify coordinators, investigators, and individuals who have entered or modified records, as well as the time and date of any 
modifications. A quality review of the data will be performed by the study site with additional reviews by the clinical monitor.  
Each eCRF is presented as an electronic copy, allowing data entry by study site personnel, who 
can add and edit data, add new subjects, identify  and resolve discrepancies, and view records. 
This system provides immediate direct data transfer to the database, as well as immediate 
detection of discrepancies, enabling study site coordinators to resolve and manage discrepancies 
in a timely manner.  
Paper copies of the eCRFs and other database reports may be printed and signed by the 
Investigator. This system provides study site personnel, monitors, and reviewers with access to 
hardcopy audits, discrepancy reviews, and Investigator comment information. 
After all queries have been resolved, the SAP is approved and signed, and any summary/analysis 
populations are approved, the database will be locked. All summary and analysis of the data will 
be performed using SAS software Version 9.2 or later.  
10.3.1. Data Manage ment  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the study, the I nvestigator agrees to 
maintain adequate case histories for the subjects treated as part of the research under this protocol. The Investigator agrees to ma intain accurate eCRFs and source documentation as part 
of the case histories. These source documents may include laboratory reports, ECG strips, and 
other materials.  
The Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) will supply the eCRF. Study personnel must have 
documented training of the us e of the EDC system before the system can be authorized.  
All eCRF information is to be completed. If an item is not available or is not applicable, this fact 
should be indicated. 
Study site personnel will enter subject data into the ED C system. The analysis data sets will be a 
combination of these data and data from other sources (eg, laboratory data). All entries and 
changes to the data in the eCRF will be recorded electronically with an audit trail specifying the 
date and time of entry or change and the name of the authorized person making the entry or change. The I nvestigator will answer all queries issued, if applicable. Data queries and query 
correspondence will be included in the audit trail.

Confidential  Clinical data management will be performed in accordance wit h applicable Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, 
removing errors and inconsistencies in the data). Adverse events and concomitant medication 
terms will be coded using MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionary terminology, respectively.  
After database lock, each study site will receive an electronic copy of their study site -specific 
eCRF data as entered into the EDC system for the study, including full discrepancy and audit history. Additionally,  an electronic copy of all of the study site’s data from the study will be 
created and sent to the Sponsor for storage. The Sponsor (or S ponsor designee) will maintain a

11.1. Institutional Review Board, Independent Ethics Committee, and 
Institutional Biosafety Committee 
Federal regulations and the ICH guidelines require that approval be obtained from an 
IRB/ IEC/IBC before partic ipation of human subjects in research studies. Before study onset, the 
protocol, ICF, advertisements to be used for the recruitment of study subjects, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to the subject or the subject’s legal guardian must be approved by an IRB/IEC/IBC. Documentation of all IRB/IEC/IBC approvals and of the IRB/IEC/IBC compliance with ICH harmonised tripartite guideline E6(R2): Good Clinical Practice (GCP) will be maintained by the study site and will be avai lable for review by 
the Sponsor or its designee. 
All IRB/IEC/IBC approvals should be signed by the IRB/IEC/IBC chair or designee and must 
identify the IRB/IEC/IBC name and address, the clinical protocol by title or protocol number or 
both, and the date approval or a favorable opinion was granted. 
The Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the progress and status of the 
study at intervals not exceeding 1 year or otherwise specified by the IRB/IEC/IBC. T he 
Investigator must promptly su pply the Sponsor or its designee, the IRB/IEC/IBC, and, where 
applicable, the institution, with written reports on any changes significantly affecting the conduct 
of the study or increasing the risk to subjects.

The study will be performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and all applicable local laws and regulations.  
11.3. Subject Information and Consent 
A written ICF in compliance with regulatory authority regu lations and 21 CFR §50 shall be 
obtained from each subject before entering the study or performing any unusual or nonroutine 
procedure that involves risk to the subject. An ICF template may be provided by the Sponsor to study sites. If any institution- specific modifications to study -related procedures are proposed or 
made by the study site, the ICF should be reviewed by the Sponsor, its designee, or both before IRB/IEC/IBC submission. Once reviewed, the ICF will be submitted by the Investigator to his or 
her IRB/IEC/IBC for review and approval before the start of the study. If the ICF is revised 
during the course of the study, all active participating subjects must sign the revised form. 
Before recrui tment and enrollment, each prospective subject or their legal guardian will be given 
a full explanation of the study and be given the opportunity to read the approved ICF. Once the 
Investigator is assured that the subject or their legal guardian understand s the implications of 
participating in the study, the subject or their legal guardian will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing the ICF. 
The Investigator shall retain the signed original ICF(s) and must provide a copy of the sign ed 
original form to the subject or their legal guardian.

97 
Confidential  13. STUDY MANAGEMENT 
The administrative structure will include a DMC (Section  9.3). 
13.1. Monitoring  
13.1.1. Monitoring of the Study  
The clinical monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor, has the obligation to closely follow the 
progression of the study, ensuring that it is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, 
ICH E6(R2), all applicable local laws and regulations, and with current and applicable standard 
operating procedures. In doing so, the monitor will visit the I nvestigat or and study site at 
periodic intervals, in addition to maintaining necessary telephone and written contact. 
The monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review 
of study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
Investigator and study site personnel. 
13.1.2. Inspection of Records  
Investigators and institutions involved in the s tudy will permit study -related monitoring, audits, 
IRB/IEC/IBC review, and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to all study records. 
In the event of either an audit or inspection, the I nvestigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, 
representatives of the Sponsor, or a regulatory agency (eg, FDA or other regulatory agency) 
access to all study records.  
The Investigator should promptly notify the clinical research associate of any audits or 
inspections scheduled by any regulatory authorities and promptly forward copies of any reports received to the clinical research associate. The clinical research associate will then inform and forward any reports to the Sponsor. 
13.2. Management of Protocol Amendments and Deviations  
13.2.1. Modification of the Protocol  
Any changes in this research activity, except those necessary to remove an apparent, immediate hazard to the subject , must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor or its designee. 
Amendments to the protocol must be submitted in writing to the I nvestigator’s IRB/IEC/IBC for 
approval before subjects can be enrolled into an amended protocol. 
13.2.2. Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is a departure from the written procedures or processes. 
A significant deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol by the subject or 
Investigator that results in a significant, additional risk to the subject or important change to the 
study design. Significant deviations can include nonadherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria, 
nonadherence to safety and efficacy -related assessments, or nonadherence to FDA regulations or 
ICH GCP guidelines, that could lead to the subject being withdrawn from the study ( Section  7.1). 
Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7 .0 
98 
Confidential  Protocol waivers or exemptions are not permitted. Adherence to the study design requirements, 
including those specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table  6), is essential for study conduct.  
The Investigator or designee must document and explain in the subject’s source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The I nvestigator may implement a deviation from, or 
a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior 
IRB/IEC/IBC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation 
or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the 
IRB/IEC/IBC for review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory 
authorities, if required. 
Protocol deviat ions will be documented by the clinical monitor throughout the course of 
monitoring visits. Principal Investigators will be notified in writing by the monitor of deviations. 
The IRB/IEC/IBC should be notified of all protocol deviations in a timely manner, as required. 
13.3. Study Termination  
Although the Sponsor has every intention of completing the study, the Sponsor reserves the right 
to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  
The end of the study is defined as the date on whic h the last subject completes the last visit 
(includes follow -up visit). 
13.4. Final Report 
Whether the study is completed or prematurely terminated, the Sponsor will ensure that the 
clinical study report (CSR) is prepared  and provided to the regulatory agencies as required by the 
applicable regulatory requirements. The S ponsor will also ensure that the CSR in marketing 
applications meets the standards of the ICH harmonised tripartite guideline E3: Structure and 
Content of CSRs.  
Where required by applicable regula tory requirements, an I nvestigator signatory will be 
identified for the approval of the CSR. The I nvestigator will be provided reasonable access to 
statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the opportunity to review the 
complete study  results.  
Upon completion of the CSR, the Sponsor will provide the I nvestigator with a summary of the 
cumulative study results. The Investigator is encouraged to share the cumulative summary results 
and will provide each subject with their individual data.  The study results will be posted on 
publicly available clinical study registers, where required.

a Screening assessments may be completed in any reasonable order (except where indicat ed) and on more than 1 day at the Investigator’s discretion. All screening assessments must be 
completed within the Screening Period before Day 0. 
b  should be completed prior to invasive assessments being conducted.  
c Subjects will complete the GSDIa Morning Diary and GSDIa Evening Diary daily for 7 days leading up to and including the Day 0 and 12, 24, and 52 study visits. Subjects will complete 
the GSDIa Morning Diary in the morning upon awakening. Subjects  will complete the GSDIa Evening Diary at the end of the day.  Subjects will be provided with copies of the GSDIa 
Morning Diary and GSDIa Evening Diary during the Screening Period and instructed to bring the completed assessments to each study inpatient visit. 
d Subjects will be asked to complete a brief telephone interview at Week s 24 and 52 regarding their experience completing the assessments to guide further development of the 
assessments. At Week 52, subjects will also be asked about their experience in the study.  
e Vital signs will be measured approximately 5 minutes after the start of the infusion, and approximately 0.5 (±  5 minutes), 1 (±  5 minutes), 4, 8 hours (± 15 minutes), and 22 hours 
(± 1 hour) after the start of infusion. 
f Complete physical examination will include assessment s of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the skin; the abdomen with documentation of liver and spleen size; a nd the endocrine, 
metabolic, neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems.  
g Targeted physical examination will include assessments of the skin; the abdomen with documentation of liver and spleen size; and the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal 
systems.  
h It is recommended that the Screening sample for G6PC  genotyping be collected at the time written informed consent is provided. 
i Liver function tests will be assessed at a minimum of every 3 to 4 days starting at DTX401 post  dose Day 4 through Week 12, or longer if clinically indicated. One blood sample will be 
collected for determination of clinical chemistry (including LFTs) and sent to the central laboratory for analysis . A second blood sample will be collected for determination of LFTs and 
sent to the local laboratory (STAT sample), as described in the laboratory manual.  
j Liver function tests and triglyceride  level s can be repeat ed during the Screening Period at the Investigator’s discretion.  
k A blood sample for measurement of lipid level s will be collected on the morning of hospital admission for each controlled fasting challenge  at approximatel y the same time starting at 
Day 0. The sample should be collected at least 2 to 4 hours after the subject’s last meal.  
l A blood sample for determination of clinical chemistry (including LFTs) will be collected approximately 22 hours  after the start of DTX401 infusion.  
m Blood samples for measurement of cortisol, fatty acid, glucagon, insulin, C-pept ide, growth hormone, IGFBP1, ACTH, alanine, and ketone  level s will be collected  at the beginning and 
end of each controlled fasting challenge , or more frequently at the Investigator’s discretion .  
n If possible, a  blood sample for measurement of ACTH and cortisol levels will be collected approximately 1 week before the Week 12 visit . 
o It is recommended that the Screening sample for AAV8  neutralizing antibody testing be collected at the time written informed consent is provided.  
p A blood sample for vector genome determination will be collected approximately 22 hours after the start of DTX401 infusion.  
q  
r The subject's daily prescribed diet and daily diet intake will be recorded at the time points specified in Table 6 and, if possible, on a weekly basis through the Week 52 visit or early 
withdrawal. 
s The subject will remain on his or her prescribed diet for the duration of each inpatient study visit.  
t The subject's daily prescribed cornstarch (or equivalent) and daily cornstarch (or equivale nt) intake will be recorded at the time points specified in Table  6 and, if possible, on a wee kly 
basis through the Week 52 visit or early withdrawal. 
u Supplemental information on glucose level trends will be collected using a CGM device . The site will provide a CGM device to the subject during the Screening Period after determinin g 
that the  subject i s eligible for the study. Subjects will be educated on the appropriate care and use of the CGM device  and sensors, and  instructed to wear the CGM device through the 
Week 52 visit or early withdrawal . Data from the subject’s CGM device will be transferred to the Sponsor throughout the study, including a final data transfer at the end of the Week 52 
visit or early withdrawal . 

Protocol 401GSDIA01  Version 7.0

Confidential  v Subjects will receive the Morning Glucose Level monitoring worksheet and instructions for completing it following DTX401 administration . If a subject is unable to use the assigned 
CGM, the subject should collect morning glucose levels at least 2 mornings per week throughout the study and record the values on the Morning Glucose Level monitoring worksheet. 
Subjects should measure their morning glucose level using their own glucose monitoring device before taking their morning dose of cornstarch. Subjects will be instructed to bring the 
completed worksheet to each study visit.  
w If the subject was unable to use the assigned CGM but was ab le to complete the Morning Glucose Level monitoring worksheet, the subject’s worksheet will be collected  and reviewed  at 
the time points specified in Table  6, and a new worksheet will be provided to the subject.  
x Before the controlled fasting challenge begins, the study site will provide  dinner for the subject. The dinner meal will be personalized for each subject, and will include a target  
carbohydrate range and overall composition in protein, fats and dietary fibers that is as close as possible to the subject’s most current dinner dietary prescription, but not higher than the 
carbohydrate content of the dinner consumed at their baseline fasting challenge . 
y Subjects will be given an oral dose of cornstarch equivalent per their most recent cornstarch prescription at approximately the same time that they typically take it, but no la ter than 3 hours 
post dinner .  
z The controlled fasting challenge requires a 24-hour inpatient stay and should be performed after all other assessments  are completed except for 24-hour urine coll ection, which may be 
completed concurrently, and  which will be completed after the controlled fasting challenge. In addition to the specified time points, if clinically indicated, the controlled fasting 
challenge can be performed at an unschedul ed visit.  
aa Blood samples for measurement of glucose and lactate (venous) levels will be collected at the beginning of the controlled fasting challenge , then approximately every 60 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) until the glucose level decreases to ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L),  then approximately every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) until the glucose level decreases to < 54 mg/dL 
(< 3.0 mmol/L) or the fast reaches 15 hours without hypoglycemia, whichever occurs first. Samples should be sent to the local laboratory (STAT sample) and results should be available 
within 30 minutes or less of blood sample collection for the safety of the subject . 
bb Subjects will be registered in the IWRS at Screening and after eligibility for enrollment is confirmed.  
cc The site will schedule the dosing visit in the I WRS no less than 3 days before, preferably 7 days before, the DTX401 infusion to allow time for DTX401 to be shipped and de livered to the 
site. 
dd If the subject  continues to be on steroid regimen and the Investigator determines that it is not safe to proceed with the CFC, the Week 12 visit may become an outpatient visit. Investigators 
should try to complete an adhoc CFC assessment as soon as the subject has completed steroid treatment and within 8 weeks of the Week 12 visit, as an unscheduled visit.

Study Design and Schedule:
This is a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in 
subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
following a standard induction regimen.
Subjects enrolled into the trial must have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to 
severely active WG or MPA that was treated with corticosteroids and either 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (ie, induction therapy) in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated under the following induction regimens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
•A single course rituximab (RTX) administered at  a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks 
plus high dose corticosteroids ( HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
interval, plus HDCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart fol lowed by pulses of 
15mg/kg every  3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, leukopenia,or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local Amend 01

standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Subjects who are between 6 and 26 weeks of starting induction therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 
score of0 (Appendix 4), and are receiving ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone (orequivalent) on 2
consecutive measurements at least 14 daysapart may be enrolledinto the study. A minimum 
6week period should elapse between initiation of induction therapy and randomization. 
Randomization will be performed on Day  0. A schematic of the study  design is shown below.
All randomized subjects should be treated with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 
2mg/kg/day . Azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following 
administration of induction th erapy. Azathioprine should not be initiated any  later than Day  0. 
Subjectswho meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio toreceive study agent 
(belimumab [10mg/kg] or placebo) administered intravenously (IV)over 1 hour.The 
randomizati onwill be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs.anti-MPO), disease 
stageat induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease) and induction regimen (IV 
cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. rituximab). Belimumab or placebo will be 
supplied by the sponsor during this double-blind treatment phase. It is anticipated that no 
more than 25% of the patients would be newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such 
enrollment of these patients may be capped if they exceed this proportion. Study agent 
(belimumab/placebo) will be administ ered at Day  0, 14, 28, and every  28days thereafter .  
Initial randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX 
induction and 40 post-CYC induction). Once the first 20 patients r andomized following 
induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the independent 
data monitoring committee (DMC),who will make a recommendation regarding whether to 
continue randomization . The same procedure would be appliedfor the first 20subjects 
randomized following induction with CYC. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain 
blinded to treatment allocation.
Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA until the study has 
completed or until they experience a flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy 
endpoint (see below). The study will complete, the database will be locked and the primary 
analysis will be performed when 12months have elapsed after the last subject is randomized.
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare (as defined below) are to be 
followed per the double blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind 
treatment phase (whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior 
to 1 year an attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose 
of study agent.  Amend 02

Efficacy Endpoint sand Analysis:
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:
The primary  efficacy endpoint is timefrom Day 0 to the first relapse,defined as:
•At least 1 major BVAS item ( Appendix 4 ) OR 
•Aminimum total BVASscore of 6 (Appendix 4)OR
•Receipt of prohibited m edications (as defined in Section 5.5.1).
Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:
•Timefrom Day 0 to the first majorrelapse (defined as experiencing at least 1 major BVAS 
item, see Appendix 4 ).
Other efficacy endpointsare described in Section 8.5.4.
Sample Size Considerations:
Approximately  100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined based 
on the feasibility of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-frame. The 
sample size was not based on statistical considerations andthe analysis of primary and 
secondary  endpoints will be exploratory  in nature. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebogroup, a 
relapse rate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically  significant 
(p<0.05) in a stud y of 100 subjects (50 per arm). 
Analysis of Primary EfficacyEndpoint:
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the time to first relapsefrom Day 0 between the 
placebo/azathioprine group and the belimumab/azathioprine combination group using a Cox 
proportional hazards model, adjusted for ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs.anti-MPO), disease stage
at induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease), and induction regimen (rituximab vs.IV 
cyclophosphamide vs.oral cyclophosphamide).However, the adjustment of induction 
regimen will be changed to rituximab vs.IV and/or oral cyclophosphamide if the number of 
events (relapse) is less than 5 in subjects using oral cyclophos
phamide or IV 
cyclophosphamide .For any subject who does not experience a relapse,the time to first relapse 
will be censored at the time of the subject’s last assessment .
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/fla re are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end 
of the double-blind treatment phase (whichever is earlier).The primaryefficacyanalysis will 
be performed after 12 mon ths have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject .Amend 04

Analysis of Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:
The analysis of the major secondary  efficacy endpoint will be performed using the same 
method described for the primary efficacy analysis, but censoring subjects who receive any 
prohibited medication prior to an observation of any  major BVAS item.
Safety Endpoints and Analysis:
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events (AEs), changes in laboratory 
parameters and immunogenici ty.The frequency  and rate of laboratory  abnormalities will be 
tabulated by treatment group.The frequency  and rate of AEswill be tabulated by MedDRA 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term and presented b y treatment group.
Adverse events of special interestthat will be analyzed in this protocol include: all-cause 
mortality; serious and/or severe infections; opportunistic infections; infusion reactions 
including h ypersensitivity  reactions; malignant neoplasms; selected serious psy chiatric events; 
suicidality assessment ( Appendix 8 ); and immunogenicity.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analy zed. The DMC will include at lea st 3 physicians and a 
statistician, none of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. The first DMC reviews will occur 
after the first 20 subjects per induction regimen (RTX or IV/oral CYC) have been randomized 
and have had a Week 8 visit. Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with 
RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a 
recommendation regarding whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be 
applied for the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with IV or oral CYC. The 
DMC will review the data approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction 
regimens. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The 
DMC will monitor this trial until the data are locked, unblinded, and analyzed for the primary 
efficacy outcome, after which time monitoring may be assumed by an internal Human 
Genome Sciences (HGS) committee. Investigators and IRBs/ECs will be notified of the 
outcome of each DM C meeting.
PK Endpoints and Analysis:
Serum samples will be collected from all randomized subjects who receive a dose of study 
agent during the study and analyzed to determine serum belimumab concentration s. Serum 
belimumab concentration data will be used in a population PK analysis, which will be 
reported separatel y.
Immunogenicity:
Serum samples for the measurement of anti-belimumab antibodies will be obtained from all 
subjects before administration of study agent on Day 0, Week 8, Week 24, Week 48 and
Exit/8-week Follow -up.Additionally , samples will be obtained fromsubjects atWeeks 24 and 
48 during additional years. For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 
8-week follow-up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity  was assessed if 8-week 
follow-up immunogenicity  sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum Amend 04

sample for anti-belimumab antibodies at least 6months after the last dose of study agent or 
after completion and/or unblinding of the study , whichever is later. 
Biological Markers and Autoantibodies :
Pharmacogenetic sampling (in consenting subjects) will be taken once during the course of 
this study (see Appendix 9 ).  
Biological markers will be measured at baseline (Day 0) and at multiple time points 
thereafter :
•Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  (ANCA:antiPR3, anti -MPO)
•Serum complement (C3, C4)
•Serum immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA, IgM, IgG)
•C-reactive Protein (CRP)
•Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
•Urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio
•BLyS protein (Day 0 only)
•FACS of peripheral l ymphocytes

1Background
1.1Disease Background
The systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis ( also commonly  referred to as granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis [GPA]), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti-neutrophil cy toplasmic antibodies ( ANCA)(Jennetteand 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV)are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to life-threatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining 
patterns in immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear 
(P-ANCA).It is now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 
3 (PR3), and P-ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which 
are enzymes that are abundant in the granules of neutrophils ( Jennetteand Falk, 1997; Merkel
et al, 1997). Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO 
autoantibodies are more common in MPA and CSS.  Anti-PR3 antibodies are associated with 
increased morbidityand mortality compared to anti-MPO(Hoganet al, 1996; Franssen et al, 
1998).The most widely used classification criteria for diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are 
those published by the American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt
et al, 1990 and Masiet al, 1990, respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill 
Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA (Jennetteet al, 1994; Jennetteet al, 2013).Of note, 
none of these diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement of ANCA. The Chapel Hill 
criteria for WG can be found in Appendix 1 and for MPA in Appendix 2 .
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classification criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Wattset al, 2007; 
Mahr, 2009). In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiolo gicalstudies are confounded by its 
original inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilising the ACR or CHCC 
criteria, prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and
0.4-1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by some margin 
(Koldingsnes and Nossent,2008). In the US, the prevalence rates of WGrange from 
2.6-9/100000 ( Zeftet al, 2005; Mahret al,2006).AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with 
peak age of onset in those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatsakiet al, 2010),with other small vessel 
vasculitides being the major concern in childhood ( Broganet al,2010).
Current therapy is usually determined by severity of the disease, with more severe forms 
warranting more aggressive approaches. These usually involve an initial remission induction 
regimenof high dose corticosteroid administered with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab 
followed by a remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stoneet al,2010; 
Boschet al,2007; Jayneet al,2003). Minor manifestations are usuall y treated with low dose 
corticosteroid administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate ( Belmont,2006). Even Amend 02

with recent treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains 
unacceptabl y high (Droogeret al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmaniet al,1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG
(Stoneet al,2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 (Mukhtyaret al, 2008, Appendix 3). In its current 
form it is a list of 56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A 
weighted numerical score is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each 
manifestation. The items are grouped by organ systems, and each organ system has a 
maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the relative importanc e of the organ system 
(Mukhtyaret al, 2008). The tool also makes a distinction between new or worsening disease 
and persistent disease with new or worsening attracting higher scores.
1.2Study Agent Background
Belimumab (also known as LymphoS tat-B; BENLYSTA™) is a B-lymphocyte stimulator 
(BLyS)-specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to 
its receptors on B cells. Belimumab does not bind Bcells directly, but by binding BLyS, 
belimumab inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the 
differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin -producing plasma cells.
Nonclinical pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicologic data generated with 
belimumab are provided in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3Clinical Experience
1.3.1Belimumab A dministered Intravenously
Belimumab administered as an intravenous (IV)infusion has been studied in SLE subjects in 
1 Phase 1 trial (LBSL01), 1 Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
(LBSL02) and 2 Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [BLISS 52 
(HGS1006 -C1057) and BLISS 76 (HGS1006- C1056)], and in RA subjects in a Phase2 
double-blind, placebo -controlled trial (LBRA01).
Phase 3 studies of belimumab in SLEwerecompleted in 2009 and 2010 and formed the basis 
of IV belimumab in the US, Canada and EU .The Phase 3 trials included 1,684 subjects where 
belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy demonstrated superiority over placebo plus 
standard therapy in reduction in disease activity as measured by the SLE responder index 
(SRI) with an acceptable safety profile.The primarysafety population supporting approval 
also included data from a Phase 2 study  in 449 subjects with SLE.Evidence of benefit in other 
clinical measures such as reductions in disease activity as measured by SELENA SLEDAI, 
severe flare, and reduced steroid use was also observed. Treatment with belimumab plus 
standard of care was generally well tolerated, with rates of adverse events (AEs), severe AEs, 
serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and serious/severe infections generally 
comparable to the rates observed in the placebo plus standard of care group.Mortality  rates in 
the controlled clinical trials were low, although numericall yhigher in the belimumab groups: 
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, I nc. Confidential Page 22
Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectivel y.Causes of deathwere as 
expected in an SLE population with active disease receiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as steroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, cardiovascular 
disease, and suicide .Serious infections were observed in 5.2% and 6.0% of subjects receiving 
placebo and belimumab, respectivel y.The rate of malignancy  (excluding non-melanoma skin 
cancer) was the same between the placebo and belimumab groups at 0.4%; however as with 
other immunomodulating agents, the mechanism of action of belimumab could increase the 
risk for the development of malignancies. Hypersensitivity  and infusion reactions were 
observed. Anaphylaxis was also observed, though rare (<1%). Depression -related events, 
common in patients with SLE, were observed more frequently with belimumab than with 
placebo; it is unknown if belimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these 
events.The most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥5% of subjects in 
clinical trials were nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in 
extremity , depression, migraine, and phary ngitis.
Experience fromopen-label, long-term continuation trials ofbelimumab in SLE subjects 
suggests that prolonged treatment with belimu mab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase in the incidence rate of AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs) over time, 
including important events such as infections and malignancies. The prevalence rate of AEs 
and SAEs has also remained relatively stable over time.Long term belimumab treatment 
through6 years appearsto provide sustained improvement in SLE disease activity .
Results of the clinical trials of belimumab administered IV are described in further detail in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.
A benefit-risk evaluation of belimumab in the context of the present study is provided in 
Appendix 12of this protocol.
1.4Rationale for the S tudy
Studies in subjects with WGand MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2diseasesranging from 15% at 
18months (Jayneet al, 2003) to 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al,2010) on azathioprine –the 
most effective of current therapies (Jayneet al,2003; Pagnoux et al,2008; Hiemstra et al,
2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV.Further supporting a role for B cells is the fact that activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popaet al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, are found in subjectswith 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagaiet al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010).Together, these 
provide a strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels.
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20(Dasset al, 2008; Wanget al 2008), recently showed success in inducing Amend 02

remission in AAV (Stoneet al, 2010)and was granted approval for the treatment of WG and 
MPAsupports the rationale that belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLy S, 
may be useful in the treatment of this disease.Finally,limited data from the small (n=111) 
subset of subjects in the Phase 3 trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their 
SLE (as assessed by  the SELENA SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus 
standard of care treatment arms had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 
compared with subjects receiving placebo plus standard of care. Specifically , 19/36 (52.8%) 
and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in the belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose groups, 
respectivel y, had resolution of vasculitic activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of 
placebo subjects.Taken together, the sedata support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
2Study Objectives
2.1Primary Objective
1.To evaluate the efficacy  of belimumab in the maintenance of remission following a 
standard induction regimen in subjects with Wegener’s g ranulomatosis (W G) or 
microscopic pol yangiitis (MPA).
2.To evaluate the safet y of belimumab in subj ects with WG or MPA.
3Study Design
3.1 Basic D esign Characteristics
This is a multi-center,multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in 
subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
following a standard induction regimen.Subjects enrolled into the trial must have had an 
initial or relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WGor MPA that was treated with 
corticosteroids and either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab ( ie,induction therapy) in the 
6 months leading up to randomization. S ubjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
•A single course rituximab (RTX) administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks 
plus high dose corticosteroids ( HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
intervalplus HSCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/d ay orally plus HDCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeksapart followed by  pulses of 
15mg/kg every  3 weeks plus HDCS .
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency , leukopenia, or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]Amend 01

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is:methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/da ynot to exceed 80mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Subjects who between 6 and26 weeksof starting induction therapy, achieve a BVASv.3
score of 0 (Appendix 4) and are receiving ≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) on 
2consecutive visits at least 14daysapart may be enrolled into the study. A minimum 6 week 
period should elapse between initiation of induction therapy and randomization.
Randomization will be performed on Day 0. A schematic of the study design is shown in 
Figure 1.
Figure 1Schematic of study design
All randomized subjects should be treated with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 2 
mg/kg/day. Azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following 
administration of induction therapy . Azathioprine should not be initiated any  later than Day  0. 
Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio toalso receive study 
agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo )administered intravenousl y over 1 hour.The 
randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), disease 
stage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease) and induction regimen (IV Amend 01

cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. rituximab). Belimumab or placebo will be 
supplied by the sponsor during this double-blind treatment phase. It is anticipated that no 
more than 25% of the patientswould be newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such 
enrollment of these patients may  be capped if they  exceed this proportion. Study agent will be 
administere d at Day 0, 14, 28 and every  28days thereafter.
Initial randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX 
induction and 40 post-CYCinduction). Once the first 20 patients randomized following 
induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the independent 
data monitoring committee (DMC), who will make a recommendation regarding whether to 
continue randomization . The same procedure would be applied for the first 20 subjects
randomized following induction with CYC. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain 
blinded to treatment allocation.
Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA until the study has 
completed or until they experience a flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy 
endpoint (see Section 8.5.1). The study will complete, the database will be locked,and the 
primary analysis will be performed when12months have elapsed after the last subject is 
randomized.
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an 
attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of study 
agent.

5Study Treatment Regimen
5.1Study Agent Name and Formulation
The common name of the investigational product is BENLYSTA™.The generic (USAN/INN) 
name is belimumab.
Belimumab is a recombinant, human, IgG1monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human 
B lymphocyte stimulator (BLy S, also referred to as BAFF and TNFSF13B). Belimumab has a 
molecular weight of approximately  147 kDa.Belimumab is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology  in a mammalian cell expre ssion system.
Belimumab drug product is provided as a sterile, lyophilized product in a 20 mL vial. Upon 
reconstitution with 4.8 mL sterile water for injection (SWFI), each vial will contain 80 mg/mL 
belimumab in0.16 mg/mL citric acid, 2.7 mg/mL sodium citrate, 80 mg/mL sucrose, 
0.4mg/mL polysorbate80, pH 6.5. Each vial is single use.Amend 02

The placebo control is prepared as a sterile, lyophilized product in a 20 mL vial. Placebo is
reconstituted with 4.8 mL SWFI. Upon reconstitution with 4.8 mL sterile water for injection 
(SWFI), each vial will contain 0.16 mg/mL citric acid,2.7 mg/mL sodium citrate, 80 mg/mL 
sucrose, 0.4 mg/mL  polysorbate80, pH 6.5. Each placebo vial is single use.
5.2Packaging, L abeling, Preparation, and S torage
Belimumab will be supplied in a 20 mL vial containing 400 mg belimumab (deliverable).
Placebo control will be supplied in a 20 mL  vial.
Lyophilized belimumab and placebo should be stored at 2-8°C. After reconstitution and 
dilution in normal saline, the material is stable for up to 8 hours at 2-8°C, or at room 
temperature. Refer to the Pharmacy  Manual for detailed instructions on the preparation, 
administration, and storage of study  agent.
The 400 mg single use vial of study agent will be reconstituted with 4.8 mL SWFI, to yield a 
final concentration of 80 mg/mL of belimumab. Placebo will be reconstituted with 4.8 mL 
SWFI.
In addition to any country-specific requirements, the study agent label will contain, at a 
minimum, the following information:
•Product name;
•Concentration;
•Lot number;
•Storage conditions;
•Investigational drug statement; and
•Manufacturer’s name and address.
The calculated dose of study agent to be administered to the subject is determined in 
milligrams (mg) by the assigned treatment group and the subject's body weight inkilograms 
(kg).
The reconstituted study agent will be diluted in 250 mL normal saline for intravenous 
infusion. An amount of normal saline, equal to the calculated amount of product to be added, 
should be removed from the infusion bag prior to adding theproduct. After adding the 
reconstituted product, gently invert the bag to mix the solution. 
Belimumab and placebo will be supplied as open-label vials and 3rdparty unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted and diluted by the unblinded site pharmacist 
or designee, independent of the study (person responsible for receiving and dispensing study 
agent). Except for a limited number of safety oversight personnel, all other site personnel, the 
subject, the sponsor and contract research organization (CRO) will remain blinded to the 
study agent received and to certain biomarkers and pharmacod ynamic laboratory  results.

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study agent 
(unblinded monitor) aspects of the study.
Study agent inventory /accountability  forms will be examined and reconciled by the Sponsor
or designee. At the end of the study , all used and unused study  agent must be accounted for on 
a study agent accountability  form.
Refer to the Pharmacy manual for more details regarding storage, handling, and drug 
accountability .
5.3Dose, Route of Administration, and S chedule
The treatment groups include one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimumab and a placebo 
arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section5.5.3). 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. The intent of this 
instruction is to prevent more rapid infusion of belimumab which may result in a higher
incidence of infusion reactions. Infusion time need notbe exactly one hour as it is often 
difficult to so precisely adjust infusion times and there may be clinical reasons for infusions
lasting longer than one hour. Therefore, the instruction should be interpreted as infusion over 
at leastone hour. The target infusion time should still be approximately  one hour assuming no 
other issues intervene. Once randomized, subjects will be dosed with study agent on Days 0, 
14, and 28 and every  28days thereafter.
Premedication including an antihistamine, with or without an antipy retic, may  be administered 
before the infusion. Antihistamine H2- receptor antagonists ( eg, ranitidine) are also permitted.
Belimumab/placebo should be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to 
manage infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if 
the subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigators/site personnel should be aware of the 
risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor 
subjects closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placebo administration must be 
discontinued immediately and the appropriate medical therap y administered. 
In the post-marketing setting, delayed onset of symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  reactions 
has been observed. Subjects should remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after 
completion of the first 2 infusions in the double-blind treatment phase. Should symptoms of 
acute hypersensitivity  occur,an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment. This may include, but is not limited to, monitoring vital signs and 
observing for any untoward reactions. Beyond the first 2infusions, subjects should be 
monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after infusion according to study  sites’ 
guidelines or standard operating procedure for IV infusions.
Subjects should be made aware of the potential risk, the signs and symptoms of such 
reactions, and the importance of immediatel y seeking medical attention. For further 
information, see the belimumab IB.Amend 04

5.4Alteration of Dose/Schedule D ue to Toxicity
The dose of belimumab/placebo administered may  not be altered.   The rate of infusion may  be 
slowed or interrupted if the subject appears to develop signs of adverse reaction or infusion-
associated symptoms. At later visits, these subjects may continue to be infused over a longer 
infusion period at the investigator’s clinical discretion. 
If a subject experiences a clinically significant AE that
the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly or probably related to belimumab/placebo and could potentially  be 
exacerbated by the next dose, the investigator may delay the dose by up to 2 weeks or 
withhold 1 dose. If a similar concern is present after 2 weeks, the investigator should contact 
the medical monitor to determine whether treatment should be discontinued.
If a subject experiences a clinically significant, potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) AE that 
the investigator believes may be definitely , possibly or probably related to 
belimumab/placebo , then treatment with study agent will be discontinued. The subjectwillbe 
followed at regularl y scheduled study  visits as specified by theprotocol through the end of the 
double-blind period and also until resolution of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).All subjects 
should be monitored closely for infection. Increased vigilance for infection is recommended 
in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL , especially  for prolonged per iods; clinical 
judgment should be applied with respect to the appropriateness of continuing study therapy in 
these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be consulted before administering subsequent doses 
of study agent in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL.  Study  agent will be discontinued in 
subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that are associated with a severe or serious infection.
5.5Concurrent M edications
5.5.1Prohibited Medications and Therapies that Result in Treatment Failure
Subjects who start prohibited medication or therapies at any time during the double-blind 
phase willbe considered as having relapsed asof the time of receipt of the prohibited 
medication ,andtreatment with study agent will be discontinued. However, the subject will 
continue to be followed for survival through at least 12months after randomization. The 
following medications and therapies are prohibited during the stud y:
•Other immunomodulatory  investigational agents (biologic or non -biologic);
•Rituximab ;
•Cyclophosphamide;
•Other immunosuppressive agents (eg,cyclosporine) with the exception of methotrexate 
for AZA intolerance described in Section 5.5.3;
•Corticosteroids for vasculitis:

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
doses > 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent), or
IV corticosteroid pulses at any  dose;
Note: Doses of prednisone up to a maximum of 20 mg/day (or equivalent) for vasculitis, 
for a maximum of 1 week, are only allowable within the first 2 months of the double -blind 
treatment period.
•Corticosteroids for reasons ot her than vasculitis:
at an average daily  dose of > 20mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for > 14days where 
the average dail y dose is calculated as the sum of the dose over 7 consecutive day s divided 
by 7, or
IV corticosteroid pulses > 125 mg prednisone ( or equivalent)
Note: Doses of prednisone (or equivalent) > 20mg/day  for ≤ 14 days or IV corticosteroid 
pulses ≤ 125 mg prednisone (
or equivalent) for reasons other than vasculitis cannot be 
given more than once in any  365 day period(See also Section 5.5.3).
•Plasmapharesis .
5.5.2Other Prohibited Medications and Therapies
Due to the mechanism of action of belimumab, it is possible that response to vaccination may 
be impaired. Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrentl y with 
belimumab/placebo infusions.
Other investigational agents are not permitted.
5.5.3Allowable Medications
The use of stable baseline dose regimens of corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent) is permitted over the course of the trial.Doses of corticosteroid up to a maximum 
of 20mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent), for vasculitis, are permitted for a maximum of 
1week within the first 2 months of the doub le-blind treatment period. At other times, subjects 
are restricted to ≤ 10mg/dayprednisone or equivalent. It is expected that this dose may be 
tapered as clinically appropriate . Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma, or topical corticosteroids 
for atopic dermatitisare also permitted . Doses of prednisone (or equivalent) > 20mg/day  for ≤ 
14 days or an IV corticosteroid pulse up to 125 mg prednisone (or equivalent) arepermitted 
for reasons other than vasculitis (eg. acute allergic reaction) , but a subject ca nnot receive more 
than 1 such corticosteroid regimen in any 365 day period (See also Section 5.5.1).
5.5.3.1 Azathioprine and Methotrexate
The target dose of azathioprine is 2mg/kg/day  (not to exceed 200 mg/day). For the 
maintenance of remission azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated 
following administration of induction therapy. Azathioprine must not be initiated any later 
than Day 0. Azathioprine should be started at a dose of 50 mg/day and increased by no more 
than 50mg/day every week until the target dose is achieved.
Subjectsnaïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT >2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, 
characterized by severe nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be Amend 01

permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day . If the subjectcontinues to 
experience the toxicities described above a switch to methotrexate at a target dose of  
25mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. 
These subjectswill be included in the primary  analysis. 
For subjects previously  identified as being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identif ied 
as having undetectable or reduced activity  of thiopurine methy ltransferase (TPMT), it may  be
permissible for methotrexate to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance 
of remission from the outset
. This should be discussed with the medical monitor .
Methotrexate would not be recommended for those subjects with significantly  impaired renal 
function.
Theappropriate local prescribing information (eg,dose adjustments, contraindications, 
hematological and biochemical monitoring, pregnanc y, contraception, etc.)for azathioprine 
or methotrexate (MTX)(as applicable) ,should be followed prior to and during treatment.
In the extension phase of the trial, the dose of AZA/MTX can be decreased or discontinued 
based on the discretion of the inves tigator. 
6Study Procedures
The nature of potential risks and benefits associated with participation in the study will be 
explained to all potential study subjects.Written informed consent (including consent for the

Subjects who have undergone all screening procedures and have met the entry criteria will be 
enrolled into the study and assigned to treatment by Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS).Randomization will be performed on Day  0. Azathioprine may  be initiated as soon as 
it is clinically indicated following administration of induction therapy. Azathioprine must not 
be initiated any later than Day 0.Female subjects who require pregnancy testing must have a 
negative urine pregnancy test done on Day 0, prior to randomization. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( belimumab +AZA or placebo + AZA).
6.3Double-Blind Treatment P hase
Subjects will be evaluated during the scheduled study visits as outlined in the Study Calendar 
(Table6-1and Table6-2). Time windows are provided for each study visit to allow flexibility  
in site and subject scheduling. All study visits should occur within the visit window of the 
scheduled stud y visit.
At baseline (Day 0), the subject will be randomized and receive the first dose of study agent. 
Visits to the study site will occur on Day 14, Day 28, and approximately  every 28 days 
(calculated from the Day 0 dose) thereafter. Allefforts should be made to retain subjects on

2. Any SAEs occurring prior to the start of study agent administration and assessed as relate dto study participation (eg, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests) will be recorded on the SAE worksheet and 
reported as described in Section 7.2from the time a subject consents to participate in the s tudy.
3. All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are identified from the start of study agent administration ( Day 0) through 8 weeks following administration of the last dose of study agent should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE eCRF).   SAEs that occur after the 8 week follow -up period that are assessed by the investigator as definitely, possibly or probably related to study agent 
must be reported to the Drug Safety designee on the SAE worksheet.  (Post study SAEs will not be documented on the AE eCRF.)
4. Refer to Appendix 6 for laboratory assessments to be completed.
5. Results of urine pregnancy test at subsequent visits, if required, must be available prior to dosing. See S ection 6.1(Screening Procedures) for definition of those exempted from pregnancy testing.
6. In consenting subjects only ( Appendix 9 ).
7. Immunogenicity samples are collected pre -dose atall time points .  For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 8 -week follow -up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity was assessed if 8 -
week follow -up immunogenicity sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum sample for anti -belimumab antibodies at least 6 months after the last dose of study agent or after completion 
and/or unblinding of the study, whichever is later. 
8. Subjects who discontinue treatment with study agent (belimumab/ placebo) will continue to be followed per this calendar schedule until relapse as defined in Section 8.5.1 .
9. Subjects should remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 study agent infu sions.  Should symptoms of acute hypersensitivity occur, an extended period of monitoring may be 
appropriate, based on clinical judgment.
10. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, AST or ALT > 2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity reaction, characterized by severe nausea and 
vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day. If the patien t continues to experience the toxicities d escribed above a switch to methotrexate at doses of 
up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. For subjects previously identified as being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced a ctivity of 
thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the outset following discussion with the medical 
monitor.
11. Any visit in which the subj ect discontinues treatment becomes the Exit visit (ie ,generally 4 weeks after the last dose of study agent ). The Exit Visit should be completed for subjects who discontinue the double

6.4Unscheduled Visits
Unscheduled visits may be necessary  during the course of the study to capture a subject’s 
status between regularly scheduled visits. Examples include, but are not limited to, a 
worsening of disease symptoms (eg, flare), AE reporting, or follow-up to a previously  
reported AE.
6.5Laboratory  Tests
Non-fasting clinical laboratory  tests will be performed as outlined in the Study Calendar 
(seeTable6-1, Table 6-2).
Due to the potential for unblinding, the following lab results will not be provided to study 
sites after baseline (Day  0): serum immunoglobulin isoty pes IgM/IgA and the results from the 
FACS anal ysis listed below.  
In geographies where feasible, the following biological markers will be measured (using 
FACS anal ysis):
•T cell subsets: CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+
•B lymphocytes:(CD19+, CD20+, CD20+/CD69+ activated, CD27hi/CD20- short-lived 
plasma, CD27+/CD20+ memory , CD27-/CD20+ naïve, CD138+/CD20 -138 plasma cells,

6.5.2Liver Chem istry Stopping and Follow -up Criteria
Liver chemistry  stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure 
subject safety and evaluate liver event etiology in alignment with the FDA premarketing 
clinical liver safety  guidance [ James, 2009; Le Gal , 2005].
Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria- Liver Stopping Event
ALT-absolute ALT 8xULN
ALT Increase ALT 5xULN but <8xULN  persists for 2 weeks
ALT 3xULN but <5xULN  persists for 4 weeks
Bilirubin1, 2ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) 
INR2ALT 3xULN and INR>1.5, if I NR measured
Cannot Monitor ALT 5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 2 weeks
ALT 3xULN but <5xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks
Symptomatic3ALT 3xULN associated with symptoms (new or worsening) believed to be related t o liver 
injury or hypersensitivity
1) Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immedia tely 
available, discontinue study treatment for that subject if ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN. Additionally, if serum 
bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2) All events of ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR measured 
which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of 
hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the thr eshold value stated will not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.
3) New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).Amend 02

6.5.3.1 Required A ctions and Follow Up A ssessments for Increased 
Monitoring w ith Continued Therapy
Notify the GSK medical monit or within 24 hours of learning of the abnormality  to 
discuss subject safet y. 
Subject can continue study  treatment
Subject must return weekly  for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) until they  resolve, stabilise or return to within baseline 
If at any time subject meets the liver chemistry stopping criteria, proceed as 
described above for Required Actions and Follow up Assessments following ANY 
Liver Stopping Event
If ALT decreases from ALT  5xULN and <8xU LN to ≥3xUL N but <5xULN, 
continue to monitor liver chemistries weekl y. 
If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xUL N and bilirubin <2xUL N, monitor 
subjects twice monthly  until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline.
6.5.4 Study Treatment Restart
Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a 
clear underlying cause (other than drug induced liver injury [DILI]) of the liver event (e.g. 
biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there 
should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity , and the study treatment 
should not be associated with HL A markers of liver injury .
Approval b y GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where:
Investigator requests consideration for study  treatment restart if liver chemistries have a 
clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver chemistries have 
improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T <3xUL N).
Restart risk fact ors (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic hepatitis, 
possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study treatment has an HLA genetic 
marker associated with liver injury  (e.g., lapatinib, abacavir, amoxicillin/clavulanate) are
reviewed and excluded.
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart must 
be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury or death.  
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the study  
treatment r estart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  chart.  
2013N167980_ 02
Human Genome Sciences, I nc. Confidential Page 46
Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.
Subjects approved b y GSK Medical Governance for restarting stud y treatment must 
return to the clinic once a w eek for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have 
been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol. 
If after study  treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  stopping 
criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment restart. 
GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 7.2
6.5.5Immunogenicity
Serum samples for the measurement of anti-belimumab antibodies will be obtained from all 
subjects before administration of study agent on Day 0, Week 8, Week 24, Week 48 and 
Exit/8-week Follow -up. Addition ally, samples will be obtained from subjects at Weeks 24 and 
48 during additional years. For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 
8-week follow-up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity  was assessed if 8-week 
follow-up immuno genicity sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum 
sample for anti-belimumab antibodies at least 6months after the last dose of study agent or 
after completion and/or unblinding of the study , whichever is later. 
6.6Exit Visit
Subjects who relapse/flare and do not complete the study  must return for an Exit visit 4 weeks 
after the final dose of study  agent. 
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an 
attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of study 
agent.
Refer to the Study Calendar (Table6-1, Table6-2) for a list of procedures required at this 
visit.  
6.78-Week Follow -up Visit
All subjects must return for a follow-up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of 
study agent. 
Refer to the Study Calendar (see Table6-1, Table6-2) for a list of procedures required at this 
visit.Amend 04

6.8Withdrawal of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects will be free to withdraw from treatment or from the study  at any time, for any  reason, 
or they may be withdrawn/removed, if necessary , to protect their health (see reasons for 
withdrawal below). It is understood by  all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can 
render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary  withdrawal of subjects should be 
avoided.
Subjects may  be withdrawn from treatment with study  agent for any of the following reasons:
•Unacceptable toxicity  (see Section 5.4)
•Prohibited concurrent medication or therap y (see Section 5.5.1 andSection 5.5.2)
•Withdrawal of c onsent(including use and disclosure of research -related health 
information)
•Pregnancy
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an 
attempt will be made to ascertain survival status 12 months after the first dose of study agent.  
Any subject that withdraws consent for use and disclosure of research-related health 
information will be considered withdrawn from the study  and not followed. 
6.9Subject U nblinding
Belimumab and placebo will be supplied as open-label vials and 3rdparty unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstitu ted and diluted by the unblinded site pharmacist 
or designee, independent of the study (person responsible for receiving and dispensing study 
agent). Except for a limited number of safety  oversight personnel, all study site personnel, the 
subject, the sponsor and the Contract Research Organization (CRO) remain blinded to the 
study agent received and to the results of certain biomarker and pharmacody namic laboratory  
results. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study 
agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study .
If a medical emergency occurs and a decision regarding the subject’s condition requires 
knowledge of the treatment assignment, the study blind may be broken for the specific 
subject.Whenever possible, the investigator should consult with the medical monitor prior to 
unblinding any subject. Any broken blind will be clearly justified and explained by a 
comment in the eCRF. The investigator must notify  the Medical Monitor of any  broken blind, 
regardless of whethe r it was done for emergency  or non-emergency  reasons.

The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
7.1Definitions
ADVERSE EVENT 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the
use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to
produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of effica cy), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae.
“Lack of efficacy”or “failure of expected pharmacological action”per se will not be reported
as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from
lack of efficacy  will be reported if they  fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsenAmend 04

The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT –A serious adverse event is an y untoward medical 
occurrence that, at an y dose:
a. Results in death
b. Is life-threatening 
NOTE:The term 'life-threatening' inthe definition of 'serious' refers to an event inwhich 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
NOTE:In general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency  ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-
patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication 
prolongs hospitalisation or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in 
doubt as to whether “hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be 
considered serious.
Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsenfrom 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d. Results in disability  / incapacity , or
NOTE:The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly  / birth defect
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples 
of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

g. All events of possible drug -induced liver injury with hy perbilirubinaemia defined as ALT ≥ 
3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT ≥3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR 
measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is notrequired and the threshold 
value stated will not apply to patients receivinganticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing isunavailable, 
record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin
elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the
criterion of total bilirubin ≥2xULN, then the event is still reportedas an SAE. If INR is 
obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver injury .
7.2Reporting A dverse Events to the Sponsor
All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are identified from thestart 
of study agent administration (Day0) through 8 weeks following administration of the last 
dose of study agent will be recorded on the Adverse Even tCase Report Form (AE eCRF). All 
data fields on the AE eCRF should be completed.
For subjects who discontinue treatment with study agent during the double-blind period (for 
reasons other than withdrawal of consent), all adverse events will be collected through 
8weeks following the administration of the last dose of study  agent. After this time, all SAEs , 
regardless of relationship to study  drug, will be collected until relapse or the study is analysed 
for the primary endpointand study sites are informed that SAE data collection can cease, 
whichever occurs first.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs )must ALSO be recorded on the SAE eCRF within 24 hours of 
site personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedness. All fields of the SAE 
eCRF should be completed, but completion of the reportshould not be held until all 
information is available. Follow-upinformation and corrections should be added to the eCRF 
within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the eventas described in the Study 
Procedure Manual. 
In addition, prior to study drug administration, any SAE assessed as relatedto study 
participation (eg, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests) will be reported as anSAE 
from the time a subject consents to participate in the study.   
SAEsthatoccuroff study, afterthefollow-up periodthatareassessedbytheinvestigator as
definitely ,possibly orprobably related tostudyagent mustbereportedtothesponsor as 
outlined in the Study  Procedures Manual.
7.3Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting (Protocol Specified 
Events)
Protocol Specified Events (PSEs) are additional events that must be reported to the Drug 
Safety designee in an expedited manner. A PSE may or may not be an SAE. PSEs are 
considered SAEs if they  meet 1 or more of the criteria for an SAE (See Section 7.1). PSEsare Amend 04

recorded on thePSE page of the eCRF within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of 
the event. 
IgG < 250 mg/dL (Grade 4) is a protocol specified event for this protocol. 
7.4Laboratory  Abnormalities as A dverse Events
Any abnormal laboratory  test results (hematology ,clinical chemistry , or urinalysis)or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, any clinically 
significant safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged 
by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, are not to be 
reported as AEs or SAEs. 
If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  abnormalit y, the diagnosis or medical 
condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg,
elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL 
(Grade 4) should always be recorded on the PSE page of the eCRF. IgG < 250 mg/dLshould 
also be reported as an SAE if it meets one or more of the SAE criteria in Section 7.1.
Laboratory tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7.If a particular lab testis not listed in the Appendix, the lab test should be graded 
mild, moderateor severe as specif ied in Section 7.8.
7.5Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in SLE patients recei ving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherap y, including belimumab. A diagnosis of PML  should be considered in an y 
subject presenting with new- onset or deteriorating neurological signs and sy mptoms. The 
subject should be referred to a neurologist or other appropriate specialist for evaluation. If 
PML is confirmed, stud y agent should be discontinued and consideration should be given to 
stopping all immunosuppressant therapy . 
If PML is suspected, this should be immediately  reported to the Medical Monitor.  The 
appropriateness of continuing study  agent, while the case is being assessed, should be 
discussed.
7.6Suicidality  Assessment
Some autoimmune diseases have an increased risk of suicidal behavior and/or ideation 
(Bachenet al, 2009, Timonen et al, 2003, Stenager et al, 1992).In order to objectively  assess 
suicidality  in belimumab clinical programs the C-SSRS will be utilized to collect information
on suicidal behavior and ideation. Since major depressive disorder may increase the risk of 
suicidal ideation or behavior before or during clinical studies, subjects participating in this 
study will beassessed at every  visit for suicidalit y.Amend 03

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
Subjectswho answer “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation questions 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS should be referred to appropriate psychiatric care and prompts the 
completion of an SAE worksheet. The medical monitor should be notified when these events
occur. In addition, a “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation question 3, 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS prompts the completion of the Possible Suicidality Related History 
Questionnaire (PSRHQ, only the first time this condition is met; refer to Appendix 10for the 
PSRHQ) eCRF and a Possible Suicidality  Related Questionnaire (PSRQ) eCRF (at all times 
this condition is met ; refer to Appendix 11 for the PSRQ ).  
Baseline/Screening and during treatment assessment of suicidality  will be performed during 
the blinded portion of this study using C
-SSRS (Refer to Appendix 8for C-SSRS). 
TheC-SSRS is a brief measure which is designed to assess severity and change of suicidality 
by integrating both behaviour and ideation (Posneret al, 2007). The C-SSRS is administered 
by a qualified clinician and is designed to address the need for asummary measure to track 
change in the severit y/density of suicidality  across both clinical settings and treatment trials. I t 
assesses intensity of ideation (a potentially  important marker of severity) by specifically 
asking about frequency , duration, intrusiveness, controllability , and deterrents. In addition, it 
captures both the modal and most severe forms of ideation. The C- SSRS is to be completed by 
the investigator or his/her qualified designee at every visit during the double-blind portion of 
the study. 
Although assessment of suicidality  using the C-SSRS will take place only during the blinded 
portion of the study, investigators are reminded of the importance to clinically assess for 
suicidality  at every visit given that study patients are at increased risk of suicidal behavior 
and/or ideation.
7.6.1Possible Suicidality  Related Questionnaire (PSRQ)
The investigator will be prompted to complete the PSRQ (in addition to the AE or SAE pages, 
as appropriate) if a yes response is given to any  suicidal behavior or a yes response to suicidal 
ideation questions 3, 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS.Refer to Appendix 11for the PSRQ. If the 
adverse event meets the definition of an SAE, which includes a yes answer to any suicidal 
behavioror a yes to suicidal ideation questions 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS the site must ensure that 
there are no significant discrepancies between the PSRQ and the SAE.
7.7Reporting a Pregnancy
Any pregnancy  that occurs during stud y participation must be reported u sing a clinical trial 
pregnancy  form. To ensure subject safet y, each pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor 
within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence. All pregnancies that are identified from the start 
of study agent through 16 weeks following the la st dose of study  agent should be reported. 
The pregnancy  must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) 
and status of mother and child. Pregnancy  complications and elective terminations for medical 
reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an 
SAE.Amend 02

Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy , brought to the investigator’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study  and considered by  the investigator as possibly  
related to the study treatment, must be promptly  reported to the Sponsor.
7.8Investigator Evaluation of A dverse Events
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria for 
seriousness are listed in Section 7.1), severity (intensity), and causality (relationship to study 
agent). The investigator will make an assessment of intensity based on the Division of 
Microbiology  and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables (see 
Appendix 7 ) where possible:
SEVERITY
Mild An event that is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal  
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities (Grade 1
DMID).
Moderate An event that is s ufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
everyday activities (Grade 2 DMID).
Severe An event that prevents normal every day activities (Grade 3 or 4 
DMID). 
Not applicable Those event(s) where intensity is meaningless or impossible to
determine (i.e., blindness and coma).
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre-defined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE.
CAUSALITY
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) 
and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.Amend 02

Human Genome Sciences, I nc. Confidential Page 54
Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to includein the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to GSK.The investigator may change his/her opinion of 
causality in light of follow-up information, amending the SAE data collection tool 
accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.
7.9Follow-Up of A dverse Events
Serious and non-serious adverse events that occur from the start of study medication 
administration through 8 weeks after the date of last administration of study agentare 
reported.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigato r is required to proactively  follow each subject 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-serious AEs of special interest (see Section 
8.6.2) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or until thesubject is lost to follow-up. This applies to all subjects, 
including those withdrawn prematurel y. 
PSEs (see Section 7.3) that occur after the Screening visit through 8 weeks after thedate of 
last administration of study agent are reported and followed as described above for 
AEs/SAEs.
7.10Reporting Serious A dverse Events to Regulatory  Authorities and
Institutional Review Board s/Independent Ethics Committee s
All SAEs that are considered by the sponsor to be unexpected and related to belimumab will 
be reported by the sponsor or designee as expedited (eg, 15-Day) reports to the appropriate 
regulatory  authorities AND to all participating investigators (exceptions discussed below). In 
addition, the sponsor or designee follows all applicable local and national regulatory  
requirements regarding safety reporting. Each investigator must also comply withthe 
applicable regulatory requirements relatedtothereporting ofSAEstotheIRBs/IECs 
responsible forreviewing thestudyattheirsite,aswellastheregulatory authority(ies)(if 
applicable).
All serious adverse events, including serious disease
-related events (discussed below), will 
be monitored by treatment group by an independent DMC. Investigators and IRBs/IECs will 
be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting, and any  recommendations made.
The conditions listed in Appendix 3are disease related events that can occur in the study 
population regardless of belimumab exposure. When these conditions are considered SAEs, 
they must be reported to the Sponsorwithin 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware as 
described in Section 7.2. Where these are clearly related to the underlying vasculitis, the 
Sponsormay not submit them as expedited reports to regulatory  authorities or participating 
investigators .Amend 04

8Endpoints and Statistical A nalysis
8.1General Statistical Considerations
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be performed on the intent to treat (ITT) 
population defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study 
agent(belimumab or placebo). The ITT analysis will be performed according to the treatment 
that a subject was ran domized to receive, regardless of the actual treatment received.
The database will be locked for the primary analysis afterall data have been collected, 
verified and validated for all subjects through 12 months after the randomization of the 
lastsubject.All subjects and study site personnel will remain blinded to original treatment 
assignment until after the final database is lockedand the results of the study are made 
publicly available. 
Analysis of primary and secondary  endpoints will be exploratory in nature. Nominal p values
may be reported and considered descriptive. Where appropriate point estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals will be constructed.
8.2Randomization Procedure and A ssignment to Treatment Groups
This is a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Once subjects have consented, have undergone all screening procedures and have been 
determined to be eligible for the study , they will be randoml y assigned (via an interactive web 
response system [IWRS]) to 1 of 2 treatment groups (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) in a 
1:1 ratio. At randomization, subjects will be stratified according to ANCAtype (anti-PR3 vs.
anti-MPO), disease stageat induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease), andinduction 
regimen (IV cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs.RTX). Randomization will be 
performed on Day  0.  
8.3Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are lockedand analyzed(after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee) . The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Initial randomization will be limited to 40 subjects 
per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC 
reviews will occur after the first 20subjects per induction regimen (RTX or IV/oral CYC) 
havebeenrandomized and have had a Week 8 visit. Once the first 20 subjects randomized 
following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the 
DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding whether to continue randomization . The 
same procedure would be applied for the first 20 subjects randomized following induction 
with CYC. The DMC will review the data approximately  every 6months thereafter across 
both induction regimens. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment 
allocation.  Investigators and IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each DMC 
meeting.Amend 04

The DMC will receive information within 72 hours of the sponsor or designee receiving 
notification of any IgG < 250 mg/dL and all unexpected causally-related SAEs that are life 
threatening or result in death. Other unexpected, causa lly-related SAEs will be provided to the 
DMC within 15 calendar days.  In addition, the DMC will receive information on all serious 
infections and all opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship to study agent, within 
15 calendar day s.
8.4Sample Size Rationale
Approximately  100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined based 
on the feasibility  of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-frame. The 
sample size was not based on statistical considerations and the analysis of primary and 
secondary  endpoints will be exploratory  in nature. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebo group, a 
relapse rate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically  significant 
(p<0.05) in a stud y of 100 subjects (50 per arm). 
8.5Efficacy
8.5.1Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse ,defined as 
•at least 1 major BVAS item ( Appendix 4 ) OR 
•a minimum total BVAS score of 6 (Appendix 4 ) OR
•receipt of prohibited medications (a s defined in Section 5.5.1).
8.5.2Primary Efficacy 
Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the time to first relapse from Day 0 between the 
placebo/azathioprine group and the belimumab/azathioprine combination group using a Cox 
proportional hazard model, adjusted for ANCA type (anti- PR3 vs.anti-MPO), disease stage at 
induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease), and induction regimen (rituximab vs.IV 
cyclophosphamide vs.oral cyclophosphamide). However, the adjustment of induction 
regimen will be changed to rituximab vs.IV and/or oral cyclophosphamide if the number of 
events (relapse) is less than 5 in subjects using the oral or IV cyclophosphamide. If there are 
then still less than 5 patients with an event (relapse) in any of the levels of this or any other 
stratification factor then the stratification term may be removed from the model. For any 
subject who does not experience a relapse, the time to first relapse will be censored at the time 
of the 
subject’s last assessment. Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare 
(asdefined in primary efficacy endpoint) are to be followed per protocol for inclusion in the 
primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). The database will be locked and the primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject .Amend 04

Biological Markers and Autoantibodies:
Pharmacogenetic sampling (in consenting subjects) will be taken once during the course of 
this study  (see Appendix 9 ).  
Biological markers will be measured at baseline (Day 0) and at multiple time points 
thereafter:
•Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA – anti-PR3, anti-MPO)
•Serum complement (C3, C4)
•Serum immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA, IgM, IgG)
•C-reactive Protein (CRP)
•Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
•Urinary protein: urinary  creatinine ratio
•BLyS protein (Day 0 only)

8.5.5Major Secondary  Endpoint analy sis and Other Efficacy Analyses
The exploratory  analysis ofthemajor secondary  efficacy endpoint will be performed using the
samemethod described for theprimary efficacyendpoint, but censoring subjects who receive 
any prohibited medicatio n (as defined in Section 5.5.1)prior to an observation of any major 
BVAS item . Any censoring will be applied on the date prohib ited medications are received.
The analysis of other efficacy endpoints, biomarkers, and auto-antibodies measurements will 
be described in the statistical analysis plan.
8.6Safety
8.6.1Definition of Safety Variables
Safety will be evaluated by adverse events, changes in laboratory  parameters, suicidality  
assessment ( Appendix 8 ), and immunogenicit y.
8.6.2Analysis of Safety Variables
AEs will be graded for severity by the investigator using AdverseEvent Severity Grading 
Tables(Appendix 7) or as described in Section 7.8, as appropriate. The frequency  and rate of 
AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Additional 
analyses may be performed based on event rates adjusting for subject-years on study agent if 
thetime on study agent is imbalanced across treatment groups. Serious and severe (Grade 3 
and Grade 4) AEs will also be summarized by MedDRA SOC and preferred term. 
Discontinuations due to AEs will be summar ized. 
The frequency  of laboratory  abnormalities will be tabulated by treatment group. Laboratory  
values will be assessed for changes from baseline. Laboratory  toxicity will be graded using 
Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables when possible. Shift tables will be used to determine 
if subjects move from normal to abnormal during the course of the study. Shifts of ≥ 2 grades 
and Grade 3 or 4 laboratory  abnormalities will be summarized.

•Immunogenicit y
The analyses of these safety  endpoints will be described in the statistical analy sis plan.
8.7Pharmacokinetics
8.7.1Definition of Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
All randomized subjects who receive a dose of study  agent will be sampled for the assessment 
of serum belimumab levels. Assessment of belimumab concentrations will be performed at the 
timepoints indicated in Section 6.5.1.
8.7.2Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
Serum belimumab concentration will be determined by an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) -
based assay. Results for this study will be presented using appropriate graphicand tabular 
summaries. Serum belimumab concentration data obtained from this study will be used in a 
population PK analysis, which will be reported separately . Potential effects of demographic 
characteristics, concurrent medications, renal function or disease state on belimumab PK will 
be evaluated.
9Pharmacogenetics (PGx)
In consenting subjects, ablood sample for PGx research will be drawn at baseline (Day 0)to 
better characterize genetic variability  (eg,HLA typing) that may affectefficacy or safety 
endpoints. Information regarding PGx research is included in Appendix 9 .
The IEC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory  agency must approve the PGx 
assessments before these can be conducted at the study site. The approval(s) must be in 
writing and clearly specify approval of the PGx assessments (ie, approval of Appendix 9). In 
some cases, approval of the PGx assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest 
of the study. If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate that approval of the PGx 
assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx assessments, can be initiated. 
When PGx assessments are not approved, then approval for the rest of the study will clearly 
indicate this and that PGx assessments will not be conducted.
10Study Administration
Belimumab is under joint development by Human Genome Sciences, Inc and 
GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals. Human Genome Sciences, Inc. is the sponsor of the study .
10.1Informed Consent

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
form must be approved by the IRB/IEC and contain all elements required by national, state, 
local, and institutional regulations or requirements.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to provide each subject with full and adequate verbal 
and written information using the IRB/IEC approved informed consent document(s), 
including the objective and procedures of the study and the possible risks involved before 
inclusion in the study.Each subject must voluntarily  provide written informed consent 
(including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health information). The 
consent must be obtained prior to performing any study-related procedures that are not part of 
normal patient care, including screening and changes in medications including any  washout of 
medications. A copy of the signed informed consent must be given to the study  subject.
10.2Institutional Review Board R eview/Independent Ethics Committee 
Review and Approval
The investigator or Sponsor (as appropriate per national regulations) shall assure that an 
IRB/IEC, constituted in accordance with the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
will provide initial and continuing review of the study .
Prior to shipment of the study agent and enrollment of study subjects, documented IRB/IEC 
approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and any advertisement for subject 
recruitment must be obtained and provided to the Sponsoror designee.
The IRB/IEC must also be informed of all protocol amendments prior to implementation. The 
investigator must provide reports of any change in research activity (ie, the completion, 
termination, or discontinuation of a study ) to the IRB/IEC.
10.3Protocol Compliance
Except for a change that is intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a study 
subject, the protocol shall be conducted as described.Any such change must be reported 
immediately  to the Sponsorand to the IRB/IEC.
10.4Protocol Revisions
Protocol amendments will be prepared and approved by the Sponsor. All protocol 
amendments will be signed by the investigator and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review prior 
to implementation. Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to the Sponsoror 
designee. If an amendment significantl y alters the study design, increases potential risk to the 
subject or otherwise affects statements in the informed consent form, the informed consent 
form must be revised accordingly  and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval. The 
approved consent form must be used to obtain informed consent from new subjects prior to 
enrollment and must be used to obta in informed consent from subjects already  enrolled if they  
are affected b y the amendment.

10.5Data Collection and Management
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records for 
each subject. The investigator is also responsible for maintaining any source documentation 
related to the stud y, including an y films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes.
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. For data collection and 
management purposes, subjects are to be identified by  a subject number only . Documents that 
identify the subject beyond subject number will not be submitted to the Sponsor(eg, the 
signed informed consent document; subject initials) and must be maintained in strict 
confidence by the investigator , except to the extent necessary  to allow auditing by the 
regulatory authorities, study  monitor, or Sponsorrepresentatives.
Site personnel record all data for each study  subject through electronic case report forms using
an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) s ystem provided and approved by  the Sponsor. Refer to the 
Study Procedures Manual for additional information regarding CRFs that will be used as 
source documentation. Sites must complete the eCRFs in a timely  manner and the investigator 
must promptly reviewthe completed eCRFs for each subject. As the person ultimately 
responsible for the accuracy of all eCRF data, the investigator must sign the Investigator's 
Statement in each subject's eCRF.
The EDC system automatically  generates queries resulting from thecomputer checks 
embedded into the sy stem, so as to ensure accuracy , quality, consistency , and completeness of 
the database. Manual queries resulting from review by monitors, medical coders, and other 
Data Management staff are also generated from within the EDC system, where they are 
tracked. Sites resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary . Every change 
to data is captured in the EDC system audit trail. Uponcompletion of the study, or after 
reaching a pre-specified point in the study,Data Management will lock the database and 
generate the SAS datasets necessary  for data analysis and reporting. Uponcompletion of the 
study, each site will be provided with a compact disk containing the eCRFs for each of their 
subjects.
10.6Study Monitoring
The study Sponsor, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or designee, will monitor the study .Study 
monitors representing the Sponsorwill visit study sites routinely throughout the trial.The 
Sponsorwill review CRFs and compare them with source documents to verify accurate and 
complete collection of data and confirm that the study is being conducted according to the 
protocol. Auditors representing the Sponsormay also similarly evaluate the study and its 
monitors. For these purposes, the investigator will make CRFs and source documents 
available when requested. 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by representatives of the national regulatory 
authorities, who will also be allowed access to study documents. The investigators should 
promptly notify Human Genome Sciences of any audits they have scheduled with any 
regulatory  authority.

10.7Drug Accountability
Upon receipt, the investigator is responsible for taking an inventory  of the study agent, 
including any buffers or diluents.A record of this inventory  must be kept and usage must be 
documented on study  agent inventory  forms provided by  the Sponsor.
Study agent inventory  forms will be examined and reconciled by a Sponsor’s unblinded 
monitor, or designee. At the end of the study, all used and unused study agent mustbe 
accounted for on a stud y agent accountability  form.
10.8Retention of Records
The investigator shall retain all records and source documents pertaining to the study, 
including any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes.They will be retained for the longer of 
the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the study is conducted, 
or the period specified by the Sponsorat the time the study is completed, terminated, or 
discontinued.
If the investigator leaves the institution, the records shall be transferred to an appropriate 
designee who accepts the responsibility  for record retention. Notice of such transfer shall be 
documented in writing and provided to the Sponsor.
10.9Financial Disclosure
The investigator and all sub-investigators will provide HGS sufficient and accurate 
information on financial interests (proprietary  or equity interests, payments exclusive of 
clinical trial costs) to allow complete disclosure to regulatory  authorities. The investigator 
shall promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the 
investigation and for a period of 1 y ear following study  completion.
10.10Publication Policy
This study is being conducted as part of a multi-center clinical study. Data from all sites 
participating inthe multi-center clinical study will be pooled and analyzed. The investigator 
acknowledges that an independent, joint publication is anticipated to be authored by the 
investigators of the multi-center study and Sponsor’s representatives. Neither institution nor 
principal investigator shall independentl y publish or present the results of the study prior to 
the publication of the multi-center study publication. The investigator agrees that the Sponsor
will be the coordinator and arbitrator of all multi-center study publications. For multi-center 
trials, no investigator will be authorized to publish study results from an individual center 
until the earlier of the multi-center trial results are published or 12 months after the end or 
termination of the multi- center trial at all sites.
The investigator shall submit a copy of any proposed publication, manuscript, abstract, 
presentation or other document with respect to this study to the Sponsorfor review and 
comment at least 60 days prior to its submission for publication or presentation. No 
publication or presentation with respect to the study shall be made unless and until all of the 
2013N167980_ 02

Sponsor’s comments on the proposed publication or presentation have been considered and 
any information determined by Sponsorto be confidential information has been removed. If 
requested in writing by the Sponsor, the investigator shall withhold material from submission 
for publication or presentation for an additional 60 days to allow for the filing of a patent 
application or the taking of other measures to establish and preserve the Sponsor’s proprietary  
rights.
10.11Study or Study Site Termination
If HGS, the investigator, IRB/IEC, or a regulatory  authority discoversconditions arising 
during the study  that indicate that the study  should be halted or that the study  center should be 
terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between HGS and the 
investigator. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
•The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study.
•A decision on the part of HGS to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the product for WG or MPA.
The study  site may warrant terminatio n under the following conditions:
•Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study  at an acceptable rate.
•Failure of the investigator to comply  with pertinent regulatory  authority regulations.
•Submission of knowingly  false information from the research facility  to HGS, study  
monitor, or the regulatory authorit y.
•Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

Appendix 9 Pharmacogenetic Research
Background
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study of variability  in drug response due to hereditary  factors 
in different populations. There is increasing evidence that an individual's genetic composition 
(ie,genotype) may impact pharmacokinetics, pharmacod ynamics (relationship between
concentrations and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) and/or 
clinical outcome (in terms of efficacy  and/or safety  and tolerability ).
A key component to successful PGx research is the collection of samples during the conduct
of clinical studies.  
Research Rationale
Systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood vessels 
with a variety of etiologies but little is knownregarding the genetic contribution to risk for 
developing different forms of vasculitis.  Recent gene studies in vasculitis are identify ing both 
common polymorphisms associated with other autoimmune but also completely  different 
associations (Monachand Merkel, 2010) .
There is growing evidence for a genetic contribution to the risk of developing different forms 
of vasculitis (Monachand Merkel,2010) for example the association of alpha 1-antitrypsin 
deficiency  in WG. 
Blood samples for pharmaco genetics will be drawn as described in Section 9.Insights into the 
genetic pathways underlying AAVmay help identify subgroups of patients that may have 
additional benefit from therapies from specific therapies. Fc Receptor polymorphism analysis 
may further define the interaction between underlying genetic heterogeneity  and the 
therapeutic endpoints utilized in this trial.  
Collection of whole blood samples may enable PGx analyses to be conducted if there are any 
unexplained or unexpected results. 
If at any time it appears there is potential variability  in response in this clinical study or in a 
series of clinical studies with belimumab that may be attributable to genetic variations of 
subjects, the following o bjectives may  be investigated: 
•Relationship between genetic variants and the pharmacokinetics of belimumab.
•Relationship between genetic variants and safet y and/or tolerability  of belimumab.
•Relationship between genetic variants and efficacy of belimumab.Amend 02

Study Population
Any subject who has given informed consent to participate in the clinical study, has met all 
the entry criteria for the clinical study, and receives belimumab may take part in the PGx 
research.  
Subject participation in the PGx research is voluntary  and refusal to participate will not 
indicate withdrawal from the clinicalstudy. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or 
loss of benefits to which the subject would otherwise be entitled.
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the PGx research may  still participate in the clinical 
study. PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken for PGx 
research.
Study Assessments and Procedures
In addition to any  blood samples drawn for the clinical st udy, a whole blood sample (~10 mL) 
will be collected for the PGx research using a DNA tube. The PGx sample is labeled (or 
coded) with a study specific number that can be traced or linked back to the subject by the 
investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or 
social security number). The blood sample will be taken on a single occasion unless a 
duplicate sample is required due to inability to utilize the original sample. The blood samples 
will be drawn on Day 0 (baseline) visit provided informed consent for PGx research has been 
obtained from the subject, but may be taken at any time while the subject is participating in 
the clinical study . 
If deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted from the blood sample, the DNA may be 
subjected to sample quality control analysis. This analysis will involve the genotyping of 
several genetic markers to confirm the integrity of individual samples. If inconsistencies are 
noted in the anal ysis, then those samples may  be destroy ed. 
The need to conduct PGx analysis may be identified after a study (or set of studies) of 
belimumab has been completed and the study data reviewed. In some cases, the samples may 
not be studied ie, no questions are raised about how people respond to belimum ab. 
Samples will be stored securely and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study or the sponsor may destroy the samples sooner. The sponsor or those 
working with the sponsor (for example, other researchers) will use sample s collected from the 
study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the subject informed consent form.
Subjects may  request their sample to be destroy ed at any time.

Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in PGx research and has a sample taken for PGx 
research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than lost to follow-up, the 
subject will be given the following options:
1.The sample is retained for PGx research.
2.Any PGx sample is destroy ed.
If a subject withdraws consent from the PGx research or requests sample destruction for any 
reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample 
destruction within the timeframe specified by the sponsor and maintain the documentati on in 
the site study records. In either case, the sponsor will only use study information 
collected/generated up to that point.
Screen and Baseline Failures
If a blood sample for PGx research has been collected and it is determined that the subject 
does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the clinical study, then the investigator 
must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the 
timeframe specified b y the sponsor and maintain the documentation in the site stud y records.
Pharmacogenetics Analyses
Specific sections of DNA may be selected from areas of the genome (ie, candidate genes)
known to encode the drug target, drug metabolizing enzymes, areas associated with 
mechanisms underlying adverse events, and those linked to study disease and, thus, linked to 
drug response. 
Generally , two approaches will be utilized to explore genetic variation in drug response.
The candidate genes that may  be selected and investigated in this study  are the following: 
•HLA alleles
•Alpha-1 anti-trypsin (A1AT)
•Fc receptors
•Cytokines, immune receptors and chemokines related to immune cell function
In addition, continuing research may identify other enzymes, transporters, proteins, or 
receptors that may be involved in response to belimumab. The genes that may code for these 
proteins may  also be studi ed.
By evaluating large numbers of poly morphic markers (eg, single nucleotide pol ymorphisms or 
SNPs) throughout the genome, sets of markers may be identified that correspond to 
differential dr ug response. These will include:
2013N167980_ 02
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 114
Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 Belimumab
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Testing
The genotypic frequencies of each polymorphism will be evaluated for conformity  to 
those expected under normal conditions by employing Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium 
testing.
Comparison of Dem ographic and Baseline Characteristics by Genotype
Differences in baseline clinical characteristics and potential contributing covariates may 
be summarized and compared among genoty pe (or haploty pe) subgroups.
Evaluation of Genotypic Effects
Analyses may becarried out to evaluate the degree of association between subject 
genotype (orhaplotype) and selected parameters (eg, pharmacokinetics, SLE disease 
activity and safety). Where such genotypic tests are inappropriate (eg, where the number 
of marker genotypes is too large and/or the frequency  of individual genotypes too small), 
allelic tests may  be conducted. Allelic tests evaluate whether the frequency  of each marker 
allele is the same in responders and non -responders.
Evaluation of Treatment by Genotype an d Gene-Gene Interaction
In addition to evaluating the main effects of the genotypes (haplotypes or alleles) on the 
selected parameters, the possibility  of a treatment group by genotype (haplotype or allele) 
interaction will also be explored. If appropriate , the joint effects of multiple markers 
(gene-gene interactions) may  also be evaluated.
Linkage Disequilibrium
For pairs of polymorphisms, the degree to which alleles from the 2 sites are correlated 
(linkage disequilibrium) may also be evaluated. If the genotypes at 2 polymorphic sites 
within a gene are shown to be statistically  associated with a response to investigational 
product, the degree of linkage disequilibrium will aid interpretation in that it will indicate 
the extent to which the 2 sites are exer ting independent effects.
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity
Adjustment to observed p- values may be made to limit erroneous conclusions due to 
multiple tests when multiple markers are evaluated (especiall y in the case of a genome 
scan for association). 
Power and Sample Size Considerations
The ability to detect differential drug response among genotypes at a polymorphic site 
depends on the total number of subjects genotyped and the frequency  distribution of the 
different genotypes. Consequently , genotyping analyses are plausible for those 
polymorphic sites where the number of subjects comprising the genotypic groups is 
sufficiently  large; however, these frequencies will not be known until sufficient samples 
have been collected and genot yping is complete.

Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s PGx Data
The sponsor may summarize the cumulative PGx research results in the clinical study report. 
In general, the sponsor does not inform the investigator, subject or anyone else (eg, family 
members, study investigators, primary care physicians, insurers, or employers) of the PGx 
research results because the information generated from PGx studies is preliminary  in nature, 
and the significance and scientific validity of the results are undeterm ined at such an early 
stage of research, under any  circumstance unless required by  law.

Appendix 12 Protocol A ddendum –Benefit and Risk A ssessment
Disease Background
The systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis; also known as granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti- neutrophil cy toplasmic antibodies (ANCA) ( Jennetteand 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to lifethreatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. 
Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining patterns in 
immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear (P-ANCA). It is 
now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 3 (PR3), and P-
ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which are enzymes that 
are abundant in the granules of neutrophils ( Jennetteand Falk, 1997; Merkelet al, 1997). 
Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO autoantibodies are 
more common in MPA and CSS. Anti -PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality compared to anti-MPO. The most widely used classification criteria for 
diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are those published by the American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavittet al, 1990 and Masiet al, 1990, 
respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA 
(Jennetteet al, 1994). Of note, none of these diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement 
of ANCA.
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the
same classification criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Wattset al, 2007). 
In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiological studies are confounded by its original 
inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilizing the ACR or CHCC criteria, 
prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and 0.4-
1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by somemargin 
(Koldingsnes et al, 2008). AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with peak age of onset in 
those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatsakiet al, 2010), with other small vessel vasculitides being the 
major concern in childhood (Broganet al, 2010).Current therapy is usually determined by 
severity of the disease, with more severe forms warranting more aggressive approaches. These 
usually involve an initial remission induction regimen of high dose corticosteroid 
administered with either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX) followed by a 
remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stoneet al, 2010; Boschet al, 2007; 
Jayneet al, 2003). Minor manifestations are usually treated with low dose corticosteroid 
administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate (Belmont, 2006). Even with recent Amend 02

treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains unacceptabl y 
high (Droogeret al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmaniet al, 1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG 
(Stoneet al, 2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 ( Mukhtyaret al, 2009). In its current form it is a list of 
56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A weighted numerical score 
is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each manifestation. The items are grouped 
by organ systems, and each organ system has a maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the 
relative importance of the organ system (Mukhtyaret al, 2009). The tool also makes a 
distinction between new or worsening disease and persistent disease with new or worsening 
attracting higher scores.
IV Belimumab
Over 2,000 individuals with SL E have been tre ated with belimumab in clinical studies. In two 
global Phase 3 studies, belimumab 10 mg/kg met the primary efficacy endpoint (SRI at 
Week52). Evidence of other possible benefits in these trials included reductions in risk of 
severe flare and corticosteroid use, and improvements in patient reported quality of life and 
fatigue. Serological activity was reduced as measured by reductions in autoantibodies and 
normalization of hypergammaglobulinemia and complement levels. B cells, including 
autoreactive B cells, were also reduced, but not severely  depleted, consistent with what would 
be expected from inhibition of BLyS (reference belimumab IB, Section 5.3.1). These results 
supported the approval of belimumab in the EU, US, Canada and other countries.
In the Unit ed States belimumab is approved for the following indication:
BENLYSTA®  (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, 
autoantibody -positive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard 
therapy.
Limitations of Use: The efficacy of BENLYSTA has not been evaluated in patients with 
severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. BENLYSTA 
has not been studied in combination with other biologics or intravenous 
cyclophosphamide. Use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in these situations.
In the EU, the approved indication focuses on patients with high disease activity (where 
belimumab offered the greatest benefit):
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, 
autoantibo dypositive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease 
activity (e.g positive anti -dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.
The EU SPC also includes special warnings and precautions for use similar to the US 
labeling, including that belimumab has not been studied in and is thus not recommended in 
2013N167980_ 02

patients with severe active central nervous system lupus or severe active lupus nephritis. In 
addition, caution should be exercised if belimumab is co-administered with other B cell 
targeted therapy or cyclophosphamide. Reference Section 4.4 of the SPC for the complete list 
of specials warnings and precautions.
Treatment with belimumab plus standard therapy was generally well tolerated, with rates of 
AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leadingto discontinuation, and serious/severe infections 
generally comparable to the rates observed in the placebo plus standard therapy group. The 
most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 3% of patients receiving 10 mg/kg 
belimumab IV in clinical trials (and at a ≥ 1% greater rate than placebo) were nausea, 
diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity , depression, 
migraine, pharyngitis, cystitis, leukopenia, and gastroenteritis viral. In clinical trials, 
hypersensitivity and infusion reactions were observed more frequently with belimumab, with 
anaphylaxis observed in ≤ 1% of subjects. Data from the post-marketing setting indicate that 
hypersensitivity  reactions may be serious or result in death, that the onset of such reactions 
may be delayed, and that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant 
hypersensitivity  may be at increased risk. In addition, it is also known from clinical trials and 
the post-marketing setting that the vast majority of hypersensitivity  reactions occur with the 
1stor 2ndinfusion. The product labeling, belimumab IB, protocol, and informed consent forms 
have been updated to include this new information, as applicable.
Other risks that may be associated with belimumab based on its mechanism of action include 
serious infections and malignancy , although no increases in the rates of serious infections or 
malignancies have been observed. Psychiatric events including depression and suicide were 
observed more frequently  with belimumab than with placebo, although it is unknown if 
belimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these events. Finally, mortality 
rates in the controlled clinical trials were low, although numerically  higher in the belimumab 
groups (0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectively ). Causes of death 
were as expected in an SLE population with active disease receiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, 
cardiovascular disease, and suicide.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in patients with SLE receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherap y, including belimumab. Although the benefit-risk profile for belimumab 
remains unchanged following these events, the Sponsor considers that knowledge of these 
cases is important and has updated the clinical investigator’s brochure (IB) for belimumab and 
revised the informed consent form (ICF) to communicate that development of PML is a 
potential risk.  
Experience from open-label, long-term continuation trials of belimumab in SLE patients 
suggests prolonged treatment with belimumab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase i n the incidence of AEs or SAEs over time, including important events such 
as infections and malignancies. Long-term belimumab treatment appears to provide sustained 
improvement in SL E disease activity  and reduction of flares.Amend 03

Belimumab in A NCA-Associated V asculitis
Study Overview and Patient Population
Belimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg in combination with standard SLE therapy demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically meaningful reduction in SLE disease activity versus 
placebo plus standard SLE t herapy at Week 52 in two Phase 3 clinical studies in subjects with 
active, autoantibod y-positive SL E.
Studies in subjects with WG and MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2 dis eases ranging from 15% at 18 
months (Jayneet al, 2003) to 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al, 2010) on azathioprine –the most 
effective of current therapies ( Jayneet al, 2003; Pagnouxet al, 2008; Hiemstra et al, 2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV. Further supporting a role for B cells is the fact that activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popaet al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, are found in subjects with 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagaiet al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010). Together, these 
providea strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels. Therefore, 
for the proposed study, subjects are required to have documented evidence of anti-PR3 or 
anti-MPO autoantibodies prior to randomization, as this population is considered the most 
likely to benefit from treatment with a B cell modulating agent like belimumab. This is 
consistent with the Phase 3 SLE results for belimumab where the subjects who benefitted 
from treatment were those who were antinuclear antibody (ANA/anti -dsDNA) autoantibody 
positive at baseline.
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20, recentl y showed success in inducing remission in AAV (Stoneet al, 2010) and 
was granted approval in the US for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease. Finally , limited data from the small (n = 111) subset of subjects in the Phase 3 
trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their SLE (as assessed by the SELENA 
SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus standard of care treatment arms 
had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 compared with subjects receiving 
placebo plus standard of care. Specificall y, 19/36 (52.8%) and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in 
the belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dosegroups, respectivel y, had resolution of vasculitic 
activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of placebo subjects. Taken together, these 
data support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
The safety of the proposed study is supported by data from the Phase 2 and 3 trials in SLE in 
which subjects who were receiving belimumab in combination with significant background 
therapies, including steroids and immunosuppressants, had an adverse event profile similar to 
that of subjects receiving placebo plus stand ard therapies.

This is a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in 
subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG)or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
following a standard induction regimen. Subjects enrolled into the study must have a clinical 
diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the Chapel Hill criteria and must have had an initial or 
relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WG or MPA that was treated with 
corticosteroids and either CYC or RTX in the 6 months leading up to randomization. Subjects 
treated with 1 of the following induction regimens will be eligible for participation in the 
study:
•A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
interval, plus HDCS OR
•CYC 2 mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
•CYC 3 IVpulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, leukopenia,or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, therecommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Approximately  100 subjects with ANCA-vasculitis who are between 6 and 26 weeks from 
starting induction therapy, who achieve a BVAS v.3 score of 0 (ie, are in remission), and are 
receiving ≤10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14 
days apart will be enrolled into the study. Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) 
administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour. Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be 
administered at Day 0, 14, and every 28 days thereafter. Randomization will be performed on 
Day 0. 
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be trea ted with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . For the maintenance of remission, azathioprine may be 
initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration of induction therapy. 
Azathioprine must not be initiated any later than Day 0. For subjects previously  identified as Amend 03

being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced 
activity of thiopurine methy ltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate to be 
used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the outset. 
Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, 
characterized bysevere nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be 
permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to 
experience the toxicities described above, a switch to methotrexate at a target dose of 25 
mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. As 
azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that 
many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walterset al, 2010). 
Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  
analysis.
The randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), 
diseasestage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (IV 
CYC vs. oral CYC vs. RTX). It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patients would be 
newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be 
capped if they exceed this proportion. Refer to Section 4 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for a 
complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The primary efficacy endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse, defined as at least 
1major BVA S item or a minimum total BVAS score of 6 or receipt of prohibited medications 
according to the protocol. Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA 
until the results from the primary efficacy analysis are available or until they experience a 
flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy endpoint. The database will be locked and 
the primary analysis will be performed when 12 months have elapsed after the last subject is 
randomized. Subjects who discontinue study  agent prior to relap se/flare are to be followed per 
the double blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment 
phase (whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year 
an attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of study 
agent.
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately  4 weeks after their last dose of study 
agent as well as a follow -up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of study  agent. 
Dose and Schedule
Investigational Study Agent (Belimumab or Placebo)
The dose and schedule of belimumab proposed for use in the ANCA-associated vasculitis 
study is the same dosage (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 4 weeks thereafter) 
and route of administration (IV) as that approved for marketing. The belimumab BDS and 
FDP that will be used for this study  is the same as that approved for marketing.Amend 04

In the Phase 3 IV SLE studies, several clinical measures of improvement including the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Week 52 (SRI), SELENA SLEDAI reductions, severe flare risk 
reduction, and complement normalization generally favored the 10 mg/kg dose. Trends 
toward clinically significant steroid reduction were present for both doses. Additionally , there
appeared to be a greater dose response in subjects with high disease and serological activity. 
There was no apparent dose-response in the safety profile of belimumab with both doses 
being generally well-tolerated. These data supported the selection of 10 mg/kg belimumab as 
the marketed dose in general SLE, and also support its continued evaluation in combination 
with standard maintenance therapies in patients with WG or MPA.
The use of placebo in this trial is considered appropriate and does not put placebo patients at 
undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo group and the belimumab group will 
receive standard of care maintenance therapies for vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) 
and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate rescue therapy in accordance with standard 
clinical practice as described above.
Induction and Maintenance Regimens for ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
•A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
interval, plus HDCS OR
•CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
•CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 w eeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, leukopenia,or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriat e to reach

Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gormanet al, 2003, 
Smithet al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 ( Stoneet al, 2010), demonstrated non-
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphami de, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX dosing regimen of 4 infusions of 375 mg/m2each 
given 1 week apart reflects the dosing regimen that is approved b y the FDA for this indication.
An alternative RTX induction regimen (2 infusions of 1 gram each administered 2 weeks 
apart) is also offered in the protocol. Although the latter regimen is not licensed as an 
induction therapy for ANCA-vasculitis, it is very widely used in clinical practice and clinical 
evidence suggests that there is no difference between the two dosing regimens in terms of 
duration of B -cell depletion or therapeutic efficacy efficacy  (Joneset al,2009).
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauciand Wolff, 1973; Fauciet al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayneet al, 2003) showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14 days
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving ≤10 mg/day of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
between 6 and26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, subject 
randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, subjects will be 
randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + placebo or AZA (2 
mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol will be stratified by 
induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. For the maintenance of remission, 
azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration of Amend 03

induction therapy and no later than Day 0. For subjects previously identified as being 
intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced activity 
of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate to be used as 
an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the outset. Subjects naive 
to azathioprine and who experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or 
thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestinal hypersensitivity 
reaction characterized by severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine 
will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day. If the subject continues to 
experience toxicities, a switch to methotrexate at doses of upto 25 mg/week as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated 
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walterset al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is 
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs 
physicians to follow the appropriate local prescribing information for azathioprine or 
methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society ( EUVAS)and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC),and consensus was reached that these 
regimens are appropriate for this international trial. 
Complete details regarding the use of concurrent medications can be found in Section 5.5 of 
Protocol HGS1006- C1100.
Safety Considerat ions
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analyzed (after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee). The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Belimumab has not y et been studied following use of 
IV cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX); there is limited experience with the 
combination of belimumab and oral CYC. As an added safety precaution, initial 
randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction 
and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC reviews will occur after the first 20 subjects per 
induction regimen (RTX or I V/oral CYC) have been randomize d and have had a Week 8 visit. 
Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, 
safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding 
whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be applied for the first 
20subjects randomized following induction with CYC. The DMC will review the data 
approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction regimens. At all times the 
patients, study sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation. Investigators and 
IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting.
The DMC will be notified of:

regarding the DMC).
Based on the large body of safety data from SLE patients treated with belimumab and/or the 
mechanism of action of belimumab as a B cell immunosuppressant, anticip ated potential risks 
of belimumab treatment in vasculitis patents include serious infusion and hypersensitivity  
reactions, infections, depression-related events, and malignancy . These risks are briefly 
reviewed here and are detailed more fully in the belimumab Investigator’s Brochure. Both 
investigators and subjects will be appropriately  informed regarding these risks. It is noted that 
because of the older patient population affected by this disease, the average age of subjects 
anticipated to participate in this study will be older than the average age of the SLE 
population studied to date (mean age of ~53 years at the time of diagnosis in vasculitis ( Stone
et al, 2010) compared with an average age of ~38 years in controlled Phase 3 studies of 
belimumab in SLE). As such, patients with vasculitis may be at a greater risk for infection 
than the SLE patients; however, the increased monitoring forinfections by both the DMC 
(described above) and recommended to investigators (see below) will help to ensure subject 
safety through timely detection, treatment and reporting of infections.
The protocol states that all subjects should be monitored closelyfor infection and increased 
vigilance for infection is recommended in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL, 
especially for prolonged periods; clinical judgment should be applied with respect to the 
appropriateness of continuing study therapy in these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be 
consulted before administering subsequent doses of study agent in subjects with IgG levels 
<250 mg/dL. Study agent will be discontinued in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that 
are associated with a severe or serious infection. If a subject experiences a clinically 
significant, potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) AE that the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly  or probably  related to belimumab/placebo, then treatment with study  agent 
will be discontinued. The subject will be followed at regularly scheduled study visits as 
specified by the protocol through the end of the double-blind period and also until resolution 
of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).
In order to ensure subject safety with respect to infusion and hypersensitivity  reactions, the 
protocol excludes patients with known history of allergic reactions to human or murine 
proteins or monoclonal antibodies. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine 
whether premedication diminishes the frequency  or severity of hypersensitivity  reactions to 
belimumab. The protocol recommends that based on clinical judgment, premedication 
including an antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the 
infusion. Antihistam ine H2-receptor antagonists (eg, ranitidine) are also permitted.

Belimumab/placebo will be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to manage 
infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the 
subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigators/site personnel should be aware of the risk 
of hypersensitivity  reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor subjects 
closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placebo administration must be 
discontinued immediately  and the appropriate medical therapy administered. Per protocol, 
subjects are to remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 
2infusions in the double-blind treatment phase. Should symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  
occur, an extended period of monitoring may  be appropriate, based on clinical judgment. This 
may include, but is not limited to, monitoring vital signs and observing for any untoward 
reactions. Beyond the first 2 infusions, subjects should be monitored during and for an 
appropriate period of time after infusion according to study sites’ guidelines or standard 
operating procedure for IV infusions. Subjects should be made aware of the potential risk, the 
signs and symptoms of such reactions, and the importance of immediately  seeking medical 
attention.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in patients with SL E receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacother apy, including belimumab. Therefore, a diagnosis of PML  should be considered 
in any subject presenting with new -onset or deteriorating neurological signs and sy mptoms. 
The protocol requires that subjects should be referred to a neurologist or other appropr iate 
specialist for evaluation. If PML  is confirmed, study  agent should be discontinued and 
consideration should be given to stopping immunosuppressant therapy . If PML is suspected, 
this should be immediately  reported to the Medical Monitor . The appropria teness of 
continuing study  agent, while the case is being assessed, should be discussed.
The protocol recommends that subjects with persistent or worsening disease should receive 
appropriate rescue therapy  in accordance with standard clinical practice, but if exceeding what 
is allowed per protocol, treatment with study agent (ie, belimumab or placebo) will be 
discontinued and the subject will be considered as having relapsed for the primary analysis. 
The list of prohibited medications that results in the subjects being considered as relapsed for 
the primary endpoint (Protocol Section 5.5.2.1), was developed because the need for the use 
of these agents (eg, RTX or CYC) is indicative of treatment failure (ie, disease relapse).
Moreover, concomitant use of suchmedications (eg, high-dose steroids) can be associated 
both with potent disease -modifying activity  and/or significant toxicity  that may  introduce bias 
and confound interpretation of results. As such, no subject will be denied appropriate medical 
care for their condition due to their participation in this clinical study .
In addition, the Sponsor notes that although this is a placebo controlled trial, the sponsor does 
not consider that placebo patients are at undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo 
group and the belimumab group will receive standard of care maintenance therapies for 
vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate 
rescue therap y in accordance with standard clinical practice as describ ed above.Amend 03

Risk:Benefit Conclusions
In summary, the proposed Phase 3 study is a superiority  study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of belimumab for the maintenance of disease remission in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis or m icroscopic poly angiitis. The risk:benefit profile of 
10 mg/kg IV belimumab in patients with active, autoantibody -positive SLE was demonstrated 
to be positive in the two Phase 3 SLE studies, thereby supporting its approval in Canada, the 
US, and the EU. Belimumab has already been shown to be effective in treating patients with 
active, autoantibody -positive SL E, a B cell mediated autoimmune disease. Like SL E, WG and 
MPA are also B cell mediated autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies (in this case, 
against neutrophil components), are considered to be pathogenic ( Popaet al, 1999). In each of 
these diseases, the general purpose of the therapy is similar –reducing disease activity by 
down regulating B cells (including autoreactive B cells) and reducing the level autoantibodies 
produced by those autoreactive B cell clones. Down regulating B cell numbers may also 
reduce inflammatory  processes because of the role of B cells in antigen presentation. A 
limited amount of data from the IV Phase 3 studies suggests that belimumab may reduce 
vasculitic sy mptoms.
There are potential risks associated with belimumab treatment including serious infusion and 
hypersensitivity  reactions, infections, depression- related events, and malignanc y; however, in 
view of the serious and potentially  life threatening nature of disease flares in WG and MPA, it 
is believed that the overall risk:benefit analysis for belimumab in the maintenance of 
remission in WG and MPA is favorable, especially  in view of the nature of the trial as a 
superiority  trial over a current standard of care regimen.

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Protocol Amendment 04, 26 February 2015
Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The proposed modifications to the protocol reflect a change by  the sponsor to the strategic 
objectives for the evaluation of belimumab in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). It is 
proposed that the trial should be changed from a Phase 3 study to allow for an exploratory  
evaluation of belimumab in AAV only. There is no longer the intention to seek a licensed 
indication for belimumab asan adjunctive maintenance therapy in AAV on the basis of 
the data emerging from this study. The term “Phase 3”has been removed from the study 
title.
Enrolment of subjects onto the current trial has progressed at a much slower than expected 
rate. Based oncurrent enrolment projections, data outputs from the current trial would 
unlikely be available for review until mid -2018.
Having reviewed the timing of the study in the context of the evolving therapy area for 
ANCA-associated vasculitis, the sponsor feelsthat the current format and design of the 
BREVAS trial, if driven to completion as a Phase 3 investigation, would no longer 
provide significant and timely new information for the vasculitis community . On the basis 
of the BREVAS trial data alone, even in the event of a successful outcome, it is not felt 
that belimumab can be sufficientl y well differentiated as a concomitant therapy for 
remission maintenance in AAV to fulfill a significant unmet need for patients where other 
therapeutic options are now available (e.g., rituximab). 
As such, GSK is proposing to modify  the strategic objective of the trial such that it will be 
conducted as an exploratory  study, in which global enrolment would be restricted to 
approximately  100 patients (compared to the original target of approximately 300). It is 
planned that the data will be published in descriptive format with exploratory  analyses on 
efficacy endpoints undertaken as appropriate. It is expected that the safety data emerging 
from the smaller cohort of patients inBREVAS will contribute to our understanding of 
belimumab safet y. 
2.The study design and schedule has been modified throughout the protocol to clarify that 
the study will no longer be driven by the requirement to achieve at least 66 relapse events. 
The study will complete and the primary  analysis will be undertaken once 12 months have 
elapsed following enrolment of the last subject.
3.The protocol has been modified throughout such that subjects completing the study  will no 
longer have the option to participate in a 6-month open-label extension following 
completion of the double -blind treatment phase. The section entitled “open label extension 
phase”(6.4) and the related time and events table (Table 6- 3) has been removed.
4.The study design schematics have been modified in the protocol by removal of the 
expected number of enrolled subjects; ‘N=300-400’ has been removed from the 
schematic.

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
5.In the statistical sections of the protocol, the sample size considerations have been 
modified to reflect the fact that approximately 100 patients will be recruited. The sample 
size is based largely on the feasibility  of recruitment within a reasonable time-frame. 
Sample size calculations based on expected relapse rates have been removed from the 
protocol. The minimum detectable effect for a sample size of N=100 subjects has been 
determined. 
For the purposes of reporting the data, analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will 
be exploratory  in nature. Nominal ‘p’ values may be reported and considered descriptive. 
Where appropri ate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed.
The section on “Subgroup analyses”(7.5.2.1) has been removed as this is no longer 
considered relevant in the context of the smaller expected total sample size of 
approximately  100 subje cts.
In the section “Primary Efficacy Analysis” (8.5.2), we have clarified how stratification 
terms may be handled in the analysis if there are fewer than 5events(relapses) in any of 
the stratification levels.
6.In the section “Dose, route of administration and schedule”, we have clarified that the 
administration of belimumab/placebo should be over approximately  one hour, but not less 
than one hour for reasons of safet y.
7.The section on liver chemistry  stopping and follow-up criteria, which describes how 
patient care should be managed if a liver event occurs during the study, has been updated 
with the most recent GSK-specified protocol for managing these events. The section also 
defines the circumstances and criteria that may allow a study treatment restart following a 
liver event. The section also includes the criteria for more intensive monitoring with 
continued therapy following a liver event. Accompany ing figures have been placed in 
Appendix 13.
8.The adverse event reporting section (Section 7) has been modified throughout for 
consistency  with AE, SAE or PSE data collection procedures and forms.
9.The text on progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML) has been updated to 
provide further guidance on the management of suspected cases.
10.The section “Reportinga pregnancy ”has been modified to provide scope for following up 
the outcomes of a pregnancy  (including premature termination) as well as the status of 
mother and child.
11.The section “Randomiz ation procedure and assignment to treatment requirements” has 
been modified to remove the requirement for subjects to be randomised within 2 weeks of 
achieving remission. This corrects an error in the protocol and ensures consistency  with 
wording across other sections of the protocol. 
12. The reference list has been updated in the protocol.
13.Appendix 12 (Benefit-Risk assessment) has been updated to reflect the change in study 
status to an exploratory trial and to reflect the changes in the main protocol as outlined 
above.

The relapse rate in the study is anticipated to be approximately  20% in the control group. 
However, there is some uncertainty  around thisrelapse event rate which could be 30% or

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
higher. This study is designed to target at least 66 subjects experiencing a relapse (as defined 
in the primary endpoint), which will provide 85% power to detect a reduction in relapse rates 
of 20 vs. 10% (hazard ratio = 0.472). With this same hazard ratio and a 30% event rate, a 
study with 66 subjects experiencing a relapse will provide 85% power to detect a reduction in 
the relapse rate from 30% to 15.5%. A target of 300 to 400 subjects will be randomized to 
achieve the required number of events.
After approximately  300subjects have been randomized, the relapse rate in the overall 
population will be evaluated in a blinded manner internally  by HGS while the enrollment 
continues. If the relapse rate is consistent with the 20% control rate assumption, enrollment 
will continue to 400 subjects to ensure timely accrual of the 66 events. However, if there is 
evidence that the relapse rate is higher than 20% control rate assumption, enrollment may be 
stopped at approximate ly 300 subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed after 
at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse and at least 12 months have elapsed after the 
last subject is randomized.
Added:
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined 
based on the feasibility of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-
frame.The sample size was not based on statistical considerations and the analysis of 
primary and secondary endpoints will be exploratory innature. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomization of the 
last subject.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebo 
group, a relapse rate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically 
significant (p<0.05) in a study of 100 subjects (50 per arm). 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint, Synopsis
Change from:
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are tobe followed per the double 
blind visit schedule for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end 
of the double-blind treatment phase (whichever is earlier). The primary efficacy analysis will 
be performed after at least 66 sub jects have experienced a relapse and at least 12 months have 
elapsed after the last subject is randomized .

For the analysis of the primary and the major secondary  efficacy endpoint, a step-down 
sequential testing procedure will be used to control the overall type 1 error (Section 8.1).
Section 3.1, Basic Desi gn Characteristics
Deleted:
If the result on the primary efficacy endpoint from the double blind portion of this trial shows 
that belimumab is superior to placebo, and the safety profile of belimumab is acceptable, 
subjects who receive treatment with study agent until the completion of the double-blind 
period of the study and have not relapsed (as defined by the primary endpoint) will be given 
the option to receive treatment with belimumab in the open-label extension phase. Subjects 
who enter the open-label extension phase will receive belimumab for up to an additional 
6months and this will be supplied by the sponsor. After the 6-month open-label extension 
phase, subjects who wish to continue treatment may do so by being prescribed commerciall y 
available belimumab. If belimumab is not commerciall y available in a subject’s country of 
participation, the subject may continue to receive belimumab under a separate continuation 
protocol. A separate informed consent will need to be provided for the continuation protocol. 
The 8 week follow -up visit is not required for subjects entering the continuation protocol. 
Section 5.3 Dose, Route of Administration, and Schedule
Change from:
The treatment groups include one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimumab and a placebo 
arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section 5.5.3). 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. Once randomized, 
subjects will be dosed with study agent on Days 0, 14, and 28 and every 28days thereafter. 
Following the final double-blind visit, eligible subjects (see Section 6.4) will have the option 
to continue in the 6 -month open -label extension period.
Change to:
The treatment groups include one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimumab an d a placebo 
arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section 5.5.3 ). 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. The intent of this 
instruction is toprevent more rapid infusion of belimumab which may res ult in a higher 
incidence of infusion reactions. Infusion time need notbe exactly one hour as it is often 
difficult to so precisely adjust infusion times and there may be clinical reasons for 
infusions lasting longer than one hour. Therefore, the instruction should be interpreted 
as infusion overat leastone hour. The target infusion time should still be approximately

by the primary endpoint) will be given the option to receive treatment with belimumab in the 
6-month open -label extension phase.
Subjects who do not enter the open-label extension ,will return for an Exit visit 
(approximately  4  weeks after the last dose of study agent), and a follow-up visit 
(approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of study  agent).

6.4Open-Label Extension Phase
In the 6-month open-label extension, all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab every 
28days until Week 24, with a final evaluation at Week 28 (4 weeks after the last dose). The 
firstdose on the open-label extension will be given 4 weeks after completion of the 
double-blind period. Day 0 is the first visit in the extension phase of the trial and represents 
the first belimumab administration for placebo subjects. Subjects should remain under clinica l 
supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 infusions.  Should symptoms of acute 
hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment.
All subjects participating in the open-label extension will continue to be monitored for 
efficacy and safet y as per the study  calendar (see Table 6 -3). 
During the 6-month open-label extension, the investigator may adjust concurrent medications 
(add, eliminate, change dose level/frequency ) as clinically  appropriate. Prohibited medications 
during this phase are live vaccines, biological therapies and other investigational agents. 
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately  4weeks after their last dose of study 
agent as well as a follow-up visit approximately 8 weeks after the last dose of study agent. 
These visits apply  to subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early  
from the open -label extension.

6.5.2 Liver Chemistry Stopping a nd Follow -up Criteria
Liver chemistry  stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure 
subject safety and evaluate liver event etiology in alignment with the FDA premarketing 
clinical liver safety  guidance [James, 2009; Le Gal, 2005 ].
Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria- Liver Stopping Event
ALT-absolute ALT 8xULN
ALT Increase ALT 5xULN but <8xULN  persists for 2 weeks
ALT 3xULN but <5xULN  persists for 4 weeks
Bilirubin1, 2ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bil irubin) 
INR2ALT 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured
Cannot Monitor ALT 5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 2 weeks
ALT 3xULN but <5xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks
Symptomatic3ALT 3xULN associated with symptom s (new or worsening) believed to be related to liver 
injury or hypersensitivity
1) Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immedia tely 
available, discontinue study treatment for th at subject if ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN. Additionally, if serum 
bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2) All events of ALT  3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR measured 
which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of 
hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.
3) New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tende rness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).
6.5.2.1 Required Actions and Follow up Assessments following ANY Liver Stopping 
Event
ACTIONS:
Immediately  discontinue study  treatment
Report the eve nt to GSK within 24 hours

2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or AL T 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measure d 
which may  indicate severe liver injury  (possible ‘Hy ’s Law’), must be reported as an 
SAE (excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis); INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to subjects receiving 
anticoagu lants)
Perform liver event follow up assessments

6.5.4 Study Treatment Restart
Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a 
clear underlying cause (other than drug induced liver injury [DILI]) of the liver event (e.g. 
biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there 
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 15
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity , and the study treatment 
should not be associated with HL A markers of liver injury .
Approval b y GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where:
Investigator requests consideration for study  treatment restart if liver chemistries have a 
clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver chemistries have 
improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T <3xUL N).
Restart risk fact ors (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic hepatitis, 
possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study treatment has an HLA genetic 
marker associated with liver injury  (e.g., lapatinib, abacavir, amoxicillin/clavulanate) are
reviewed and excluded.
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart must 
be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury or death.  
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the study  
treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  chart.  
Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.
Subjects approved b y GSK Medical Governance for restarting stud y treatment must 
return to the clinic once a w eek for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have 
been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol. 
If after study  treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  stopping 
criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment restart. 
GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 7.2

Section 7 Adverse Event Reporting
Added:
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
Section 7.1 Definit ions
Change from:
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE): Any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study  agent but is not necessarily  caused 
by the study agent. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency or severity) of 
preexisting conditions.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: An adverse event resulting in any of the following 
outcomes:
death
is life-threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life)
inpatient hospitalization *
prolongation of an existing hospitali zation
persistent or significant disability/incapacit y
congenital anomal y/birth defect
is medically  important+
*An inpatient hospitalization is defined as an admission for any length of time. A 
hospitalization for administration of study  agent, for routin e or planned clinical procedures, or 
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 17
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
for “social” reasons (not the result of any adverse change in the subject’s condition) should 
not be considered an adverse event and should not be reported as a serious adverse event. If 
the subject experiences any adverse change in condition during hospitalization, the condition 
must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event according to the above 
definitions. 
+Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
isappropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above(eg, 
possible drug-induced liver injury). These should also usually be considered serious. (ICH 
guidelines, March 1995)
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT: An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational productor package insert/summary  of product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means the event has previously been observed with the study 
agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does not 
mean that the event is expected with the underly ing disease(s) or concomitant medications.
Change to:
ADVERSE EVENT
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include :
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present pr ior to the start of the study
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent.  This should be reported regardless of sequelae.
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 18
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an A E or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e .g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)
Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease( s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s co ndition
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: A serious adverse event is any untoward medical 
occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life-threatening
c.NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
d.Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
e.NOTE:  In general, hospitalisation signifi es that the subject has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward 
for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or out- patient setting.  Complications th at occur during 
hospitalisation are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.
f.Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.
g. Results in disability/incapacity, or
h.NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. 
sprained ankle) which may interfere o r prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.
i.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 19
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
j.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important me dical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may 
jeopardise the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These shoul d also be 
considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or 
development o f drug dependency or drug abuse.
k.All events of possible drug- induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined 
as ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT 3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply to patients receiving 
anticoagulants).
l.NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick 
indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is 
unavailable and a subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xULN, then the 
event is still reported as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the SAE 
form. INR el evations >1.5 suggest severe liver injury.   
Section 7.2 Reporting Adverse Events to the Sponsor
Change from:
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must ALSO be recorded on the SAE Worksheet and sent to 
the HGS Drug Safety  designee within 24 hours of site person nel becoming aware of the SAE, 
regardless of expectedness. All pagesof the SAE Worksheet should be completed, but the 
SAE Worksheet should not be held until all information is available. Additional information 
and corrections should be provided on subsequent SAE Worksheets as described in the Study 
Procedures Manual. SAE Worksheets should be sent either via the EDC system, if SAE EDC 
functionality  is available or by facsimile to the HGS Drug Safety designee using the fax 
number listed on the SAE Worksheet .
In addition, prior to study drug administration, any SAE assessed as relatedto study 
participation (eg, protocol mandated procedures, invasive tests) will be recorded on the SAE 
worksheet and reported as described  abovefrom the time a subject consentsto participate in 
the study. Pre-treatment SAEs will not be documented on the AE eCRF.
SAEs that occur off study, after the follow-up period, that are assessed by the investigator as 
definitely , possibly or probably related to study agent must be reportedto the Drug Safety 
designee on the SAE worksheet. Post study  SAEs will not be documented on the AE eCRF.

within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the event. 
Section 7.4 Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse Events
Change from:
A laboratory  abnormality  should be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention includes, but is not limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay , or concomitant therapy. In addition, any medically important laboratory  
abnormality  may be reported as an adverse event at the discretion of the investigator. This 
includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is no intervention but the abnormal value(s) 
suggests a disease or organ toxicity.If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  
abnormality , the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, 
hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In

addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL (Grade 4) should be recorded as an adverse event 
(and SAE if meeting the criteria in Section 7.1).
Laboratory  tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7 .If a particular lab test is not listed in Appendix 7, the lab test should be graded as 
mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening as specified in Secti on 7.8.

Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be mo re severe than expected for 
the subject’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs .
If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  abnormalit y, the diagnosis or medical 
condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, 
elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL

start of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent should be 
reported. All pregnancies are tracked up to term or delivery following the last study agent
treatment. When pregnancy  is reported, HGS Drug Safety sends an acknowledgement 
memorandum to the principal investigator along with a Pregnancy  Assessment Form. A 
Pregnancy  Assessment Form must be completed every threemonths until live birth, elective 
termination of the pregnancy , or miscarriage. The site is responsible for following the 
subject’s pregnancy  to final outcome. 
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy  are considered AEs andmay be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 7.1 and 
Section7.2.
Change to:
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a clinical 
trial pregnancy form. To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence . All pregnancies that are identified 
from the start of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent 
should bereported. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome 
(including premature termination) and status of mother and child. Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE 
or SAE. Spontaneous abortion s must be reported as an SAE.
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator’s 
attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by the investigator as 
possibly related to the study treatment, must be prompt ly reported to the Sponsor.
Section 7.8 Investigator Evaluation of Adverse Events
Change from:
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness, severity 
(intensity  or grade), and causality (relationship to study agent). The criteria for serious are 
listed in Section 7.1. The severity of an AE is to be evaluated according to the Adverse Event 
Severity Grading Tables in Appendix 7. If an AE does not have Adverse Event Severity 
Grading in Appendix 7, the follo wing severit y classifications will be used :
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 23
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
SEVERITY:
Grade 1-Mild      -causing no limitation of usual activities.
Grade 2-Moderate      -causing some limitation of usual activities.
Grade 3-Severe     -causing inability  to carry out usual activities.
Grade 4-Life-threatening*   -potentially  life-threatening or disabling; significant medical 
intervention is required.
*Note –a severity assessment of Life-threatening is not necessaril y the same as the 
seriousness criterion of Life -threatening (see “ serious” criteria Section 7.1). The former means 
that the event is a potential threat. The latter means that the event is an immediate threat to 
life.
CAUSALITY:
It is a regulatory  requirement for investigators to assess relationship between the 
investigational product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE based on the information 
available. The assessment should be reviewed on receipt of any  new information and amended 
if necessary .A “reasonable possibility ” is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or 
arguments tosuggest a causal relationship. Facts/evidence or arguments that may support a 
“reasonable possibility ” include, e.g., a temporal relationship, a pharmacologicall y-predicted 
event, or positive dechallenge or rechallenge. Confounding factors, such as concom itant 
medication, a concurrent illness, or relevant medical history , should also be considered.
Change to:
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria for 
seriousness are listed in Section 7.1) , severity (intensity), and causalit y (relationship to study  
agent). The investigator will make an assessment of intensity based on the Division of 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID)Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables (see 
Appendix 7) where possible :
SEVERITY:
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities (Grade 1 
DMID).
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
everyday activities (Grade 2 DMID).
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities (Grade 3 or 4 
DMID).
Not applicable Those event(s) where intensity is meaningless or impossible to 
determine (i.e., blindness and coma).
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 24
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre-defined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
CAUSAL ITY:
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betweenstudy treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the 
determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her 
opinion of causality in light of follow-up information, amending the SAE data collection 
tool accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements .
Section 7.9 Follow -up of Adverse Events
Change from:
Adverse eventsthatoccur from the start of study medication through 8 weeks after the date of 
last administration of study  agent are followed until final outcome is known or until the end of 
the 8-week study follow-up period. Adverse events that have not resolved at the end of the 8-
week study follow-up visit are recorded on the adverse event case report form (AE eCRF) as 
ONGOING. 
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow-up period are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovered with sequelae is achieved. If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for anSAE (eg, the subject is lost to follow-up), the reason a final outcome 
could not be obtained willbe documented b y the investigator . 
Change to:
Serious and non-serious adverse eventsthat occur from the start of study medication 
administration through 8 weeks after the date of last administration of study agent are 
reported. 
2013N167980_0 2
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 25
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 04 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-serious AEs of special interest 
(see Section 8.6.2) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until thesubject is lost to follow-up. This applies to all 
subjects, including those withdrawn prematurely. 
PSEs (see Section 7.3) that occur after the Screening visit through 8 weeks after the date 
of last administration of study agent are reported and followed as described above for 
AEs/SAEs.
Section 8.1 General Statistical Considerations
Change from:
The database will be locked for the primary analysis after all data have been collected, 
verified and validated for all subjects through 12 months after the randomization of the 
lastsubject or when 66 events (relapse as defined for the primary efficacy endpoint) have 
been observed, whichever is later . All subjects and study  site personnel will remain blinded to 
original treatment assignment until after the final database is locked and the results of the 
study are made publicl y available. 
For the analysis of the primary and the major secondary  efficacy endpoint, a step-down 
sequential testing procedure will be used to control the overall type 1 error. With this 
procedure, the primary endpoint (time to the first relapse) will be evaluated first. If the 
primary efficacy endpoint demonstrates statistical significance (2-sided, alpha=0.05) then 
inference will proceed to the major secondary  efficacy endpoint, time to the first major relapse 
(2-sided, alpha = 0.05). If the result is statistically  significant, superiorit y of belimumab on the 
time to the first major relapse will be established. If statistical significance is not met, p values 
may be reported and considered descriptive.
Analyses of all other efficacy endpoints other than the primary and major secondary  efficacy 
endpoints will not be subject to any multiple testing procedure. All statistical tests will be 
2-sided and performed at an overall significance level of 0.05.
Change to:
The database will be locked for the primary analysis after alldata have been collected, 
verified and validated for all subjects through 12 months after the randomization of the 
last subject. All subjects and study site personnel will remain blinded to original treatment 
assignment until after the final database is locked and the results of the study are made 
publicly available. 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will be exploratory in nature. Nominal p 
values may be reported and considered descriptive. Where appropriate point estimates and 
95% confidence in tervals will be constructed.

Section 8.2 Randomization Procedure and Assignment to Treatment Groups
Change from:
This is a Phase 3,multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study. Once subjects have consented, have undergone all screening procedures and have been 
determined to be eligible for the study , they will be randoml y assigned (via an interactive web 
response system [IWRS]) to 1 of 2 treatment groups (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) in a 
1:1 ratio. At randomizatio n, subjects will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. 
anti-MPO), disease stage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction 
regimen (IV cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. RTX). Randomization will be 
performed on Day 0.  Day 0 (first administration of belimumab/placebo and azathioprine) 
must occur no more than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission.

Section 8.5.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis
Change from:
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the time to first relapse from Day 0 between the 
placebo/azathioprine group and the belimumab/azathioprin e combination group using a Cox 
proportional hazard model, adjusted for ANCA t ype (anti-PR3 vs. anti- MPO), disease stage at 
induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (rituximab vs. IV 
cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophospham ide). However, the adjustment of induction 
regimen will be changed to rituximab vs. IV and/or oral cyclophosphamide if the number of 
events (relapse) is less 5 in subjects using the oral or IV cyclophosphamide. For any subject 
who does not experience a relapse, the time to first relapse will be censored at the time of the 
subject’s last assessment. Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare 
(asdefined in primary efficacy endpoint) are to be followed per protocol for inclusion in the 
primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). The database will be locked and the primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse and at least12 months have 
elapsed after the last subject is randomized.

Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine forthe Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The protocol has been modified to provide flexibility  in timing of initiation of azathioprine 
maintenance therapy i.e.,option to initiate as soon as clinically indicated and prior to 
confirmation of remission.
2.The protocol has been modified to allow alternative unlicensed rituximab dose for 
induction (1g every 2 weeks) in addition to the licensed dosing regimen (375 mg/m2/wk 
for 4 doses).
3.The protocol has been modified to provide flexibility in timing of baseline BVAS 
assessments –allowing 2 baseline assessments separated by at least 14 days (instead of 
strict 21-35 days separation).
4.Theabsolute requirement to randomize within 14 days of confirmation of remission has 
been removed and clarification has been added that subjects cannot be randomized until at 
least 6 weeks after initiation of induction therap y.
5.A study schematic diagram has been added to clarify  the trial design.
6.Clarification has been added regarding ‘high dose corticosteroids’ for induction and text 
providesguidance but allows locally accepted practice. No subject should receive <10mg 
for induction.
7.The protocol has been modified to allow some flexibility  to cyclophosphamide dosing 
regimens (allows adjustment for age, obesity, renal insufficiency , leukopenia, other 
toxicities) for induction.
8.The protocol has been modified to allow the o ption to use methotrexate from the outset, as 
an alternative to azathioprine , if patient is a priori known to be azathioprine intolerant or 
has low/absent thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)activity. Exclusion of subject with 
intolerance or contraindications to methotrexate (where this is being considered as an 
alternative to azathiop rine). 
9.The protocol has been modified to allow equal to/less than 10mg prednisonedaily during 
maintenance (rather than strictly <10mg prednisone daily); articulated option to taper as 
clinically appropriate.
10.Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y text has been updated based on new 
information. This addition is to ensure full awareness of PML risk in the trial population 
and to provide clarification on clinical assessment and actions.
11.In Appendices 1 and 2, “criteria” in the title and text hasbeen changed to “definition” . 
The List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
12.Appendix 5 has been updated to include a sample of the VDI case report form.
13.The Benefit and Risk Assessment section has been updated to reflect new and/or amended 
information in the protocol body .

Characteristics
Formerly:
Subjects enrolled into the trial must have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to 
severely active WG or MPA that was treated with corticosteroids and either 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (ie, induction therapy) in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated under the following induction regimens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:

A single course rituximab (RTX) administered at  a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks 
plus high dose corticosteroids (HDCS ) OR
Cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
Cyclophosphamide 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeksapart followed by  pulses of 
15mg/kg every  3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses ofcyclophosphamide are givenas targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency or white cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day.
Subjects who are within26 weeks of starting induction therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 score 
of0 (Appendix 4 ), and are receiving < 10 mg/dayprednisone (orequivalent) on 2 consecutive 
measurements 21 to 35days apart may be enrolled into the study. Randomization will be 
performed on Day 0. Day 0 (first administration of belimumab/placebo) must occur no more 
than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission. Azathioprine must be initiated at any time 
following confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0.All subjects willbe treated 
with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 2mg/kg/day . Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study agent (belimumab [10mg/kg] orplacebo) 
administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour. The randomization will be stratified according to 
ANCA ty pe (anti-PR3 vs. anti -MPO), disease stageat induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing 
disease) and induction regimen (IV cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. 
rituximab). Belimumab or placebo will be supplied by the sponsor during this double-blind 
treatment phase.It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patients would be newly 
diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be capped if 
they exceed this proportion. Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 
14, 28, and every  28days thereafter.

practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/da y not to exceed 80mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach ≤ 10 
mg/day. As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous 
steroid pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be 
receiving more than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Subjects who are between 6 and26 weeks of starting induction therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 
score of0 (Appendix 4), and are receiving ≤ 10 mg/dayprednisone (orequivalent) on 2 
consecutive measurements at least 14days apart may be enrolled into the study. A minimum 
6week period should elapse between initiation of induction therapy and randomization.
Randomization will be performed on Day 0. A schematic of the study design is shown 
below/in Figure 1.
All randomized subjects shouldbe treated with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 
2mg/kg/day . Azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following 
administration of induction therapy. Azathioprine should not be initiated any later than 
Day 0.Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study

Section 5.5.3.1 Azathioprine and Methotrexate
Formerly:
The target dose of azathioprine is 2 mg/kg/day  (not to exceed 200 mg/day ). Azathioprin e must 
be initiated at an y time following confirmation of remission up to and incl uding Day  0at a 
dose of 50 mg/day  and increased by  no more than 50 mg/day every week until the target dose 
is achieved.
Subjectsnaïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT >2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, 
characterized by severe nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be 
permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day . If the subjectcontinues to 
experience the toxicities described above a switch to methotrexate at a target dose of  
25mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. 
These subjects will be included in the primary  analysis. 
It is recommended that the appropriate local prescribing information ( eg,contraindications, 
hematological and biochemical monitoring, pregnancy , contraception, etc.)for azathioprine or 
methotrexate (MTX) (as applicable), should be followed prior to and during treatment.
In the extension phase of the trial, the dose of AZA/MTX can be decreased or discontinued 
based on the discretion of the investigator.

* Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
These should also usually be considered serious. (ICH guidelines, March 1995)

Section7.5 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
Formerly:
There have been no reported cases of PML in subjects with SLE or RA treated with 
belimumab. However, patients with autoimmune diseases may be at increased risk for PML 
secondary  to the diseases themselves, as well as the concurrent use of immunosuppressive 
drugs. The most common signs and symptoms of PML include visual disturbances, ocular 
movements, ataxia, and mental status changes such as disorientation or confusion. Clinical 
signs and sy mptoms of PML  and vasculitis can be similar. The investigator must exercise best 
judgment in further workup and clinical intervention as appropriate. If PML is suspected, this 
should be promptly  reported to the sponsor.
Modified to:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in SLE patients receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherapy, including belimumab. A diagnosis of PML should be considered in 
any subject presenting with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and 
symptoms. The subject should be referred to a neurologist or other appropriate 
specialist for evaluation. If PML is confirmed, study agent should be discontinued and 
consideration should be given to stopping immunosuppressant therapy. 
If PML is suspected, this should be immediately reported to th e Medical Monitor.  The 
appropriateness of continuing study agent, while the case is being assessed, should be 
discussed.

Added:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in patients with SLE receiving 
immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy, including belimumab. Although the benefit-risk 
profile for belimumab remains unchanged following these events, the Sponsor considers 
that knowledge of these cases is important and has updated the clinical investigator’s

Formerly:
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of 
remission in subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic

All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be treated with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . Azathioprine must be initiated at any time following 
confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0.Patients with known intolerance to 
azathioprine will be excluded from the trial. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop

methotrexate at a target dose of 25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated 
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  analysis.

1mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience the toxicities described above, a switch to 
methotrexate at a target dose of 25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated 
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010).Subjects for whom methotrexate is 
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  analysis.

Formerly:
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral)

to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under thefollowing induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg /kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses ofcyclophosphamide are givenas targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency  or white cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10mg/day.
Rituximab was approved in April 2011by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith et al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX regimen specified in this vasculitis study is the 
sameas that approved b y the FDA for this indication.
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally orIV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauci and Wolff, 1973; Fauci et al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011).Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayne et al, 2003) showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration ofcyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.

Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements 3 to 5weeks 
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving < 10mg/day of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
no more than26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, subject 
randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, subjects will be 
randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + placebo or AZA (2 
mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol must occur within 2 
weeks of achieving a confirmed remission and the randomization will be stratified by 
induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who w ere taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. In this study, subjects who have a known 
intolerance to azathioprine will be excluded. Subjects naive to azathioprine and who 
experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST 
or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by 
severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce 
the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience toxicities, a switch 
to methotrexate at doses of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be 
permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it is not 
anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters 
et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included
in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs physicians to follow the appropriate local 
prescribing information for azathioprine or methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during 
treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society ( EUVAS)and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC), and consensus was reached that these 
regimens are appropriate for this international trial . 
Complete details regarding the use of concurrent medications can be found in Section 5.5 of 
Protocol HGS1006- C1100.

Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA

regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high

CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks ap art followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity,renal insufficiency, leukopenia, or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach ≤ 10
mg/day. As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous 
steroid pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be 
receiving more than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith etal, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX dosing regimen of 4 infusions of 375 mg/m2
each given 1 week apart reflects the dosing regimen thatisapproved by the FDA for this 
indication. An alternative RTX induction regimen (2 infusions of 1 gram each 
administered 2 weeks apart) is also offered in the protocol. Although the latter regimen 
is not licensed as an induction therapy for ANCA-vasculitis, it is very widely used in 
clinical practice and clinical evidence suggests that there is no difference between the 
two dosing regimens in terms of duration of B-cell depletion or therapeu tic efficacy 
efficacy (Jones et al, 2009).
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 3 
weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and MPA 
since the earl y 1970s when initial wo rk by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of Health

with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14 days
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving ≤ 10mg/day of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
between 6 and26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, subject

randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + placebo or AZA (2 
mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol will be stratified by 
induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. For the maintenance of remission, 
azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration 
of induction therapy and no later than Day 0. For subjects previously identified as being 
intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced 
activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate 
to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the 
outset.Subjects naive to azathioprine and who experience azathioprine -related toxicity 
(Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several 
gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by severe nausea and vomiting), 
following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1

immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy, including belimumab. Therefore, a diagnosis of 
PML should be considered in any subject presenting with new-onset or deteriorating 
neurological signs and symptoms. The protocol requires that subjects should be referred 
toa neurologist or other appropriate specialist for evaluation. If PML is confirmed, 
study agent should be discontinued and consideration should be given to stopping 
immunosuppressant therapy. If PML is suspected, this should be immediately reported 
to the Medical Monitor.  The appropriateness of continuing study agent, while the case is 
being assessed, should be discussed.

Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The protocol has been modified to include testing at Screening for HIV antibody,to 
expand Hepatitis B serology  testing, and to exclude patients who test positive according to 
the criteria specified. 
2. Because theRIBA antibody confirmation assay for hepatitis C is not available due to
non-availability  of manufacturer’s reagents, analternative test, HCV RNA-PCR assay , 
will be used todetect the presence of viral RNA, and hence confirm a current infection.
3.The protocol has been modified to exclude patients at baseline with abnormal liver 
function according to the criteria specified.
4.A new section has been added to clarify how patientcareshould be managed if a patient 
has a liver chemistry  event during the study. The accompan ying figure has been placed in 
an appendix (Appendix 13) and the List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
5.Measurement of vital signs (temperature, sitting blood pressure[systolic and diastolic], 
and heart rate) have been added to the procedures for all scheduled study visits and a 
12-lead ECG has been added to the procedures for the Day 0 visit. These procedures have 
been added to provide increased understanding and to assist analyses of potential safety 
events should they  occur.
6.A page with the protocol’s revision chronology  has been added.
7.The Synopsis has been corrected to include study  agent dosing on day  28.
8.Text has been added to clarify that study agents (belimumab or placebo) will be provided 
by the sponsor during the double-blind treatment phaseand that belimumab will be 
provided b y the sponsor during the open -label extension phase .
9.Within the definition of postmenopausal in Inclusion Criterion #7, “1year without 
menses” has been changed to “12 consecutive months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause.” Also, the sub-bullet formatting ofthe last 8 rows of Inclusion 
Criterion #7 has been corrected.
10.Steroid use for vasculitis has been modified to restrict the use of corticosteroid
s up to a 
maximum of 20 mg/dayof prednisone (or equivalent) for a maximum of 1 week within 
the first 2 months of the double- blind treatment period , and at other times, to < 10 mg/day .
11.The Reference List has beenupdated to include references cited in text but not present in 
thelistand to delete a reference included in error .Also, the in text citation for Posner et al 
has been corrected to Posner et al 2007 and the reference has been added to the list.
12.Cross-references have been added inSection 1 for references that were in the Reference 
List but which inadvertenly  had not been cited in text.
2013N167980_00

13.In Appendix 8,for the question at baseline/screening “Is the time the subject felt most 
suicidal (i.e. the lifetime rating) more than X month(s) ago?”, the “X” has been corrected 
to “2”, i.e, “more than 2 month(s) ago”.
14.The investigator evaluation of adverse eventsregarding causality has been modified from 
a multi-choice assessment (definitely related, probably related, etc.) to an assessment of 
“reasonable possibility ”.  
15. Appendix9 has been corrected to cite the reference and the publication has been added to 
the Reference List.
16.Two new appendices have been added to provide the questionnaires for the PSRHQ 
(Appendix 10) and the PSRQ (Appendix 11) and cross-references added in-text as 
appropriate. The List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
17.The protocol has been modified to include a Benefit and Risk Assessment (Appendix 12). 
The List of Appendices has been update d accordingl y.
18. Minor administrative changewas made for presentation of cross-referencing sections and 
tables, e.g., “see Sections X.1and X.2” waschanged to “see SectionX.1and 
Section X.2”. These minorchanges are not shownin the Modifications section below. 
19.The list of abbreviations has been updated to add abbreviations as a result of new and/or 
amended text and to correct previous errors.
20. The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) definitions for Wegener’s granulomatosis 
and microscopic polyangiitis in Appendices 1 and 2 of the protocol have been updated to 
reflect the most recent CHCC (2012) definitions. The reference for this (Jeannette et al 
2013) is cited in the text ( Section 1.1) and in the reference list.

Section 1.1 Disease Background
Formerly:
Anti-PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity  and mortality compared to anti-
MPO.The most widely used classification criteria for diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are 
those published by the American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt 
et al, 1990 and Masi et al, 1990, respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill 
Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA (Jennette et al, 1994 ).
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same class ification criteria as later ones ( Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Watts et al, 2007 ).
In the US, the prevalence rates of WG range from 2.6- 9/100000 ( Mahr et al, 2006).

Section 1.4 Rationale for the Study
Formerly:
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20,recently showed success in inducing remission in AAV (Stone et al, 2010) and 
was granted approval for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease.

Section 6.6 Laboratory Tests
The following section has been added:
Section 6.6.2 Phase III -IV Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follow- up Criteria
The liver chemistry  stopping and follow-up criteria have been designed to assure subject 
safety and evaluate liver event etiology .
Phase III-IV liver chemistry  stopping criteria 1- 5 are defined below:
1.ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xUL N (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT ≥ 3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured). 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediatel y available, withdraw study  drug 
from that subject if ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of 
detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury .
2.ALT ≥ 8xULN.
3.ALT ≥ 5xULN but <8 xULN persists for ≥2 weeks.
4.ALT ≥ 3xULN if associated with sy mptoms (new or worsening) believed to be related to 
hepatitis (such as fatigue, nause a, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness , or 
jaundice),or hypersensitivity  (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia ).
5.ALT ≥ 5xULN but <8 xULN and cannot be monitored weekl y for ≥2 weeks.
When any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria 1-5 is me t, do the following:
Immediatel y withdraw investigational product
Report the event to GSK within 24 hours of learning its occurrence
Complete the liver event CRF and SAE data collection tool if the event also meets the 
criteria for an SAE. All events of AL T ≥ 3xULN andbilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) 
(or ALT ≥ 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured); INR measurement is not required and 
the threshold value stated will not apply  to patients receiving anticoagulants), termed 
‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic impairment or 
cirrhosis) . 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediatel y available, withdraw study  drug 
from that subject if ALT ≥ 3xULN andbilirubin ≥ 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of 
detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury .
Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy  CRFs if these tests are perfor med
2013N167980_00

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Perform liver event follow up assessments, and monitor the subject until liver chemistries 
resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described below.
Withdraw the subject from the study (unless further safety follow up is required) after 
completion of the liver chemistry  monitoring as described below.
Do not re -startinvestigational product.
In addition, for criterion 1:
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 hours for repeat 
liver chemistries, liver event follow up assessments (see below), and close monitoring
A specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended.
Monitor subjects twice weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baselin e values
For criteria 2, 3, 4 and 5:
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24-72 hou rsfor 
repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow up assessments (see below)
Monitor subjects weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AS T, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values; criterion 5 subjects should 
be monitored as frequently  as possible
Subjects with ALT ≥5xULN and <8xULN which exhibit a decrease to ALT ≥3xULN, but 
<5xULN and bilirubin <2xULN without hepatitis symptoms or rash, and who can be 
monitored weekl y for 4 weeks:
Notify the GSK medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of the a bnormality  to discuss 
subject safet y
Can continue investigational product
Must return weekl y for repeat liver chemistries (AL T, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) until they  resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline
If at any time these subjects meet the liver chemistry  stopping criteria, proceed as 
described above
If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xUL N and bilirubin <2xUL N, monitor subjects 
twice monthly  until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline values.
For criteria 1-5, make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow up assessments
described below:
• Viral hepatitis serology including:
Hepatitis A IgM antibody;
Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody  (IgM);
2013N167980_00

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Hepatitis C RNA;
Cytomegalovirus IgM a ntibody;
Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibod y(or if unavailable, obtain heterophile 
antibody or monospot testing) ;
Hepatitis E IgM antibody;
Blood sample for PK analy sis, obtained within approximately  1 to 2 weeks after the liver 
event. Record t he date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose 
of investigational product prior to blood sample draw on the CRF. If the date or time of 
the last dose is unclear, provide the subject’s best approximation. I f the date/time of the
last dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period 
indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample. Instructions for sample handling and shipping 
are in the Study  Procedures Manual.
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lac tate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2xULN
Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia. Record the 
appearance or worsening of clinical s ymptoms of hepatitis or hy persensitivity , such as 
fatigue, naus ea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever rash or 
eosinophilia as relevant on the AE report form
Record use of concomitant medications, paracetamol (acetaminophen), herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications, or putative hepatot oxins, on the concomitant 
medications report form.
Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake case report form
The following are required for subjects with ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% 
direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:
Anti-nuclear antibody , anti-smooth muscle antibody , and Type 1 anti-liver kidney  
microsomal antibodies and quantitative total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma 
globulins) .
Serum acetaminophen adduct HPL C assay (quantifies potential acetaminophen 
contribution to liver injury  in subjects with definite or likely  acetaminophen use in the 
preceding week [James, 2009]) .
Liver imaging (ultrasound, magneti c resonance, or computerized tomography ) to evaluate 
liver disease.
Section 7.6 Suicidality Assessment
Formerly:
Subjects who answer “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation questions 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS should be referred to appropriate psychiatric care and prompts the 
completion of an SAE worksheet. The medical monitor should be notified when these events 
occur. In addition, a “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation question 3, 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS prompts the completion of the Possible Suicidality Related History

CAUSALITY
It is a regulatory requirement for investigators to assess relationship between the 
investigati onal product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE based on the information 
available. The assessment should be reviewed on receipt of any new information and 
amended if necessary. A “reasonable possibility ”is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Facts/evidence or 
arguments that may support “a reasonable possibility ”include, e.g., a temporal 
relationship, a pharmacologically- predicted event, or positive dechallenge or 
rechallenge. Confounding factors,such as concomitant medication, a concurrent illness, 
or relevant medical history, should also be considered.

Disease Background
The systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis; also known as granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti- neutrophil cy toplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (Jennette a nd 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to lifethreatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. 
Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining patterns in 
immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear (P-ANCA). It is 
now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 3 (PR3), and P-
ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which are enzymes that 
are abundant in the granules of neutrophi ls (Jennette and Falk, 1997; Merkel et al, 1997). 
Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO autoantibodies are 
more common in MPA and CSS. Anti -PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality compared to anti-MPO. The most widely used classification criteria for 
diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are those published by the American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt et al, 1990 and Masi et al, 1990, 
respectivel y), and that published by the ChapelHill Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA 
(Jennette et al, 1994). Of note, none of these diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement 
of ANCA.
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classificati on criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Watts et al, 2007). 
In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiological studies are confounded by its original 
inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilizing the ACR or CHCC criteria, 
prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and 0.4-
1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by some margin 
(Koldingsnes et al, 2008). AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with peak age of onset in 
those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatski et al, 2010), with other small vessel vasculitides being the 
major concern in childhood (Brogan et al, 2010).Current therapy is usually determined by 
severity of the disease, with more severe forms warranting more aggressive approaches. These 
usually involve an initial remission induction regimen of high dose corticosteroid 
administered with either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX) followed by a 
remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stone et al, 2010; Bosch et al, 2007; 
Jayne et al, 2003). Minor manifestations are usually treated with low dose corticosteroid 
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 30
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate (Belmont, 2006). Even with recent 
treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains unacceptabl y 
high (Drooger et al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmani et al, 1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG 
(Stone et al, 2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 (Mukht yar et al, 2009). In its current form it is a list of 
56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A weighted numerical score
is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each manifestation. The items are grouped 
by organ systems, and each organ system has a maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the 
relative importance of the organ system (Mukhtyar et al, 2009). The tool also makes a 
distinction between new or worsening disease and persistent disease with new or worsening 
attracting higher scores.
IV Belimumab
Over 2,000 individuals with SL E have been treated with belimumab in clinical studies. In two 
global Phase 3 studies, belimumab 10 mg/kg met the primary efficacy endpoint (SRI at 
Week52). Evidence of other possible benefits in these trials included reductions in risk of 
severe flare and corticosteroid use, and improvements in patient reported quality of life and 
fatigue. Serological activity was reduced as measured by reductions in autoantibodies and 
normalization of hypergammaglobulinemia and complement levels. B cells, including 
autoreactive B cells, were also reduced, but not severely  depleted, consistent with wha t would 
be expected from inhibition of BLyS (reference belimumab IB, Section 5.3.1). These results 
supported the approval of belimumab in the EU, US, Canada and other countries.
In the United States belimumab is approved for the following indication:
BENLYSTA® (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, 
autoantibody -positive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard 
therapy.
Limitations of Use: The efficacy of BENLYSTA has not been evaluated in patients with 
severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. BENLYSTA 
has not been studied in combination with other biologics or intravenous 
cyclophosphamide. Use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in these situations.
In the EU, the approved indication focuses on patients with high disease activity (where 
belimumab offered the greatest benefit):
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, 
autoantibodypositive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree ofdisease 
activity (e.g positive anti -dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.
The EU SPC also includes special warnings and precautions for use similar to the US 
labeling, including that belimumab has not been studied in and is thus not recommended in 
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 31
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
patients with severe active central nervous system lupus or severe active lupus nephritis. In 
addition, caution should be exercised if belimumab is co-administered with other B cell 
targeted therapy or cyclophosphamide. Reference Section 4.4 of the SPC for the complete list 
of specials warnings and precautions.
Treatment with belimumab plus standard therapy was generally well tolerated, with rates of 
AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and serious/severe infections 
generally comparable to the rates observed in the placebo plus standard therapy group. The 
most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 3% of patients receiving 10 mg/kg 
belimumab IV in clinical trials (and at a ≥ 1% greater rate than placebo) were nausea, 
diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity , depression, 
migraine, pharyngitis, cystitis, leukopenia, and gastroenteritis viral. In clinical trials, 
hypersensitivity  and infusion reactions were observed more frequently with belimumab, with 
anaphylaxis observed in ≤ 1% of subjects. Data from the post-marketing setting indicate that 
hypersensitivity  reactions may be serious or result in death, that the onset of such reactions 
may be delayed, and that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant 
hypersensitivity  may be at increased risk. In addition, it is also known from clinical trials and 
the post-marketing setting that the vast majority of hypersensitivity  reactions occur with the 
1stor 2ndinfusion. The product labeling, belimumab IB, protocol, and informed consent forms 
have been updated to include this new information, as applicable.
Other risks that may be associated with belimumab based on its mechanism of action include 
serious infections and malignanc y, although no increases in the rates of serious infections or 
malignancies have been observed. Psychiatric events including depression and suicide were 
observed more frequently  with belimumab than with placebo, although it is unknown if 
belimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these events. Finally, mortality 
rates in the controlled clinical trials were low, although numerically  higher in the belimumab 
groups (0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectively ). Causes of death 
were as expected in an SLE population with active disease receiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, 
cardiovascular disease, and suicide.
Experience from open-label, long-term continuation trials of belimumab in SLE patients 
suggests prolonged treatment with belimumab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase in the incidence of AEs or SAEs over time, including important events such 
as infections and malignanci es. Long-term belimumab treatment appears to provide sustained 
improvement in SL E disease activity  and reduction of flares.
Belimumab in A NCA-Associated Vasculitis
Study Overview and Patient Population
Belimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg in combination with standard SLE therapy demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically meaningful reduction in SLE disease activity versus 
placebo plus standard SLE therapy  at Week 52 in two Phase 3 clinical studies in subjects with 
active, autoantibod y-positive SL E.
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 32
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Studies in subjects with WG and MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2 diseases ranging from 15% at 18 
months (Jayne et al, 2003) to 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al, 2010) on az athioprine –the most 
effective of current therapies (Jay ne et al, 2003; Pagnoux et al, 2008; Hiemstra et al, 2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV. Further supporting a role for B cells is the factthat activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popa et al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, are found in subjects with 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagai et al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010). Together, these 
provide a strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels. Therefore, 
for the proposed study, subjects are required to have documented evidence of anti-PR3 or 
anti-MPO autoantibodies prior to randomization, as this population is considered the most 
likely to benefit from treatment with a B cell modulating agent like belimumab. This is 
consistent with the Phase 3 SLE results for belimumab where the subjects who benefitted 
from treatment were those who were antinuclear antibody (ANA/anti -dsDNA) autoantibody 
positive at baseline.
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20, recentl y showed success in inducing remission in AAV (Stone et al, 2010) and 
was granted approval in the US for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease. Finally , limited data from the small (n = 111) subset of subjects in the Phase 3 
trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their SLE (as assessed by the SELENA 
SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus standard of care treatment arms 
had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 compared with subjects receiving 
placebo plus standard of care. Specificall y, 19/36 (52.8%) and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in 
the belimumab 1 mg/kg and10 mg/kg dose groups, respectivel y, had resolution of vasculitic 
activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of placebo subjects. Taken together, these 
data support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
The safety of the proposed study is supported by data from the Phase 2 and 3 trials in SLE in 
which subjects who were receiving belimumab in combination with significant background 
therapies, including steroids and immunosuppressants, had an adverse event profile similar to 
that of subjects receiving plac ebo plus standard therapies.
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of 
remission in subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA) following a standard induction regimen. Subjects enrolled into the study 
must have a clinical diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the Chapel Hill criteria and must 
have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WG or MPA that was 
treated with corticosteroids and either CYC or RTX in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated with 1 of the following induction regimens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 33
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2 mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses of CYC are given as targets but may be adjusted for renal insufficiency  or white 
cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day .
A target of 300 to 400 subjects who are within 26 weeks of starting induction therapy , achieve 
a BVAS v.3 score of 0 (ie, are in remission), and are receiving less than 10 mg/day  prednisone 
(or equivalent) on 2 consecutive measurements 21 to 35 days apart will be enrolled into the 
study. Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
study agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour. 
Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 14, and every 28 days 
thereafter. Randomization will be performed on Day 0. Day 0  (first administration of 
belimumab/placebo) must occur no more than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission.
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be treated with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . Azathioprine must be initiated at any time following 
confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0. Patients with known intolerance to 
azathioprine will be excluded from the trial. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop 
Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe 
gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, characterized by severe nausea and vomiting, 
following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 
1mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience the toxicities described above, a switch to 
methotrexate at a target dose of 25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated 
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is 
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  analysis.
The randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), 
disease stage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (IV 
CYC vs. oral CYC vs. RTX). It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patients would be 
newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be 
capped if they exceed this proportion. Refer to Section 4 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for a 
complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The primary efficacy endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse, defined as at least 
1major BVAS item or a minimum total BVAS score of 6 or receipt of prohibited medications 
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 34
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
according to the protocol. Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA 
until the results from the primary efficacy analysisare available or until they experience a 
flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy endpoint. The database will be locked and 
the primary analysis will be performed after at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse 
and at least 12 months have elapsed after the last subject is randomized. Subjects who 
discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double blind visit 
schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase (whichever is 
earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an attempt will be 
made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of stud y agent.
If top line data from the double blind portion of this trial show that belimumab is superior to 
placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint, and the safety profile of belimumab is acceptable, 
subjects who receive treatment with study agent until the completion of the double-blind 
period of the study and have not relapsed (as defined by the primary endpoint) will be given 
the option to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6-month open-label extension period, in 
which all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab IV. Subjects participating in the open-
label extension will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. All subjects will return 
for an Exit visit approximately  4 weeks after their last dose of study  agent as well as a follow -
up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of study agent. These visits apply to 
subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early from the open-label 
extension.
After the 6-month open-label extension phase, subjects who wish to continue treatment may 
do so by being prescribed commerciall y available belimumab. If belimumab is not 
commerciall y available in a subject’s country of participation, the subject may continue to 
receive belimumab under a separate continuation protocol. A separate informed consent will 
be provided for the continuation protocol. The 8 week follow-up visit is not required for 
subjects entering the continuation protocol.
Dose and Schedule
Investigational Study Agent (Belimumab or Placebo)
The dose and schedule of belimumab proposed for use in the ANCA-associated vasculitis 
study is the same dosage (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 4 weeks thereafter) 
and route of administration (IV) as that approved for marketing. The belimumab BDS and 
FDP that will be used for this study  is the same as that approved for marketing.
In the Phase 3 IV SLE studies, several clinicalmeasures of improvement including the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Week 52 (SRI), SELENA SLEDAI reductions, severe flare risk 
reduction, and complement normalization generally favored the 10 mg/kg dose. Trends 
toward clinically significant steroid reduction were present for both doses. Additionally , there 
appeared to be a greater dose response in subjects with high disease and serological activity. 
There was no apparent dose-response in the safety profile of belimumab with both doses 
being generally well-tolerated. These data supported the selection of 10 mg/kg belimumab as 
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 35
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
the marketed dose in general SLE, and also support its continued evaluation in combination 
with standard maintenance therapies in patients with WG or MPA.
The use of placebo in this trial is considered appropriate and does not put placebo patients at 
undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo group and the belimumab group will 
receive standard of care maintenance therapies for vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) 
and, ifneeded, subjects will receive appropriate rescue therapy in accordance with standard 
clinical practice as described above.
Induction and Maintenance Regimens for ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the s tudy:
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses of cyclophosphamide are given as targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency  or white cell counts as dictated by  local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day .
Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith et al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX regimen specified in this vasculitis study is the 
same as that approved b y the FDA for this indication.
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauci and Wolff, 1973; Fauci et al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
2013N167980_00
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 36
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayne et al, 2003)showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements 3 to 5 weeks 
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving < 10 mg/day  of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
achieved no more than 26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, 
subject randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, 
subjects will be randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + 
placebo or AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol must 
occur within 2 weeks of achieving a confirmed remission and the randomization will be 
stratified by  induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. In this study, subjects who have a known 
intolerance to azathioprine will be excluded. Subjects naive to azathioprine and who 
experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST 
or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by 
severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce 
the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience toxicities, a switch 
to methotrexate at doses of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be 
permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it isnot 
anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters 
et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included 
in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs physicians to follow the appropriate local 
prescribing information for azathioprine or methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during 
treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society ( EUVAS)and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC), and consensus was reached that these 
regimens are appropriate for this international trial. 
Complete details regarding the use of concurrent medications can be found in Section 5.5 of 
Protocol HGS1006- C1100.

Safety Considerations
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analyzed (after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee). The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Belimumab has not y et been studied following use of 
IV cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX); there is limited experience with the 
combination of belimumab and oral CYC. As an added safety precaution, initial 
randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction 
and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC reviews will occur after the first 20subjects per 
induction regimen (RTX or I V/oral CYC) have been randomized and have had a Week 8 visit. 
Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, 
safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding 
whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be applied for the first 
20subjects randomized following induction with CYC. The DMC will review the data 
approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction regimens. At all times the 
patients, study sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation. Investigators and 
IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting.
The DMC will be notified of:
• all unexpected causall y-related SAEs that ar e life-threatening or result in death;
• other unexpected causally -related SAEs;
• all reports of serious infections and opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship 
to study agent; and
• subjects experiencing IgG < 250 mg/dL; 
within protocol-specified timeframes. Based on these data, an ad hoc DMC meeting may be 
called at any time (see Section 8.3 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for additional detail 
regarding the DMC).
Based on the large body of safety data from SLE patients treated with belimumab and/or the 
mechanism of action of belimumab as a B cell immunosuppressant, anticipated potential risks 
of belimumab treatment in vasculitis patents include serious infusion and hypersensitivity  
reactions, infections, depression-related events, and malignancy . These risks are briefly 
reviewed here and are detailed more fully in the belimumab Investigator’s Brochure. Both 
investigators and subjects will be appropriately  informed regarding these risks. It is noted that 
because of the older patient population affected by this disease, the average age of subjects 
anticipated to participate in this study will be older than the average age of the SLE 
population studied to date (mean age of ~53 years at the time of diagnosis in vasculitis (Stone 
et al, 2010) compared with an average age of ~38 years in controlled Phase 3 studies of 
belimumab in SLE). As such, patients with vasculitis may be at a greater risk for infection 
than the SLE patients; however, the increased monitoring for infections by both the DMC 
(described above) and recommended to investigators (see below) will help to ensure subject 
safety through timely detection, treatment and reporting of infections.

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 02 Summary of Modifications Belimumab
The protocol states that all subjects should be monitored closely for infection and increased 
vigilance for infection is recommended in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL, 
especially for prolonged periods; clinical judgment should be applied with respect to the 
appropriateness of continuing study therapy in these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be 
consulted before administering subsequent doses of study agent in subjects with IgG levels 
<250 mg/dL. Study agent will be discontinued in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that 
are associated with a severe or serious infection. If a subject experiences a clinically 
significant, potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) AE that the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly  or probably  related to belimumab/placebo, then treatment with study  agent 
will be discontinued. The subject will be followed at regularly scheduled study visits as 
specified by the protocol through the end of the double-blind period and also until resolution 
of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).
In order to ensure subject safety with respect to infusion and hypersensitivity  reactions, the 
protocol excludes patients with known history of allergic reactions to human or murine 
proteins or monoclonal antibodies. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine 
whether premedication diminishes the frequency  or severity of hypersensitivity  reactions to 
belimumab. The protocol recommends that based on clinical judgment, premedication 
including an antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the 
infusion. Antihistamine H2-receptor antagonists (eg, ranitidine) are also permitted. 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to manage 
infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the 
subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigat ors/site personnel should be aware of the risk 
ofhypersensitivity  reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor subjects 
closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placebo administration must be 
discontinued immediately  and the appropriate medical therapy administered. Per protocol, 
subjects are to remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 
2infusions in the double-blind treatment phase and the open-label extension. Should 
symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be 
appropriate, based on clinical judgment. This may include, but is not limited to, monitoring 
vital signs and observing for any untoward reactions. Beyond the first 2 infusions, subjects 
should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after infusion according to 
study sites’ guidelines or standard operating procedure for IV infusions. Subjects should be 
made aware of the potential risk, the signs and symptoms of such reactions, and the 
importance of immediately  seeking medical attention.
The protocol recommends that subjects with persistent or worsening disease should receive 
appropriate rescue therapy  in accordance with standard clinical practice, but if exceeding what 
is allowed per protocol, treatment with study agent (ie, belimumab or placebo) will be 
discontinued and the subject will be considered as having relapsed for the primary analysis. 
The list of prohibited medications that results in the subjects being considered as relapsed for 
the primary endpoint (Protocol Section 5.5.2.1), was developed because the need for the use 
of these agents (eg, RTX or CYC) is indicative of treatment failure (ie, disease relapse).
Moreover, concomitant use of such medications (eg, high-dose steroids) can be associated 
both with potent disease- modifying activit y and/or significant toxicity that may introduce

bias and confound interpretation of results. As such, no subject will be denied appropriate 
medical care for their condition due to their participation in this clinical study .
In addition, the Sponsor notes that although this is a placebo controlled trial, the sponsor does 
not consider that placebo patients are at undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo 
group and the belimumab group will receive standard of care maintenance therapies for 
vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate 
rescue therap y in accordance with standard clinical practice as described above.
Risk:Benefit Conclusions
In summary, the proposed Phase 3 study is a superiority  study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of belimumab for the maintenance of disease remission in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic poly angiitis. The risk:benefit profile of 
10 mg/kg IV belimumab in pa tients with active, autoantibody -positive SLE was demonstrated 
to be positive in the two Phase 3 SLE studies, thereby supporting its approval in Canada, the 
US, and the EU. Belimumab has already been shown to be effective in treating patients with 
active, autoantibody -positive SL E, a B cell mediated autoimmune disease. Like SL E, WG and 
MPA are also B cell mediated autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies (in this case, 
against neutrophil components), are considered to be pathogenic (Popa et al, 1999). Ineach of 
these diseases, the general purpose of the therapy is similar –reducing disease activity by 
down regulating B cells (including autoreactive B cells) and reducing the level autoantibodies 
produced by those autoreactive B cell clones. Down regulating B cell numbers may also 
reduce inflammatory  processes because of the role of B cells in antigen presentation. A 
limited amount of data from the IV Phase 3 studies suggests that belimumab may reduce 
vasculitic sy mptoms.
There are potential risks associated with belimumab treatment including serious infusion and 
hypersensitivity  reactions, infections, depression- related events, and malignancy ; however, in 
view of the serious and potentially  life threatening nature of disease flares in WG and MPA, it 
is believed that the overall risk:benefit analysis for belimumab in the maintenance of 
remission in WG and MPA is favorable, especially  in view of the nature of the trial as a 
superiority  trial over a current standard of care regimen.

Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine for theMaintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The protocol has been modified to further define allowable/prohibited doses of 
corticosteroids that can be given for vasculitis and for reasons other than vasculitis. It is 
now specified that IV corticosteroid pulses for vasculitis at any dose are prohibited and 
use of such will result in the subject being considered as relapsedfor the primary 
endpoint; it is considered that subjects requiring IV corticosteroid pulses are having 
sufficient disease activity to qualify as having relapsed. In relation to this, it is now 
clarified that IV steroid pulses > 125 mg prednisone (or equivalent) are prohibited for 
reasons other than vasculitis and such use will also result in the subject being considered a 
treatment failure.Importantly , it is also now stated that use of high dose steroids (ie, 
average daily dose of >20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≤ 14 days or IV 
corticosteroid pulses ≤ 125 mg prednisone or equivalent) for non vasculitis reasons may 
only be given to a subject 1 time in any 365 day period without the subject being 
considered a treatment failure.Thesemodifications to the protocol will prevent 
uncontrolled use of oral and IV pulse corticosteroids that could confound the 
interpretation of stud y results. 
2.A statement has been added to clarify that the protocol-defined induction regimens for 
cyclophosphamide are given as treatment targets but that theymay be adjusted to account 
for renal insufficiency  or reduced white blood cell countsas dictated by local standard of 
care practices.
3.A subgroup analysis by duration of IV corticosteroid pulse used for induction (1 day vs. 
>1 day) has been added.
4.The language regarding the recommended HDCS tapering to reach the entry criteria of 
<10 mg/day  has been corrected from the previously  written < 10 mg/kg.
5.The dose of methotrextate to be used in case of azathioprine toxicity has been clarified to 
be a target dose, to allow for flexibility in individual practice. A minimum dose of 
methotrexate (no less than 10 mg/week) is also specified, to ensure subjects are receiving 
a sufficient and relatively  consistent therapy.This change also ensures the guidance given 
for methotrexate is consisten t with that given for azathioprine.
6. Vital signs havebeen added to the listing of screening procedures to match the study 
calendar footnote.
7.The visit windows for the 8and 12 week visits in Study  Calendar 6 -1have been corrected 
to +/-7 days rather than +/-3 days.
8.Serum IgG has been added to the 8 Week Follow -upvisits in Study  Calendars 6- 1 and 6-2.
This was omitted in error in amendment 00 of the protocol.
9.Footnote number 12 in Study Calendar 6-1 and footnote number 8 in Study Calendar 6-2 
havebeen revised to correspond with Section 7.2 of the protocol.

Study Design and Schedule:
This is a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in 
subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
following a standard in duction regimen.
Subjects enrolled into the trial must have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to 
severely active WG or MPA that was treated with corticosteroids and either 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (ie, induction therapy) in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated under the following induction regimens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
•A single course rituximab (RTX) administered at  a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks 
plus high dose corticostero ids (HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
interval, plus HDCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 
15mg/kg every  3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, leukopenia,or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]Amend 01

For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Subjects who are between 6 and 26 weeks of starting induction therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 
score of0 (Appendix 4), and are receiving ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone (orequivalent) on 2
consecutive measurements at least 14 daysapart may be enrolledinto the study. A minimum 
6week period should elapse between initiation of induction therapy and randomization. 
Randomization will be performed on Day  0. A schematic of the study  design is shown below.
All randomized subjects should be treated with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 
2mg/kg/day . Azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following 
administration of induction th erapy. Azathioprine should not be initiated any  later than Day  0. 
Subjectswho meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio toreceive study agent 
(belimumab [10mg/kg] or placebo) administered intravenously (IV)over 1 hour.The 
randomizati onwill be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs.anti-MPO), disease 
stageat induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease) and induction regimen (IV 
cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. rituximab). Belimumab or placebo will be 
supplied by the sponsor during this double-blind treatment phase. It is anticipated that no 
more than 25% of the patients would be newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such 
enrollment of these patients may be capped if they exceed this proportion. Study agent 
(belimumab/placebo) will be administ ered at Day  0, 14, 28, and every  28days thereafter .  
Initial randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX 
induction and 40 post-CYC induction). Once the first 20 patients r andomized following 
induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the independent 
data monitoring committee (DMC),who will make a recommendation regarding whether to 
continue randomization . The same procedure would be appliedfor the first 20subjects 
randomized following induction with CYC. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain 
blinded to treatment allocation.
Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA until the study has 
completed or until theyexperience a flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy 
endpoint (see below). The double-blind phase of the study will complete, the database will be 
locked and the primary analysis will be performed when 12months have elapsed after the last 
subject is randomized.
In consultation with the investigating physician, subjects participating in the double-blind 
period of the trial will have the option to continue to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6 -
month open label extension phase. The criteria for entry into the extension phase of the study 
are: (1)the safety profile of belimumab is considered to be acceptable, based on ongoing Amend 01

IDMC data reviews of the safety data, and other relevant safety data sources; (2) the risk-
benefit profile for continuing treatment with belimumab must be favorable in the opinion of 
the investigator; (3) the subject will have completed the double-blind treatment period of the 
trial without having relapsed (as defined in the primary endpoint); (4) a favorable opinion has 
been obtained from the local ethics committee or IRB with respect to continuation of 
belimumab treatment. Subjects who enter the open-label extension phase will receive 
belimumab for up to an additional 6 monthsand this will be supplied by  the sponsor.
Following completion of the study and, where applicable, completion of the 6-month open-
label extension phase, subjects will not receive any additional treatment supplied bythe 
sponsor.The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the 
post-study care of the subject’s medical condition .
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare (as defined below) are to be 
followed per the double blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind 
treatment phase (whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior 
to 1 year an attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose 
of study agent.

Efficacy Endpoint sand Analysis:
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:
The primary  efficacy endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse,defined as:
•At least 1 major BVAS item ( Appendix 4 ) OR 
•Aminimum total BVASscore of 6 (Appendix 4 )OR
•Receipt of prohibited medications (as defined in Section 5.5.1).
Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:
•Timefrom Day 0 to the first majorrelapse (defined as ex periencing at least 1 major BVAS 
item, see Appendix 4 ).
Other efficacy endpointsare described in Section 8.5.4.
Sample Size Considerations:
Approximately  100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined based 
on the feasibility  of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-frame. The 
sample size was not based on statistical considerations andthe analysis of primary and 
secondary  endpoints will be exploratory  in nature. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebo group, a 
relapse rate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically  significant 
(p<0.05) in a stud y of 100 subjects (50 per arm). 
Analysis of Primary EfficacyEndpoint:
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the time to first relapsefrom Day 0 between the 
placebo/azathioprine group and the belimumab/azathioprine combination group using a Cox 
proportional hazards model, adjusted for ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs.anti-MPO), disease stage
at induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease), and induction regimen (rituximab vs.IV 
cyclophosphamide vs.oral cyclophosphamide).However, the adjustment of induction 
regimen will be changed to rituximab vs.IV and/or oral cyclophosphamide if the number of 
events (relapse) is less than 5 in subjects using oral cyclophos
phamide or IV 
cyclophosphamide .For any subject who does not experience a relapse,the time to first relapse 
will be censored at the time of the subject’s last assessment .
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end 
of the double-blind treatment phase (whichever is earlier).The primaryefficacyanalysis will 
be performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject .Amend 04

Analysis of Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:
The analysis of the major secondary  efficacy endpoint will be performed using the same 
method described for the primary efficacy analysis, but censoring subjects who receive any 
prohibited medication prior to an observation of any  major BVAS item.
Safety Endpoints and Analysis:
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events (AEs), changes inlaboratory 
parameters and immunogenicity .The frequency  and rate of laboratory  abnormalities will be 
tabulated by treatment group.The frequency  and rate of AEswill be tabulated by MedDRA 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term and presented b y treatment group.
Adverse events of special interestthat will be analyzed in this protocol include: all-cause 
mortality; serious and/or severe infections; opportunistic infections; infusion reactions 
including h ypersensitivity  reactions; malignant neoplasms; se lected serious psy chiatric events; 
suicidality  assessment ( Appendix 8 ); and immunogenicity.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked an d analyzed. The DMC will include at least 3 phy sicians and a 
statistician, none of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. The first DMC reviews will occur 
after the first 20 subjects per induction regimen (RTX or IV/oral CYC) have been randomized 
and have had a Week 8 visit. Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with 
RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a 
recommendation regarding whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be 
applied for the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with IV or oral CYC. The 
DMC will review the data approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction 
regimens. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The 
DMC will monitor this trial until the data are locked, unblinded, and analyzed for the primary 
efficacy outcome, after which time monitoring may be assumed by an internal Human 
Genome Sciences (HGS) committee. Investigators and IRBs/ECs will be notified of the 
outcome of each DMC meeting.
PK Endpoints and Analysis:
Serum samples will be collected from all randomized subjects who receive a dose of study 
agent during the study and analyzed to determine serum belimumab concentration s. Serum 
belimumab concentration data will be used in a population PK analysis, which will be 
reported separatel y.
Immunogenicity:
Serum samples for the measurement of anti-belimumab antibodies will be obtained from all 
subjects before administration of study agent on Day 0, Week 8, Week 24, Week 48 and
Exit/8-week Follow -up.Additionally , samples will be obtained fromsubjects atWeeks 24 and 
48 during additional years. For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 
8-week follow-up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity  was assessed if 8-week Amend 04

follow-up immunogenicity  sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum 
sample for anti-belimumab antibodies at least 6months after the last dose of study agent or 
after completion and/or unblinding of the study , whichever is later. 
Biological Markers and Autoantibodies :
Pharmacogenetic sampling (in consenting subjects) will be taken once during the course of 
this study (see Appendix 9 ).  
Biological markers will be measured at baseline (Day 0) and at multiple time points 
thereafter :
•Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  (ANCA:antiPR3, anti -MPO)
•Serum complement (C3, C4)
•Serum immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA, IgM, IgG)
•C-reactive Protein (CR P)
•Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
•Urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio
•BLyS protein (Day 0 only)
•FACS of peripheral l ymphocytes

1Background
1.1Disease Background
The systemic vasculitide s encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis ( also commonly  referred to as granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis [GPA]), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti-neutrophil cy toplasmic antibodies ( ANCA)(Jennetteand 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV)are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to life-threatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining 
patterns in immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear 
(P-ANCA).It is now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 
3 (PR3), and P-ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which 
are enzymesthat are abundant in the granules of neutrophils ( Jennetteand Falk, 1997; Merkel
et al, 1997). Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO 
autoantibo dies are more common in MPA and CSS.  Anti-PR3 antibodies are associated with 
increased morbidityand mortality compared to anti-MPO(Hoganet al, 1996; Franssen et al, 
1998). The most widely used classification criteria for diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are 
those published by the American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt
et al, 1990 and Masiet al, 1990, respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill 
Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA (Jennetteet al, 1994; Jennetteet al, 2013).Of note, 
none ofthese diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement of ANCA. The Chapel Hill 
criteria for WG can be found in Appendix 1 and for MPA in Appendix 2 .
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classification criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Wattset al, 2007; 
Mahr, 2009). In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiological studies are confounded by its 
original inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilising the ACR or CHCC 
criteria, prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and
0.4-1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by some margin 
(Koldingsnes and Nossent,2008). In the US, the prevalence rates of WGrange from 
2.6-9/100000 ( Zeftet al, 2005; Mahret al,2006).AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with 
peak age of onset in those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatsakiet al, 2010),with other small vessel 
vasculitides being the major concern in childhood ( Broganet al,2010).
Current therapy is usually determined by severity of the disease, with more severe forms 
warranting more aggressive approaches. These usually involve an initial remission induction 
regimen of high dose corticosteroid administered with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab 
followed by a remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stoneet al,2010; 
Boschet al,2007; Jayneet al,2003). Minor manifestations are usuall y treated with low dose Amend 02

corticosteroid administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate ( Belmont,2006). Even 
with recent treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains 
unacceptabl y high (Droogeret al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmaniet al,1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG
(Stoneet al,2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 (Mukhtyaret al, 2008, Appendix 3). In itscurrent 
form it is a list of 56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A 
weighted numerical score is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each 
manifestation. The items are grouped by organ systems, and each organ system has a 
maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the relative importanc e of the organ system 
(Mukhtyaret al, 2008). The tool also makes a distinction between new or worsening disease 
and persistent disease with new o r worsening attracting higher scores.
1.2Study Agent Background
Belimumab (also known as LymphoStat -B; BENLYSTA™) is a B-lymphocyte stimulator 
(BLyS)-specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to 
its receptors on B cells. Belimumab does not bind Bcells directly, but by binding BLyS, 
belimumab inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the 
differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin -producing plasma cells.
Nonclinical pharmacolog ic, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicologic data generated with 
belimumab are provided in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3Clinical Experience
1.3.1Belimumab A dministered Intravenously
Belimumab administered as an intravenous (IV)infusion has been studied in SLE subjects in 
1 Phase 1 trial (LBSL01), 1 Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
(LBSL02) and 2 Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [BLISS 52 
(HGS1006 -C1057) and BLISS 76 (HGS1006- C1056)], and in RA subjects ina Phase2 
double-blind, placebo -controlled trial (LBRA01).
Phase 3 studies of belimumab in SLEwerecompleted in 2009 and 2010 and formed the basis 
of IV belimumab in the US, Canada and EU .The Phase 3 trials included 1,684 subjects where 
belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy demonstrated superiority over placebo plus 
standard therapy in reduction in disease activity as measured by the SLE responder index 
(SRI) with an acceptable safety profile.The primarysafety population supporting approval 
also included data from a Phase 2 study  in 449 subjects with SLE.Evidence of benefit in other 
clinical measures such as reductions in disease activity as measured by SELENA SLEDAI, 
severe flare, and reduced steroid use was also observed. Treatment with belimumab plus 
standard of care was generally well tolerated, with rates of adverse events (AEs), severe AEs, 
serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and serious/severe infections generally 
comparable to the rates observed in the placebo plus standard of care group.Mortality  rates in

Clinical Protocol H GS1006-C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
the controlled clinical trials were low, although numericall yhigher in the belimumab groups: 
0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectivel y.Causes of deathwere as 
expected in an SLE population with active diseasereceiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as steroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, cardiovascular 
disease, and suicide .Serious infections were observed in 5.2% and 6.0% of subjects receiving 
placebo and belimumab, respectivel y.The rate of malignancy  (excluding non-melanoma skin 
cancer) was the same between the placebo and belimumab groups at 0.4%; however as with 
other immunomodulating agents, the mechanism of action of belimumab could increase the 
risk for the development of malignancies. Hypersensitivity  and infusion reactions were 
observed. Anaphylaxis was also observed, though rare (<1%). Depression -related events, 
common in patients with SLE, were observed more frequently with belimumab than with 
placebo; it is unknown ifbelimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these 
events.The most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥5% of subjects in 
clinical trials were nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in 
extremity , depression, migraine, and phary ngitis.
Experience fromopen-label, long-term continuation trials ofbelimumab in SLE subjects 
suggests that prolonged treatment with belimu mab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase in the incidence rate of AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs) over time, 
including important events such as infections and malignancies. The prevalence rate of AEs 
and SAEs has also remained relatively stable over time.Long term belimumab treatment 
through6 years appearsto provide sustained improvement in SLE disease activity .
Results of the clinical trials of belimumab administered IV are described in further detail in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.
A benefit-risk evaluation of belimumab in the context of the present study is provided in 
Appendix 12 of this protocol.
1.4Rationale for the S tudy
Studies in subjects with WGand MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2diseasesranging from 15% at 
18months (Jayneet al, 2003) to 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al,2010) on azathioprine –the 
most effective of current therapies (Jayneet al,2003; Pagnoux et al,2008; Hiemstra et al,
2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV.Further supporting a role for B cells is the fact that activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popaet al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, are found in subjectswith 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagaiet al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010).Together, these 
provide a strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels.Amend 02

Clinical Protocol H GS1006-C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20(Dasset al, 2008; Wanget al 2008), recently showed success in inducing 
remission in AAV (Stoneet al, 2010)and was granted approval for the treatment of WG and 
MPAsupports the rationale that belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLy S, 
may be useful in the treatment of this disease.Finally,limited data from the small (n=111) 
subset of subjects in the Phase 3 trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their 
SLE (as assessed by  the SELENA SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus 
standard of care treatment arms had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 
compared with subjects receiving placebo plus standard of care. Specifically , 19/36 (52.8%) 
and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in the belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose groups, 
respectivel y, had resolution of vasculitic activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of 
placebo subjects.Taken together, the sedata support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
2Study Objectives
2.1Primary Objective
1.To evaluate the efficacy  of belimumab in the maintenance of remission following a 
standard induction regimen in subjects with Wegener’s g ranulomatosis (W G) or 
microscopic pol yangiitis (MPA).
2.To evaluate the safet y of belimumab in subj ects with WG or MPA.
3Study Design
3.1 Basic D esign Characteristics
This is a multi-center,multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in 
subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) 
following a standard induction regimen.Subjects enrolled into the trial must have had an 
initial or relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WGor MPA that was treated with 
corticosteroids and either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab ( ie,induction therapy) in the 
6 months leading up to randomization. S ubjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
•A single course rituximab (RTX) administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks 
plus high dose corticosteroids ( HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
intervalplus HSCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/d ay orally plus HDCS OR
•Cyclophosphamide 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeksapart followed by  pulses of 
15mg/kg every  3 weeks plus HDCS .Amend 01

[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency , leukopenia, or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is:methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/da ynot to exceed 80mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Subjects who between 6 and26 weeksof starting induction therapy, achieve a BVASv.3
score of 0 (Appendix 4) and are receiving ≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) on 
2consecutive visits at least 14daysapart may be enrolled into the study. A minimum 6 week 
period should elapse between initiation of induction therapy and randomization.
Randomization will be performed on Day 0. A schematic of the study design is shown in 
Figure 1.
Figure 1Schematic of study design
All randomized subjects should be treated with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 2 
mg/kg/day. Azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following 
administration of induction therapy . Azathioprine should not be initiated any  later than Day  0. Amend 01

Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio toalso receive study 
agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo )administered intravenousl y over 1 hour.The 
randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), disease 
stage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease) and induction regimen (IV 
cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. rituximab). Belimumab or placebo will be 
supplied by the sponsor during this double-blind treatment phase. It is anticipated that no 
more than 25% of the patientswould be newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such 
enrollment of these patients may  be capped if they  exceed this proportion. Study agent will be 
administere d at Day 0, 14, 28 and every  28days thereafter.
Initial randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX 
induction and 40 post-CYCinduction). Once the first 20 patients randomized following 
induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the independent 
data monitoring committee (DMC), who will make a recommendation regarding whether to 
continue randomization . The same procedure would be applied for the first 20 subjects
randomized following induction with CYC. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain 
blinded to treatment allocation.
Subjects willreceive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA until the study has 
completed or until they experience a flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy 
endpoint (see Section8.5.1). The double-blind phase of the study will complete, the database 
will be locked ,and the primary analysis will be performed when12months have elapsed after 
the last subject is randomized.
In consultation with the investigating physician, subjects participating in the double-blind 
period of the trial will have the option to continue to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6 -
month open label extension phase. The criteria for entry into the extension phase of the study 
are: (1) the safety profile of belimumab is considered to be acceptable, based on ongoing 
IDMC data reviews of the safety data, and other relevant safety data sources; (2) the risk-
benefit profile for continuing treatment with belimumab must be favorable in the opinion of 
the investigator; (3) the subject will have completed the double-blind treatment period of the 
trial without having relapsed (as defined in the primary endpoint); (4) a favorable opinion has 
been obtained from the local ethics committee or IRB with respect to continuation of 
belimumab treatment. Subjects who enter the open-label extension phase will receive 
belimumab for up to an additional 6 monthsand this will be supplied by  the sponsor.
Following completion of the study and, where applicable, completion of the 6-month open-
label extension phase,subjects will not receive any additional treatment supplied by the 
sponsor.The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the 
post-study care of the subjec t’s medical condition .
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an Amend 02

5.1Study Agent Name and Formula tion
The common name of the investigational product is BENLYSTA™.The generic (USAN/INN) 
name is belimumab.
Belimumab is a recombinant, human, IgG1monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human 
B lymphocyte stimulator (BLy S, also referred to as BAFF and TNFSF13B). Belimumab has a 
molecular weight of approximately  147 kDa.Belimumab is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology  in a mammalian cell expression sy stem.
Belimumab drug product is provided as a sterile, lyophilized product in a 20 mL vial. Upon 
reconstitution with 4.8 mL sterile water for injection (SWFI), each vial will contain 80 mg/mL 
belimumab in0.16 mg/mL citric acid, 2.7 mg/mL sodium citrate, 80 mg/mL sucrose, 
0.4mg/mL polysorbate80, pH 6.5. Each vial is single use.
The placebo control is prepared as a sterile, lyophilized product in a 20 mL vial. Placebo is
reconstituted with 4.8 mL SWFI. Upon reconstitution with 4.8 mL sterile water for injection 
(SWFI), each vial will contain 0.16 mg/mL citric acid,2.7 mg/mL sodium citrate, 80 mg/mL 
sucrose, 0.4 mg/mL  polysorbate80, pH 6.5. Each placebo vial is single use.
5.2Packaging, L abeling, Preparation, and S torage
Belimumab will be supplied in a 20 mL vial containing 400 mg belimumab (deliverable).
Placebo control will be supplied in a 20 mL  vial.
Lyophilized belimumab and placebo should be stored at 2-8°C. After reconstitution and 
dilution in normal saline, the material is stable for up to 8 hours at 2-8°C, or at room 
temperature. Refer to the Pharmacy  Manual for detailed instructions on the preparation, 
administration, and storage of study  agent.
The 400 mg single use vial of study agent will be reconstituted with 4.8 mL SWFI, to yield a 
final concentration of 80 mg/mL of belimumab. Placebo will be reconstituted with 4.8 mL 
SWFI.
In addition to any country-specific requirements, the study agent label will contain, at a 
minimum, the following information:
•Product name;
•Concentration;
•Lot number;

Clinical Protocol H GS1006-C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
•Storage conditions;
•Investigational drug statement; and
•Manufacturer’s name and address.
The calculated doseof study agent to be administered to the subject is determined in 
milligrams (mg) by the assigned treatment group and the subject's body weight in kilograms 
(kg).
The reconstituted study agent will be diluted in 250 mL normal saline for intravenous 
infusion. An amount of normal saline, equal to the calculated amount of product to be added, 
should be removed from the infusion bag prior to adding the product. After adding the 
reconstituted product, gently invert the bag to mix the solution. 
Belimumab and placebo will be supplied as open-label vials and 3rdparty unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted and diluted by the unblinded site pharmacist 
or designee, independent of the study (person responsible for receiving and dispensing study 
agent). Except for a limited number of safety oversight personnel, all other site personnel, the 
subject, the sponsor and contract research organization (CRO) will remain blinded to the 
study agent received and to certain biomarkers and pharmacod ynamic laboratory  results. 
Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study agent 
(unblinded monitor) aspects of the study .
Study agent inventory /accountability  forms will be examined and reconciled by the Sponsor
or designee .At the end of the study , all used and unused study  agent must be accounted for on 
a study agent accountability  form.
Refer to the Pharmacy manual for more details regarding storage, handling, and drug 
accountability .
5.3Dose, Route of Administration, and S chedule
The treatment groups include one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimumab and a placebo 
arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section5.5.3). 
Belimumab/placebo will beadministered intravenously  over 1 hour. The intent of this 
instruction is to prevent more rapid infusion of belimumab which may result in a higher 
incidence of infusion reactions. Infusion time need notbe exactly one hour as it is often 
difficult to so precisely adjust infusion times and there may be clinical reasons for infusions
lasting longer than one hour. Therefore, the instruction should be interpreted as infusion over 
at leastone hour. The target infusion time should still be approximately  one hour assuming no 
other issues intervene. Once randomized, subjects will be dosed with study agent on Days 0, 
14, and 28 and every  28days thereafter.
Premedication including an antihistamine, with or without an antipy retic, may  be administered 
before the infu sion. Antihistamine H2- receptor antagonists ( eg, ranitidine) are also permitted.Amend 04

Clinical Protocol H GS1006-C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
Belimumab/placebo should be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to 
manage infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if 
the subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigators/site personnel should be aware of the 
risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor 
subjects closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placeb o administration must be 
discontinued immediately and the appropriate medical therap y administered. 
In the post-marketing setting, delayed onset of symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  reactions 
has been observed. Subjects should remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after 
completion of the first 2 infusions in the double-blind treatment phase. Should symptoms of 
acute hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment. This may include, but is not limited to, monitoring vital signs and 
observing for any untoward reactions. Beyond the first 2infusions, subjects should be 
monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after infusion according to study  sites’ 
guidelines or standard operating procedure for IV infusions.
Subjects should be made aware of the potential risk, the signs and symptoms of such 
reactions, and the importance of immediatel y seeking medical attention. For further 
information, see the belimumab IB.
5.4Alteration of Dose/Sched ule Due to Toxicity
The dose of belimumab/placebo administered may  not be altered.   The rate of infusion may  be 
slowed or interrupted if the subject appears to develop signs of adverse reaction or infusion-
associated symptoms. At later visits, these subjects may continue to be infused over a longer 
infusion period at the investigator’s clinical discretion. 
If a subject experiences a clinically significant AE that
the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly or probably related to belimumab/placebo and could potentially  be 
exacerbated by the next dose, the investigator may delay the dose by up to 2 weeks or 
withhold 1 dose. If a similar concern is present after 2 weeks, the investigator should contact 
the medical monitor to determine whether treatment should be discontinued.
If a subject experiences a clinically significant, potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) AE that 
the investigator believes may be definitely , possibly or probably related to 
belimumab/placebo , then treatment with study agent will be discontinued. The subjectwillbe 
followed at regularl y scheduled study  visits as specified by theprotocol through the end of the 
double-blind period and also until resolution of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).All subjects 
should be monitored closely for infection. Increased vigilance for infection is recommended 
in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL , especially  for prolonged periods; clinical 
judgment should be applied with respect to the appropriateness of continuing study therapy in 
these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be consulted before administering subsequent doses 
of study agent in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL.  Study agent will be discontinued in 
subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that are associated with a severe or serious infection.Amend 04

5.5Concurrent M edications
5.5.1Prohibited Medications and Therapies that Result in Treatment Failure
Subjects who start prohibited medication or therapies at any time during the double-blind 
phase willbe considered as having relapsed asof the time of receipt of the prohibited 
medication ,andtreatment with study agent will be discontinued. However, the subject will 
continue to be followed for survival through at least 12months after randomization. The 
following medications and therapies are prohibited during the study :
•Other immunomodulatory  investigational agents (biologic or non -biologic);
•Rituximab ;
•Cyclophosphamide;
•Other immunosuppressive agents (eg,cyclosporine) with the exception of methotrexate 
for AZA intolerance described in Section 5.5.3;
•Corticosteroids for vasculitis:
doses > 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent), or
IV corticosteroid pulses at an y dose;
Note: Doses of prednisone up to a maximum of 20 mg/day  (or equivalent) for vasc ulitis, 
for a maximum of 1 week, are only allowable within the first 2 months of the double -blind 
treatment period.
•Corticosteroids for reasons other than vasculitis:
at an average daily  dose of > 20mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for > 14days where 
the average dail y dose is calculated as the sum of the dose over 7 consecutive day s divided 
by 7, or
IV corticosteroid pulses > 125 mg prednisone (or equivalent)
Note: Doses of prednisone (or equivalent) > 20mg/day  for ≤ 14 days or IV corticosteroid 
pulses ≤ 125 mg prednisone (
or equivalent) for reasons other than vasculitis cannot be 
given more than once in any  365 day period(See also Section 5.5.3).
•Plasmapharesis .
5.5.2Other Prohibited Medications and Therapies
Due to the mechanism of action of belimumab, it is possible that response to vaccination may 
be impaired. Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with 
belimumab/placebo infusions.
Other investigational agents are not permitted.
5.5.3Allowable Medications
The use of stable baseline dose regimens of corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent) is permitted over the course of the trial.Doses of corticosteroid up to a maximum 
of 20mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent), for vasculitis, are permitted for a maximum of 
1week within the first 2 months of the doub le-blind treatment period. At other times, subjects 
are restricted to ≤ 10mg/dayprednisone or equivalent. It is expected that this dose may be

for atopic dermatitisare also permitted . Doses of prednisone (or equivalent) > 20mg/day  for ≤ 
14 days or an IV corticosteroid pulse up to 125 mg prednisone (or equivalent) arepermitted 
for reasons other than vasculitis (eg. acute allergic reaction) , but a subject ca nnot receive more 
than 1 such corticosteroid regimen in any 365 day period (See also Section 5.5.1).
5.5.3.1 Azathioprine and Methotrexate
The target dose of azathioprine is 2mg/kg/day  (not to exceed 200 mg/day). For the 
maintenance of remission azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated 
following administration of induction therapy. Azathioprine must not be initiated any later 
than Day 0. Azathioprine should be started at a dose of 50 mg/day and increased by no more 
than 50mg/day every week until the target dose is achieved.
Subjectsnaïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT >2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, 
characterized by severe nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be 
permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day . If the subjectcontinues to 
experience the toxicities described above a switch to methotrexate at a target dose of  
25mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. 
These subjectswill be included in the primary  analysis. 
For subjects previously  identified as being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identif ied 
as having undetectable or reduced activity  of thiopurine methy ltransferase (TPMT), it may  be
permissible for methotrexate to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance 
of remission from the outset
. This should be discussed with the medical monitor .
Methotrexate would not be recommended for those subjects with significantly  impaired renal 
function.
Theappropriate local prescribing information (eg,dose adjustments, contraindications, 
hematological and biochemical monitoring, pregnanc y, contraception, etc.)for azathioprine 
or methotrexate (MTX)(as applicable) ,should be followed prior to and during treatment.
In the extension phase of the trial, the dose of AZA/MTX can be decreased or discontinued 
based on the discretion of the inves tigator. 
6Study Procedures
The nature of potential risks and benefits associated with participation in the study will be 
explained to all potential study subjects.Written informed consent (including consent for the 
use and disclosure of research-related health information) must be obtained before the subject 
can begin an y screening procedures that are not considered part of standard patient care. 
Subjects participating in the pharmacogenetics (PGx) research portion of the protocol

6.2Study Enrollment P rocedures
Subjects who have undergone all screening procedures and have met the entry criteria will be 
enrolled into the study and assigned to treatment by Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS).Randomization will be performed on Day  0. Azathioprine may  be initiated as soon as 
it is clinically indicated following administration of induction therapy. Azathioprine must not 
be initiated any later than Day 0.Female subjects who require pregnancy testing must have a 
negative urine pregnancy  test done on Day 0, prior to randomization. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( belimumab +AZA or placebo + AZA).
6.3Double-Blind Treatment P hase
Subjects will be evaluated duringthe scheduled study visits as outlined in the Study Calendar 
(Table6-1and Table6-2). Time windows are provided for each study visit to allow flexibility  
in site and subject scheduling. All study visits should occur within the visit window of the 
scheduled stud y visit.
At baseline (Day 0), the subject will be randomized and receive the first dose of study agent. 
Visits to the study site will occur on Day 14, Day 28, and approximately  every 28 days 
(calculated from the Day 0 dose) thereafter. Allefforts should be made to retain subjects on 
schedule, based on the date of their Day 0  dose. Subjects should remain under clinical 
supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 infusions.  Should symptoms of acute 
hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment.
Subjects who have not experienced a flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy 
endpoint (seeSection 8.5.1) will remain on double-blind treatment with study agentuntil the 
study has completed. The double-blind phase of the study will complete and the primary 
efficacy analysis will be performed when12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of 
the last subject.
In consultation with the investigating physician, subjects participating in the double-blind 
period of the trial will have the option to continue to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6 -
month open label extension phase. The criteria for entry into the extension phase of the study 
are: (1) the safety profile of belimumab is considered to be acceptable, based on ongoing 
IDMC data reviews of the safety data, and other relevant safety data sources; (2) the risk-
benefit profile for continuing treatment with belimumab must be favorable in the opinion of 
the investigator; (3) the subject will have completed the double-blind treatment period of the 
trial without having relapsed (as defined in the primary endpoint); (4) a favorable opinion has 
been obtained from the local ethics committee or IRB with respect to continuation of 
belimumab treatment. Subjects who enter the open-label extension phase will receive 
belimumab for up to an additional 6 monthsand this will be supplied by  the sponsor.
Subjects who do not enter the open -label extension will return for an Exit visit (approximately  
4 weeks after the last dose of study  agent), and a follow-up visit (approximately  8 weeks after 
the last dose of study agent).Amend 03

Table 6-1Footnotes:
1. Complete physical examination, including he ightandweight.  
2. Any SAEs occurring prior to the start of study agent administration and assessed as relate dto study participation (eg, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests) will be recorded on the SAE worksheet and 
reported as described in Section 7.2from the time a subject consents to participate in the s tudy.
3. All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are identified from the start of study agent administration ( Day 0) through 8 weeks following administration of the last dose of study agent should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE eCRF).   SAEs that occur after the 8 week follow -up period that are assessed by the investigator as definitely, possibly or probably related to study agent 
must be reported to the Drug Safety designee on the SAE worksheet.  (Post study SAEs will not be documented on the AE eCRF.)
4. Refer to Appendix 6 for laboratory assessments to be completed.
5. Results of urine pregnancy test at subsequent visits, if required, must be available prior to dosing. See S ection 6.1(Screening Procedures) for definition of those exempted from pregnancy testing.
6. In consenting subjects only ( Appendix 9 ).
7. Immunogenicity samples are collected pre -dose atall time points .  For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 8 -week follow -up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity was assessed if 8 -
week follow -up immunogenicity sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum sample for anti -belimumab antibodies at least 6 months after the last dose of study agent or after completion 
and/or unblinding of the study, whichever is later. 
8. Subjects who discontinue treatment with study agent (belimumab/ placebo) will continue to be followed per this calendar schedule until relapse as defined in Section 8.5.1 .
9. Subjects should remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 study agent infu sions.  Should symptoms of acute hypersensitivity occur, an extended period of monitoring may be 
appropriate, based on clinical judgment.
10. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, AST or ALT > 2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity reaction, characterized by severe nausea and 
vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day. If the patien t continues to experience the toxicities d escribed above a switch to methotrexate at doses of 
up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. For subjects previously identified as being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced a ctivity of 
thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the outset following discussion with the medical 
monitor.
11. Any visit in which the subj ect discontinues treatment becomes the Exit visit (ie ,generally 4 weeks after the last dose of study agent ). The Exit Visit should only be completed for subjects who discontinue the double 
blind treatment phase early or forsubjects that have successfully completed the double -blind treatment phase and do not wish to participate in the open label extension phase . Subjects who discontinue treatment 
but have not relapsed will remain on the double blind study visit schedule. For subjects who complete the double blind phase and enter the open label phase, refer to Table 6-3for vis it details.

Table 6-2Footnotes:
1All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are identified from the start of study agent administration ( Day 0) through 8 weeks following administration of the last dose of study agent should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE eCRF).    SAEs that occur after the 8 week follow -up period that are assessed by the investigator as definitely, possibly or probably related to study agent 
must be reported to the Drug Safety designee on the SAE worksheet.  (Post study SAEs will not be documented on the AE eCRF.)
2Refer to Appendix 6 for laboratory assessments to be completed.
3Results of urine pregnancy test at subsequent visits, if required, must be available prior to dosing. See Section 6.1(Screening Procedures) for definition of those exempted from pregnancy testing.
4Immunogenicity samples are collected pre -dose atall timep oints.  For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 8 -week follow -up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity was assessed if 8-
week follow -up immunogenicity sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum samp le for anti -belimumab antibodies at least 6 months after the last dose of study agent or after completion 
and/or unblinding of the study, whichever is later.
5Subjects who discontinue treatment with study agent (belimumab/Placebo) will continue to be follow ed per this calendar schedule until relapse as defined in Section 8.5.1 .
6Subjects naïve to  azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, AST or ALT > 2times ULN, or a severe gastrointe stinal hypersensitivity reaction, characterized by severe nausea and 
vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day. If the patien t continues to experience the toxicities described above a swi tch to methotrexate at doses of 
up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted.
7Any visit in which the subject discontinues treatment becomes the Exit visit (ie, generally 1 -4 weeks after the last dose of study agent). The Exit Visit should only be completed for subjects who discontinue the 
double blind treatment phase early or when subjects have successfully completed the double -blind treatment phase and do not wish to participate in the open label extension phase .For subjects who c omplete the 
double blind phase and enter the open label phase, refer to Table 6-3for vis it details.
8In subjec ts who discontinue study agent all AEs and SAEs will be reported on the AE eCRF through 8 weeks followi ng administration of the last dose of study agent .After this time, all SAEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, will be collected until relapse or the study is an alysed for the primary endpoint , whichever occurs first .

6.4Open-Label Extension Phase
In the 6-month open-label extension, all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab every 
28days until Week 24, with a final evaluation at Week 28 (4 weeks after the last dose). The 
first dose on the open-label extension will be given 4 weeks after completion of the 
double-blind period. Day 0 is the first visit in the extension phase of the trial and represents 
the first belimumab administration for placebo subjects. Subjects should remain under clinical 
supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 infusions.  Should symptoms of acute 
hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment.
All subjects participating in the open-label extension will continue to be monitored for 
efficacy and safet y as per the study  calendar (see Table6-3). 
During the 6-month open-label extension, the investigator may adjust concurrent medications 
(add, eliminate, change dose level/frequency ) as clinically  appropriate. Prohibited medications 
during this phase are live vaccines, biological therapies and other investigational agents. 
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately  4weeks after their last dose of study 
agent as well as a follow-up visit approximately 8 weeks after the last dose of study agent. 
These visits apply  to subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early  
from the open- label extension.
Following completion of the 6 -month open- label extension phase, subjects will not receive 
any additional treatment supplied by  the sponsor. The investigator is resp onsible for ensuring 
that consideration has been given to the post -study care of the subject’s medical condition .Am01/Belgium

6.5Unscheduled Visits
Unscheduled visits may be necessary  during the course of the study to capture a subject’s 
status between regularly scheduled visits. Examples include, but are not limited to, a 
worsening of disease symptoms (eg, flare), AE reporting, or follow-up to a previously  
reported AE.
6.6Laboratory  Tests
Non-fasting clinical laboratory  tests will be performed as outlined in the Study Calendar 
(seeTable6-1, Table 6-2, and Table6-3).
Due to the potential for unblinding, thefollowing lab results will not be provided to study 
sites after baseline (Day  0): serum immunoglobulin isoty pes IgM/IgA and the results from the 
FACS anal ysis listed below.  
In geographies where feasible, the following biological markers will be measured (using 
FACS anal ysis):
•T cell subsets: CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+
•B lymphocytes: (CD19+, CD20+, CD20+/CD69+ activated, CD27hi/CD20- short-lived 
plasma, CD27+/CD20+ memor y, CD27-/CD20+ naïve, CD138+/CD20 -138 plasma cells,

6.6.2Liver Chem istry Stopping and Follow -up Criteria
Liver chemistry  stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure 
subject safety and evaluate liver event etiology in alignment with the FDA premarketing 
clinical liver safety  guidance [ James, 2009; Le Gal , 2005].
Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria- Liver Stopping Event
ALT-absolute ALT 8xULN
ALT Increase ALT 5xULN but <8xULN  persists fo r 2 weeks
ALT 3xULN but <5xULN  persists for 4 weeks
Bilirubin1, 2ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) 
INR2ALT 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured
Cannot Monitor ALT 5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 2 weeks
ALT 3xULN but <5xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks
Symptomatic3ALT 3xULN associated with symptoms (new or worsening) believed to be related to liver 
injury or hypersensitivity
1) Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately 
available, discontinue study treatment for that subject if ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN. Additionally, if serum 
bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2) All events of ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR measured 
which may indicate se vere liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of 
hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.
3) New or worsen ing symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).Amend 02

6.6.3.1 Required A ctions and Follow Up A ssessments for Increased 
Monitoring w ith Continued Therapy
Notify the GSK medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of the abnormality  to 
discuss subject safet y. 
Subject can continue study  treatment
Subject must return weekly  for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline

If ALT decreases from ALT  5xULN and <8xULN to ≥3xULN but <5xULN, 
continue to monitor liver chemistries weekl y. 
If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xUL N and bilirubin <2xUL N, monitor 
subjects twice monthly  until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline.
6.6.4 Study Tre atment Restart
Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a 
clear underlying cause (other than drug induced liver injury [DILI]) of the liver event (e.g. 
biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there 
should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity , and the study treatment 
should not be associated with HL A markers of liver injury .
Approval b y GSK for study treatment restart can be considered w here:
Investigator requests consideration for study  treatment restart if liver chemistries have a 
clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver chemistries have 
improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T <3xUL N).
Restart risk factors (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic hepatitis, 
possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study treatment has an HLA genetic 
marker associated with liver injury  (e.g., lapatinib, abacavir, amoxicillin/cl avulanate) are 
reviewed and excluded.
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart must 
be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be prov ided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury or death.  
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the stud y 
treatment r estart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  chart.  
2015N245521_ 00

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.
Subjects approved b y GSK Medical Governance for restarting stud y treatment must 
return to the c linic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have 
been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol. 
If after study  treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  stopping 
criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment restart. 
GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 7.2
6.6.5Immunogenicity
Serum samples for the measurement of anti-belimumab antibodies will be obtained from all 
subjects before administration of study agent on Day 0, Week 8, Week 24, Week 48 and 
Exit/8-week Follow- up. Additionally , samples will be obtained from subjects at Weeks 24 and 
48 during additional years. For any subject who had a positive antibody response at the 
8-week follow-up visit (or last study visit at which immunogenicity  was assessed if 8-week 
follow-up immunogenicity  sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum 
sample for anti-belimumab antibodies at least 6months after the last dose of study agent or 
after completion and/or unblinding of the study , whichever is later. 
6.7 Exit Visit
Subjects who relapse/flare and do not complete the study  must return for an Exit visit 4 weeks 
after the final dose of study  agent. 
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an 
attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of study 
agent.
Refer to the Study Calendar (Table6-1, Table6-2) for a list of procedures required at this 
visit.  
6.88-Week Follow -up Visit
All subjects must return for a follow-up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of 
study agent. 
Refer to the Study Calendar (see Table6-1, Table6-2and Table6-3) for a list ofprocedures 
required at this visit.Amend 04

6.9Withdrawal of Subjects fromTreatment
Subjects will be free to withdraw from treatment or from the study  at any time, for any  reason, 
or they may be withdrawn/removed, if necessary , to protect their health (see reasons for 
withdrawal below). It is understood by  all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can 
render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary  withdrawal of subjects should be 
avoided.
Subjects may  be withdrawn from treatment with study  agent for any of the following reasons:
•Unacceptable toxicity  (see Section 5.4)
•Prohibited concurrent medication or therap y (see Section 5.5.1 andSection 5.5.2)
•Withdrawal of c onsent(including use and disclosure of research -related health 
information)
•Pregnancy
Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an 
attempt will be made to ascertain survival status 12 months after the first dose of study agent.  
Any subject that withdraws consent for use and disclosure of research -related health 
information will be considered withdrawn from the study  and not followed.

Belimumab and placebo will be supplied as open-label vials and 3rdparty unblinding will be 
employed. The study agent will be reconstituted and diluted by the unblinded site pharmacist 
or designee, independent of the study (person responsible for receiving and dispensing study 
agent). Except for a limited number of safety  oversight per sonnel, all study site personnel, the 
subject, the sponsor and the Contract Research Organization (CRO) remain blinded to the 
study agent received and to the results of certain biomarker and pharmacody namic laboratory  
results. Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and study 
agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study .
If a medical emergency occurs and a decision regarding the subject’s condition requires 
knowledge of the treatment assignment, the study blind may be broken for the specific 
subject.Whenever possible, the investigator should consult with the medical monitor prior to 
unblinding any subject. Any broken blind will be clearly justified and explained by a 
comment in the eCRF. The investigator must notify  the Medical Monitor of any  broken blind, 
regardless of whether it was done for emergency  or non-emergency  reasons.

7Adverse Event Reporting
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definitio n of an AE or SAE.
7.1Definitions
ADVERSE EVENT 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
Note: AnAE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the
use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to
produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of thecondition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. This should be reported rega rdless of sequelae.
“Lack of efficacy”or “failure of expected pharmacological action”per se will not be reported
as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from
lack of efficacy  will be reported if they  fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsenAmend 04

The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT –A serious adverse event is an y untoward medical 
occurrence that, at an y dose:
a. Results in death
b. Islife-threatening 
NOTE:The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event inwhich 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it we re more severe.
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
NOTE:In general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency  ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-
patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication 
prolongs hospitalisation or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in 
doubt as to whether “hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be 
considered serious.
Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsenfrom 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d. Results in disability  / incapacity , or
NOTE:The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance suchas uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly  / birth defect
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise t he 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples 
of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

g. All events of possible drug -induced liver injury with hy perbilirubinaemia defined as ALT ≥ 
3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT ≥3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR 
measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is notrequired and the threshold 
value stated will not apply to patients receivinganticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing isunavailable, 
record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin
elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the
criterion of total bilirubin ≥2xULN, then the event is still reportedas an SAE. If INR is 
obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver injury .
7.2Reporting A dverse Events to the Sponsor
All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are identified from the start 
of study agent administration (Day0) through 8 weeks following administration of the last 
dose of study agent will be recorded on the Adverse Even tCase Report Form (AE eCRF). All 
data fields on the AE eCRF should be comple ted.
For subjects who discontinue treatment with study agent during the double-blind period (for 
reasons other than withdrawal of consent), all adverse events will be collected through 
8weeks following the administration of the last dose of study  agent. After this time, all SAEs, 
regardless of relationship to study  drug, will be collected until relapse or the study is analysed 
for the primary endpointand study sites are informed that SAE data collection can cease, 
whichever occurs first.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)must ALSO be recorded on the SAE eCRF within 24 hours of 
site personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedness. All fields of the SAE 
eCRF should be completed, but completion of the reportshould not be held until all 
informatio n is available. Follow-up information and corrections should be added to the eCRF 
within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the eventas described in the Study 
Procedure Manual. 
In addition, prior to study drug administration, any SAE assessed as relatedto study 
participation (eg, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests) will be reported as anSAE 
from the time a subject consents to participate in the study.   
SAEsthatoccuroff study, afterthefollow-up periodthatareassessedbytheinvestigator as
definitely ,possibly orprobably related tostudyagent mustbereportedtothesponsor as 
outlined in the Study  Procedures Manual.
7.3Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting (Protocol Specified 
Events)
Protocol Specified Events (PSEs) are additional events that must be reported to the Drug 
Safety designee in an expedited manner. A PSE may or may not be an SAE. PSEs are 
considered SAEs if they  meet 1 or more of the criteria for an SAE (See Section 7.1).PSEsare Amend 04

recorded on the PSE page of the eCRF within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of 
the event. 
IgG < 250 mg/dL (Grade 4) is a protocol specified event for this protocol. 
7.4Laboratory  Abnormalities as A dverse Events
Any abnormal laboratory  test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinalysis)or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, any clinically 
significant safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged 
by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, are not to be 
reported as AEs or SAEs. 
If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  abnormalit y, the diagnosis or medical 
condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg,
elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL 
(Grade 4) should always be recorded on the PSE page of the eCRF. IgG < 250 mg/dLshould 
also be reported as an SAE if it meets one or more of the SAE criteria in Section 7.1.
Laboratory  tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7.If a particular lab testis not listed in the Appendix, the lab test should be graded 
mild, mod erateorsevere as specified in Section 7.8.
7.5Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in SLE patients receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherap y, including belimumab. A diagnosis of PML  should be considered in an y 
subject presenting with new- onset or deteriorating neurological signs and sy mptoms. The 
subject should be referred to a neu rologist or other appropriate specialist for evaluation. If 
PML is confirmed, stud y agent should be discontinued and consideration should be given to 
stopping all immunosuppressant therapy . 
If PML is suspected, this should be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor.  The 
appropriateness of continuing stud y agent, while the case is being assessed, should be 
discussed.
7.6Suicidality  Assessment
Some autoimmune diseases have an increased risk of suicidal behavior and/or ideation 
(Bachenet al, 2009, Timonen et al, 2003, Stenager et al, 1992).In order to objectively  assess 
suicidality  in belimumab clinical programs the C-SSRS will be utilized to collect information 
on suicidal behavior and ideation. Since major depressive disorder may increase the risk of 
suicidal ideation or behavior before or during clinical studies, subjects participating in this 
study will beassessed at every  visit for suicidalit y.Amend 03

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
Subjectswho answer “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation questions 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS should be referred to appropriate psychiatric care and prompts the 
completion of an SAE worksheet. The medical monitor should be notified when these events 
occur. In addition, a “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation question 3, 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS prompts the completion of the Possible Suicidality Related History 
Questionnaire (PSRHQ, only the first time this condition is met; refer to Appendix 10for the 
PSRHQ) eCRF and a Possible Suicidality  Related Questionnaire (PSRQ) eCRF (at all times 
this condition is met ; refer to Appendix 11 for the PSRQ ).  
Baseline/Screening and during treatment assessment of suicidality  will be performed during 
the blinded portion of this study using C-SSRS (Refer to Appendix 8for C
-SSRS). 
TheC-SSRS is a brief measure which is designed to assess severity and change of suicidality 
by integrating both behaviour and ideation (Posneret al, 2007). The C-SSRS is administered 
by a qualified clinician and is designed to address the need for a summary measure to track 
change in the severit y/density of suicidality  across both clinical settings and treatment trials. I t 
assesses intensity of ideation (a potentially  important marker of severity) by specifically 
asking aboutfrequency , duration, intrusiveness, controllability , and deterrents. In addition, it 
captures both the modal and most severe forms of ideation. The C- SSRS is to be completed by 
the investigator or his/her qualified designee at every visit during the double-blind portion of 
the study. 
Although assessment of suicidality  using the C-SSRS will take place only during the blinded 
portion of the study, investigators are reminded of the importance to clinically assess for 
suicidality  at every visit given that study patients are at increased risk of suicidal behavior 
and/or ideation.
7.6.1Possible Suicidality  Related Questionnaire (PSRQ)
The investigator will be prompted to complete the PSRQ (in addition to the AE or SAE pages, 
as appropriate) if a yes response is give n to any suicidal behavior or a yes response to suicidal 
ideation questions 3, 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS.Refer to Appendix 11for the PSRQ. If the 
adverse event meets the definition of an SAE, which includes a yes answer to any suicidal 
behavior or a yes to suicidal ideation questions 4 or 5 on the C- SSRS the site must ensure that 
there are no significant discrepancies between the PSRQ and the SAE.
7.7Reporting a Pregnancy
Any pregnancy  that occurs during stud y participation must be reported using a clinical trial 
pregnancy  form. To ensure subject safet y, each pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor 
within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence. All pregnancies that are identified from the start 
of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study  agent should be reported. 
The pregnancy  must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) 
and status of mother and child. Pregnancy  complications and elective terminations for medical 
reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an 
SAE.Amend 02

Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy , brought to the investigator’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study  and considered by  the investigator a s possibly  
related to the study treatment, must be promptly reported to the Sponsor.
7.8Investigator Evaluation of A dverse Events
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria for 
seriousness are listed in Section 7.1), severity (intensity), and causality (relationship to study 
agent). The investigator will make an assessment of intensity based on the Division of 
Microbiology  and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables (see 
Appendix 7 ) where possible:
SEVERITY
Mild An event that is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal  
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities (Grade 1
DMID).
Moderate An event that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
everyday activities (Grade 2 DMID).
Severe An event that prevents normal every day activities (Grade 3 or 4 
DMID). 
Not applicable Those event(s) where intensity is meaningless or impossible to
determine (i.e., blindness and coma).
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre-defined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE.
CAUSALITY
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility" is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) 
and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.Amend 02

There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to includein the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to GSK.The investigator may change his/her opinion of 
causality in light of follow-up information, amending the SAE data collection tool 
accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.
7.9Follow-Up of A dverse Events
Serious and non-serious adverse events that occur from the start of study medication 
administration through 8 weeks after the date of last administration of study agentare 
reported.
After the initial AE/SA E report, the investigator is required to proactively  follow each subject 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-serious AEs of special interest (see Section 
8.6.2) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or until thesubject is lost to follow-up. This applies to all subjects, 
including those withdrawn prematurel y. 
PSEs (see Section 7.3) that occur after the Screening visit through 8 weeks after the date of 
last administration of study agent are reported and followed as described above for 
AEs/SAEs.
7.10Reporting Serious A dverse Events to Regulatory  Authorities and
Institutional Review Board s/Independent Ethics Committee s
All SAEs that are considered by the sponsor to be unexpected and related to belimumab will 
be reported by the sponsor or designee as expedited (eg, 15-Day) reports to the appropriate 
regulatory  authorities AND to all participating investigators (exceptions discussed below). In 
addition, the sponsor or designee follows all applicable local and national regulatory  
requirements regarding safety reporting. Each investigator must also comply withthe 
applicable regulatory requirements relatedtothereporting ofSAEstotheIRBs/IECs 
responsible forreviewing thestudyattheirsite,aswellastheregulatory authority(ies)(if 
applicable).
All serious adverse events, including serious disease
-related events (discussed below), will 
be monitored by treatment group by an independent DMC. Investigators and IRBs/IECs will 
be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting, and any  recommendations made.
The conditions listed in Appendix 3are disease related events that can occur in the study 
population regardless of belimumab exposure. When these conditions are considered SAEs, 
they must be reported to the Sponsorwithin 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware as 
described in Section 7.2. Where these are clearly related to the underlying vasculitis, the 
Sponsormay not submit them as expedited reports to regulatory  authorities or participating 
investigators .Amend 04

8Endpoints and Statistical A nalysis
8.1General Statistical Considerations
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be performed on the intent to treat (ITT) 
population defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study 
agent(belimumab or placebo). The ITT analysis will be performed according to the treatment 
that a subject was randomized to receive, regardless of the actual treatment received.
The database will be locked for the primary analysis afterall data have been collected, 
verified and validated for all subjects through 12 months after the randomiz ation of the 
lastsubject.All subjects and study site personnel will remain blinded to original treatment 
assignment until after the final database is lockedand the results of the study are made 
publicly available. 
Analysis of primary and secondary  endpoints will be exploratory  in nature. Nominal p values
may be reported and considered descriptive. Where appropriate point estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals will be constructed.
8.2Randomization Procedure and A ssignment to Treatment Groups
This is a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Once subjects have consented, have undergone all screening procedures and have been 
determined to be eligible for the study , they will be randoml y assigned (via an interactive web
response system [IWRS]) to 1 of 2 treatment groups (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) in a 
1:1 ratio. At randomization, subjects will be stratified according to ANCAtype (anti-PR3 vs.
anti-MPO), disease stageat induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease), andinduction 
regimen (IV cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs.RTX). Randomization will be 
performed on Day  0.  
8.3Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analyzed(after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee) . The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Initial randomization will be limited to 40 subjects 
per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC 
reviews will occur after the first 20subjects per induction regimen (RTX or IV/oral CYC) 
havebeenrandomized and have had a Week 8 visit. Once the first20 subjects randomized 
following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, safety data will be reviewed by the 
DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding whether to continue randomization . The 
same procedure would be applied for the first 20 subjectsrandomized following induction 
with CYC. The DMC will review the data approximately  every 6months thereafter across 
both induction regimens. At all times the sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment 
allocation.  Investigators and IRBs/IECs willbe notified of the outcome of each DMC 
meeting.Amend 04

The DMC will receive information within 72 hours of the sponsor or designee receiving 
notification of any IgG < 250 mg/dL and all unexpected causally-related SAEs that are life 
threatening or result in death . Other unexpected, causally -related SAEs will be provided to the 
DMC within 15 calendar days.  In addition, the DMC will receive information on all serious 
infections and all opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship to study agent, within 
15calendar day s.
8.4Sample Size Rationale
Approximately  100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined based 
on the feasibility  of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-frame. The 
sample size was not based on statistical considerations and the analysis of primary and 
secondary  endpoints will be exploratory  in nature. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomi zation of the last subject.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebo group, a 
relapse rate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically  significant 
(p<0.05) in a stu dy of 100 subjects (50 per arm). 
8.5Efficacy
8.5.1Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary endpoint is time from Day  0 to the first relapse ,defined as 
•at least 1 major BVAS item ( Appendix 4 ) OR 
•a minimum total BVAS score of 6 (Appendix 4 ) OR
•receipt of prohibited medications (as defined in Section 5.5.1).
8.5.2Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the time to first relapse from Day 0 between the 
placebo/azathioprine group and the belimumab/azathioprine combination group using a Cox 
proportional hazard model, adjusted for ANCA type (anti- PR3 vs.anti-MPO), disease stage at 
induction (initial diagnosis vs.relapsing disease), and induction regimen (rituximab vs.IV 
cyclophosphamide vs.oral cyclophosphamide). However, the adjustment of induction 
regimen will be changed to rituximab vs.IV and/or oral cyclophosphamide if the number of 
events (relapse) is lessthan 5 in subjects using the oral or IV cyclophosphamide. If there are 
then still less than 5 patients with an event (relapse) in any of the levels of this or any other 
stratification factor then the stratification term may be removed from the model. For any 
subject who does not experience a relapse, the time to first relapse will be censored at the time 
of the 
subject’s last assessment. Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare 
(asdefined in primary efficacy endpoint) are to be followed per protocol for inclusion in the 
primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). The database will be locked and the primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after 12 months have ela psed following randomi zation of the last subject .Amend 04

8.6Safety
8.6.1Definition of Safety Variables
Safety will be evaluated by adverse events, changes in laboratory  parameters, suicidality  
assessment ( Appendix 8 ), and immunogenicit y.
8.6.2Analysis of Safety Variables
AEs will be graded for severity by the investigator using AdverseEvent Severity Grading 
Tables(Appendix 7) or as described in Section 7.8, as appropriate. The frequency  and rate of 
AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Additional 
analyses may be performed based on event rates adjusting for subject-years on study agent if 
thetime on study agent is imbalanced across treatment groups. Serious and severe (Grade 3 
and Grade 4) AEs will also be summarized by MedDRA SOC and preferred term. 
Discontinuations due to AEs will be summarized. 
The frequency  of laboratory  abnormalities will be tabulated by treatment group. Laboratory  
values will be assessed for changes from baseline. Laboratory toxicity will be graded using 
Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables when possible. Shift tables will be used to determine 
if subjects move from normal to abnormal during the course of the study. Shifts of ≥ 2 grades 
and Grade 3 or 4 laboratory  abnormaliti es will be summarized.

8.7Pharmacokinetics
8.7.1Definition of Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
All randomiz ed subjects who receive a dose of study  agent will be sampled for the assessment 
of serum belimumab levels. Assessment of belimumab concentrations will be performed at the 
timepoints indicated in Section 6.6.1.
8.7.2Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
Serum belimumab concentration will be determined by an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) -
based assay. Results for this study will be presented using appropriate graphic and tabular 
summaries. Serum belimumab concentration data obtained from this study will be used in a 
population PK analysis, which will be reported separately . Potential effects of demographic 
characteristics, concurrent medications, renal function or disease state on belimumab PK will 
be evaluated.
9Pharmacogenetics (PGx)
In consenting subjects, ablood sample for PGx research will be drawn at baseline (Day 0)to 
better characterize genetic variability  (eg,HLA typing) that may affectefficacy or safety 
endpoints. Information regarding PGx research is included in Appendix 9 .
The IEC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory  agency must approve the PGx 
assessments before these can be conducted at the study site. The approval(s) must be in 
writing and clearly specify approval of the PGx assessments (ie, approval of Appendix 9). In 
some cases, approval of the PGx assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest 
of the study. If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate that approval of the PGx 
assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx assessments, can be initiated. 
When PGx assessments are not approved, then approval for the rest of the study will clearly 
indicate this and that PGx assessments will not be conducted.

form must be approved by the IRB/IEC and contain all elements required by national, state, 
local, and institutional regulations or requirements.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to provide each subject with full and adequate verbal 
and written information using the IRB/IEC approved informed consent document(s), 
including the objective and procedures of the study and the possible risks involved before 
inclusion in the study.Each subject must voluntarily  provide written informed consent 
(including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health information). The 
consent must be obta ined prior to performing any study-related procedures that are not part of 
normal patient care, including screening and changes in medications including any  washout of 
medications. A copy of the signed informed consent must be given to the study subject.
10.2Institutional Review Board R eview/Independent Ethics Committee 
Review and Approval
The investigator or Sponsor (as appropriate per national regulations) shall assure that an 
IRB/IEC, constituted in accordance with the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practic e (GCP), 
will provide initial and continuing review of the study .
Prior to shipment of the study agent and enrollment of study subjects, documented IRB/IEC 
approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and any advertisement for subject 
recruitment must be obtained and provided to the Sponsoror designee.
The IRB/IEC must also be informed of all protocol amendments prior to implementation. The 
investigator must provide reports of any change in research activity (ie, the completion, 
termination, or discont inuation of a study ) to the IRB/IEC.
10.3Protocol Compliance
Except for a change that is intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a study 
subject, the protocol shall be conducted as described. Any such change must be reported 
immediately  to the Sponsorand to the IRB/IEC.
10.4Protocol Revisions
Protocol amendments will be prepared and approved by the Sponsor. All protocol 
amendments will be signed by the investigator and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review prior 
to implementation. Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to the Sponsoror

10.5Data Collection and Management
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records for 
each subject. The investigator is also responsible for maintaining any source documentation 
related to the study , including an y films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes.
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. For data collection and 
management purposes, subjects are to be identified by  a subject number only . Documents that 
identifythe subject beyond subject number will not be submitted to the Sponsor(eg, the 
signed informed consent document; subject initials) and must be maintained in strict 
confidence by the investigator, except to the extent necessary  to allow auditing by the 
regulatory authorities, study  monitor, or Sponsorrepresentatives.
Site personnel record all data for each study  subject through electronic case report forms using
an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) sy stem provided and approved by  the Sponsor. Refer to the 
Study Procedures Manual for additional information regarding CRFs that will be used as 
source documentation. Sites must complete the eCRFs in a timely  manner and the investigator 
must promptly review the completed eCRFs for each subject. As the person ultimately 
responsible for the accuracy of all eCRF data, the investigator must sign the Investigator's 
Statement in each subject's eCRF.
The EDC system automatically  generates queries resulting from the computer checks 
embedded into the sy stem, so as to ensure a ccuracy, quality, consistency , and completeness of 
the database. Manual queries resulting from review by monitors, medical coders, and other 
Data Management staff are also generated from within the EDC system, where they are 
tracked. Sites resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary . Every change 
to data is captured in the EDC system audit trail. Uponcompletion of the study, or after 
reaching a pre-specified point in the study, Data Management will lock the database and 
generate the SASdatasets necessary  for data analysis and reporting. Uponcompletion of the 
study, each site will be provided with a compact disk containing the eCRFs for each of their 
subjects.
10.6Study Monitoring
The study Sponsor, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or designee, will monitor the study .Study 
monitors representing the Sponsorwill visit study sites routinely throughout the trial.The 
Sponsorwill review CRFs and compare them with source documents to verify accurate and 
complete collection of data and confirm that the study is being conducted according to the 
protocol. Auditors representing the Sponsormay also similarly evaluate the study and its 
monitors. For these purposes, the investigator will make CRFs and source documents 
available when requested. 
In addition, the study may be evaluated by representatives of the national regulatory 
authorities, who will also be allowed access to study documents. The investigators should 
promptly notify Human Genome Sciences of any audits they have scheduled with any 
regulatory authorit y.

10.7Drug Accountability
Upon receipt, the investigator is responsible for taking an inventory  of the study agent, 
including any buffers or diluents.A record of this inventory  must be kept and usage must be 
documented on study  agent inventory  forms provided by  the Sponsor.
Study agent inventory  forms will be examined and reconciled by a Sponsor’s unblinded 
monitor, or designee. At the end of the study, all used and unused study agent must be 
accounted for on a stud y agent accountability  form.
10.8Retention of Records
The investigator shall retain all records and source documents pertaining to the study, 
including any films, tracings, computer discs, or tapes.They will be retained for the longer of 
the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the study is conducted, 
or the period specified by the Sponsorat the time the study is completed, terminated, or 
discontinued.
If the investigator leaves the institution, the records shall be transferred to an appropriate 
designee who accepts the responsibility  for record retention. Notice of such transfer shall be 
documented in writing and provided to the Sponsor.
10.9Financial Disclosure
The investigator and all sub-investigators will provide HGS sufficient and accurate 
information on financial interests (proprietary  or equity interests, payments exclusive of 
clinical trial costs) to allow complete disclosure to regulatory  authorities. The investigator 
shall promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the 
investigation and for a period of 1 y ear following study  completion.
10.10Publication Policy
This study is being conducted as part of a multi-center clinical study. Data from all sites 
participating in the multi-center clinical study will be pooled and analyzed. The investigator 
acknowledges that an independent, joint publication is anticipated to be authored by the 
investigators of the multi-center study and Sponsor’s representatives. Neither institution nor 
principal investigator shall independentl y publish orpresent the results of the study prior to 
the publication of the multi-center study publication. The investigator agrees that the Sponsor
will be the coordinator and arbitrator of all multi-center study publications. For multi-center 
trials, no investigat or will be authorized to publish study results from an individual center 
until the earlier of the multi-center trial results are published or 12 months after the end or 
termination of the multi- center trial at all sites.
The investigator shall submit a copy of any proposed publication, manuscript, abstract, 
presentation or other document with respect to this study to the Sponsorfor review and 
comment at least 60 days prior to its submission for publication or presentation. No 
publication or presentation with respect to the study shall be made unless and until all of the

Sponsor’s comments on the proposed publication or presentation have been considered and 
any information determined by Sponsorto be confidential information has been removed. If 
requested inwriting by the Sponsor, the investigator shall withhold material from submission 
for publication or presentation for an additional 60 days to allow for the filing of a patent 
application or the taking of other measures to establish and preserve the Sponsor’s proprietary  
rights.
10.11Study or Study Site Termination
If HGS, the investigator, IRB/IEC, or a regulatory  authority discoversconditions arising 
during the study  that indicate that the study  should be halted or that the study  center should be 
terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between HGS and the 
investigator. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
•The discovery  of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study.
•A decision on the part of HGS to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the product for WG or MPA.
The study  site may warrant termination under the following conditions:
•Failure of the investigato r to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate.
•Failure of the investigator to comply  with pertinent regulatory  authority regulations.
•Submission of knowingly  false information from the research facility  to HGS, study  
monitor, or the regulatory authority.
•Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

Appendix 9 Pharmacogenetic Research
Background
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study of variability  in drug response due to hereditary  factors 
in different populations. There is increasing evidence that an individual's genetic composition 
(ie,genotype) may impact pharmacokinetics, pharmacod ynamics (relationship between 
concentration s and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) and/or 
clinical outcome (in terms of efficacy  and/or safety  and tolerability ).
A key component to successful PGx research is the collection of samples during the conduct 
of clinical studies.  
Research Rationale
Systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood vessels 
with a variety of etiologies but little is knownregarding the genetic contribution to risk for 
developing different forms of vascu litis.  Recent gene studies in vasculitis are identify ing both 
common polymorphisms associated with other autoimmune but also completely  different 
associations (Monachand Merkel, 2010) .
There is growing evidence fora genetic contribution to the risk of developing different forms 
of vasculitis (Monachand Merkel,2010) for example the association of alpha 1-antitrypsin 
deficiency  in WG. 
Blood samples for pharmacogenetics will be drawn as described in Section 9.Insights into the 
genetic pathways underlying AAVmay help identify subgroups of patients that may have 
additional benefit from therapies from specific therapies. Fc Receptor polymorphism analysis 
may further define the interaction between underlying genetic heterogeneity  and the 
therapeutic endpoints utilized in this trial.  
Collection of whole blood samples may enable PGx analyses to be conducted if there are any 
unexplained or unexpected results. 
If at any time it appears there is potential variability  in response in this clinical study or in a 
series of clinical studies with belimumab that may be attributable to genetic variations of 
subjects, the following objectives may  be investigated: 
•Relationship between genetic variants and the pharmacokinetics of belimumab.
•Relationship between genetic variants and safet y and/or tolerability  of belimumab.
•Relationship between genetic variants and efficacy of belimumab.Amend 02

Study Population
Any subject who has given informed consent to participate in the clinical study, has met all 
the entry criteria for the clinical study, and receives belimumab may take part in the PGx 
research.  
Subject participation in the PGx research is voluntary  and refusal to participate will not 
indicate withdrawal from the clinicalstudy. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or 
loss of benefits to which the subject would otherwise be entitled.
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate i n the PGx research may  still participate in the clinical 
study. PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken for PGx 
research.
Study Assessments and Procedures
In addition to any  blood samples drawn for the clinical study , a whole b lood sample (~10 mL) 
will be collected for the PGx research using a DNA tube. The PGx sample is labeled (or 
coded) with a study specific number that can be traced or linked back to the subject by the 
investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or 
social security number). The blood sample will be taken on a single occasion unless a 
duplicate sample is required due to inability to utilize the original sample. The blood samples 
will be drawn on Day 0 (baseline) visit provided informed consent for PGx research has been 
obtained from the subject, but may be taken at any time while the subject is participating in 
the clinical study . 
If deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted from the blood sample, the DNA may be 
subjected to sample quality control analysis. This analysis will involve the genotyping of 
several genetic markers to confirm the integrity of individual samples. If inconsistencies are 
noted in the anal ysis, then those samples may  be destroy ed. 
The need to conduct PGx analysis may be identified after a study (or set of studies) of 
belimumab has been completed and the study data reviewed. In some cases, the samples may 
not be studied ie, no questions are raised about how people respond to belimumab. 
Samples will be stored securely and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study or the sponsor may destroy the samples sooner. The sponsor or those 
working with the sponsor (for example, other researchers) will use samples collected fr om the 
study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the subject informed consent form.
Subjects may  request their sample to be destroy ed at any time.

Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in PGx research and has a sample taken for PGx 
research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than lost to follow-up, the 
subject will be given the following options:
1.The sample is retained for PGx research.
2.Any PGx sample is destroy ed.
If a subject withdraws consent from the PGx research or requests sample destruction for any 
reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample 
destruction within the timeframe specified by the sponsor and maintain the documentation in 
the sitestudy records. In either case, the sponsor will only use study information 
collected/generated up to that point.
Screen and Baseline Failures
If a blood sample for PGx research has been collected and it is determined that the subject 
does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the clinical study, then the investigator 
must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the 
timeframe specified b y the sponsor and maintain the documentation in the site study  records.
Pharmacogenetics Analyses
Specific sections of DNA may be selected from areas of the genome (ie, candidate genes)
known to encode the drug target, drug metabolizing enzymes, areas associated with 
mechanisms underlying adverse events, and those linked to studydisease and, thus, linked to 
drug response. 
Generally , two approaches will be utilized to explore genetic variation in drug response.
The candidate genes that may  be selected and investigated in this study  are the following: 
•HLA alleles
•Alpha-1 anti-trypsin (A1AT)
•Fc receptors
•Cytokines, immune receptors and chemokines related to immune cell function
In addition, continuing research may identify other enzymes, transporters, proteins, or 
receptors that may be involved in response to belimumab. The genes that may code for these 
proteins may  also be studi ed.
By evaluating large numbers of poly morphic markers (eg, single nucleotide pol ymorphisms or 
SNPs) throughout the genome, sets of markers may be identified that correspond to 
differential drug response. T hese will include:

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Testing
The genotypic frequencies of each polymorphism will be evaluated for conformity  to 
those expected under normal conditions by employing Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium 
testing.
Comparison of Demographic and B aseline Characteristics by Genotype
Differences in baseline clinical characteristics and potential contributing covariates may 
be summarized and compared among genoty pe (or haploty pe) subgroups.
Evaluation of Genotypic Effects
Analyses may be carried out to evaluate the degree of association between subject 
genotype (orhaplotype) and selected parameters (eg, pharmacokinetics, SLE disease 
activity and safety). Where such genotypic tests are inappropriate (eg, where the number 
of marker genotypes is too large and/or the frequency  of individual genotypes too small), 
allelic tests may  be conducted. Allelic tests evaluate whether the frequency  of each marker 
allele is the same in responders and non -responders.
Evaluation of Treatment by Genotype and Gene- Gene Interaction
In addition to evaluating the main effects of the genotypes (haplotypes or alleles) on the 
selected parameters, the possibility  of a treatment group by genotype (haplotype or allele) 
interaction will also be explored. If appropriate, the joint effects of multiple markers 
(gene-gene interactions) may  also be evaluated.
Linkage Disequilibrium
For pairs of polymorphisms, the degree to which alleles from the 2 sites are correlated 
(linkage disequilibrium) may also be evaluated. If the genotypes at 2 polymorphic sites 
within a gene are shown to be statistically  associated with a response to investigational 
product, the degree of linkage disequilibrium will aid interpretation in that it will indicate 
the extent to which the 2 sites are exerting independe nt effects.
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity
Adjustment to observed p- values may be made to limit erroneous conclusions due to 
multiple tests when multiple markers are evaluated (especiall y in the case of a genome 
scan for association). 
Power and Sam ple Size Considerations
The ability to detect differential drug response among genotypes at a polymorphic site 
depends on the total number of subjects genotyped and the frequency  distribution of the 
different genotypes. Consequently , genotyping analyses are plausible for those 
polymorphic sites where the number of subjects comprising the genotypic groups is 
sufficiently  large; however, these frequencies will not be known until sufficient samples 
have been collected and genot yping is complete.

Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s PGx Data
The sponsor may summarize the cumulative PGx research results in the clinical study report. 
In general, the sponsor does not inform the investigator, subject or anyone else (eg, family 
members, studyinvestigators, primary care physicians, insurers, or employers) of the PGx 
research results because the information generated from PGx studies is preliminary  in nature, 
and the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined at such an early 
stage of research, under any  circumstance unless required by  law.

Appendix 12 Protocol A ddendum –Benefit and Risk A ssessment
Disease Background
The systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis; also known as granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti- neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) ( Jennetteand 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to lifethreatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. 
Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining patterns in 
immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear (P-ANCA). It is 
now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 3 (PR3), and P-
ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which are enzymes that 
are abundant in the granules of neutrophils ( Jennetteand Falk, 1997; Merkelet al, 1997). 
Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO autoantibodies are 
more common in MPA and CSS. Anti -PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality compared to anti-MPO. The most widely used classification criteria for 
diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are those published by the American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavittet al, 1990 and Masiet al, 1990, 
respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) forMPA 
(Jennetteet al, 1994). Of note, none of these diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement 
of ANCA.
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classification criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Wattset al, 2007). 
In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiological studies are confounded by its original 
inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilizing the ACR or CHCC criteria, 
prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and 0.4-
1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by some margin 
(Koldingsnes et al, 2008). AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with peak age of onset in 
those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatsakiet al, 2010), with other small vessel vasculitides being the 
major concern in childhood (Broganet al, 2010).Current therapy is usually determined by 
severity of the disease, with more severe forms warranting more aggressive approaches. These 
usually involve an initialremission induction regimen of high dose corticosteroid 
administered with either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX) followed by a 
remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stoneet al, 2010; Boschet al, 2007; 
Jayneet al, 2003). Minor manifestations are usually treated with low dose corticosteroid 
administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate (Belmont, 2006). Even with recent Amend 02

treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains unacceptabl y 
high (Droogeret al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS)was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmaniet al, 1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG 
(Stoneet al, 2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 ( Mukhtyaret al, 2009). In its current form it is a list of 
56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A weighted numerical score 
is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each manifestation. The items are grouped 
by organ systems, and each organ system has a maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the 
relative importance of the organ system (Mukhtyaret al, 2009). The tool also makes a 
distinction between new or worsening disease and persistent disease with new or worsening 
attracting higher scores.
IV Belimumab
Over 2,000 individuals with SL E have been treated with beli mumab in clinical studies. In two 
global Phase 3 studies, belimumab 10 mg/kg met the primary efficacy endpoint (SRI at 
Week52). Evidence of other possible benefits in these trials included reductions in risk of 
severe flare and corticosteroid use, and improvements in patient reported quality of life and 
fatigue. Serological activity was reduced as measured by reductions in autoantibodies and 
normalization of hypergammaglobulinemia and complement levels. B cells, including 
autoreactive B cells, were also re duced, but not severely  depleted, consistent with what would 
be expected from inhibition of BLyS (reference belimumab IB, Section 5.3.1). These results 
supported the approval of belimumab in the EU, US, Canada and other countries.
In the United States beli mumab is approved for the following indication:
BENLYSTA®  (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, 
autoantibody -positive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard 
therapy.
Limitations of Use: The efficacy of BENLYSTA has not been evaluated in patients with 
severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. BENLYSTA 
has not been studied in combination with other biologics or intravenous 
cyclophosphamide. Use of BENLYSTA is not re commended in these situations.
In the EU, the approved indication focuses on patients with high disease activity (where 
belimumab offered the greatest benefit):
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, 
autoantibodypositive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease 
activity (e.g positive anti -dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.
The EU SPC also includes special warnings and precautions for use similar to the US 
labeling, including that belim umab has not been studied in and is thus not recommended in 
2015N245521_00

patients with severe active central nervous system lupus or severe active lupus nephritis. In 
addition, caution should be exercised if belimumab is co-administered with other B cell 
targeted therapy or cyclophosphamide. Reference Section 4.4 of the SPC for the complete list 
of specials warnings and precautions.
Treatment with belimumab plus standard therapy was generally well tolerated, with rates of 
AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinu ation, and serious/severe infections 
generally comparable to the rates observed in the placebo plus standard therapy group. The 
most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 3% of patients receiving 10 mg/kg 
belimumab IV in clinical trials (and at a ≥ 1% greater rate than placebo) were nausea, 
diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity , depression, 
migraine, pharyngitis, cystitis, leukopenia, and gastroenteritis viral. In clinical trials, 
hypersensitivity  and infusion reactions were observed more frequently with belimumab, with 
anaphylaxis observed in ≤ 1% of subjects. Data from the post-marketing setting indicate that 
hypersensitivity  reactions may be serious or result in death, that the onset of such reactions 
may be delayed, and that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant 
hypersensitivity  may be at increased risk. In addition, it is also known from clinical trials and 
the post-marketing setting that the vast majority of hypersensitivity reactions occur with the 
1stor 2ndinfusion. The product labeling, belimumab IB, protocol, and informed consent forms 
have been updated to include this new information, as applicable.
Other risks that may be associated with belimumab based on its mechanism of action include 
serious infections and malignancy , although no increases in the rates of serious infections or 
malignancies have been observed. Psychiatric events including depression and suicide were 
observed more frequently  with belimumab than with placebo, although it is unknown if 
belimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these events. Finally, mortality 
rates in the controlled clinical trials were low, although numerically  higher in the belimumab 
groups (0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectively ). Causes of death 
were as expected in an SLE population with active disease receiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, 
cardiovascular disease , and suicide.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in patients with SLE receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherap y, including belimumab. Although the benefit-risk profile for belimumab 
remains unchanged following these events, the Sponsor considers that knowledge of these 
cases is important and has updated the clinical investigator’s brochure (IB) for belimumab and 
revised the informed consent form (ICF) to communica te that development of PML is a 
potential risk.  
Experience from open-label, long-term continuation trials of belimumab in SLE patients 
suggests prolonged treatment with belimumab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase in the incidenc e of AEs or SAEs over time, including important events such 
as infections and malignancies. Long-term belimumab treatment appears to provide sustained 
improvement in SL E disease activity  and reduction of flares.Amend 03

Belimumab in A NCA-Associated Vasculitis
Study Overview and Patient Population
Belimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg in combination with standard SLE therapy demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically meaningful reduction in SLE disease activity versus 
placebo plus standard SLE therapy  at Week52 in two Phase 3 clinical studies in subjects with 
active, autoantibod y-positive SL E.
Studies in subjects with WG and MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2 diseases ranging from 15% at 18 
months (Jayneet al, 2003) to 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al, 2010) on azathioprine –the most 
effective of current therapies ( Jayneet al, 2003; Pagnouxet al, 2008; Hiemstra et al, 2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV. Further supporting a role for B cells is the fact that activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popaet al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, arefound in subjects with 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagaiet al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010). Together, these 
provide a strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels. Therefore, 
for the proposed study, subjects are required to have documented evidence of anti-PR3 or 
anti-MPO autoantibodies prior to randomization, as this population is considered the most 
likely to benefit from treatment with a B cell modulating agent like belimumab. This is 
consistent with the Phase 3 SLE results for belimumab where the subjects who benefitted 
from treatment were those who were antinuclear antibody (ANA/anti -dsDNA) autoantibody 
positive at baseline.
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20, recentl y showed success in inducing remission in AAV (Stoneet al, 2010) and 
was granted approval in the US for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease. Finally , limited data from the small (n = 111) subset of subjects in the Phase 3 
trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their SLE (as assessed by the SELENA 
SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus standard of care treatment arms 
had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 compared with subjects receiving 
placebo plus standard of care. Specificall y, 19/36 (52.8%) and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in 
the belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose groups, respectively, had resolution of vasculitic 
activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of placebo subjects. Taken together, these 
data support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
The safety of the proposed study is supported by data from the Phase 2 and 3 trials in SLE in 
which subjects who were receiving belimumab in combination with significant background 
therapies, including steroids and immunosuppressants, had an adverse event profile similar to 
that of subjects receiving placebo plus standard therapies.

This is a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in 
subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopi c polyangiitis (MPA) 
following a standard induction regimen. Subjects enrolled into the study must have a clinical 
diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the Chapel Hill criteria and must have had an initial or 
relapsing episode of moderate to severely activeWG or MPA that was treated with 
corticosteroids and either CYC or RTX in the 6 months leading up to randomization. Subjects 
treated with 1 of the following induction regimens will be eligible for participation in the 
study:
•A single course of RTX administ ered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
interval, plus HDCS OR
•CYC 2 mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
•CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, leukopenia,or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, therecommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Approximately  100 subjects with ANCA-vasculitis who are between 6 and 26 weeks from 
starting induction therapy, who achieve a BVAS v.3 score of 0 (ie, are in remission), and are 
receiving ≤10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14 
days apart will be enrolled into the study. Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) 
administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour. Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be 
administered at Day 0, 14, and every 28 days thereafter. Randomization will be performed on 
Day 0. 
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be trea ted with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . For the maintenance of remission, azathioprine may be 
initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration of induction therapy. 
Azathioprine must not be initiated any later than Day 0. For subjects previously  identified as Amend 03

being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced 
activity of thiopurine methy ltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate to be 
used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the outset. 
Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, 
characterized bysevere nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be 
permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to 
experience the toxicities described above, a switch to methotrexate at a target dose of 25 
mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. As 
azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that 
many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walterset al, 2010). 
Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  
analysis.
The randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), 
diseasestage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (IV 
CYC vs. oral CYC vs. RTX). It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patients would be 
newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be 
capped if they exceed this proportion. Refer to Section 4 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for a 
complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The primary efficacy endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse, defined as at least 
1major BVA S item or a minimum total BVAS score of 6 or receipt of prohibited medications 
according to the protocol. Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA 
until the results from the primary efficacy analysis are available or until they experience a 
flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy endpoint. The database will be locked and 
the primary analysis will be performed when 12 months have elapsed after the last subject is 
randomized. Subjects who discontinue study  agent prior to relap se/flare are to be followed per 
the double blind visit schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment 
phase (whichever is earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year 
an attempt will be made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of study 
agent.
In consultation with the investigating physician, subjects participating in the double-blind 
period of the trial will have the option to continue to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6 -
month open label extension phase. The criteria for entry into the extension phase of the study 
are: (1) the safety profile of belimumab is considered to be acceptable, based on ongoing 
IDMC data reviews of the safety data, and other relevant safety data sources;(2) the risk-
benefit profile for continuing treatment with belimumab must be favorable in the opinion of 
the investigator; (3) the subject will have completed the double-blind treatment period of the 
trial without having relapsed (as defined in the primary endpoint); (4) a favorable opinion has 
been obtained from the local ethics committee or IRB with respect to continuation of 
belimumab treatment. Subjects who enter the open-label extension phase will receive 
belimumab for up to an additional 6 monthsand this will be supplied by  the sponsor. Subjects 
participating in the open -label extension will continue to be monitored for efficacy  and safet y.Amend 04

Following completion of the study and, where applicable, completion of the 6-month open-
label extension phase, subjects will not receive any additional treatment supplied by the 
sponsor.The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the 
post-study care of the subjec t’s medical condition .
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately  4 weeks after their last dose of study 
agent as well as a follow -up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of study  agent. 
Dose and Schedule
Investigational Study Agent (Belimumab or Placebo)
The dose and schedule of belimumab proposed for use in the ANCA-associated vasculitis 
study is the same dosage (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 4 weeks thereafter) 
and route of administration (IV) as that approved for marketing. The belimumab BDS and 
FDP that will be used for this study  is the same as that approved for marketing.
In the Phase 3 IV SLE studies, several clinical measures of improvement including the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Week 52 (SRI), SELENA SLEDAI reductions, severe flare risk 
reduction, and complement normalization generally favored the 10 mg/kg dose. Trends 
toward clinically significant steroid reduction were present for both doses. Additionally , there 
appeared to be a greater dose response in subjects with high disease and serological activity. 
Therewas no apparent dose-response in the safety profile of belimumab with both doses 
being generally well-tolerated. These data supported the selection of 10 mg/kg belimumab as 
the marketed dose in general SLE, and also support its continued evaluation in combination 
with standard maintenance therapies in patients with WG or MPA.
The use of placebo in this trial is considered appropriate and does not put placebo patients at 
undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo group and the belimumab group will 
receive standard of care maintenance therapies for vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) 
and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate rescue therapy in accordance with standard 
clinical practice as described above.
Induction and Maintenance Re gimens for ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
•A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
•A single course of rituxima b comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by  a two-week 
interval, plus HDCS OR

•CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimensare provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity, renal insufficiency, leukopenia,or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach 
≤ 10mg/day.As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous steroid 
pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be receiving more 
than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gormanet al, 2003, 
Smithet al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 ( Stoneet al, 2010), demonstrated non-
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX dosing regimen of 4 infusions of 375 mg/m2each 
given 1 week apart reflects the dosing regimen that is approved b y the FDA for this indication.
An alternative RTX induction regimen (2 infusions of 1 gram each administered 2 weeks 
apart) is also offered in the protocol. Although the latter regimen is not licensed as an 
induction therapy for ANCA-vasculitis, it is very widely used in clinical practice and clinical 
evidence suggest s that there is no difference between the two dosing regimens in terms of 
duration of B -cell depletion or therapeutic efficacy efficacy  (Joneset al,2009).
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauciand Wolff, 1973; Fauciet al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayneet al, 2003) showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was ma intained using continued cyclophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated Amend 03

with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14 days
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving ≤10 mg/day of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
between 6 and26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, subject 
randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, subjects will be 
randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + placebo or AZA (2 
mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol will be stratified by 
induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. For the maintenance of remission, 
azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration of 
induction therapy and no later than Day 0. For subjects previously identified as being 
intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced activity 
of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate to be used as 
an alternative to azathio prine for the maintenance of remission from the outset. Subjects naive 
to azathioprine and who experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or 
thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestinal hypersensitivity 
reaction characterized by severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine 
will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day. If the subject continues to 
experience toxicities, a switch to methotrexate at doses of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated 
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walterset al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is 
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs 
physicians to follow the appropriate local prescribing information for azathioprine or 
methotrexat e (as applicable) prior to and during treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society ( EUVAS)and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC),and consensus was reached that these 
regimens are appropriate for this international trial.

Safety Considerations
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analyzed (after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee). The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Belimumab has not y et been studied following use of 
IV cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX); there is limited experience with the 
combination of belimumab and oral CYC. As an added safety precaution, initial 
randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction 
and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC reviews will occur after the first 20 subjects per 
induction regimen (RTX or I V/oral CYC) have been randomized and have had a Week 8 visit. 
Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, 
safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding 
whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be applied for the first 
20subjects randomized following induction with CYC. The DMC will review the data 
approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction regimens. At all times the 
patients, study sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation. Investigators and 
IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting.
The DMC will be notified of:
•all unexpected causall y-related SAEs that are life -threatening or result in death;
•other unexpected causally -related SAEs;
•all reports of serious infections and opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship to 
study agent; and
•subjects experiencing IgG < 250 mg/dL; 
within protocol-specified timeframes. Based on these data, an ad hoc DMC meeting may be 
called at any time (see Section 8.3 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for additional detail 
regarding the DMC).
Based on the large body of safety data from SLE patients treated with belimumab and/or the 
mechanism of action of belimumab as a B cell immunosuppressant, anticipated potent ial risks 
of belimumab treatment in vasculitis patents include serious infusion and hypersensitivity  
reactions, infections, depression-related events, and malignancy . These risks are briefly 
reviewed here and are detailed more fully in the belimumab Investigator’s Brochure. Both 
investigators and subjects will be appropriately  informed regarding these risks. It is noted that 
because of the older patient population affected by this disease, the average age of subjects 
anticipated to participate in this studywill be older than the average age of the SLE 
population studied to date (mean age of ~53 years at the time of diagnosis in vasculitis ( Stone
et al, 2010) compared with an average age of ~38 years in controlled Phase 3 studies of 
belimumab in SLE). As such, patients with vasculitis may be at a greater risk for infection 
than the SLE patients; however, the increased monitoring for infections by both the DMC 
(described above) and recommended to investigators (see below) will help to ensure subject 
safety through timely detection, treatment and reporting of infections.

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
The protocol states that all subjects should be monitored closely for infection and increased 
vigilance for infection is recommended in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL, 
especially for prolonged periods; clinical judgment should be applied with respect to the 
appropriateness of continuing study therapy in these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be 
consulted before administering subsequent doses of study agent in subjects with IgGlevels 
<250 mg/dL. Study agent will be discontinued in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that 
are associated with a severe or serious infection. If a subject experiences a clinically 
significant, potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) AE that the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly  or probably  related to belimumab/placebo, then treatment with study  agent 
will be discontinued. The subject will be followed at regularly scheduled study visits as 
specified by the protocol through the end of the double-blind period and also until resolution 
of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).
In order to ensure subject safety with respect to infusion and hypersensitivity  reactions, the 
protocol excludes patients with known history of allergic reactions to humanor murine 
proteins or monoclonal antibodies. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine 
whether premedication diminishes the frequency  or severity of hypersensitivity  reactions to 
belimumab. The protocol recommends that based on clinical judgment, premedication 
including an antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the 
infusion. Antihistamine H2-receptor antagonists (eg, ranitidine) are also permitted. 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to manage 
infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the 
subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigators/site personnel should be aware of the risk 
of hypersensitivity  reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor subjects 
closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placebo administration must be 
discontinued immediately  and the appropriate medical therapy administered. Per protocol, 
subjects are to remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 
2infusions in the double-blind treatment phase. Should symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  
occur, an extended period of monitoring may  be appropriate, based on clinical judgment. This 
may include, but is not limited to, monitoring vital signs and observing for any untoward 
reactions. Beyond the first 2 infusions, subjects should be monitored during and for an 
appropriate period of time after infusion according to study sites’ guidelines or standard 
operating procedure for IV infusions. Subjects should be made aware of the potential risk, the 
signs and symptoms of such reactions, and the importance of immediately  seeking medical 
attention.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in patients with SL E receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherap y, including belimumab. Therefore, a diagnosis of PML  should be considered 
in any subject presenting with new -onset or deteri orating neurological signs and sy mptoms. 
The protocol requires that subjects should be referred to a neurologist or other appropriate 
specialist for evaluation. If PML  is confirmed, study  agent should be discontinued and 
consideration should be given to stopping immunosuppressant therapy . If PML is suspected, 
this should be immediately  reported to the Medical Monitor . The appropriateness of 
continuing study  agent, while the case is being assessed, should be discussed.Amend 03

Clinical Protocol HGS1006 -C1100Amend 04 (Local 01 Belgium) Belimumab
The protocol recommends that subjects with persistent or worsening disease should receive 
appropriate rescue therapy  in accordance with standard clinical practice, but if exceeding what 
is allowed per protocol, treatment with study agent (ie, belimumab or placebo) will be 
discontinued and the subject will be considered as having relapsed for the primary analysis. 
The list of prohibited medications that results in the subjects being considered as relapsed for 
the primary endpoint (Protocol Section 5.5.2.1), was developed because the need for theuse 
of these agents (eg, RTX or CYC) is indicative of treatment failure (ie, disease relapse).
Moreover, concomitant use of such medications (eg, high-dose steroids) can be associated 
both with potent disease -modifying activity  and/or significant toxicity that may introduce bias 
and confound interpretation of results. As such, no subject will be denied appropriate medical 
care for their condition due to their participation in this clinical study .
In addition, the Sponsor notes that although this is a placebo controlled trial, the sponsor does 
not consider that placebo patients are at undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo 
group and the belimumab group will receive standard of care maintenance therapies for 
vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate 
rescue therap y in accordance with standard clinical practice as described above.
Risk:Benefit Conclusions
In summary, the proposed Phase 3 study is a superiority  study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of belimumab for the maintenance of disease remission in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic poly angiitis. The risk:benefit profile of 
10 mg/kg IV belimumab in patients with active, autoantibody -positive SLE w as demonstrated 
to be positive in the two Phase 3 SLE studies, thereby supporting its approval in Canada, the 
US, and the EU. Belimumab has already been shown to be effective in treating patients with 
active, autoantibody -positive SL E, a B cell mediated au toimmune disease. Like SL E, WG and 
MPA are also B cell mediated autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies (in this case, 
against neutrophil components), are considered to be pathogenic ( Popaet al, 1999). In each of 
these diseases, the general purpose of the therapy is similar –reducing disease activity by 
down regulating B cells (including autoreactive B cells) and reducing the level autoantibodies 
produced by those autoreactive B cell clones. Down regulating B cell numbers may also 
reduce inflammatory  processes because of the role of B cells in antigen presentation. A 
limited amount of data from the IV Phase 3 studies suggests that belimumab may reduce 
vasculitic sy mptoms.
There are potential risks associated with belimumab treatment including serious infusion and 
hypersensitivity  reactions, infections, depression- related events, and malignancy ; however, in 
view of the serious and potentially  life threatening nature of disease flares in WG and MPA, it 
is believed that the overall risk:benefit analysis for belimumab in the maintenance of 
remission in WG and MPA is favorable, especially  in view of the nature of the trial as a 
superiority  trial over a current standard of care regimen.

Summary of Modifications
Protocol Amendment 04 With Local Amendment01 for Belgium , 06 July2015
Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination with 
Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.For Belgium, t he protocol (Amendment 04) has been modified at the request of the 
coordinating investigato r in Leuven and the ethics committee to re-instatea 6-month open 
label extension phase to the study  in order to maintain consistency  with earlier versions of 
the protocol and ‘fairness’ to patients.
2. It should be noted that all previous versions of the pr otocol (including Amendments 01, 02 
and 03) had incorporated a 6 -month open label extension phase , which would allow 
participating subjects, who had completed the double-blind phase of the trial, the 
opportunity to subsequently  receive open- label belimumab , supplied by  the sponsor, for a 
further 6 months.
Although the 6 -month open -label extension phase had previousl y been removed from the 
trial as part of a global protocol amendment 04 [an amendment which fundamentally  
changed the status of the trial from P hase 3 to ‘exploratory ’], ethical objection s were
subsequently raised in Belgium , because subjectscurrently enrolled onto the trial had 
previously  been informed that there would be an opportunity to receive a 6 -month 
extended supply  of belimumab in a 6- month open-label phase. It was felt that the change 
to the protocol was unfair to patients in Belgium where treatment options for ANCA -
vasculitis are considered to be limited.
3.Having considered the ethical objections raised in Belgium, the sponsor agrees to re-
instate the 6-month open- label phase of the stud yfor this country .The conditions for
entry into the open -label phase of the stud y are:(i) the safety profile of belimumab is
considered to be acceptable, based on ongoing IDMC reviews and other releva nt safety
data sources, (ii) the risk -benefit profile for continuing treatment with belimumab is 
considered to be favo rable in the opinion of the investigating ph ysician, (iii) the subject 
will have completed the double-blind treatment phase without having a disease relapse, 
and (iv) a favorable opinion has been obtained from the local ethics committee in Belgium 
with respect to extended belimumab treatment for 6 months.
At the end of the 6 -months open label extension phase, the sponsor will no longer suppl y 
belimumab toBelgiuminvestigators . The investigator swill then be responsible for 
ensuring that consideration has been given to the post- study care of the patient’s 
condition.
4. To reflect these changes, Protocol A mendment 04 has been amended locally for Belgium. 
The changes to the various sections are detailed below and include a Time and Events 
Table (Table 6.3) which details the schedule for t he various safet y and efficacy 
assessments .

double-blind period. Day 0 is the first visit in the extension phase of the trial and 
represents the first belimumab administration for placebo subjects. Subjects should 
remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 infusions.  
Should symptoms of acute hypersensitivity occur, an extended period of monitoring may 
be appropriate, based on clinical judgment.
All subjects participating in the open-label extension will continue to be monitored for 
efficacy and safety as per the study calendar (see Table6-3). 
During the 6-month open-label extension, the investigator may adjust concurrent 
medications (add, eliminate, change dose level/frequency) as clinically appropriate. 
Prohibited medications during this phase are live vaccines, biological therapies and 
other investigational agents. 
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately 4weeks after their last dose of 
study agent as well as a follow -up visit approximately 8 weeks after the last dose of study 
agent. Thesevisits apply to subjects who have completed as well as those who have 
withdrawn early from the open -label extension.
Following completion of the 6 -month open -label extension phase, subjects will not 
receive any additional treatment supplied by the sponsor. The investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post -study care of the subject’s 
medical condition.

Belimumab in ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Study Overview and Patient Population
Added:
In consultation with the investigating physician, subjects participating in the double-
blind period of the trial will have the option to continue to receive treatment with 
belimumab in a 6-month open label extension phase. The criteria for entry into the 
extension phase of the study are: (1) the safety profile of belimumab is considered to be 
acceptable, based on ongoing IDMC data reviews of the safety data, and other relevant 
safety data sources; (2) the risk -benefit profile for continuing treatm ent with belimumab

Summary of Modifications
must be favorable in the opinion of the investigator; (3) the subject will have completed 
the double-blind treatment period of the trial without having relapsed (as defined in the 
primary endpoint); (4) a favorable opinion has been obtained from the local ethics 
committee or IRB with respect to continuation of belimumab treatment. Subjects who 
enter the open-label extension phase will receive belimumab for up to an additional 
6months and this will be supplied by the sponsor. Subjects participating in the open-
label extension will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety.
Following completion of the study and, where applicable, completion of the 6-month 
open-label extension phase, subjects will not receive any additional treatment supplied 
by the sponsor. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been 
given to the post- study care of the subject’s medical condition.

Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The proposed modifications to the protocol reflect a change by  the sponsor to the strategic 
objectives for the evaluation of belimumab in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). It is 
proposed that the trial should be changed from a Phase 3 study to allow for an exploratory  
evaluation of belimumab in AAV only. There is no longer the intention to seek alicensed 
indication for belimumab as an adjunctive maintenance therapy in AAV on the basis of 
the data emerging from this study. The term “Phase 3” has been removed from the study 
title.
Enrolment of subjects onto the current trial has progressed at a muc h slower than expected 
rate. Based on current enrolment projections, data outputs from the current trial would 
unlikely be available for review until mid -2018.
Having reviewed the timing of the study in the context of the evolving therapy area for 
ANCA-associated vasculitis, the sponsor feels that the current format and design of the 
BREVAS trial, if driven to completion as a Phase 3 investigation, would no longer 
provide significant and timely new information for the vasculitis community . On the basis 
of the BREVAS trial data alone, even in the event of a successful outcome, it is not felt 
that belimumab can be sufficientl y well differentiated as a concomitant therapy for 
remission maintenance in AAV to fulfill a significant unmet need for patients where other 
therapeutic options are now available (e.g., rituximab). 
As such, GSK is proposing to modify  the strategic objective of the trial such that it will be 
conducted as an exploratory  study, in which global enrolment would be restricted to 
approximately  100 patients (compared to the original target of approximately  300). It is 
planned that the data will be published in descriptive format with exploratory  analyses on 
efficacy endpoints undertaken as appropriate. It is expected that the safety data emerging 
from the smaller cohort of patients in BREVAS will contribute to our understanding of 
belimumab safet y. 
2.The study design and schedule has been modified throughout the protocol to clarify that 
the study will no longer be driven by the requirement to achieve at least 66 relapse events. 
The study  will complete and the primary  analysis will be undertaken once 12 months have 
elapsed following enrolment of the last subject.
3.The protocol has been modified throughout such that subjects completing the study  will no 
longer have the option to participate in a 6-month open-label extension following 
completion of the double -blind treatment phase. The section entitled “open label extension 
phase” (6.4) and the related time and events table (Table 6 -3) has been removed.

Summary of Modifications
4.The study design schematics have been modified in the protocol by removal of the 
expected number of enrolled subjects; ‘N=300-400’ has been removed from the 
schematic.
5.In the statistical sections of the protocol, the sample size considerations have been 
modified to reflect the fact that approximately  100 patients will be recruited. The sample 
size is based largely on the feasibility  of recruitment within a reasonable time-frame. 
Sample size calculations based on expected relapse rates have been removed from the 
protocol. The minimum detectable effect for a sample size of N=100 subjects has been 
determined. 
For the purposes of reporting the data, analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will 
be exploratory  in nature. Nominal ‘p’ values may be reported and considered descriptive. 
Where appropriate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed.
The section on “Subgroup analyses” (8.5.2.1) has been removed as this is no longer 
considered relevant in the context of the smaller expected total sample size of 
approximately  100 subjects.
In the section “Primary Efficacy Analysis” (8.5.2), we have clarified how stratification 
terms may be handled in the analysis if there are fewer than 5 events (relapses) in any of 
the stratification levels.
6.In the section “Dose, route of administration and schedule”, we have clarified that the 
administration of belimumab/placebo should be over approximately  one hour, but not less 
than one hour for reasons of safet y.
7.The section on liver chemistry  stopping and follow-up criteria, which describes how 
patient care should be managed if a liver event occurs during the study, has been updated 
with the most recent GSK-specified protocol for managing these events. The section also 
defines the circumstances and criteria that may allow a study treatment restart following a 
liver event. The section also includes the criteria for more intensive monitoring with 
continued therapy following a liver event. Accompany ing figures have been placed in 
Appendix 13.
8.The adverse event reporting section (Section 7) has been modified throughout for 
consistency  with AE, SAE or PSE data collection procedures and forms.
9.The text on progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML) has been updated to 
provide further guidance on the management of su spected cases.
10.The section “Reporting a pregnancy ” has been modified to provide scope for following up 
the outcomes of a pregnancy  (including premature termination) as well as the status of 
mother and child.
11. The reference list has been updated in the proto col.
13. Appendix 12 (Benefit-Risk assessment) has been updated to reflect the change in study 
status to an exploratory trial and to reflect the changes in the main protocol as outlined 
above.

Sample Size Considerations , Synopsis and Section 8.4, Sample Size Rationale
Deleted:
The relapse rate in the study is anticipated to be approximately  20% in the control group. 
However, there is some uncertainty  around this relapse event rate which could be 30% or 
higher. This study is designed to target at least 66 subjects experiencing a relapse (as defined 
in the primary endpoint), which will provide 85% power to detect a reduction in relapse rates 
of 20 vs. 10% (hazard ratio = 0.472). With this same hazard ratio and a 30% event rate, a 
study with 66 subjects experiencing a relapse will provide 85% power to detect a reduction in 
the relapse rate from 30% to 15.5%. A target of 300 to 400 subjects will be randomized to 
achieve the required number of events.
After approximately  300subjects have been randomized, the relapse rate in the overall 
population will be evaluated in a blinded manner internally  by HGS while the enrollment 
continues. If the relapse rate is consistent with the 20% control rate assumption, enrollment 
will continue to 400 subjects to ensure timely accrual of the 66 events. However, if there is 
evidence that the relapse rate is higher than 20% control rate assumption, enrollment may be 
stopped at approximately 300 subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed after 
at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse and at least 12 months have elapsed after the 
last subject is randomized.
Added:
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined 
based on the feasibility of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-
frame.The sample size was not based on statistical considerations and the analysis of

Summary of Modifications
primary and secondary endpoints will be exploratory in nature. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomization of the 
last subject.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebo 
group, a relapserate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically 
significant (p<0.05) in a study of 100 subjects (50 per arm). 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint , Synopsis

Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/fla re are to be followed per the double 
blind visit schedule for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end

The treatment groups include one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimum ab and a placebo 
arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section 5.5.3 ). 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. Once randomized, 
subjects will be dosed with study agent on Days 0, 14, and 28 and every 28days thereafter.

Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. The intent of this 
instruction is toprevent more rapid infusion of belimumab whic h may result in a higher 
incidence of infusion reactions. Infusion time need notbe exactly one hour as it is often 
difficult to so precisely adjust infusion times and there may be clinical reasons for 
infusions lasting longer than one hour. Therefore, theinstruction should be interpreted 
as infusion overat leastone hour. The target infusion time should still be approximately 
one hour assuming no other issues intervene. Once randomized, subjects will be dosed with

All subjects participating in the open-label extension will continue to be monitored for 
efficacy and safet y as per the study  calendar (see Table 6 -3). 
During the 6-month open-label extension, the investigator may adjustconcurrent medications 
(add, eliminate, change dose level/frequency ) as clinically  appropriate. Prohibited medications 
during this phase are live vaccines, biological therapies and other investigational agents. 
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately  4weeks after their last dose of study 
agent as well as a follow-up visit approximately 8 weeks after the last dose of study agent. 
These visits apply  to subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early  
from the open -label extension.

Symptomatic3ALT 3xULN associated wi th symptoms (new or worsen ing) believed to be related to liver 
injury or hypersensitivity
1) Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immedia tely 
available, discontinue study treatm ent for that subject if ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN. Additionally, if serum 
bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injur y. 
2) All events of ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR measured 
which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of 
hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.
3) New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).

6.5.4 Study Treatmen t Restart
Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a 
clear underlying cause (other than drug induced liver injury [DILI]) of the liver event (e.g. 
biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there 
should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity , and the study treatment 
should not be associated with HL A markers of liver injury .
Approval b y GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where :
Investigator requests consideration for study  treatment restart if liver chemistries have a 
clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver chemistries have 
improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T <3xUL N).
Restartrisk factors (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic hepatitis, 
possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study treatment has an HLA genetic

marker associated with liver injury  (e.g., lapatinib, abacavir, amoxicillin/clavulanate) are 
reviewed and excluded .
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart must 
be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury or death.  
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the study  
treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  chart.  
Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.
Subjects approved b y GSK Medical Governance for restarting stud y treatment must 
return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have 
been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol. 
If after study  treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  stopping 
criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment restart.

Section 7.1 Definitions
Change from :
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE): Any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study  agent but is not necessarily  caused 
by the study agent. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency  or severity) of 
preexisting conditions.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: An adverse event resulting in any of the following 
outcomes:
death
is life-threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life)
inpatient hospitalization *
prolongation of an exi sting hospitalization
persistent or significant disability/incapacit y
congenital anomal y/birth defect
is medically  important+

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 Amend 0 4(with Local Am01, 02 for France) Belimumab
Summary of Modifications
*An inpatient hospitalization is defined as an admission for any length of time. A 
hospitalization for administration of study  agent, for routine or planned clinical procedures, or 
for “social” reasons (not the result of any adverse change in the subject’s condition) should 
not be considered an adverse event and should not be reported as a serious adverse event. If 
the subject experiences any adverse change in condition during hospitalization, the condition 
must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event according to the above 
definitions. 
+Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedit ed reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above(eg, 
possible drug-induced liver injury). These should also usually be considered serious. (ICH 
guidelines, March 1995)
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT: An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational productor package insert/summary  of product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means the event has previously been observed with the study 
agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does not 
mean that the event is expected with the underly ing disease(s) or concomitant medications.
Change to:
ADVERSE EVENT
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition o f an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an

Summary of Modifications
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent.  This should be reported regardless of sequelae.
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgic al procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)
Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for t he 
subject’s condition
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: A serious adverse event is any untoward medical 
occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Islife-threatening
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospitalisation orprolongation of existing hospitalis ation
NOTE:  In general, hospital isation signifies that the subject has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or out- patient setting.  C omplications that occur during 
hospitalisation are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be con sidered serious.
Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE .
d.Results in disability/incapacity , or

Summary of Modifications
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s abil ity to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
e.Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definitio n.  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, o r development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
g.All events of possible drug- induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT  3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply to patients receiving 
anticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a 
subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still reported 
as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the S AE form. INR elevations >1.5 
suggest severe liver injury.

Section 7.4 Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse Events
Change from :
A laboratory  abnormality  should be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention includes, but is not limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay , or concomitant therapy. In addition, any medically important laboratory  
abnormality  may be reported as an adverse event at the discretion of the investigator. This 
includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is no intervention but the abnormal value(s) 
suggests a disease or organ toxicity.If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  
abnormality , the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, 
hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In 
addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL (Grade 4) should be recorded as an adverse event 
(and SAE if meeting the cri teria in Section 7.1).
Laboratory  tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7 .If a particular lab test is not listed in Appendix 7 , the lab test should be graded as 
mild, moderate, severe ,or life-threatening as specified in Section 7.8.
Change to:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the inve stigator to be more severe than expected for 
the subject’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs .
If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  abnormalit y, the diagnosis or medical 
condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, 
elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL 
(Grade 4) should alwaysbe recorded on the PSE page of the eCRF. IgG < 250 mg/dL
should also be reported as an SAE if it meets one or more of the SAEcriteria in Section
7.1.
Laboratory  tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7 .If a particular lab test is not listed in Appendix 7 , the lab test should be graded as 
mild, moderate, orsevere as specified in Section 7.8.

Pregnancies must be reported to the HGS Drug Safety designee within 24 hours of the site
becoming aware of a pregnancy  in a study subject. All pregnancies that are identified from the 
start of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent should be 
reported. All pregnancies are tracked up to term or delivery following the last study agent 
treatment. When pregnancy  is reported, HGS Drug Safety sends an acknowledgement 
memorandum to the principal investigator along with a Pregnancy  Assessment Form. A 
Pregnancy  Assessment Form must be completed every threemonths until live birth, elective 
termination of the pregnancy , or miscarriage. The site is responsible for following the 
subject’s pregnancy  to final outcome. 
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy  are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 7.1 and 
Section7.2.
Change to:
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a clinical 
trial pregnancy form. To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence . All pregnancies that are identified 
from the start of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent 
should be reported. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome 
(including premature termination) and status of mother and child. Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE 
or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.

Section 7.8 Investigator Evaluation of Adverse Events
Change from:
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness, severity 
(intensity  or grade), and causality (relationship to study agent). The criteria for serious are 
listed in Section 7.1. The severity of an AE is to be evaluated according to the Adverse Event 
Severity Grading Tables in Appendix 7. If an AE does not have Adverse Event Severity 
Grading in Appendix 7 , the follo wing severit y classifications will be used :
SEVERITY:
Grade 1-Mild      -causing no limitation of usual activities.
Grade 2-Moderate      -causing some limitation of usual activities.
Grade 3-Severe     -causing inability  to carry out usual activiti es.

intervention is required.
*Note –a severity assessment of Life-threatening is not necessaril y the same as the 
seriousness criterion of Life -threatening (see “serious” criteria Section 7.1). The former means 
that the event is a potential threat. The latter means that the event is an immediate threat to 
life.
CAUSALITY:
It is a regulatory  requirement for investigators to assess relationship between the 
investigational product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE based on the information 
available. The assessment should be reviewed on receipt of any  new information and amended 
if necessary .A “reasonable possibility ” is meant to convey that there are facts/eviden ce or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Facts/evidence or arguments that may support a 
“reasonable possibility ” include, e.g., a temporal relationship, a pharmacologicall y-predicted 
event, or positive dechallenge or rechallenge. Confounding factors, such as concomitant 
medication, a concurrent illness, or relevant medical history , should also be considered.

The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria for 
seriousness are listed in Section 7.1) ,severity (intensity ), and causalit y (relationship to study

Summary of Modifications
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID)Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables(see
Appendix 7) where poss ible:
SEVERITY:
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities (Grade 1 
DMID).
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
everyday activities (Gra de 2 DMID).
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities (Grade 3 or 4 
DMID).
Not applicable Those event(s) where intensity is meaningless or impossible to 
determine (i.e., blindness and coma).
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confu sed with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre-defined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
CAUSALITY:
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betweenstudy treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the 
determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her 
opinion of causality in light offollow-up information, amending the SAE data collection 
tool accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements .

the 8-week study follow-up period. Adverse events that have not resolved at the end ofthe 8-
week study follow-up visit are recorded on the adverse event case report form (AE eCRF) as 
ONGOING. 
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow-up period are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovered with sequelae is achieved. If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for anSAE (eg, the subject is lost to follow-up), the reason a final outcome 
could not be obtained willbe documented b y the investigator . 
Change to:
Serious and non-serious adverse eventsthat occur from the start of study medication 
administration through 8 weeks after the date of last administration of study agent are 
reported. 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-serious AEs of special interest 
(see Section 8.6.2) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until thesubject is lost to follow-up. This applies to all 
subjects, includ ing those withdrawn prematurely. 
PSEs (see Section 7.3) that occur after the Screening visit through 8 weeks after the date 
of last administration of study agent are reported and followed as described above for 
AEs/SAEs.

(2-sided, alpha = 0.05). If the result is s tatistically  significant, superiorit y of belimumab on the 
time to the first major relapse will be established. If statistical significance is not met, pvalues
may be reported and considered descriptive.

Protocol Amendment 04With Local Addenda 01, 02for Ireland , 06 April 2015
Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) inCombination 
with Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The proposed modifications to the protocol reflect a change by  the sponsor to the strategic 
objectives for the evaluation of belimumab in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). It is 
proposed that the trial should be changed from a Phase 3 study to allow for an exploratory  
evaluation of belimumab in AAV only. There is no longer the intention to seek a licensed 
indication for belimumab as an adjunctive maintenance therapy in AAV on the basis of 
the data emerging from this study. The term “Phase 3” has been removed from the study 
title.
Enrolment of subjects onto the current trial has progressed at a much slower than expected 
rate. Based on current enrolment projections, data outputs from the current trial would 
unlikely be available for review until mid -2018.
Having reviewed the timing of the study in the context of the evolving therapy area for 
ANCA-associated vasculitis, the sponsor feels that the current format and design of the 
BREVAS trial, if driven to completion as a Phase 3 investigation, would no longer 
provide significant and timely new information for the vasculitis community . On the basis 
of theBREVAS trial data alone, even in the event of a successful outcome, it is not felt 
that belimumab can be sufficientl y well differentiated as a concomitant therapy for 
remission maintenance in AAV to fulfill a significant unmet need for patients where other 
therapeutic options are now available (e.g., rituximab). 
As such, GSK is proposing to modify  the strategic objective of the trial such that it will be 
conducted as an exploratory  study, in which global enrolment would be restricted to 
approximately  100 patients (compared to the original target of approximately  300). It is 
planned that the data will be published in descriptive format with exploratory  analyses on 
efficacy endpoints undertaken as appropriate. It is expected that the safety data emerging 
from the smaller cohort of patients in BREVAS will contribute to our understanding of 
belimumab safet y. 
2.The study design and schedule has been modified throughout the protocol to clarify that 
the study will no longer be driven by the requirement to achieve a t least 66 relapse events. 
The study  will complete and the primary  analysis will be undertaken once 12 months have 
elapsed following enrolment of the last subject.
3.The protocol has been modified throughout such that subjects completing the study  will no 
longer have the option to participate in a 6-month open-label extension following 
completion of the double -blind treatment phase. The section entitled “open label extension 
phase” (6.4) and the related time and events table (Table 6 -3) has been removed.

Summary of Modifications
4.The study design schematics have been modified in the protocol by removal of the 
expected number of enrolled subjects; ‘N=300-400’ has been removed from the 
schematic.
5.In the statistical sections of the protocol, the sample size considerations have been 
modified to reflect the fact that approximately  100 patients will be recruited. The sample 
size is based largely on the feasibility  of recruitment within a reasonable time-frame. 
Sample size calculations based on expected relapse rates have been removed from the
protocol. The minimum detectable effect for a sample size of N=100 subjects has been 
determined. 
For the purposes of reporting the data, analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will 
be exploratory  in nature. Nominal ‘p’ values may be reported and considered descriptive. 
Where appropriate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed.
The section on “Subgroup analyses” (8.5.2.1) has been removed as this is no longer 
considered relevant in the context of the smaller expected total sample size of 
approximately  100 subjects.
In the section “Primary Efficacy Analysis” (8.5.2), we have clarified how stratification 
terms may be handled in the analysis if there are fewer than 5 events (relapses) in any of 
the stratification levels.
6.In the section “Dose, route of administration and schedule”, we have clarified that the 
administration of belimumab/placebo should be over approximately  one hour, but not less 
than one hour for reasons of safet y.
7.The section on liver chemistry  stopping and follow-up criteria, which describes how 
patient care should be managed if a liver event occurs during the study, has been updated 
with the most recent GSK-specified protocol for managing these events. The section also 
defines the circumstances and criteria that may allow a study treatment restart following a 
liver event. The section also includes the criteria for more intensive monitoring with 
continued therapy following a liver event. Accompany ing figures have been placed in 
Appendix 13.
8.The adverse event reporting section (Section 7) has been modified throughout for 
consistency  with AE, SAE or PSE data collection procedures and forms.
9.The text on progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML) has been updated to 
provide further guidance on the management of susp ected cases.
10.The section “Reporting a pregnancy ” has been modified to provide scope for following up 
the outcomes of a pregnancy  (including premature termination) as well as the status of 
mother and child.
11.The section “Randomiz ation procedure and assignmen t to treatment requirements” has 
been modified to remove the requirement for subjects to be randomised within 2 weeks of 
achieving remission. This corrects an error in the protocol and ensures consistency  with 
wording across other sections of the protocol.
12.The reference list has been updated in the protocol.
13. Appendix 12 (Benefit-Risk assessment) has been updated to reflect the change in study 
status to an exploratory trial and to reflect the changes in the main protocol as outlined 
above.

Sample Size Considerations , Synopsis and Section 8.4, Sample Size Rationale
Deleted:
The relapse rate in the study is anticipated to be approximately  20% in the control group. 
However, there is some uncertainty  around this relapse event rate which could be 30% or 
higher. This study is designed to target at least 66 subjects experiencing a relapse (as defined 
in the primary endpoint), which will provide 85% power to detect a reduction in relapse rates 
of 20 vs. 10% (hazard ratio = 0.472). With this same hazard ratio and a 30% event rate, a 
study with 66 subjects experiencing a relapse will provide 85% power to detect a reduction in 
the relapse rate from 30% to 15.5%. A target of 300 to 400 subjects will be randomized to 
achieve the required number of events.
After approximately  300subjects have been randomized, the relapse rate in the overall 
population will be evaluated in a blinded manner internally  by HGS while the enrollment 
continues. If the relapse rate is consistent with the 20% control rate assumption, enrollment 
will continue to 400 subjects to ensure timely accrual of the 66 events. However, if there is 
evidence that the relapse rate is higher than 20% control rate assumption, enrollment may be 
stopped at approximately 300 subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed after 
at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse and at least 12 months have elapsed after the 
last subject is randomized.
Added:
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized. The sample size has been determined 
based on the feasibility of enrolling patients into the study within a reasonable time-
frame.The sample size was not based on statistical considerations and the analysis of

Summary of Modifications
primary and secondary endpoints will be exploratory in nature. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed after 12 months have elapsed following randomization of the 
last subjec t.
Although the sample size is based on feasibility, the minimal detectable effect has been 
determined. Assuming an observed relapse rate at 18 months of 20% in the placebo 
group, a relapse rate of ≤7.0% on belimumab (hazard ratio ≤0.32) would be statistically 
significant (p<0.05) in a study of 100 subjects (50 per arm).

arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section 5.5.3 ). 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. Once randomized, 
subjects will be dosed with study agent on Days 0, 14, and 28 and every 28days thereafter.

The treatment groups include one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimumab and a placebo 
arm, with all treatment groups receiving azathioprine (as described in Section 5.5.3 ). 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered intravenously  over 1 hour. The intent of this 
instruction is toprevent more rapid infusion of belimumab which may result in a higher 
incidence of infusion reactions. Infusion time need notbe exactly one hour as it is often 
difficult to so precisely adjust infusion times and there may be clinical reasons for 
infusions lasting longer than one hour. Therefore, the instruction should be interpreted 
as infusion overat leastone hour. The target infusion time should still be approximately 
one hour assuming no other issues intervene. Once randomized, subjects will be dosed with 
study agent on Day s 0, 14, and 28 and every  28days thereafter.

In the 6-month open-label extension, all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab every 
28days until Week 24, with a final evaluation at Week 28 (4 weeks after the last dose).The 
firstdose on the open-label extension will be given 4 weeks after completion of the 
double-blind period. Day 0 is the first visit in the extension phase of the trial and represents 
the first belimumab administration for placebo subjects. Subjects sho uld remain under clinical 
supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 2 infusions.  Should symptoms of acute 
hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment.
All subjects participating in the open-label extension will continue to be monitored for 
efficacy and safet y as per the study  calendar (see Table 6 -3). 
During the 6-month open-label extension, the investigator may adjust concurrent medications 
(add, eliminate, change dose level/frequenc y) as clinically  appropriate. Prohibited medications 
during this phase are live vaccines, biological therapies and other investigational agents. 
All subjects will return for an Exit visit approximately  4weeks after their last dose of study 
agent as well as a follow-up visit approximately 8 weeks after the last dose of study agent. 
These visits apply  to subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early  
from the open -label extension.

1) Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immedia tely 
available, discontinue study treatment for that subject if ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN. Addition ally, if serum 
bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2) All events of ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if INR measured 
which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of 
hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.
3) New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersen sitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).

6.5.4 Study Treatmen t Restart
Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a 
clear underlying cause (other than drug induced liver injury [DILI]) of the liver event (e.g. 
biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there 
should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity , and the study treatment 
should not be associated with HL A markers of liver injury .
Approval b y GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where :
Investigator requests consideration for study  treatment restart if liver chemistries have a 
clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver chemistries have 
improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T <3xUL N).
Restartrisk factors (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic hepatitis, 
possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study treatment has an HLA genetic

Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart must 
be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury or death.  
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the study  
treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  chart.  
Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.
Subjects approved b y GSK Medical Governance for restarting stud y treatment must 
return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have 
been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol. 
If after study  treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  stopping 
criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.

Section 7.1 Definitions
Change from :
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE): Any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study  agent but is not necessarily  caused 
by the study agent. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency  or severity) of 
preexisting conditions.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: An adverse event resulting in any of the following 
outcomes:
death
is life-threatening (ie, an immediate threat to life)
inpatient hospitalization *
prolongation of an exi sting hospitalization
persistent or significant disability/incapacit y
congenital anomal y/birth defect

Summary of Modifications
*An inpatient hospitalization is defined as an admission for any length of time. A 
hospitalization for administration of study  agent, for routine or planned clinical procedures, or 
for “social” reasons (not the result of any adverse change in the subject’s condition) should 
not be considered an adverse event and should not be reported as a serious adverse event. If 
the subject experiences any adverse change in condition during hospitalization, the condition 
must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event according to the above 
definitions. 
+Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedit ed reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above(eg, 
possible drug-induced liver injury). These should also usually be considered serious. (ICH 
guidelines, March 1995)
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT: An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational productor package insert/summary  of product characteristics for 
an approved product). Expected means the event has previously been observed with the study 
agent and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information. It does not 
mean that the event is expected with the underly ing disease(s) or concomitant medications.
Change to:
ADVERSE EVENT
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition o f an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an

Summary of Modifications
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent.  This should be reported regardless of sequelae.
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgic al procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)
Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for t he 
subject’s condition
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT: A serious adverse event is any untoward medical 
occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Islife-threatening
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospitalisation orprolongation of existing hospitalis ation
NOTE:  In general, hospital isation signifies that the subject has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or out- patient setting.  C omplications that occur during 
hospitalisation are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be con sidered serious.
Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE .
d.Results in disability/incapacity , or

Summary of Modifications
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s abil ity to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
e.Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definitio n.  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, o r development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
g.All events of possible drug- induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT  3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply to patients receiving 
anticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a 
subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still reported 
as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the S AE form. INR elevations >1.5 
suggest severe liver injury.

Section 7.4 Laboratory Abnormalities as Adverse Events
Change from :
A laboratory  abnormality  should be reported as an adverse event if it is associated with an 
intervention. Intervention includes, but is not limited to, discontinuation of treatment, dose 
reduction/delay , or concomitant therapy. In addition, any medically important laboratory  
abnormality  may be reported as an adverse event at the discretion of the investigator. This 
includes laboratory  abnormalities for which there is no intervention but the abnormal value(s) 
suggests a disease or organ toxicity.If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  
abnormality , the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, 
hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In 
addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL (Grade 4) should be recorded as an adverse event 
(and SAE if meeting the cri teria in Section 7.1).
Laboratory  tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7 .If a particular lab test is not listed in Appendix 7 , the lab test should be graded as 
mild, moderate, severe ,or life-threatening as specified in Section 7.8.
Change to:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the inve stigator to be more severe than expected for 
the subject’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs .
If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory  abnormalit y, the diagnosis or medical 
condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnormality  (eg, 
elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased). In addition, an IgG abnormality  < 250 mg/dL 
(Grade 4) should alwaysbe recorded on the PSE page of the eCRF. IgG < 250 mg/dL
should also be reported as an SAE if it meets one or more of the SAEcriteria in Section
7.1.
Laboratory  tests are graded according to the Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables in 
Appendix 7 .If a particular lab test is not listed in Appendix 7 , the lab test should be graded as

Pregnancies must be reported to the HGS Drug Safety designee within 24 hours of the site
becoming aware of a pregnancy  in a study subject. All pregnancies that are identified from the 
start of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent should be 
reported. All pregnancies are tracked up to term or delivery following the last study agent 
treatment. When pregnancy  is reported, HGS Drug Safety sends an acknowledgement 
memorandum to the principal investigator along with a Pregnancy  Assessment Form. A 
Pregnancy  Assessment Form must be completed every threemonths until live birth, elective 
termination of the pregnancy , or miscarriage. The site is responsible for following the 
subject’s pregnancy  to final outcome. 
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy  are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Complications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 7.1 and 
Section7.2.
Change to:
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a clinical 
trial pregnancy form. To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence . All pregnancies that are identified 
from the start of study agent through 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent 
should be reported. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome 
(including premature termination) and status of mother and child. Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE 
or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.

Section 7.8 Investigator Evaluation of Adverse Events
Change from:
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness, severity 
(intensity  or grade), and causality (relationship to study agent). The criteria for serious are 
listed in Section 7.1. The severity of an AE is to be evaluated according to the Adverse Event 
Severity Grading Tables in Appendix 7. If an AE does not have Adverse Event Severity 
Grading in Appendix 7 , the follo wing severit y classifications will be used :
SEVERITY:
Grade 1-Mild      -causing no limitation of usual activities.
Grade 2-Moderate      -causing some limitation of usual activities.
Grade 3-Severe     -causing inability  to carry out usual activiti es.
Grade 4-Life-threatening*   -potentially  life-threatening or disabling; significant medical 
intervention is required.
*Note –a severity assessment of Life-threatening is not necessaril y the same as the 
seriousness criterion of Life -threatening (see “serious” criteria Section 7.1). The former means 
that the event is a potential threat. The latter means that the event is an immediate threat to 
life.
CAUSALITY:
It is a regulatory  requirement for investigators to assess relationship between the 
investigational product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE based on the information 
available. The assessment should be reviewed on receipt of any  new information and amended 
if necessary .A “reasonable possibility ” is meant to convey that there are facts/eviden ce or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Facts/evidence or arguments that may support a 
“reasonable possibility ” include, e.g., a temporal relationship, a pharmacologicall y-predicted 
event, or positive dechallenge or rechallenge. Confounding factors, such as concomitant 
medication, a concurrent illness, or relevant medical history , should also be considered.
Change to:
The investigator will evaluate all adverse events with respect to seriousness (criteria for 
seriousness are listed in Section 7.1) ,severity (intensity ), and causalit y (relationship to study  
agent). The investigator will make an assessment of intensity based on the Division of

Summary of Modifications
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID)Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables(see
Appendix 7) where poss ible:
SEVERITY:
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities (Grade 1 
DMID).
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
everyday activities (Gra de 2 DMID).
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities (Grade 3 or 4 
DMID).
Not applicable Those event(s) where intensity is meaningless or impossible to 
determine (i.e., blindness and coma).
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confu sed with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre-defined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
CAUSALITY:
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betweenstudy treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the 
determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her 
opinion of causality in light offollow-up information, amending the SAE data collection 
tool accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements .

week study follow-up visit are recorded on the adverse event case report form (AE eCRF) as 
ONGOING. 
SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the follow-up period are followed until final 
outcome of recovered or recovered with sequelae is achieved. If it is not possible to obtain a 
final outcome for anSAE (eg, the subject is lost to follow-up), the reason a final outcome 
could not be obtained willbe documented b y the investigator . 
Change to:
Serious and non-serious adverse eventsthat occur from the start of study medication 
administration through 8 weeks after the date of last administration of study agent are 
reported. 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-serious AEs of special interest 
(see Section 8.6.2) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until thesubject is lost to follow-up. This applies to all 
subjects, includ ing those withdrawn prematurely. 
PSEs (see Section 7.3) that occur after the Screening visit through 8 weeks after the date

time to the first major relapse will be established. If statistical significance is not met, pvalues
may be reported and considered descriptive.
Analyses of all other efficacy endpoints other thanthe primary and major secondary  efficacy 
endpoints will not be subject to any multiple testing procedure. All statistical tests will be

Section 8.5.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis
Change from:
The primary efficacy analysis will compare the time to first relapse from Day 0 between the 
placebo/azathioprine group and thebelimumab/azathioprine combination group using a Cox 
proportional hazard model, adjusted for ANCA t ype (anti-PR3 vs. anti- MPO), disease stage at 
induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (rituximab vs. IV 
cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide). However, the adjustment of induction 
regimen will be changed to rituximab vs. IV and/or oral cyclophosphamide if the number of 
events (relapse) is less 5 in subjects using the oral or IV cyclophosphamide. For any subject 
who does not experience a relapse, the time to first relapse will be censored at the time of the 
subject’s last assessment. Subjects who discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare 
(asdefined in primary efficacy endpoint) are to be followed per protocol for inclusion in the 
primary efficacy analysis until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(whichever is earlier). The database will be locked and the primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed after at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse and at least12 months have 
elapsed after the last subject is randomized.

Summary of Modifications
If top line data from the double blind portion of this trial show that belimumab is superior to 
placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint, and the safety profile of belimumab is acceptable, 
subjects who receive treatment with study agent until the completion of the double-blind 
period of the study and have not relapsed (asdefined by the primary endpoint) will be given 
the option to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6-month open-label extension period, in 
which all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab IV. Subjects participating in the open-
label extension will conti nue to be monitored for efficacy  and safet y.
Deleted:
These visits apply  to subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early  
from the open -label extension.
After the 6-month open-label extension phase, subjects who wish to continue treatment may 
do so by being prescribed commerciall y available belimumab. If belimumab is not 
commerciall y available in a subject’s country of participation, the subject may continue to 
receive belimumab under a separate continuation protocol. A separate informed consent will 
be provided for the continuation protocol. The 8 week follow-up visit is not required for 
subjects entering the continuation protocol.

Protocol Number: HGS1006 -C1100
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The protocol has been modified to provide flexibility  in timing of initiation of azathioprine 
maintenance therapy i.e.,option to initiate as soon as clinically indicated and prior to 
confirmation of remission.
2.The protocol has been modified to allow alternative unlicensed rituximab dose for 
induction (1g every 2 weeks) in addition to the licensed dosing regimen (375 mg/m2/wk 
for 4 doses).
3.The protocol has been modified to provide flexibility in timing of baseline BVAS 
assessments –allowing 2 baseline assessments separated by at least 14 days (instead of 
strict 21-35 days separation).
4.Theabsolute requirement to randomize within 14 days of confirmation of remission has 
been removed and clarification has been added that subjects cannot be randomized until at 
least 6 weeks after initiation of induction therap y.
5.A study schematic diagram has been added to clarify  the trial design.
6.Clarification has been added regarding ‘high dose corticosteroids’ for induction and text 
providesguidance but allows locally accepted practice. No subject should receive <10mg 
for induction.
7.The protocol has been modifiedto allow some flexibility  to cyclophosphamide dosing 
regimens (allows adjustment for age, obesity, renal insufficiency , leukopenia, other 
toxicities) for induction.
8.The protocol has been modified to allow the o ption to use methotrexate from the outset, as 
an alternative to azathioprine , if patient is a priori known to be azathioprine intolerant or 
has low/absent thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)activity. Exclusion of subject with 
intolerance or contraindications to methotrexate (where this is being considered as an 
alternative to azathioprine ). 
9.The protocol has been modified to allow equal to/less than 10mg prednisonedaily during 
maintenance (rather than strictly <10mg prednisone daily); articulated option to taper as 
clinically appropriate.
10.Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y text has been updated based on new 
information. This addition is to ensure full awareness of PML risk in the trial population 
and to provide clarification on clinical assessment and actions.
11.In Appendices 1 and 2, “criteria”in the title and text hasbeen changed to “definition” . 
The List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
12.Appendix 5 has been updated to include a sample of the VDI case report form.

Subjects enrolled into the trial must have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to 
severely active WG or MPA that was treated with corticosteroids and either 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (ie, induction therapy) in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated under the following induction regimens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
A single course rituximab (RTX) administered at  a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks 
plus high dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
Cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
Cyclophosphamide 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeksapart followed by  pulses of 
15mg/kg every  3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses ofcyclophosphamide are givenas targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency  or white cell counts as dictated by local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day.
Subjects who are within26 weeks of starting induction therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 score 
of0 (Appendix 4 ), and are receiving < 10 mg/dayprednisone (orequivalent) on 2 consecutive 
measurements 21 to 35days apart may be enrolled into the study. Randomization will be 
performed on Day 0. Day 0 (first administration of belimumab/placebo) must occur no more 
than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission. Azathioprine must be initiated at any time 
following confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0.All subjects willbe treated

with oral azathioprine (AZA) at a dose of 2mg/kg/day . Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study agent (belimumab [10mg/kg] or placebo) 
administered intravenousl y (IV) over 1 hour. The randomization will be stratified according to 
ANCA ty pe (anti-PR3 vs. anti -MPO), disease stageat induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing 
disease) and induction regimen (IV cyclophosphamide vs. oral cyclophosphamide vs. 
rituximab ). Belimumab or placebo will be supplied by the sponsor during this double-blind 
treatment phase.It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patients would be newly 
diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be cappedif 
they exceed this proportion. Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 
14, 28, and every  28days thereafter.

[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity,renal insufficiency, leukopenia, or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/da y not to exceed 80mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach ≤ 10 
mg/day. As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous 
steroid pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be 
receiving more than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Subjects who are between 6 and26 weeks of starting induction therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 
score of0 (Appendix 4), and are receiving ≤ 10 mg/dayprednisone (orequivalent) on 2

Section 5.5.3.1 Azathioprine and Methotrexate
Formerly:
The target dose of azathioprine is 2 mg/kg/day  (not to exceed 200 mg/day ). Azathioprin e must 
be initiated at an y time following confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0 at a 
dose of 50 mg/day  and increased by no more than 50 mg/day every week until the target dose 
is achieved.
Subjectsnaïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT >2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, 
characteri zed by severe nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be 
permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1mg/kg/day . If the subjectcontinues to 
experience the toxicities described above a switch to methotrexate at a target dose of  
25mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. 
These subjects will be included in the primary  analysis. 
It is recommended that the appropriate local prescribing information (eg,contraindications, 
hematological and biochemical monitoring, pregnancy , contraception, etc.)for azathioprine or 
methotrexate (MTX) (as applicable), should be followed prior to and during treatment.
In the extension phase of the trial, the dose of AZA/MTX can be decreased or discontinued
based on the discretion of the investigator. 
Modified to:
The target dose of azathioprine is 2mg/kg/day  (not to exceed 200 mg/day). For the 
maintenance of remission azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated 
following administration of induction therapy. Azathioprine must not be initiated any 
later than Day 0. Azathioprine should be startedat a dose of 50 mg/day and increased by 
no more than 50 mg/day every week until the target dose is achieved.
Subjectsnaïve to azathioprine who develop Grade 3 or 4 leu kopenia or thrombocy topenia, 
AST or ALT > 2times ULN, or a severe gastrointestinal hy persensitivity  reaction, 
characterized b y severe nausea and vomiting, following initiation of azathioprine will be

25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. 
These subjects w ill be included in the primary  analysis. 
For subjects previously identified as being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects 
identified as having undetectable or reduced activity of thiopurine methyltransferase 
(TPMT), it may be permissible for metho trexate to be used as an alternative to 
azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the outset. This should be discussed

with the medical monitor. Methotrexate would not be recommended for those subjects 
with significantly impaired renal function.
Theappropriate local prescribing information (eg, dose adjustments, contraindications, 
hematological and biochemical monitoring, pregnancy, contraception, etc.) for azathioprine 
or methotrexate (MTX) (as applicable), should be followed prior to and during treatment.
As per the Summary  of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for azathioprine, it is suggested that 
during the first 8 weeks of therapy, complete blood counts, including platelets, should be 
performed weekly or more frequently if high dosage is used orif severe renal and/or hepatic 
disorder is present. The blood count frequency may be reduced later in therapy, but it is 
suggested that complete blood counts are repeated monthly, or at least at intervals of not 
longer than 3 months.
In the extension phase of the trial, the dose of AZA/MTX can be decreased or discontinued 
based on the discretion of the investigator.
Section 6.2 Study Enrollment Procedures

Section7.5 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
Formerly:
There have been no reported cases of PML in subjects with SLE or RA treated with 
belimumab. However, patients with autoimmune diseases may be at increased risk for PML 
secondary  to the diseases themselves, as well as the concurrent use of immunosuppressive 
drugs. The most common signs and symptoms of PML include visual disturbances, ocular 
movements, ataxia, and mental status changes such as disorientation or confusion. Clinical 
signs and sy mptoms of PML  and vasculitis can be similar. The investigator must exercise best 
judgment in further workup and clinical intervention as appropriate. If PML is suspected, this 
should be promptly  reported to the sponsor.
Modified to:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in SLE patients receiving immunosuppressant 
pharmacotherapy, includin g belimumab. A diagnosis of PML should be considered in 
any subject presenting with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and 
symptoms. The subject should be referred to a neurologist or other appropriate 
specialist for evaluation. If PML is confir med, study agent should be discontinued and 
consideration should be given to stopping immunosuppressant therapy. 
If PML is suspected, this should be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor.  The 
appropriateness of continuing study agent, while the ca se is being assessed, should be 
discussed.

Associated Vasculitis, Study Overview and Patient Population
Formerly:
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenan ce of 
remission in subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA) following a standard induction regimen. Subjects enrolled into the study 
must have a clinical diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the Chapel Hill criteria and must 
have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WG or MPA that was 
treated with corticosteroids and either CYC or RTX in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated with 1 of the following induction regi mens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2 mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed b y pulses of 15 mg/kg every 
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses of CYCare givenas targets but may be adjusted for renal insufficiency  or white 
cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10mg/day.

Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 14, and every 28 days 
thereafter. Randomization will be performed on Day 0. Day 0  (first administration of 
belimumab/placebo) must occur no more than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission.
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be treated with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Azathioprine must be initiated at any time following 
confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0.Patients with known intolerance to 
azathioprine will be excluded from the trial. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop 
Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe

methotrexate at a target dose of 25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is

Summary of Modifications
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity,renal insufficiency, leukopenia, or other toxicities asdictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and taperedas clinically appropriate to reach ≤ 10
mg/day. As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous 
steroid pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be 
receiving more than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
A target of 300 to 400 subjects who are between 6 and26 weeks fromstarting induction 
therapy, achieve a BVAS v.3 score of 0 (ie, are in remission), and are receiving ≤10mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent) on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14days apart will be 
enrolled into the study. Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to receive study agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) administered intravenousl y 
(IV) over 1 hour. Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 14, and 
every 28 days thereafter. Randomization will be performed on Day  0. 
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be treat ed with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. For the maintenance of remission, azathioprine may be 
initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration of induction 
therapy. Azathioprine must not be initiated any later thanDay 0. For subjects 
previously identified as being intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as 
having undetectable or reduced activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may 
be permissible for methotrexate to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the 
maintenance of remission from the outset.  Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop 
Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe 
gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, characterized by severe nausea and vomiting,

Induction and Maintenance Regimens for ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Formerly:
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses ofcyclophosphamide are givenas targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency  or white cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10mg/day.
Rituximab was appro ved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith et al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX regimen specified in this vasculitis study is the 
sameas that approved b y the FDA for this indication.
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showedthat this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauci and Wolff, 1973; Fauci et al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992;
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayne et al, 2003) showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine

Summary of Modifications
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements 3 to 5weeks 
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving < 10mg/day of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
no more than26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, subject 
randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, subjects will be 
randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + placebo or AZA (2
mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol must occur within 2 
weeks of achieving a confirmed remission and the randomization will be stratified by 
induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 4 73 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. In this study, subjects who have a known 
intolerance to azathioprine will be excluded.Subjects naive to azathioprine and who 
experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST 
or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by 
severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce 
the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience toxicities, a switch 
to methotrexate at doses of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be 
permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it is not 
anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters 
et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included 
in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs physicians to follow the appropriate local 
prescribing information for azathioprine or methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during 
treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society ( EUVAS)and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC), and consensus was reached that these

Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :

Summary of Modifications
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR 
A single course of rituximab comprising two doses, 1g IV each, separated by a two -
week interval, plus HDCS OR
CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed b y pulses of 15 mg/kg every 
3 weeks plus HDCS.
[The cyclophosphamide dosing regimens are provided as targets but may be adjusted for 
older age, obesity,renal insufficiency, leukopenia, or other toxicities as dictated by local 
practice.]
For guidance purposes, the recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction 
therapies is: methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 
0.5-1 mg/kg/day  not to exceed 80 mg/day and tapered as clinically appropriate to reach ≤ 10
mg/day. As doses for HDCS pulses per the protocol are recommended doses, local 
standard of care for the steroid dosing regimen would be acceptable if intravenous 
steroid pulses are not part of standard of care on site. However, all subjects must be 
receiving more than 10 mg of prednisone/day or equivalent for induction.
Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith et a l, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX dosing regimen of 4 infusions of 375mg/m2
each given 1 week apart reflects the dosing regimen thatisapproved by the FDA for this 
indication. An alternative RTX induction regimen (2 infusions of 1 gram each 
administered 2 weeks apart) is also offered in the protocol. Although the latter regimen 
is not licensed as an induction therapy for ANCA-vasculitis, it is very widely used in 
clinical practice and clinical evidence suggests that there is no difference between the 
two dosing regimens in terms of duration of B-cell depletion or therapeuti c efficacy 
efficacy (Jones et al, 2009).
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 3 
weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and MPA 
since the earl y 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of Health 
showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent work 
showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously  an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauci and Wolff, 1973; Fauci et al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).

Summary of Modifications
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayne et al, 2003) showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by maintenance treatment with a zathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements at least 14 days
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving ≤ 10mg/day of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
between 6 and26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, subject 
randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, subjects will be 
randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + placebo or AZA (2 
mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol will be stratified by 
induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. For the maintenance of remission, 
azathioprine may be initiated as soon as it is clinically indicated following administration 
of induction therapy and no later than Day 0. For subjects previously identified as being 
intolerant to azathioprine, or for subjects identified as having undetectable or reduced 
activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), it may be permissible for methotrexate 
to be used as an alternative to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission from the 
outset.Subjects naive to azathioprine and who experience azathioprine -related toxicity 
(Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several 
gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by severe nausea and vomiting), 
following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 1 
mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience toxicities, a switch to methotrexate at doses 
of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is 
among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects 
will needto substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010). Subjects for whom 
methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary analysis. The 
protocol instructs physicians to follow the appropriate local prescribing information for 
azathioprine or methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC), and consensus was reached that these 
regimens are appropriate for this international trial.

Appendix 12 Protocol Addendum – Benefit and Risk Assessment, Safety Considerations
Added:
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in neurological deficits, 
including fatal cases, has been reported in patients with SLE receiving
immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy, including belimumab. Therefore, a diagnosis of 
PML should be considered in any subject presenting with new-onset or deteriorating 
neurological signs and symptoms. The protocol requires that subjects should be referred 
toa neurologist or other appropriate specialist for evaluation. If PML is confirmed, 
study agent should be discontinued and consideration should be given to stopping 
immunosuppressant therapy. If PML is suspected, this should be immediately reported 
to the Medical Monitor.  The appropriateness of continuing study agent, while the case is 
being assessed, should be discussed.

Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab (HGS1006) in Combination 
with Azathioprine for the Maintenance of Remission in Wegener’s Granulomatosis and 
Microscopic Polyangiitis
Summary of Modifications and Rationale:
1.The protocol has been modified to include testing at Screening for HIV antibody, to 
expand Hepatit is B serology  testing, and to exclude patients who test positive according to 
the criteria specified. 
2.Because theRIBA antibody confirmation assay for hepatitis C is not available due to 
non-availability  of manufacturer’s reagents, an alternative test, HCV RNA-PCR assay , 
will be used todetect the presence of viral RNA, and hence confirm a current infection.
3.The protocol has been modified to exclude patients at baseline with abnormal liver 
function according to the criteria specified.
4.A new section has been added to clarify how patient care should be managed if a patient 
has a liver chemistry  event during the study. The accompan ying figure has been placed in 
an appendix (Appendix 13) and the List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
5.Measurement of vital signs (temperature, sitting blood pressure [systolic and diastolic], 
and heart rate) have been added to the procedures for all scheduled study visits and a 
12-lead ECG has been added to the procedures for the Day 0 visit. These procedures have 
been added to provide increased understanding and to assist analyses of potential safety 
events should they  occur.
6.A page with the protocol’s revision chronology  has been added.
7.The Synopsis has been corrected to include study  agent dosing on day  28.
8.Text has been added to clarify that study agents (belimumab or placebo) will be provided 
by the sponsor during the double-blind treatment phaseand that belimumab will be 
provided b y the sponsor during the open -label extension phase .
9.Within the definition of postmenopausal in Inclusion Criterion #7, “1year without 
menses” has been changed to “12 consecutive months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause.” Also, the sub-bullet formatting of the last 8 rows of Inclusion 
Criterion #7 has been corrected.
10.Steroid use for vasculitis has been modified to restrict the use of corticosteroids up to a 
maximum of 20 mg/dayof prednisone (or equivalent) for a maximum of 1 week within 
the first 2 months of the double- blind treatment period , and at other times, to < 10 mg /day.
11.The Reference List has been updated to include references cited in text but not present in 
the listand to delete a reference included in error. Also, the in text citation for Posner et al 
has been corrected to Posner et al 2007 and the reference has been added to the list.
12.Cross-references have been added in Section 1 for references that were in the Reference 
List but which inadvertenly  had not been cited in text.

13.In Appendix 8, for the question at baseline/screening “Is the time the subject felt most 
suicidal (i.e. the lifetime rating) more than X month(s) ago?”, the “X” has been corrected 
to “2”, i.e, “more than 2 month(s) ago”.
14.The investigator evaluation of adverse events regarding causality has been modified from 
a multi-choice assessment (definitely related, probably related, etc.) to an assessment of 
“reasonable possibility ”.  
15.Appendix 9 has been corrected to cite the reference and the publication has been added to 
the Reference List.
16.Two new appendices have been added to provide the questionna ires for the PSRHQ 
(Appendix 10) and the PSRQ (Appendix 11) and cross-references added in-text as 
appropriate. The List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
17.The protocol has been modified to include a Benefit and Risk Assessment (Appendix 12). 
The List of Appendices has been updated accordingl y.
18. Minor administrative change was made for presentation of cross-referencing sections and 
tables, e.g., “see Sections X.1 and X.2” was changed to “see Section X.1 and 
SectionX.2”. These minor changes are not shown in the Modifications section below. 
19.The list of abbreviations has been updated to add abbreviations as a result of new and/or 
amended text and to correct previous errors.
20.The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) definitions for Wegener’s granuloma tosis 
and microscopic polyangiitis in Appendices 1 and 2 of the protocol have been updated to 
reflect the most recent CHCC (2012) definitions. The reference for this (Jeannette et al 
2013) is cited in the text (Section 1.1) and in the reference list.

Section 1.1 Disease Background
Formerly:
Anti-PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity  and mortality compared to anti-
MPO. The most widely used classification criteria for diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are 
those published by the American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt 
et al, 1990 and Masi et al,1990, respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill 
Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA (Jennette et al, 1994 ).
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classification criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Watts et al, 2007 ).
In the US, the prevalence rates of WG range from 2.6- 9/100000 ( Mahr et al, 2006).

Section 1.4 Rationale for the Study
Formerly:
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20, recently showed suc cess in inducing remission in AAV (Stone et al, 2010) and 
was granted approval for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease.

subjects who receive treatment with study agent until the completion of the double-blind 
period of the study and have not relapsed (as defined by the primary endpoint) will be given 
the option to receive treatment with belimumab in the open-label extension phase. Subjects 
who enter the open-label extension phase will receive belimumab for up toan additional 
6monthsand this will be supplied by the sponsor.

Section 6.6 Laboratory Tests
The following section has been added:
Section 6.6.2 Phase III -IV Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follow- up Criteria
The liver chemistry  stopping and follow-up criteria have been designed to assure subject 
safety and evaluate liver event etiology .
Phase III-IV liver chemistry  stopping criteria 1-5 are defined below and presented in a figure 
in Appendix 13:
1.ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xUL N (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT ≥ 3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured). 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediatel y available, withdraw study drug 
from that subject if ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record pre sence of 
detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury .
2.ALT ≥ 8xULN.
3.ALT ≥ 5xULN but <8 xULN persists for ≥2 weeks.
4.ALT ≥ 3xULN if associated with sy mptoms (new or worsening) believed to be rel ated to 
hepatitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or 
jaundice), or hypersensitivity  (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia).
5.ALT ≥ 5xULN but <8 xULN and cannot be monitored weekl y for ≥2 weeks.
When any of the li ver chemistry stopping criteria 1- 5 is met, do the following:
Immediatel y withdraw investigational product
Report the event to GSK within 24 hours of learning its occurrence
Complete the liver event CRF and SAE data collection tool if the event also meets the 
criteria for an SAE. All events of AL T ≥ 3xULN andbilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) 
(or ALT ≥ 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured); INR measurement is not required and 
the threshold value stated will not apply  to patients receiving anticoagulants), termed 
‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic impairment or 
cirrhosis) . 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediatel y available, withdraw study drug 
from that subject if ALT ≥ 3xULN andbilirubin ≥ 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of 
detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury .
Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy  CRFs if these tests are perfor med
2013N160488_0 1

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Perform liver event follow up assessments, and monitor the subject until liver chemistries 
resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described below.
Withdraw the subject from the study (unless further safety follow up is required) after 
completion of the liver chemistry  monitoring as described below.
Do not re -start investigational product.
In addition, for criterion 1:
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 hours for repeat 
liver chemistries, liver event follow up assessments (see below), and close monitoring
A specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended.
Monitor subjects twice weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baselin e values
For criteria 2, 3, 4 and 5:
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24-72 hou rsfor 
repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow up assessments (see below)
Monitor subjects weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AS T, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values; criterion 5 subjects should 
be monitored as frequently  as possible
Subjects with ALT ≥5xULN and <8xULN which exhibit a decrease to ALT ≥3xULN, but 
<5xULN and bilirubin <2xULN without hepatitis symptoms or rash, and who can be 
monitored weekl y for 4 weeks:
Notify the GSK medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of the a bnormality  to discuss 
subject safet y
Can continue investigational product
Must return weekl y for repeat liver chemistries (AL T, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) until they  resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline
If at any time these subjects meet the liver chemistry  stopping criteria, proceed as 
described above
If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xUL N and bilirubin <2xUL N, monitor subjects 
twice monthly  until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline values.
For criteria 1-5, make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow up assessments
described below:
• Viral hepatitis serology including:
Hepatitis A IgM antibody;
Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody  (IgM);
2013N160488_0 1
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 16
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Hepatitis C RNA;
Cytomegalovirus IgM a ntibody;
Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibod y (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile 
antibody or monospot testing) ;
Hepatitis E IgM antibody;
Blood sample for PK analy sis, obtained within approximately  1 to 2 weeks after the liver 
event. Record t he date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose 
of investigational product prior to blood sample draw on the CRF. If the date or time of 
the last dose is unclear, provide the subject’s best approximation. I f the date/time of the
last dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period 
indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample. Instructions for sample handling and shipping 
are in the Study  Procedures Manual.
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lac tate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2xULN
Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia. Record the 
appearance or worsening of clinical s ymptoms of hepatitis or hy persensitivity , such as 
fatigue, naus ea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever rash or 
eosinophilia as relevant on the AE report form
Record use of concomitant medications, paracetamol (acetaminophen), herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications, or putative hepatot oxins, on the concomitant 
medications report form.
Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake case report form
The following are required for subjects with ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% 
direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:
Anti-nuclear antibody , anti-smooth muscle antibody , and Type 1 anti-liver kidney  
microsomal antibodies and quantitative total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma 
globulins) .
Serum acetaminophen adduct HPL C assay (quantifies potential acetaminophen 
contribution to liver injury  in subjects with definite or likely  acetaminophen use in the 
preceding week [James, 2009]) .
Liver imaging (ultrasound, magneti c resonance, or computerized tomography ) to evaluate 
liver disease.
Section 7.6 Suicidality Assessment
Formerly:
Subjects who answer “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation questions 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS should be referred to appropriate psychiatric care and prompts the 
completion of an SAE worksheet. The medical monitor should be notified when these events 
occur. In addition, a “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation question 3, 4 
or 5 on the C-SSRS prompts the completion of the Possible Suicidality Related History

CAUSALITY
It is a regulatory requirement for investigators to assess relationship between the 
investigati onal product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE based on the information 
available. The assessment should be reviewed on receipt of any new information and 
amended if necessary. A “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Facts/evidence or 
arguments that may support “a reasonable possibility” include, e.g., a temporal 
relationship, a pharmacologically- predicted event, or positive dechallenge or 
rechallenge. Confounding factors,such as concomitant medication, a concurrent illness, 
or relevant medical history, should also be considered.

Appendix 1 2Protocol Addendum – Benefit and Risk Assessment
Added:
Disease Background
The systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis; also known as granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti- neutrophil cy toplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (Jennette a nd 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to lifethreatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. 
Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining patterns in 
immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear (P-ANCA). It is 
now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 3 (PR3), and P-
ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which are enzymes that 
are abundant in the granules of neutrophi ls (Jennette and Falk, 1997; Merkel et al, 1997). 
Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO autoantibodies are 
more common in MPA and CSS. Anti -PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality compared to anti-MPO. The most widely used classification criteria for 
diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are those published by the American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt et al, 1990 and Masi et al, 1990, 
respectivel y), and that published by the ChapelHill Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA 
(Jennette et al, 1994). Of note, none of these diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement 
of ANCA.
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classificati on criteria as later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Watts et al, 2007). 
In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiological studies are confounded by its original 
inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilizing the ACR or CHCC criteria, 
prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and 0.4-
1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by some margin 
(Koldingsnes et al, 2008). AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with peak age of onset in 
those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatski et al, 2010), with other small vessel vasculitides being the 
major concern in childhood (Brogan et al, 2010).Current therapy is usually determined by 
severity of the disease, with more severe forms warranting more aggressive approaches. These 
usually involve an initial remission induction regimen of high dose corticosteroid 
administered with either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX) followed by a 
remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stone et al, 2010; Bosch et al, 2007; 
Jayne et al, 2003). Minor manifestations are usually treated with low dose corticosteroid 
2013N160488_0 1

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate (Belmont, 2006). Even with recent 
treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains unacceptabl y 
high (Drooger et al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmani et al, 1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG 
(Stone et al, 2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 (Mukht yar et al, 2009). In its current form it is a list of 
56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A weighted numerical score
is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each manifestation. The items are grouped 
by organ systems, and each organ system has a maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the 
relative importance of the organ system (Mukhtyar et al, 2009). The tool also makes a 
distinction between new or worsening disease and persistent disease with new or worsening 
attracting higher scores.
IV Belimumab
Over 2,000 individuals with SL E have been treated with belimumab in clinical studies. In two 
global Phase 3 studies, belimumab 10 mg/kg met the primary efficacy endpoint (SRI at 
Week52). Evidence of other possible benefits in these trials included reductions in risk of 
severe flare and corticosteroid use, and improvements in patient reported quality of life and 
fatigue. Serological activity was reduced as measured by reductions in autoantibodies and 
normalization of hypergammaglobulinemia and complement levels. B cells, including 
autoreactive B cells, were also reduced, but not severely  depleted, consistent with wha t would 
be expected from inhibition of BLyS (reference belimumab IB, Section 5.3.1). These results 
supported the approval of belimumab in the EU, US, Canada and other countries.
In the United States belimumab is approved for the following indication:
BENLYSTA® (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, 
autoantibody -positive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard 
therapy.
Limitations of Use: The efficacy of BENLYSTA has not been evaluated in patients with 
severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. BENLYSTA 
has not been studied in combination with other biologics or intravenous 
cyclophosphamide. Use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in these situations.
In the EU, the approved indication focuses on patients with high disease activity (where 
belimumab offered the greatest benefit):
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, 
autoantibodypositive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree ofdisease 
activity (e.g positive anti -dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.
The EU SPC also includes special warnings and precautions for use similar to the US 
labeling, including that belimumab has not been studied in and is thus not recommended in 
2013N160488_0 1
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 31
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
patients with severe active central nervous system lupus or severe active lupus nephritis. In 
addition, caution should be exercised if belimumab is co-administered with other B cell 
targeted therapy or cyclophosphamide. Reference Section 4.4 of the SPC for the complete list 
of specials warnings and precautions.
Treatment with belimumab plus standard therapy was generally well tolerated, with rates of 
AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and serious/severe infections 
generally comparable to the rates observed in the placebo plus standard therapy group. The 
most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 3% of patients receiving 10 mg/kg 
belimumab IV in clinical trials (and at a ≥ 1% greater rate than placebo) were nausea, 
diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity , depression, 
migraine, pharyngitis, cystitis, leukopenia, and gastroenteritis viral. In clinical trials, 
hypersensitivity  and infusion reactions were observed more frequently with belimumab, with 
anaphylaxis observed in ≤ 1% of subjects. Data from the post-marketing setting indicate that 
hypersensitivity  reactions may be serious or result in death, that the onset of such reactions 
may be delayed, and that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant 
hypersensitivity  may be at increased risk. In addition, it is also known from clinical trials and 
the post-marketing setting that the vast majority of hypersensitivity  reactions occur with the 
1stor 2ndinfusion. The product labeling, belimumab IB, protocol, and informed consent forms 
have been updated to include this new information, as applicable.
Other risks that may be associated with belimumab based on its mechanism of action include 
serious infections and malignanc y, although no increases in the rates of serious infections or 
malignancies have been observed. Psychiatric events including depression and suicide were 
observed more frequently  with belimumab than with placebo, although it is unknown if 
belimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these events. Finally, mortality 
rates in the controlled clinical trials were low, although numerically  higher in the belimumab 
groups (0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectively ). Causes of death 
were as expected in an SLE population with active disease receiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, 
cardiovascular disease, and suicide.
Experience from open-label, long-term continuation trials of belimumab in SLE patients 
suggests prolonged treatment with belimumab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase in the incidence of AEs or SAEs over time, including important events such 
as infections and malignanci es. Long-term belimumab treatment appears to provide sustained 
improvement in SL E disease activity  and reduction of flares.
Belimumab in A NCA-Associated Vasculitis
Study Overview and Patient Population
Belimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg in combination with standard SLE therapy demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically meaningful reduction in SLE disease activity versus 
placebo plus standard SLE therapy  at Week 52 in two Phase 3 clinical studies in subjects with 
active, autoantibod y-positive SL E.

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Studies in subjects with WG and MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2 diseases ranging from 15% at 18 
months (Jayne et al, 2003) to 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al, 2010) on az athioprine –the most 
effective of current therapies (Jay ne et al, 2003; Pagnoux et al, 2008; Hiemstra et al, 2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV. Further supporting a role for B cells is the factthat activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popa et al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, are found in subjects with 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagai et al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010). Together, these 
provide a strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels. Therefore, 
for the proposed study, subjects are required to have documented evidence of anti-PR3 or 
anti-MPO autoantibodies prior to randomization, as this population is considered the most 
likely to benefit from treatment with a B cell modulating agent like belimumab. This is 
consistent with the Phase 3 SLE results for belimumab where the subjects who benefitted 
from treatment were those who were antinuclear antibody (ANA/anti -dsDNA) autoantibody 
positive at baseline.
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20, recentl y showed success in inducing remission in AAV (Stone et al, 2010) and 
was granted approval in the US for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease. Finally , limited data from the small (n = 111) subset of subjects in the Phase 3 
trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their SLE (as assessed by the SELENA 
SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus standard of care treatment arms 
had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 compared with subjects receiving 
placebo plus standard of care. Specificall y, 19/36 (52.8%) and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in 
the belimumab 1 mg/kg and10 mg/kg dose groups, respectivel y, had resolution of vasculitic 
activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of placebo subjects. Taken together, these 
data support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
The safety of the proposed study is supported by data from the Phase 2 and 3 trials in SLE in 
which subjects who were receiving belimumab in combination with significant background 
therapies, including steroids and immunosuppressants, had an adverse event profile similar to 
that of subjects receiving plac ebo plus standard therapies.
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of 
remission in subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA) following a standard induction regimen. Subjects enrolled into the study 
must have a clinical diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the Chapel Hill criteria and must 
have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WG or MPA that was 
treated with corticosteroids and either CYC or RTX in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated with 1 of the following induction regimens will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
2013N160488_0 1
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 33
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2 mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses of CYC are given as targets but may be adjusted for renal insufficiency  or white 
cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day .
A target of 300 to 400 subjects who are within 26 weeks of starting induction therapy , achieve 
a BVAS v.3 score of 0 (ie, are in remission), and are receiving less than 10 mg/day  prednisone 
(or equivalent) on 2 consecutive measurements 21 to 35 days apart will be enrolled into the 
study. Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
study agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour. 
Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 14, and every 28 days 
thereafter. Randomization will be performed on Day 0. Day 0  (first administration of 
belimumab/placebo) must occur no more than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission.
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be treated with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . Azathioprine must be initiated at any time following 
confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0. Patients with known intolerance to 
azathioprine will be excluded from the trial. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop 
Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe 
gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, characterized by severe nausea and vomiting, 
following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 
1mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience the toxicities described above, a switch to 
methotrexate at a target dose of 25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated 
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is 
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  analysis.
The randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), 
disease stage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (IV 
CYC vs. oral CYC vs. RTX). It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patients would be 
newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be 
capped if they exceed this proportion. Refer to Section 4 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for a 
complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The primary efficacy endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse, defined as at least 
1major BVAS item or a minimum total BVAS score of 6 or receipt of prohibited medications 
2013N160488_0 1

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
according to the protocol. Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA 
until the results from the primary efficacy analysisare available or until they experience a 
flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy endpoint. The database will be locked and 
the primary analysis will be performed after at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse 
and at least 12 months have elapsed after the last subject is randomized. Subjects who 
discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double blind visit 
schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase (whichever is 
earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an attempt will be 
made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of stud y agent.
If top line data from the double blind portion of this trial show that belimumab is superior to 
placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint, and the safety profile of belimumab is acceptable, 
subjects who receive treatment with study agent until the completion of the double-blind 
period of the study and have not relapsed (as defined by the primary endpoint) will be given 
the option to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6-month open-label extension period, in 
which all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab IV. Subjects participating in the open-
label extension will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. All subjects will return 
for an Exit visit approximately  4 weeks after their last dose of study  agent as well as a follow -
up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of study agent. These visits apply to 
subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early from the open-label 
extension.
After the 6-month open-label extension phase, subjects who wish to continue treatment may 
do so by being prescribed commerciall y available belimumab. If belimumab is not 
commerciall y available in a subject’s country of participation, the subject may continue to 
receive belimumab under a separate continuation protocol. A separate informed consent will 
be provided for the continuation protocol. The 8 week follow-up visit is not required for 
subjects entering the continuation protocol.
Dose and Schedule
Investigational Study Agent (Belimumab or Placebo)
The dose and schedule of belimumab proposed for use in the ANCA-associated vasculitis 
study is the same dosage (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 4 weeks thereafter) 
and route of administration (IV) as that approved for marketing. The belimumab BDS and 
FDP that will be used for this study  is the same as that approved for marketing.
In the Phase 3 IV SLE studies, several clinicalmeasures of improvement including the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Week 52 (SRI), SELENA SLEDAI reductions, severe flare risk 
reduction, and complement normalization generally favored the 10 mg/kg dose. Trends 
toward clinically significant steroid reduction were present for both doses. Additionally , there 
appeared to be a greater dose response in subjects with high disease and serological activity. 
There was no apparent dose-response in the safety profile of belimumab with both doses 
being generally well-tolerated. These data supported the selection of 10 mg/kg belimumab as 
2013N160488_0 1

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
the marketed dose in general SLE, and also support its continued evaluation in combination 
with standard maintenance therapies in patients with WG or MPA.
The use of placebo in this trial is considered appropriate and does not put placebo patients at 
undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo group and the belimumab group will 
receive standard of care maintenance therapies for vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) 
and, ifneeded, subjects will receive appropriate rescue therapy in accordance with standard 
clinical practice as described above.
Induction and Maintenance Regimens for ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the s tudy:
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed by  pulses of 15 mg/kg every  
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses of cyclophosphamide are given as targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency  or white cell counts as dictated by  local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day .
Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith et al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide, the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX regimen specified in this vasculitis study is the 
same as that approved b y the FDA for this indication.
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauci and Wolff, 1973; Fauci et al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
2013N160488_0 1
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 36
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-02Addendum 01 ( Ireland)Summary of Modifications Belimumab
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayne et al, 2003)showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements 3 to 5 weeks 
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving < 10 mg/day  of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
achieved no more than 26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, 
subject randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, 
subjects will be randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + 
placebo or AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol must 
occur within 2 weeks of achieving a confirmed remission and the randomization will be 
stratified by  induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. In this study, subjects who have a known 
intolerance to azathioprine will be excluded. Subjects naive to azathioprine and who 
experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST 
or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by 
severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce 
the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience toxicities, a switch 
to methotrexate at doses of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be 
permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it isnot 
anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters 
et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included 
in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs physicians to follow the appropriate local 
prescribing information for azathioprine or methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during 
treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) and the 
Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC), and consensus was reached that these 
regimens are appropriate for this international trial. 
Complete details regarding the use of concurrent medications can be found in Section 5.5 of 
Protocol HGS1006- C1100.

Safety Considerations
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analyzed (after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee). The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Belimumab has not y et been studied following use of 
IV cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX); there is limited experience with the 
combination of belimumab and oral CYC. As an added safety precaution, initial 
randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction 
and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC reviews will occur after the first 20subjects per 
induction regimen (RTX or I V/oral CYC) have been randomized and have had a Week 8 visit. 
Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, 
safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding 
whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be applied for the first 
20subjects randomized following induction with CYC. The DMC will review the data 
approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction regimens. At all times the 
patients, study sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation. Investigators and 
IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting.
The DMC will be notified of:
• all unexpected causall y-related SAEs that ar e life-threatening or result in death;
• other unexpected causally -related SAEs;
• all reports of serious infections and opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship 
to study agent; and
• subjects experiencing IgG < 250 mg/dL; 
within protocol-specified timeframes. Based on these data, an ad hoc DMC meeting may be 
called at any time (see Section 8.3 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for additional detail 
regarding the DMC).
Based on the large body of safety data from SLE patients treated with belimumab and/or the 
mechanism of action of belimumab as a B cell immunosuppressant, anticipated potential risks 
of belimumab treatment in vasculitis patents include serious infusion and hypersensitivity  
reactions, infections, depression-related events, and malignancy . These risks are briefly 
reviewed here and are detailed more fully in the belimumab Investigator’s Brochure. Both 
investigators and subjects will be appropriately  informed regarding these risks. It is noted that 
because of the older patient population affected by this disease, the average age of subjects 
anticipated to participate in this study will be older than the average age of the SLE 
population studied to date (mean age of ~53 years at the time of diagnosis in vasculitis (Stone 
et al, 2010) compared with an average age of ~38 years in controlled Phase 3 studies of 
belimumab in SLE). As such, patients with vasculitis may be at a greater risk for infection 
than the SLE patients; however, the increased monitoring for infections by both the DMC 
(described above) and recommended to investigators (see below) will help to ensure subject 
safety through timely detection, treatment and reporting of infections.

The protocol states that all subjects should be monitored closely for infection and increased 
vigilance for infection is recommended in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL, 
especially for prolonged periods; clinical judgment should be applied with respect to the 
appropriateness of continuing study therapy in these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be 
consulted before administering subsequent doses of study agent in subjects with IgG levels 
<250 mg/dL. Study agent will be discontinued in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that 
are associated with a severe or serious infection. If a subject experiences a clinically 
significant, potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) AE that the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly  or probably  related to belimumab/placebo, then treatment with study  agent 
will be discontinued. The subject will be followed at regularly scheduled study visits as 
specified by the protocol through the end of the double-blind period and also until resolution 
of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).
In order to ensure subject safety with respect to infusion and hypersensitivity  reactions, the 
protocol excludes patients with known history of allergic reactions to human or murine 
proteins or monoclonal antibodies. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine 
whether premedication diminishes the frequency  or severity of hypersensitivity  reactions to 
belimumab. The protocol recommends that based on clinical judgment, premedication 
including an antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the 
infusion. Antihistamine H2-receptor antagonists (eg, ranitidine) are also permitted. 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to manage 
infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the 
subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigat ors/site personnel should be aware of the risk 
of hypersensitivity  reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor subjects 
closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placebo administration must be 
discontinued immediately  and the appropriate medical therapy administered. Per protocol, 
subjects are to remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 
2infusions in the double-blind treatment phase and the open-label extension. Should 
symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be 
appropriate, based on clinical judgment. This may include, but is not limited to, monitoring 
vital signs and observing for any untoward reactions. Beyond the first 2 infusions, subjects 
should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after infusion according to 
study sites’ guidelines or standard operating procedure for IV infusions. Subjects should be 
made aware of the potential risk, the signs and symptoms of such reactions, andthe 
importance of immediately seeking medical attention.
The protocol recommends that subjects with persistent or worsening disease should receive 
appropriate rescue therapy  in accordance with standard clinical practice, but if exceeding what 
is allowed per protocol, treatment with study agent (ie, belimumab or placebo) will be 
discontinued and the subject will be considered as having relapsed for the primary analysis. 
The list of prohibited medications that results in the subjects being considered as relapsed for 
the primary endpoint (Protocol Section 5.5.2.1), was developed because the need for the use 
of these agents (eg, RTX or CYC) is indicative of treatment failure (ie, disease relapse).
Moreover, concomitant use of such medications (eg, high-dose steroids) can be associated 
both with potent disease- modifying activit y and/or significant toxicity that may introduce

bias and confound interpretation of results. As such, no subject will be denied appropriate 
medical care for their condition due to their pa rticipation in this clinical study .
In addition, the Sponsor notes that although this is a placebo controlled trial, the sponsor does 
not consider that placebo patients are at undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo 
group and the belimumab group will receive standard of care maintenance therapies for 
vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate 
rescue therap y in accordance with standard clinical practice as described above.
Risk:Benefit Conclusi ons
In summary, the proposed Phase 3 study is a superiority  study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of belimumab for the maintenance of disease remission in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic poly angiitis. The ri sk:benefit profile of 
10 mg/kg IV belimumab in patients with active, autoantibody -positive SLE was demonstrated 
to be positive in the two Phase 3 SLE studies, thereby supporting its approval in Canada, the 
US, and the EU. Belimumab has already been shown to be effective in treating patients with 
active, autoantibody -positive SL E, a B cell mediated autoimmune disease. Like SL E, WG and 
MPA are also B cell mediated autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies (in this case, 
against neutrophil components), are considered to be pathogenic (Popa et al, 1999). In each of 
these diseases, the general purpose of the therapy is similar –reducing disease activity by 
down regulating B cells (including autoreactive B cells) and reducing the level autoantibodies 
produced by those autoreactive B cell clones. Down regulating B cell numbers may also 
reduce inflammatory  processes because of the role of B cells in antigen presentation. A 
limited amount of data from the IV Phase 3 studies suggests that belimumab may reduce 
vasculitic symptoms.
There are potential risks associated with belimumab treatment including serious infusion and 
hypersensitivity  reactions, infections, depression- related events, and malignancy ; however, in 
view of the serious and potentially  life threatening nature of disease flares in WG and MPA, it 
is believed that the overall risk:benefit analysis for belimumab in the maintenance of 
remission in WG and MPA is favorable, especially  in view of the nature of the trial as a 
superiority  trial over a current stan dard of care regimen.

Disease Background
The systemic vasculitides encompass a range of diseases affecting different sizes of blood 
vessels with a variety of etiologies including infective and drug-induced causes and can be 
either primary or secondary  to other diseases such as SLE. A subset of the primary small 
vessel vasculitides: Wegener’s granulomatosis; also known as granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), are 
characterized b y the presence of anti- neutrophil cy toplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (Jennette and 
Falk, 1997). ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem diseases with a broad 
range of manifestations from cutaneous ulcers, scleritis, pericarditis to lifethreatening 
manifestations such as lung hemorrhage and renal failure. All 3 forms of AAV share the 
characteristic of systemic necrotizing vasculitis; WG and CSS are further characterized by 
granuloma formation. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 2
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Historically , ANCA have been classified on the basis of their staining patterns in 
immunofluoresence assays as either cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) or perinuclear (P-ANCA). It is 
now recognized that in AAV, C-ANCA is usually directed against proteinase 3 (PR3), and P-
ANCA is generally directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), both of which are enzymes that 
are abundant in the granules of neutrophils (Jennette and Falk, 1997; Merkel et al, 1997). 
Anti-PR3 antibodies are generally associated with WG, while anti-MPO autoantibodies are 
more common in MPA and CSS. Anti -PR3 antibodies are associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality compared to anti-MPO. The most widely used classification criteria for 
diagnosing the 3 types of AAV are those published by the American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) for WG and CSS (Leavitt et al, 1990 and Masi et al, 1990, 
respectivel y), and that published by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) for MPA 
(Jennette et al, 1994). Of note, none of these diagnostic criteria incorporate the measurement 
of ANCA.
The precise epidemiology  of these diseases is uncertain as early studies did not utilize the 
same classification criteriaas later ones (Koldingsnes and Nossent, 2008; Watts et al, 2007). 
In the case of MPA, in particular, epidemiological studies are confounded by its original 
inclusion as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Utilizing the ACR or CHCC criteria, 
prevalence rates range from 5-16/100000 for WG, 2.5-9.4/100000 for MPA, and 0.4-
1.4/100000 for CSS making the latter the least prevalent of the three by some margin 
(Koldingsnes et al, 2008). AAV are extremely  rare in childhood with peak age of onset in 
those aged 65 to 74 years (Ntatski et al, 2010), with other small vessel vasculitides being the 
major concern in childhood (Brogan et al, 2010).Current therapy is usually determined by 
severity of the disease, with more severe forms warranting more aggressive approaches . These 
usually involve an initial remission induction regimen of high dose corticosteroid 
administered with either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX) followed by a 
remission maintenance period usually with azathioprine (Stone et al, 2010; Bosch et al, 2007; 
Jayne et al, 2003). Minor manifestations are usually treated with low dose corticosteroid 
administered with either azathioprine or methotrexate (Belmont, 2006). Even with recent 
treatment advances the morbidity  and mortality of patients with AAV remains unacceptabl y 
high (Drooger et al, 2009).
The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was developed and validated as a tool to 
measure disease activity (Luqmani et al, 1994). It has been modified to form the BVAS/WG 
(Stone et al, 2001) and updated most recently with the validation of version 3 of the 
instrument, also known as BVAS 2003 (Mukht yar et al, 2009). In its current form it is a list of 
56 items which are considered to be manifestations of vasculitis. A weighted numerical score 
is attached to each item to reflect the importance of each manifestation. The items are grouped 
by organ systems, and each organ system has a maximum or ‘ceiling’ score to reflect the 
relative importance of the organ system (Mukhtyar et al, 2009). The tool also makes a 
distinction between new or worsening disease and persistent disease with new or worsening 
attracting higher scores.
IV Belimumab
Over 2,000 individuals with SL E have been treated with belimumab in clinical studies. In two 
global Phase 3 studies, belimumab 10 mg/kg met the primary efficacy endpoint (SRI at 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 3

Week52). Evidence of other possible benefits in these trials included reductions in risk of 
severe flare and corticosteroid use, and improvements in patient reported quality of life and 
fatigue. Serol ogical activity was reduced as measured by reductions in autoantibodies and 
normalization of hypergammaglobulinemia and complement levels. B cells, including 
autoreactive B cells, were also reduced, but not severely  depleted, consistent with what would 
be expected from inhibition of BLyS (reference belimumab IB, Section 5.3.1). These results 
supported the approval of belimumab in the EU, US, Canada and other countries.
In the United States belimumab is approved for the following indication:
BENLYSTA®  (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, 
autoantibody -positive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard 
therapy.
Limitations of Use: The efficacy of BENLYSTA has not been evaluated in patients with 
severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. BENLYSTA 
has not been studied in combination with other biologics or intravenous 
cyclophosphamide. Use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in these situations.
In the EU, the approved indication focuses on patients with high disease activity (where 
belimumab offered the greatest benefit):
Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, 
autoantibodypositive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease 
activity (e.g positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.
The EU SPC also includes special warnings and precautions for use similar to the US 
labeling, including that belimumab has not been studied in and is thus not recommended in 
patients with severe active central nervous system lupus or severe active lupus nephritis. In 
addition, caution should be exercised if belimumab is co-administered with other B cell 
targeted therapy or cyclophosphamide. Reference Section 4.4 of the SPC for thecomplete list 
of specials warnings and precautions.
Treatment with belimumab plus standard therapy was generally well tolerated, with rates of 
AEs, severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and serious/severe infections 
generally comparable to therates observed in the placebo plus standard therapy group. The 
most commonly -reported adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 3% of patients receiving 10 mg/kg 
belimumab IV in clinical trials (and at a ≥ 1% greater rate than placebo) were nausea, 
diarrhea, pyrexia, nasophary ngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity , depression, 
migraine, pharyngitis, cystitis, leukopenia, and gastroenteritis viral. In clinical trials, 
hypersensitivity  and infusion reactions were observed more frequently with belimumab, with 
anaphylaxis observed in ≤ 1% of subjects. Data from the post-marketing setting indicate that 
hypersensitivity  reactions may be serious or result in death, that the onset of such reactions 
may be delayed, and that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant 
hypersensitivity  may be at increased risk. In addition, it is also known from clinical trials and 
the post-marketing setting that the vast majority of hypersensitivity  reactions occur with the

1stor 2ndinfusion. The product labeling, belimumab IB, protocol, and informed consent forms 
have been updated to include this new information, as applicable.
Other risks that may be associated with belimumab based on its mechanism of action include 
serious infections and malignancy , although no increases in the rates of serious infections or 
malignancies have been observed. Psychiatric events including depression and suicide were 
observed more frequently  with belimumab than with placebo, although it is unknown if 
belimumab treatment is associated with an increased risk for these events. Finally, mortality 
rates in the controlled clinical trials were low, although numerically  higher in the belimumab 
groups (0.4% and 0.8% in the placebo and belimumab groups, respectively ). Causes of death 
were as expected in an SLE population with active disease receiving a wide range of standard 
therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and included infection, 
cardiovascular disease, and suicide.
Experience from open-label, long-term continuatio n trials of belimumab in SLE patients 
suggests prolonged treatment with belimumab remains generally well tolerated, with no 
apparent increase in the incidence of AEs or SAEs over time, including important events such 
as infections and malignancies. Long-term belimumab treatment appears to provide sustained 
improvement in SL E disease activity  and reduction of flares.
Belimumab in A NCA-Associated Vasculitis
Study Overview and Patient Population
Belimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg in combination with standard SLE therapy demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically meaningful reduction in SLE disease activity versus 
placebo plus standard SLE therapy  at Week 52 in two Phase 3 clinical studies in subj ects with 
active, autoantibod y-positive SL E.
Studies in subjects with WG and MPA have shown the need for more effective treatment for 
the maintenance of remission, with relapse rates with these 2 diseases ranging from 15% at 18 
months (Jay ne et al, 2003) t o 38% at 3 years (Hiemstra et al, 2010) on azathioprine –the most 
effective of current therapies (Jay ne et al, 2003; Pagnoux et al, 2008; Hiemstra et al, 2010).
The presence of ANCA autoantibodies in AAV implicates B cells in the pathogenesis of 
AAV. Further supporting a role for B cells is the fact that activated B cells are present in 
greater numbers in GPA subjects compared with healthy persons (Popa et al, 1999). 
Additionally , elevated levels of BLyS, a B cell survival factor, are found in subjects with 
AAV (Krumbholz et al, 2005; Nagai et al, 2011; Schneeweis et al, 2010). Together, these 
provide a strong pharmacologic rationale for the use of belimumab to treat AAV, since 
belimumab has been shown in SL E to reduce both B cells and autoantibody  levels. Therefore, 
for the proposed study, subjects are required to have documented evidence of anti-PR3 or 
anti-MPO autoantibodies prior to randomization, as this population is considered the mostly 
likely to benefit from treatment with a B cell modulating agent like belimumab. This is 
consistent with the Phase 3 SLE results for belimumab where the subjects who benefitted 
from treatment were those who were antinuclear antibody (ANA/anti -dsDNA) autoantibody 
positive at baseline.
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 5
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
The fact that rituximab, a biologic therapy that targets B cells by binding to the B cell surface 
antigen CD20, recentl y showed success in inducing remission in AAV (Stone et al, 2010) and 
was granted approval in the US for the treatment of WG and MPA supports the rationale that 
belimumab, which down regulates B cells by targeting BLyS, may be useful in the treatment 
of this disease. Finally , limited data from the small (n = 111) subset of subjects in the Phase 3 
trials of SLE who had vasculitic symptoms as part of their SLE (as assessed by the SELENA 
SLEDAI) showed that more subjects in the belimumab plus standard of care treatment arms 
had resolution of their vasculitic symptoms at Week 52 compared with subjects receiving 
placebo plus standard of care. Specificall y, 19/36 (52.8%) and 28/38 (73.7%) of subjects in 
the belimumab 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose groups, respectivel y, had resolution of vasculitic 
activity at Week 52 compared with 15/37 (40.5%) of placebo subjects. Taken together, these 
data support the evaluation of belimumab in AAV.
Thesafety of the proposed study is supported by data from the Phase 2 and 3 trials in SLE in 
which subjects who were receiving belimumab in combination with significant background 
therapies, including steroids and immunosuppressants, had an adverse event profile similar to 
that of subjects receiving placebo plus standard therapies.
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of belimumab in combination with azathioprine for the maintenance of 
remission in subjects with systemic Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) or microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA) following a standard induction regimen. Subjects enrolled into the study 
must have a clinical diagnosis of WG or MPA according to the Chapel Hill criteria and must 
have had an initial or relapsing episode of moderate to severely active WG or MPA that was 
treated with corticosteroids and either CYC or RTX in the 6 months leading up to 
randomization. Subjects treated with 1 of the following induction regime ns will be eligible for 
participation in the study:
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2 mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed b y pulses of 15 mg/kg every 
3 weeks plus HDCS.
The doses of CYC are given as targets but may be adjusted for renal insufficiency  or white 
cell counts as dictated b y local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day .
A target of 300 to 400 subjects who are within 26 weeks of starting induc tion therapy , achieve 
a BVAS v.3 score of 0 (ie, are in remission), and are receiving less than 10 mg/day  prednisone 
(or equivalent) on 2 consecutive measurements 21 to 35 days apart will be enrolled into the 
study. Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
study agent (belimumab [10 mg/kg] or placebo) administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 hour. 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 6
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
Study agent (belimumab/placebo) will be administered at Day 0, 14, and every 28 days 
thereafter. Randomization will be performed on Day 0. Day 0  (first administration of 
belimumab/placebo) must occur no more than 2 weeks after confirmation of remission.
All subjects (in both the belimumab and placebo groups) will be treated with oral azathioprine 
(AZA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Azathioprine must be initiated at any time following 
confirmation of remission up to and including Day 0. Patients with known intolerance to 
azathioprine will be excluded from the trial. Subjects naïve to azathioprine who develop 
Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST or ALT > 2 times ULN, or a severe 
gastrointestinal hypersensitivity  reaction, characterized by severe nausea and vomiting, 
following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce the dose to no less than 
1mg/kg/day .If the subject continues to experience the toxicities described above, a switch to 
methotrexate at a target dose of 25 mg/week (and no less than 10 mg/week) as an alternative 
to azathioprine will be permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated
immunomodulatory  agents, it is not anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute 
methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters et al, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is 
substituted for azathioprine will be included in the primary  analysis.
The randomization will be stratified according to ANCA type (anti-PR3 vs. anti-MPO), 
disease stage at induction (initial diagnosis vs. relapsing disease), and induction regimen (IV 
CYC vs. oral CYC vs. RTX). It is anticipated that no more than 25% of the patientswould be 
newly diagnosed and anti-MPO positive, and as such enrollment of these patients may be 
capped if they exceed this proportion. Refer to Section 4 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for a 
complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The primary efficacy endpoint is time from Day 0 to the first relapse, defined as at least 
1major BVAS item or a minimum total BVAS score of 6 or receipt of prohibited medications 
according to the protocol. Subjects will receive study agent (belimumab/placebo) plus AZA 
until the results from the primary efficacy analysis are available or until they experience a 
flare (relapse) as defined in the primary efficacy endpoint. The database will be locked and 
the primary analysis will be performed after at least 66 subjects have experienced a relapse 
and at least 12 months have elapsed after the last subject is randomized. Subjects who 
discontinue study agent prior to relapse/flare are to be followed per the double blind visit 
schedule until relapse/flare or the end of the double-blind treatment phase (whichever is 
earlier). In subjects who withdraw consent from the study prior to 1 year an attempt will be 
made to ascertain survival status at 12 months after the first dose of stud y agent.
If top line data from the double blind portion of this trial show that belimumab is superior to 
placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint, and the safety profile of belimumab is acceptable, 
subjects who receive treatment with study agent until the completion of the double-blind 
period of the study and have not relapsed (as defined by the primary endpoint) will be given 
the option to receive treatment with belimumab in a 6-month open-label extension period, in 
which all subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab IV. Subjects participating in the open-
label extension will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. All subjects will return 
for an Exit visit approximately  4 weeks after their last dose of study  agent as well as a follow -
up visit approximately  8 weeks after the last dose of study agent.These visits apply to

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
subjects who have completed as well as those who have withdrawn early from the open-label 
extension.
After the 6-month open-label extension phase, subjects who wish to continue treatment may 
do so by being prescribed commerciall y available belimumab. If belimumab is not 
commerciall y available in a subject’s country of participation, the subject may continue to 
receive belimumab under a separate continuation protocol. A separate informed consent will 
be provided for the continuation protocol. The 8 week follow-up visit is not required for 
subjects entering the continuation protocol.
Dose and Schedule
Investigational Study Agent (Belimumab or Placebo)
The dose and schedule of belimumab proposed for use in the ANCA-associated vasculitis 
study is the same dosage (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 4 weeks thereafter) 
and route of administration (IV) as that approved for marketing. The belimumab BDS and 
FDP that will be used for this study  is the same as that approved for marketing .
In the Phase 3 IV SLE studies, several clinical measures of improvement including the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Week 52 (SRI), SELENA SLEDAI reductions, severe flare risk 
reduction, and complement normalization generally favored the 10 mg/kg dose. Trends 
toward clinically significant steroid reduction were present for both doses. Additionally , there 
appeared to be a greater dose response in subjects with high disease and serological activity. 
There was no apparent dose-response in the safety profile ofbelimumab with both doses 
being generally well-tolerated. These data supported the selection of 10 mg/kg belimumab as 
the marketed dose in general SLE, and also support its continued evaluation in combination 
with standard maintenance therapies in patient s with WG or MPA.
The use of placebo in this trial is considered appropriate and does not put placebo patients at 
undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo group and the belimumab group will 
receive standard of care maintenance therapies for vasc ulitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) 
and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate rescue therapy in accordance with standard 
clinical practice as described above.
Induction and Maintenance Regimens for ANCA -Associated Vasculitis
Subjects participating in this trial will have had a moderate to severe episode of WG or MPA 
that was treated with high-dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and either RTX or CYC (IV or oral) 
to induce the remission of the disease. Subjects treated under the following induction 
regimens will be eligible for participation in the study :
A single course of RTX administered at a dose of 375 mg /m2/week for 4 weeks plus high 
dose corticosteroids (HDCS) OR
CYC 2mg/kg/day  orally plus HDCS OR
CYC 3 IV pulses of 15 mg/kg given 2 weeks apart followed b y pulses of 15 mg/kg every 
3 weeks plus HDCS.

Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
The doses of cyclophosphamide are given as targets but may be adjusted for renal 
insufficiency  or white cell counts as dictated by  local practice.
The recommended HDCS regimen with any of the above induction therapies is: 
methylprednisolone pulses of up to 1000 mg IV each for 1-3 days, followed by 1 mg/kg/day 
not to exceed 80 mg/day  and tapered as clinicall y appropriate to reach < 10 mg/day .
Rituximab was approved in April 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of WG and MPA. It has 
been used in induction of remission in AAV for a number of years, (Gorman et al, 2003, 
Smith et al, 2006) and 2 recent trials published in 2010 (Stone et al, 2010), demonstrated non -
inferiority  to induction with cyclophosphamide , the latter of these trials being used as the 
basis for the recent US approval. The RTX regimen specified in this vasculitis study is the 
same as that approved b y the FDA for this indication.
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day orally or IV 15 mg every 2 weeks for 3 doses and every 
3weeks thereafter) plus prednisone has been the standard induction regimen for WG and 
MPA since the early 1970s when initial work by Fauci and Wolff at the National Institutes of 
Health showed that this regimen induced disease remission in 12/14 patients and subsequent 
work showed that survival rates increased 80% using this regimen in what was previously an 
uniformly  fatal disease (Fauci and Wolff, 1973; Fauci et al, 1983; Hoffman et al, 1992; 
Langford, 2011). Long term continued cyclophosphamide use, however, has been associated 
with significant toxicities (including infection, cystitis, cytopenias, and long term 
complications such as myelod ysplasia and bladder cancer) and mortality  (Langford, 2011).
A more recent study conducted by the European Vasculitis Group (Jayne et al, 2003) showed 
that after initial disease remission with cyclophosphamide and steroids, subjects could be 
switched to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day ) without having an increased risk of relapse compared 
to subjects whose remission was maintained using continued cy clophosphamide treatment. An 
induction regimen of CYC + prednisone followed by  maintenance treatment with azathioprine 
is now considered the standard of care, given that administration of cyclophosphamide for 
longer durations does not offer an advantage from an efficacy standpoint and is associated 
with a greater potential for toxicity (Langford, 2011). The cyclophosphamide regimens 
described above are the same as those allowed in the inclusion criteria for this vasculitis 
study.
Once disease remission (defined as having, on 2 consecutive measurements 3 to 5 weeks 
apart: a BVAS v3 score of 0 and be receiving < 10 mg/day  of oral prednisone [or equivalent], 
achieved no more than 26 weeks after the first dose of induction therapy) has been achieved, 
subject randomization into this protocol occurs. In this maintenance of remission trial, 
subjects will be randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + 
placebo or AZA (2 mg/kg/day ) + belimumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization in this protocol must 
occur within 2 weeks of achieving a confirmed remission and the randomization will be 
stratified by  induction regimen.
The primary  safety population for the SLE indication, including 473 subjects who were taking 
azathioprine as a concomitant medication at baseline, provides a substantial amount of safety 
data to support the conduct of the proposed trial. In this study, subjects who have a known 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 9
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
intolerance to azathioprine will be excluded. Subjects naive to azathioprine and who 
experience azathioprine -related toxicity (Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia or thrombocy topenia, AST 
or ALT 2 times ULN, or a several gastrointestina l hypersensitivity  reaction characterized by 
severe nausea and vomiting), following initiation of azathioprine will be permitted to reduce 
the dose to no less than 1 mg/kg/day . If the subject continues to experience toxicities, a switch 
to methotrexate at doses of up to 25 mg/week as an alternative to azathioprine will be 
permitted. As azathioprine is among the better tolerated immunomodulatory  agents, it is not 
anticipated that many subjects will need to substitute methotrexate for azathioprine (Walters 
etal, 2010). Subjects for whom methotrexate is substituted for azathioprine will be included 
in the primary analysis. The protocol instructs physicians to follow the appropriate local 
prescribing information for azathioprine or methotrexate (as applicable) prior to and during 
treatment.
Input on selection of these standard of care regimens was obtained from international experts 
in vasculitis, including members of the EUVAS and VCRC consortiums, including Dr  
 and Dr  and consensus was reached that these regimens are appropriate for 
this international trial. Please also refer to Sub -Appendix 1 which includes a signed letter from 
Dr  confirming that the induction regimen and maintenance regimen proposed for 
Study HGS1006-C1100are currently used as standard of care in clinical practice for the 
treatment of ANCA -associated vasculitis in Europe.
Complete details regarding the use of concurrent medications can be found in Section 5.5 of 
Protocol HGS1006- C1100.
Safety Consideration s
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data on an ongoing 
basis until the data are locked and analyzed (after which monitoring may be assumed by an 
internal HGS committee). The DMC will include at least 3 physicians and a statistician, none 
of whom are affiliated with the Sponsor. Belimumab has not y et been studied following use of 
IV cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX); there is limited experience with the 
combination of belimumab and oral CYC. As an added safety precaution, initial 
randomization will be limited to 40 subjects per induction regimen (40 post-RTX induction 
and 40 post-CYC induction). The first DMC reviews will occur after the first 20 subjects per 
induction regimen (RTX or IV/oral CYC) have been randomized a nd have had a Week 8 visit. 
Once the first 20 subjects randomized following induction with RTX have had a Week 8 visit, 
safety data will be reviewed by the DMC, who will make a recommendation regarding 
whether to continue randomization. The same procedure would be applied for the first 
20subjects randomized following induction with CYC. The DMC will review the data 
approximately  every 6 months thereafter across both induction regimens. At all times the 
patients, study sites and sponsor will remain blinded to treatment allocation. Investigators and 
IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each DMC meeting.
The DMC will be notified of:
• all unexpected causall y-related SAEs that are life -threatening or result in death;
• other unexpected causally -related SAEs;

• all reports of serious infections and opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship 
to study agent; and
• subjects experiencing IgG < 250 mg/dL; 
within protocol-specified timeframes. Based on these data, an ad hoc DMC meeting may be 
called at any time (see Section 8.3 of Protocol HGS1006 -C1100 for additional detail 
regarding the DMC).
Based on the large body of safety data from SLE patients treated with belimumab and/or the 
mechanism of action of belimumab as a B cell immunosuppressant, an ticipated potential risks 
of belimumab treatment in vasculitis patents include serious infusion and hypersensitivity  
reactions, infections, depression-related events, and malignancy . These risks are briefly 
reviewed here and are detailed more fully in the belimumab Investigator’s Brochure. Both 
investigators and subjects will be appropriately  informed regarding these risks. It is noted that 
because of the older patient population affected by this disease, the average age of subjects 
anticipated to participate in this study will be older than the average age of the SLE 
population studied to date (mean age of ~53 years at the time of diagnosis in vasculitis (Stone 
et al, 2010) compared with an average age of ~38 years in controlled Phase 3 studies of 
belimumab in SLE). As such, patients with vasculitis may be at a greater risk for infection 
than the SLE patients; however, the increased monitoring for infections by both the DMC 
(described above) and recommended to investigators (see below) will help to ensure subject 
safety through timely detection, treatment and reporting of infections.
The protocol states that all subjects should be monitored closely for infection and increased 
vigilance for infection is recommended in subjects who experience IgG levels < 250 mg/dL, 
especially for prolonged periods; clinical judgment should be applied with respect to the 
appropriateness of continuing study therapy in these subjects. The Medical Monitor must be 
consulted before administering subsequent doses of study agent in subjects with IgG levels 
<250 mg/dL. Study agent will be discontinued in subjects with IgG levels < 250 mg/dL that 
are associated with a severe or serious infection. If a subject experiences a clinically 
significant, potentially  life-
threatening (Grade 4) AEthat the investigator believes may be 
definitely , possibly  or probably  related to belimumab/placebo, then treatment with study  agent 
will be discontinued. The subject will be followed at regularly scheduled study visits as 
specified by the protocol through the end of the double-blind period and also until resolution 
of the AE(s) (whichever is longer).
In order to ensure subject safety with respect to infusion and hypersensitivity  reactions, the 
protocol excludes patients with known history of allergic reactions to human or murine 
proteins or monoclonal antibodies. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine 
whether premedication diminishes the frequency  or severity of hypersensitivity  reactions to 
belimumab. The protocol recommends that based on clinical judgment, premedication 
including an antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the 
infusion. Antihistamine H2-receptor antagonists (eg, ranitidine) are also permitted. 
Belimumab/placebo will be administered by investigators/site personnel prepared to manage 
infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the 
subject develops an infusion reaction. Investigators/site personnel should be aware of the risk 
of hypersensitivity  reactions, which may present as infusion reaction, and monitor subjects 
Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Confidential Page 11
Protocol HGS1006 -C1100-01Addendum 01 (Sweden) Summary of Modifications Belimumab
closely. In the event of a serious reaction, belimumab/placebo administration must be 
discontinued immediately  and the appropriate medical therapy administered. Per protocol, 
subjects are to remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first 
2infusions in the double-blind treatment phase and the open-label extension. Should 
symptoms of acute hypersensitivity  occur, an extended period of monitoring may be 
appropriate, based on clinical judgment. This may include, but is not limited to, monitoring 
vital signs and observing for any untoward reactions. Beyond the first 2 infusions, subjects 
should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after infusion according to 
study sites’ guidelines or standard operating procedure for IV infusions. Subjects should be 
made aware of the potential risk, the signs and symptoms of such reactions, and the 
importance of immediately seeking medical attention.
The protocol recommends that subjects with persistent or worsening disease should receive 
appropriate rescue therapy  in accordance with standard clinical practice, but if exceeding what 
is allowed per protocol, treatment with study agent (ie, belimumab or placebo) will be 
discontinued and the subject will be considered as having relapsed for the primary analysis. 
The list of prohibited medications that results in the subjects being considered as relapsed for 
the primary endpoint (Protocol Section 5.5.2.1), was developed because the need for the use 
of these agents (eg, RTX or CYC) is indicative of treatment failure (ie, disease relapse).
Moreover, concomitant use of such medications (eg, high-dose steroids) can be associated 
both with potent disease- modifying activit y and/orsignificant toxicity  that may introduce
bias and confound interpretation of results. As such, no subject will be denied appropriate 
medical care for their condition due to their participation in this clinical study .
In addition, the Sponsor notes that although this is a placebo controlled trial, the sponsor does 
not consider that placebo patients are at undue risk because all subjects in both the placebo 
group and the belimumab group will receive standard of care maintenance therapies for 
vasculitis (ie, azathioprine or methotrexate) and, if needed, subjects will receive appropriate 
rescue therap y in accordance with standard clinical practice as described above.
Risk:Benefit Conclusions
In summary, the proposed Phase 3 study is a superiority  study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of belimumab for the maintenance of disease remission in patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic poly angiitis. The risk:benefit profile of 
10 mg/kg IV belimumab in patients with active, autoan tibody-positive SLE was demonstrated 
to be positive in the two Phase 3 SLE studies, thereby supporting its approval in Canada, the 
US, and the EU. Belimumab has already been shown to be effective in treating patients with 
active, autoantibody -positive SL E,a B cell mediated autoimmune disease. Like SL E, WG and 
MPA are also B cell mediated autoimmune diseases in which autoantibodies (in this case, 
against neutrophil components), are considered to be pathogenic (Popa et al, 1999). In each of 
these diseases, the general purpose of the therapy is similar –reducing disease activity by 
down regulating B cells (including autoreactive B cells) and reducing the level autoantibodies 
produced by those autoreactive B cell clones. Down regulating B cell numbers may also
reduce inflammatory  processes because of the role of B cells in antigen presentation. A

limited amount of data from the IV Phase 3 studies suggests that belimumab may reduce 
vasculitic sy mptoms.
There are potential risks associated with belimumab treatment including serious infusion and 
hypersensitivity  reactions, infections, depression- related events, and malignancy ; however, in 
view of the serious and potentially  life threatening nature of disease flares in WG and MPA, it 
is believed that the overall risk:benefit analysis for belimumab in the maintenance of 
remission in WG and MPA is favorable, especially  in view of the nature of the trial as a 
superiority  trial over a current standard of care regimen.

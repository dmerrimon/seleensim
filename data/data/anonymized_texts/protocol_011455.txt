 Study Design  Phase 2a, open -label , dose-escalation , safety, tolerability , and activity study  
Methodol ogy Subjects who have signed an Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee - (IEC)-approved informed consent form  (ICF)  and who 
have met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. 
Approximately  48 subjects will be enrolled  to receive orally administered 
KD025 200  mg once daily ( QD), KD025 200 mg twice daily ( BID_, or 
KD025 400 mg QD. Study drug will be administered in  28-day cycles until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Subjects may receive 
study drug in the inpatient or outpatient setting.  
Cohort 1  16 subjects  200 mg KD025 QD  
Cohort 2 16 subjects  200 mg KD025 BID  
Cohort 3 16 subjects  400 mg KD025  QD  
BID = twice daily; QD = once daily  
Prior to enrolling subsequent cohorts, t he safety data in each previous 
cohort will be evaluated after 8 subjects have reached 2 months of treatment 
to assure there is no safety signal.  If ≥ 25% of subjects in a cohort 
experience a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 
v4.03 Grade 2 liver toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade  3 (or higher) adverse 
event ( AE) in the same organ or body system, or if >  25% of subjects in a 
cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then dose 
escalation to the next cohort will not occur, and all subject s in that dose 
cohort will be dose reduced.       
If ≥ 25% of subjects in the 200 mg QD cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 
Grade 2 l iver toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the 
same organ or body system, or if >  25% of subjects in a cohort are 
discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then further dosing will 
not occur and the study will be terminated.  
Respon se criteria will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle, starting at 
Cycle  2 Day 1 , as well as the end of treatment (EOT) visit using the criteria 
of 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project on Clinical Trials in cGVHD 
(CR, PR, or lack of response (unchanged, mi xed, or progression); see 
Appendix  B).   
cGVHD severity (clinician -reported) and symptom (subject -reported) 
assessments will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle starting at Cycle 1 
Day 1  as well as the EOT visit using the Physi cian-reported Global Chronic 
GVHD Activity Assessment form (Appendix A),  cGVHD Activity 
Assessment: Patient Self Report, and Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale (see 
Appendices C  and D).  
At Cycle 25 Day 1 (C25D1) and all odd cycles thereafter (ie, C27D1, 
C29D1, C31D1, etc.), subjects will receive 2 cycles worth of study drug 
along with  2 diaries and will return to the clinic at the next odd cycle for

 assessments and investigational  product  (IP) accountability.  Investigators 
and/or subjects have the option of coming into the clinic at one or more 
even cycles (ie, C26D1, C28D1, C30D1, etc .).  On even cycles, when 
subjects  do not come to clinic, the study staf f will contact the patient  via 
phone  and document any new adverse events and concomitant medications.  
Subjects will also undergo pre-specified safety assessments  throughout the 
study.   
Follow-Up Period 
Follow -Up visits will occur 28 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study 
drug. Subjects will undergo physical examinations ( PEs); vital sign 
measurements; blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, and 
pharmacodynamic ( PD) markers; urinalysis; ECGs; AE assessments; 
concomitant medication assessments; and pregnancy testing f or females of 
childbearing potential.  
Long -Term Follow -Up 
Subjects will be contacted approximately every 8 weeks and can be 
contacted via telephone, email , or postal mail to confirm survival status and 
the initiation of any anti -cancer treatment or any cha nges in treatment of 
cGVHD. This can also be confirmed from electronic medical records . 
Number of Subjects  Approximately 48 subjects (adult male and female) total will be enrolled 
(16 subjects in each KD025 dose cohort ).  
Approximate Duration 
of Subject Participation  After approximately 3 weeks for screening, study drug will be administered 
in 28 -day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs  
followed by  4 weeks  of follow -up. 
Subjects will be contacted approximately every 8 weeks and  can be 
contacted via telephone, email or postal mail to confirm survival status and 
the initiation of any anti -cancer treatment or any changes in treatment of 
cGVHD. This can also be confirmed from electronic medical records

Investigational 
Product/Study Drug   KD025 will be provided as 100  mg capsules  or 200  mg tablets . 
Dosage and 
Administration  Subjects will receive KD025 200 mg QD, KD025 200 mg BID, or KD025 
400 mg QD. Subjects should take study drug with a meal or within 
5 minutes of completing a meal.  
Duration of Treatment  Study drug will be administered in 28 -day cycles until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Concomitant Treatment  
 Subjects will be counseled to avoid non -prescribed medicines or 
complementary alternative me dicines excluded by the study. Use of drugs 
that prolong QT/QTc should be used with caution in subjects who are 
receiving KD025 .  
All medications a subject receives fro m the signing of informed consent 
through the 28 -Day Follow -Up visit  will be documented, including steroids  
and CNIs. 
Prohibited Medications  
The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (see Appendix H for a listing of these 
drugs) is pro hibited . 
Safety Evaluation  Safety assessments include AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), PEs, vital 
sign measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations (he matology, chemistry, 
and urinalysis ), pulmonary function tests ( PFTs ), and ECGs.

 Prior to enrollin g subsequent cohorts, the safety data in each previous 
cohort will be evaluated after 8 subjects have reached 2 months of treatment 
to assure there is no safety signal. Two months was selected as the time for 
the safety review because all of the clinically  significant KD025 -related 
AEs to date occurred within 36 days or less  of starting KD025 treatment .   
 
The AE reporting period for a subject enrolled in the study begins when the 
subject provides informed consent and is continued through 28 days after 
their last dose of study drug. All AEs that occur in enrolled subjects during 
the AE reporting period must be recorded, regardless of the relationship of 
the AE to study drug. Any known untoward event that occurs beyond the 
AE reporting period that the investi gator assesses as at least possibly related 
to study drug also should be reported to Kadmon . A Follow -Up Visit will 
occur 28 days after the last dose of study drug, but prior to starting on a 
new therapy if a new therapy is started earlier. This visit may be done 
within ± 7 days of the scheduled visit . 
 
Exacerbation of any of the signs or symptoms of the disease will constitute 
a potential rationale for cessation of therapy. Both laboratory and clinical 
data may constitute a reason to pause or cease therapy . Previous studies 
have indicated that reversible and modest liver toxicity may occur 
spontaneously after a few weeks of initiation of therapy .   
• When treatment -related Grade 3 toxicities occur, drug administration 
will be halted until recovery to at least  Grade 1, and study drug may 
be resumed at a reduced dose.   
• When treatment -related Grade 2 toxicities  other than liver toxicities  
that cannot definitively be attributed to a cause other than the study 
drug occur , drug administration will be halted until r ecovery to at 
least Grade 1 at which time study drug administration may resume at 
the same dose.   
• When greater than Grade 2 liver toxicities occur , drug administration 
will be halted until recovery to at least Grade 1 at which time  study 
drug administrati on may resume at a reduced dose.   
 
Pauses in therapy may not last more than 14 days; subjects requiring pauses 
of more than 14  days will be discontinued from the study.  If Grade 2 or 3 
treatment -related toxicities persist for 14 days, subjects will be dis continued 
from the study.    
 
Other organ -based toxicity has not been observed in clinical studies with 
KD025, but as this is the first study in cGVHD, careful monitoring of all 
toxicities will be carried out. CTCAE v4.03 grading will be used for all 
AEs.  
Activity Evaluation  The primary activity outcome will be the percentage of subjects who meet 
the overall response  (OR)  criteria (PR + CR). This will be assessed overall 
(ie, any subject meeting the PR or CR criteria at any time point).  
Response criteria  and a ctivity  in terms of cGVHD severity will be evaluated 
on Day 1 of each cycle starting at Cycle 2 Day 1 using the 
Physician -reported Global Chronic GVHD Activity Assessment Form, 
while activity  in terms of symptom burden will be evaluated using the

 cGV HD Activity Assessment —Patient Self -report . Failure -free survival , 
Overall Survival, TTNT,  and changes in corticosteroid and CNI dose will 
be documented . Changes in symptom burden/bother will be documented  
using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale. Compliance with  oral dosing will 
be confirmed using patient diaries.  
Pharmacokinetics  Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) for determination of plasma 
concentrations of KD025 and its metabolites, will be collected on Day 1 of 
Cycles 1  and 2 at the following time  points: Pre-dose (Time 0), and 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing (after first dose for subjects in the BID 
group). In addition, subjects will have samples collected pre-dose on Day 1 
of Cycle 4  and pre-dose at the Cycle 7, Day 1 visit. Subjects should be 
instructed to withhold taking study drug on these days as dosing will be 
performed at the clinic.   
Subjects will have a total 16 samples drawn (80 mL).  
KD025 and metabolite c oncentrations will be used to calculate the 
following PK parameters: C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-6hr. 
Pharmacodynamics  All subjects will have PD blood samples drawn 4 times over the course of 
the study : Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycl e 2 Day 1 (4 weeks), Cycle  4 
Day 1 (12 weeks)  and Cycle 7 Day 1 (24 weeks) . The samples will be 
analyzed to eval uate changes in the expression of several cytokines in 
plasma (including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of 
circulating Th17 and Treg cells  in blood .   
Statistical Analysis  Four  populations will be included in the analysis of study d ata: 
• The modified intent -to-treat (mITT)  population will consist of all 
subjects who are enrolled  in the study  and receive at least 1 dose of 
study medication .   
• The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of KD025  
• The PK population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 post -dose PK sample drawn  
 
All analyses of safety will be performed on the safety population while 
activity  will be performed on the mITT population.  
The primary activity  outcome will be the percentage of subjects who meet 
the OR criteria (PR + CR). This will be assessed overall (ie,  any subject 
meeting the PR or CR criteria at any time point).   
 
Assuming an underlying 25% rate for subjects to meet the OR, each 
treatment group of 16 subject s has an approximately 80% chance of having 
at least 3 subject s meet the overall response criteria, and approximately 
90% chance of at least 2 subjects meet the overall response criteria.  
 
The change in cGVHD severity will be evaluated using the 
Physician -reported Global cGVHD Activity Assessment form. The change 
in symptom burden will be evaluated using the cGVHD Activity 
Assessment - Patient Self -report.  Changes in symptom burden/bother will 
be documented  using the Le e cGVHD Symptom Scale and compared 
among KD025 treatment groups.

 The FFS will be defined as the time from first dose of study drug to either 
the start of another treatment, relapse of the underlying disease, or death. 
The time to FFS will be summarized fo r each treatment group.  
 
The OS will be defined as  the time from first dose of KD025 to the date of 
death due to any cause. Kaplan -Meier plots, descriptive statistics of OS and 
landmark OS at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months will be provided . 
 
The TTNT  will be defi ned as the  time from the first dose of KD025 to the 
start of additional systemic cGVHD therapy .  
 
Changes in corticosteroid and CNI dose will be evaluated and results will 
be summarized by treatment group.  Corticosteroids may be tapered at the 
discretion o f the investigator after 4  weeks of KD025 administration.  
 
The DOR is defined as the time of initial response until documented 
progression. Responses by organ system (PR and CR) will be assessed 
based on the 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project on Clinic al Trials 
in cGVHD.  
 
The exploratory outcome variables are expression of several cytokines 
(including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of 
immune -cell subtypes (including  Th17 and Treg cells ). Results will be 
summarized by treatment  group.   
 
Demographics, subject disposition, and screening and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized overall and by treatment group.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs will be evaluated using the CTCAE v4.03. The 
secondary safety outcome will be the number (%) of s ubjects experiencing 
AEs overall. The total sample size of 16 subjects per KD025 dose group 
will provide >  90% probability of one or more KD025 subjects 
experiencing an AE that has an underlying rate of ≥  14% and >  80% 
probability of one or more subjects i n the study experiencing an AE that has 
an underlying rate of ≥  10%.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by treatment group 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA®) System 
Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term  (PT), class ified from verbatim 
terms.   MedDRA® Version 20. 0 or higher will be used. The incidence and 
percentage of subjects with at least 1 occurrence of a preferred term will be 
included, according to the most severe grade using a 5 -point scale (mild, 
moderate, sev ere, life threatening, or death). The number of events per 
preferred term will also be summarized. Causality (relationship to study 
treatment) will be summarized separately.  
AEs, SAEs, treatment -related AEs , treatment -related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, 
treatment -related ≥ Grade 3 AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal or 
treatment discontinuation will be summarized overall and by treatment 
group according to SOC and PT. AEs will also be presented in listings. 
Duration of AEs will be dete rmined and included in listings, along with

 4. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
Chronic gr aft versus host disease (cGVHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) occurring in approximately 50% of transplant 
recipients and involving multiple organs. Patients with cGVHD require prolonged 
immunosuppressi ve treatment for an average of 2 to 3 years from the initial diagnosis, with 
10% of those surviving for at least 7 years still requiring immunosuppressive treatment at that 
time and beyond. Glucocorticoids, with or without CNIs , remain the standard initial  treatment, 
but significant side effects and unsatisfactory outcomes, particularly for patients with high -risk 
features of cGVHD, support the need for more effective and less toxic therapies.   
4.1. Study Rationale  
Recent studies have demonstrated that a pro -inflammatory interleukin ( IL)-17-producing lineage 
of T cells termed Th17 is actively involved in the pathogenesis of cGVHD. The development and 
function of Th17 cells is dependent on activation of STAT3, and transcription factors RORγt and 
IRF4. Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant activation of Rho -associated protein 
kinases 2 (ROCK2) leads to induction of IL -17 and IL -21 via the IRF4 -dependent mechanism. 
Moreover, inhibition of ROCK effectively decreased IL -17 production in vivo and ameliorated 
the development of autoimmun e models of arthritis, diabetes and lupus in mice. In addition, 
patients with cGVHD have a relative deficiency of regulatory T -cells ( Treg ). This deficiency 
appears to be a consequence of abnormalities in Treg homeostasis after HCT  wherein increased 
prolif eration of Treg s is not sufficient to compensate for reduced thymic output and increased 
susceptibility to apoptosis. Recent in vitro data indicate that KD025, a specific ROCK2 inhibitor, 
significantly reduced the production of IL -17 and IL -21 in CD4+ T ce lls in response to T cell 
receptor stimulation and positively regulated the suppressive function of Treg. Experiments in a 
mouse model of cGVHD show that KD025 can reverse lung pathology and improve pulmonary 
function tests  (PFTs) , decrease collagen deposi ted in the lungs, and decrease the number of 
germinal centers and frequency of T follicular helper cells in spleens. In a second rodent model, 
KD025 administration was effective in blocking the progression of chronic sclerodermatous 
GVHD. Thus , this study will evaluate the potential of KD025 to ameliorate the symptoms of 
cGVHD.

 4.2. Selection of Doses in this Study  
This study will evaluate KD025 at doses of 200 mg once daily (QD), KD025 200 mg twice daily 
(BID) , and KD025 400 mg QD. Preliminary data from an ong oing study of KD025 in patients 
with psoriasis suggest that the dose of 400 mg QD for 12 weeks is associated with clinical 
efficacy in psoriasis and is well tolerated.  
KD025 has a plasma elimination half -life of 5 -6 hours, indicating BID dosing may be nec essary 
for more consistent inhibition of ROCK2 in patients throughout a 24 -hour period , but whether 
BID dosing is more effective than QD dosing is unknown.  Thus, the optimal dosing frequency 
for KD025 will be examined in this study by enrolling subjects in  the two cohorts 200 mg BID 
and 400 mg QD. Safety data from prior studies in healthy human volunteers evaluating doses of 
500 mg BID for 28 days support the use of 400 mg QD in this study . 
The Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) includes additional nonclinical an d clinical information about 
KD025 .  
4.3. Previous Clinical Experience with  KD025  
To date, there have been 6 Phase 1 trials conducted with KD025 in normal healthy subjects: a 
single -ascending dose (SAD) trial (2119 -09-01), a combined single - and multiple -ascend ing dose 
(SAD/MAD) trial (KD025 -101), a MAD trial with QD and BID dosing (KD025 -102), a 
placebo -controlled safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study (KD025 -103), a food effect study 
(KD025 -105), and a PK study (KD025 -106) which compared a tablet formation with  capsule 
formulation of KD025 (final data showed that after a single dose of KD025 200 mg, KD025 was 
rapidly absorbed with no lag time observed under both fasted and fed states and no  statistically  
significant differences were observed between tablet and c apsule formulation under fed 
conditions ). A Phase 2a, open -label study in 8 adult subjects with moderately severe psoriasis 
vulgaris who have failed first -line therapy was recently completed (KD025 -205).  Additionally, a 
Phase 2 open -label, safety, and tole rability study in subjects with psoriasis vulgaris who have 
disease progression after 1 systemic therapy is currently on -going (KD025 -206).  
The SAD trial (SLx -2119 -09-01) assessed the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025. The dose 
levels of KD025 tested were 20, 40, 80, and 160  mg. Thirty -two subjects were enrolled in 
4 sequential cohorts of 8 subjects , randomized  with 6 receiving drug and 2  receiving placebo  in

 each cohort . No treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal, deaths, or 
serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in this trial. There were 14 TEAEs reported, 9  of 
which were determined by the investigator to be related to study drug  and were mild in severity. 
One subject at the 160 -mg KD025 dose level experienced joint swelli ng and arthralgia occurring 
after the follow -up visit. No subject had laboratory abnormalities during the dosing period or 
within 1  week after dosing. There were no changes in blood pressure or heart rate and no 
clinically significant QTcB  or corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula  (QTc[F]) 
parameters.  
KD025 was readily absorbed and was measured out to 24 hours in plasma. KD025 was the main 
analyte (>  90% parent derived area under the curve  [AUC ]) and KD025m2 was present at about 
5%, with KD025m1 < 1%. The half-life ( t1/2) of KD025 was approximately 5 –6 hours, 
supporting once - or twice -daily dosing.  
A combined SAD/MAD (KD025 -101) trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025 in 
healthy males with single doses followed by 1 week of rest a nd then 7  consecutive days of 
dosing. There were 8 cohorts with 8 subjects in each cohort. For each dosing cohort, 6 subjects 
received KD025 and 2 subjects received placebo. The dose levels studied were 40, 80, 120, 160, 
240, 320, 400, and 500 mg. Few TEAE s were reported and of those reported, the majority were 
determined by the investigator to be mild in severity. There were no SAEs reported during the 
study. One subject (No. 50008) was withdrawn because of  a TEAE that was considered not 
related to KD025 ( elevated blood creatinine phosphokinase [CPK] levels of moderate intensity).  
No clinically relevant clinical chemistry (apart from elevated [CPK] discussed above), 
hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis abnormalities were reported for any of the subjects. No 
clinically significant abnormalities were reported for any vital signs (systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure, or heart rate) or 12 -lead electrocardiogram  (ECG ) parameters and no subject had an 
abnormal physical examination  (PE) finding of concern.  
A MAD  trial (KD025 -102) was a single -center, placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized 
(6:2) study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of KD025 administered for 7 days in up to 
32 healthy male and postmenopausal female subjects. This study enrolled 4 cohorts with 
8 subjects in each cohort (6 subjects received KD025 and 2 subjects received placebo). The dose 
regimens studied were 500, 800, and 1000 mg administered QD, and 500 mg administered BID.

 All 32 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 31  subjects completed the study; all 
24 subjects completed all doses of study drug at 500 and 800 mg QD, and 500 mg BID. Seven of 
8 subjects completed all doses of study drug at 1000 mg QD. One subject randomized to active 
study drug 1000 mg QD receive d 6 days of study drug before being discontinued because of  a 
positive urine drug test.  
Multiple escalating doses of KD025 ranging from 500 mg to 800 mg to 1000 mg QD and 500 mg 
BID for 7 days were generally well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were reported in this 
study. Five treatment -related adverse events ( AEs) were reported in 4 subjects (16.7%) receiving 
KD025, including upper abdominal pain and diarrhea in 1 subject receiving 500 mg QD, nausea 
in 2 subjects receiving 500 mg BID, and diarr hea in 1 subject receiving 1000 mg QD. There was 
1 treatment -related AE of diarrhea in 1 subject (12.5%) receiving placebo. There were no 
treatment -related AEs in subjects receiving KD025 800 mg QD. No subjects discontinued study 
participation because of A Es. There were no clinically relevant changes and no clinically 
meaningful trends in hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis laboratory results attributable to 
study drug during this study. There were no SAEs or deaths.  
The following are PK conclusions  from  this study:  
• KD025 was rapidly absorbed after QD oral dose administration with median observed 
time to reach peak plasma concentration ( Tmax) values ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 hours 
post-dose. 
• Median T max values after BID dosing were more variable and ranged f rom 4.0 hours after 
the first dose to 12.0 hours after the second dose.  
• Mean t 1/2 values were similar across dose levels for each day, with values ranging from 
4.55 to 5.76 hours for Day 1 and from 7.68 to 9.73 hours for Day 7.  
• Mean KD025 maximum concentra tion observed  (Cmax) and area under the curve from 
0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24hr)values generally increased in a less than dose proportional 
manner with the increase in QD dose level from 500 to 1000 mg.  
• Overall exposure (AUC 0-24hr) following BID dose administr ation of 500 mg of KD025 
was 1.9 - to 2-fold higher than the AUC 0-24hr after QD dose administration of 1000  mg

 was 500 mg. There were no TEAEs, no treatment -related AEs, SAEs, or deaths reported in this 
study.  
The following are PK conclusions from this study:   
• A high fat meal given 30 minutes prior to KD025 oral administration had a significant 
effect on the PK of KD025.  
• Plasma systemic exposure (C max and AUCs) of KD025 was approximately 3 –fold higher 
under the fed state compared with the fasted state,  and the median T max value was delayed 
by 2 hours with food.  
• Similar food effects were observed for metabolites KD025m1 and KD025m2 as for the 
parent drug.  
• The high fat meal increased systemic exposure (mean C max and AUC 0-t values) by 
approximately 1.7 - to 2.3 -fold for metabolite KD025m1 and approximately 3.1 - to 
4.4-fold for metabolite KD025m2 compared with the fasted treatment.  
Recently completed, KD025 -205 was a Phase 2a, open -label study in 8 adult subjects with 
moderately severe psoriasis vulgaris who  had failed first -line therapy. The study evaluated the 
safety and tolerability of 200 mg KD025 daily for 28 days. Efficacy and activity measures 
included the evaluation of any decreases in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index in at least 50% of 
the subjects after 4 weeks of dosing with 200 mg of KD025 and improvement in the Physicians 
Global Assessment for psoriasis. Cytokine levels and expression associated with psoriasis were 
evaluated in pharmacodynamic (PD) whole blood samples and punch biopsies of select ed 
lesions, respectively, collected at baseline  and at the end of treatment. Eight subjects began 
treatment with KD025. Five SAEs were reported in this study and all 5 occurred in the same 
subject: Subject 001 -008 experienced Grade 2 vomiting (2 events), Grade 2 nausea (2 events), 
Grade 3 anastomotic ulcer (related to the subject's previous gastric bypass surgery), and Grade 3 
kidney stones, none of which were assessed to be related to study drug (she was subsequently 
discontinued after 20  days of dosing). Another subject experienced reversible grade 1 elevated 
ALT and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) on Day 22 with no known etiology and permanently 
discontinued treatment with KD025. The ALT/AST returned to normal levels 13 days after the 
last dose of KD025.  No other TEAEs or SAEs were reported.

 Follow -up for efficacy and activity measures in this study  has completed . The following PK 
conclusions can be made for this study:  
• KD025 was rapidly absorbed after oral dose administration with median T max values of 
2.0 hours and 4.0 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 28, respectively.  
• Mean  t½ for KD025 was 6. 08 hours and 5. 27 hours on Days 1 and 28, respectively.  
• Two metabolites (KD025m1 and KD025m2) rapidly appeared in plasma and were readily 
eliminated. No accumulation o f either metabolite was apparent after multiple doses.  
Exposure of daily dosing at 200  mg for 28 days was comparable to or slightly lower than that 
observed in study KD025 -101 for daily dosing at similar dose levels.    
KD025 -206 is an ongoing Phase 2, ope n-label, safety and tolerability study of KD025 in subjects 
with psoriasis vulgaris who have disease progression after at least 1 systemic therapy. The 
primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 daily dosing regimens 
(200 mg BID, 400  mg QD, and 400 mg BID) of KD025 in subjects with psoriasis vulgaris who 
have progressed despite first -line therapy. To date, preliminary safety data are available on 
10 subjects who received KD025 at a dose of 200 mg BID, and 10 subjects who received KD02 5 
at a dose of 400 mg QD. All subjects had normal ALT and AST values during screening. Four 
subjects (3  subjects receiving 200 mg BID and 1 subject receiving 400  mg QD) had TEAEs of 
elevation of ALT or AST. Bilirubin levels remained normal, and all ALT or AST increases were 
asymptomatic and reversible. The ALT and AST elevations first occurred from study Day 16 to 
study Day 36. The ALT/AST elevations were mild or moderate in intensity, except in 1 subject 
who had severe ( grade 3) ALT elevation to a maximum of 377 U/L.  KD025 administration was 
discontinued in 3 subjects, and ALT and AST levels decreased. One subject, who was receiving 
KD025 400 mg QD, had peak ALT of 121 U/L and AST of 127 U/L that then returned to the 
normal range despite continuing to rece ive KD025 400 mg QD. The data from these subjects 
suggest that increases in ALT and AST are modest and may be reversible despite the 
continuation of KD025.   
4.4. KD0 25 Nonclinical Toxicology  
To date, Good Laboratory Practice compliant general toxicology/toxico kinetic studies of acute, 
subchronic (1 and 3  month), and chronic ( 6-month  rat and 9-month  dog) duration have been

Section  17. 
6.3. Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2a, dose -escalat ion, open -label  study  designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability,  
and activ ity of KD025 in subjects with steroid -dependent cGVHD and active disease in terms of 
PR and CR as defined by the 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project on clinical trials in 
cGVHD  (see Appendix B ). This study also is designed to use the Physician -reported global 
cGVHD Activity Assessment to evaluate cGVHD severity; use the cGVHD Activity Assessment 
Patient Self -Report to assess symptom activity  (see Appendix C); evaluate FFS ; evaluate OS;  
assess chan ges in corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dose; evaluate TTNT ; and assess 
the PK of KD025 in subjects with cGVHD.  Changes in symptom burden/bother will be 
documented using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale  (see Appendix D ). Changes in the expression 
of several cytokines ( including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2) in plasma  and percentage s of immune -
cell subtypes (including Th17 and Treg cells)  in whole blood after KD025 administration to 
subjects with cGVHD .  
Subjects who have sig ned an IRB/IEC -approved informed consent form, and met all of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  (Section 7.2 and 7.3), will be enrolled. Approximately  48 subjects 
will receive orally administered KD025 200  mg QD (n  = 16), KD025 200 mg BID (n = 16), or 
KD025 400 mg QD (n = 16). Study drug will be administered in 28 -day cycles until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs . For disease progression,  subjects wit h a 
“Lack  of Response  (LOR)  – Mixed” response assessment ( Appendix B ) may continue treatment 
with KD025 and remain on study if the investigator considers continued treatment to be in the 
subject’s best interest, only after ap proval from the medical monitor  and documentation of the 
subject’s willingness to continue.  Subjects may receive study drug treatment either in the 
inpatient or outpatient setting.  
Prior to enrolling subsequent cohorts, the safety data in each previous cohort will be evaluated 
after 8 subjects have reached 2 months of treatment to assure there is no safety signal. As this is 
an open -label study, safety data will be continuously monitered. If ≥  25% of subjects in a cohort 
experience a Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.03 Grade 2 liver 
toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the same organ or body system, or if

 > 25% of subjects in a cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then dose 
escalation to the nex t cohort will not occur, and all subject s in that dose cohort will be dose 
reduced.  
If ≥ 25% of subjects in the 200 mg QD cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 liver toxicity 
or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the same organ or body system, or if >  25% of 
subjects in a cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 da ys, then further dosing will 
not occur and the study will be terminated. See Section  14.4 for additional information.  
Response criteria will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle starting at Cycle 2 Day 1 visit as well 
as the end of treatment (EOT) visit using the criteria of 2014 NIH Consensus Development 
Project on Clinical Trials in cGVHD  (CR, PR, and Lack of Response (unchanged, mixed, or 
progression) ; Lee et al ., 2015 ). cGVHD severi ty (clinician reported) and symptom (subject 
reported) assessment s will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle starting on Cycle 1 Day 1  as 
well as the EOT  visit using the Physician -reported global cGVHD Activity Assessment form 
(Appendix A),  cGVHD Activity Assessment: Patient Self Report , and Lee cGVHD Symptom 
Scale  (see Appendices C and D).  
At Cycle 25, Day 1 (C25D1), and all odd cycles thereafter (ie, C27D1, C29D1, C31D1 , etc.), 
subjects will receive 2 cycles worth of study drug along with 2 diaries and will return to the 
clinic at the next odd cycle for assessments and IP accountability.  Investigators and/or subjects 
have the option of coming into the clinic at one or m ore even cycles (i.e., C26D1, C28D1, 
C30D1, etc).   On even cycles, when patients do not come to clinic, the study staff will contact 
the patient via phone  and document any new adverse events and concomitant medications.  
Subjects will also undergo assessmen ts as described in Table 1.

 n. If screening assessments are done within 14 days of Cycle 1, Day 1, they do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1 .  
o. Subjects who achieve SD, PR, or CR will continue dosing with stud y drug until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. For LOR –Mixed subjects please refer to 
Section  9.1 of protocol.  
p. At Cycle 25 Day 1 (C25D1) and all odd cycles thereafter (i.e., C27D1, C29D1, C31D1, etc.), subjects will receive 2 cycles wor th of study drug along with 2 diaries and will 
return to the clinic at the next odd cycle for assessments and IP accountability.  Investigators and/or subjects have the opt ion of coming into clinic at one or more even cycles 
(i.e., C26D1, C28D1, C30D1, etc .). On even cycles, when patients  do not come to clinic, the study staff will contact the patient via phone  and document any new adverse events 
and concomitant medications.  
q. Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely also will be asked to come to the cl inic for EOT assessments.  
r. The Follow -Up visit will occur 28 days after the last dose of study drug, but prior to starting on a new therapy, if a new therapy is st arted earlier. This visit may be done within 
± 7 days of the scheduled visit.     
s. These assess ments are suggested for any unscheduled visits (UNS).  
t. Subjects are to return to the study site within 3 days after the subject’s last dose of study drug to complete all EOT assess ments. This may occur at the visit at which disease 
progression is diagnosed .

 9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
9.1. Procedures to be Performed  
All screening assessments  are to be performed within 28 days before first study drug dose, unless 
otherwise specified.  
Study Day 1 is defined as the date th e subject takes the first dose of study drug, with subsequent 
study days numbered sequentially thereafter.  
If significant changes from baseline are noted during the course of the study, additional 
unscheduled clinic visits may be undertaken by the investi gator, or requested by the sponsor, in 
order to determine both the relevance of the finding(s) and the duration of the event(s).  
Informed Consent  
All subjects must take part in the informed consent process. Adequate time must be allowed for 
the subject to ask questions and make a voluntary decision. No protocol -specific procedures, 
including screening procedures are to be performed until the subject has signed and dated an 
IRB/IEC -approved ICF.   
Demographics and Medical History  
A complete medical history w ill be taken. Information to be documented includes demographic 
information, prior medical illnesses and conditions, and surgical procedures.  
Physical Examination  
Complete PEs will be performed. All PEs will include assessment of cardiac (including heart 
rate, and vital sign measurements), musculoskeletal (eg, muscle aches) and neurological (eg, 
gait) body systems. A complete PE is to include documentation of height (screening only), 
weight, body temperature, and vital signs (blood pressure [sitting], pulse  rate [sitting], Karnofsky 
Performance Scale, and respiratory rate) and will be performed by a physician or staff member 
who is qualified to perform such examinations (eg, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner).   
Any abnormal or clinically significant  findings from the PE must be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eCRF) page.   
Vital Sign Measurements

Amendment No. 7  
  
 
Kadmon Corporation  Page 51 of 121 
Confidential and Proprietary  28 October  2019  
 Vital sign measurements will be collected after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes. Vital 
sign assessments will include mea surements of sitting blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats 
per minute), respiration rate (breaths per minute), and temperature (Celsius).  
Please note that blood pressure measurements are to be performed using appropriate technique 
(per guidelines of th e American Heart Association). Specifically, subjects should be seated 
quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their feet flat on floor (legs 
uncrossed), and their arms bared on a hard surface, with the arm slightly abducted a nd bent, with 
palm up and the midpoint of upper arm at heart level. Correct cuff and bladder size should be 
utilized. Two or more readings separated by 1 to 2  minutes should be averaged. If the first 
2 readings differ by more than 5 mm Hg, an additional 2 readings should be obtained and 
averaged. Record cuff size, arm used, and subject's position (if not seated).  
Karnofsky Performance Scale   
Subject’s performance status will be assessed using the Karnofsky Performance Scale tool (see 
Appendix E ).  
Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory samples (hematology, serum chemistry, TSH, urinalysis, and virology) are to be 
collected as outlined in  Table 1and Section  8.8. Safety laboratory analyses will be performed by 
the central laboratory. Laboratory results will be graded using the CTCAE v4.03.   
12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms will be performed with the subject in a supine position having res ted in this 
position for at least 5 minutes before each reading. ECGs are to be performed 3 times 
consecutively within 30 minutes (must have an interval of at least 1 –2 minutes between ECGs). 
ECG is to be performed immediately prior to any blood sample col lections, if possible. See 
Section 9.3 for additional ECG procedure information and Table 2 for timing allowances.  
Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy tests (urine) will be done  in women of childbearing potential. Positive urine results 
are to be confirmed with serum testing.

Kadmon Corporation  Page 52 of 121 
Confidential and Proprietary  28 October  2019  
 Pulmonary function tests (to include FEV 1, FVC, DL CO, TLC, and RV) will be performed 
according to the guidelines published by the  American Thoracic Society or European Respiratory 
Society for standardization of spirometry  (ATC 1995 ; Quanjer et al ., 1993 ). Diffusion capacity 
(DL CO) determinations will be performed at the same time  as spirometric testing ; FEV 1, FVC, 
DL CO, TLC, and RV will also be expressed as absolute values and % predicted of normal based 
on published reference values for adults  (Hankinson et al., 1999 ). See Section 9.4 for additional 
information.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Sampling  
Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) for determination of plasma concentrations of KD025 and 
its metabolites, will be collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 at the follow ing time points : 
Pre-dose (Time 0), and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing (after first dose for subjects in the 
BID group). In addition, subjects will have samples collected pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 4 and 
pre-dose at the Cycle 7 Day 1  visit. See Section 11 for additional information.  
Blood Sampling for Pharmacodynamics (PD)  
All subjects will have PD blood samples drawn up to 4 times over the course of the study: Pre -
dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 (4  weeks), Cycle  4 Day 1 (12 weeks)  and Cycle 7 Day 1  
(24 weeks) .  Samples  will be analyzed to evaluate changes in the expression of several cytokines 
in plasma (including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of circulating Th17 
and Treg cell s in blood.  See Section 12 for additional information .     
KD025 Administration  and Treatment Duration  
Subjects will receive their first dose of study drug in the clinic on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and then 
study drug will be dispensed for home administration. On scheduled visit days, subjects will take 
their dose at the clinic.  
Subjects will receive KD025 200 mg QD, KD025 200 mg BID, or KD025 400  mg QD. Subjects 
will be treated until disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity .  Subjects with a “L OR -
 Mixed” r esponse assessment may continue treatment with KD025 and remain on study if the 
investigator considers continued treatment to be in the subject’s best interest only after approval 
from the medical monitor and documentation of the subject’s willingness to c ontinue.

 Subjects who have SD, PR, or CR at the time of decision to discontinue treatment and who come 
off study for reasons other than AEs will be tapered off of KD025 by lowering the dose by 
50% every 2  weeks  (see Section 14.1 for additional details)  until they reach a dose of 100 mg 
QD or equivalent. Further instructions will be listed in the pharmacy manual .   
Study Drug Diary  
Subjects will be given a study drug diary to record the details of each dose of study drug. Diaries 
will be dispensed/collected  on Day 1 of each cycle. Compliance with oral dosing will be 
confirmed using patient diaries, which will be examined at each visit.  
Response and Activity Assessments  
Response criteria will be assessed using the 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project for 
Clinical Trials in cGVHD criteria (CR, PR, or LOR [unchanged, mixed, or progression ; see (Lee 
et al., 2015 ).     
Activity in terms of cGVHD severity will be evaluated using the Physician -reported Global 
cGVHD Activity Assessment  form (see Appendix A ), while activity in terms of symptom burden 
will be evaluated using the cGVHD Activity Assessment - Patient Self Report (see Appendix C ). 
Failure -free survival , OS and TTNT  will be evaluated at the same time points . Changes in 
corticosteroid and CNI dose will be documented as they occur on the appropriate eCRF . Changes 
in symptom burden/bother will be documented using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale (see 
Appendix D ).  
See Section 10 for additional information on response assessment.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications, including systemic steroids and CNIs, are to be collected from 
time the subject signs the ICF throughout the subject’s participation in the study. See Section 15 
for additional information.  
Adverse Event Assessments  
Information regarding the occurrence of AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the 
ICF throughout their participation in the study, including a period of 28 days after last dose of

9.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments  
A digital 12 -lead ECG will be obtained during the study (see  Table 1 for timing of ECG 
assessments  and Table 2  for timing allowances ). 
Digital 12 -lead ECG recordings are to be made with the subject in a supine position having 
rested in this position for at least 5 minutes before each reading . ECGs are to be performed 
3 times consecutively within 30 min utes (must have an interval of at least 1 –2 minutes between 
ECGs). At each visit, the ECG is to be performed immediately before  any blood sample 
collection , if possible . 
The following ECG parameters will be collected: PR interval, QRS interval, and QTc[F]. The 
ECG findings will be evaluated by a qualified physician for the presence of abnormalities 
(qualitative assessment) . The physician will assess each ECG as normal, abnormal/not clinically 
significant, or abnormal/clinically significant.   
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead to a change in subject management (eg, dose reduction or 
delay, requirement for additional medication or monitoring) or result in clinical signs and 
symptoms are considered clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will  be recorded 
in the AE eCRF. If ECG abnormalities meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 16.3.1 ).

 10. ACTIVITY  
The primary activity  endpoint of this study is subject response based on the 2014 NIH Consensus 
Development Project on Clinical Trials in cGVHD. Secon dary endpoints include evaluation of 
cGVHD severity using the Physician -reported global cGVHD Activity Assessment; evaluation 
of symptom burden using the cGVHD Activity Assessment - Patient Self Report; FFS ; OS; 
TTNT ;  changes in corticosteroid and CNI dose; and  changes in symptom burden/bother using 
the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale . 
10.1. 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project on Clinical Trials in 
cGVHD  
Subject response (CR, PR, or LOR [unchanged, mixed response, progression]) based on the 2014 
NIH Consensus Devel opment Project on Clinical Trials in cGVHD  is the primary activity  
endpoint for this study  (see Appendix B ). Response criteria will be assessed on Day 1 of each 
cycle starting on Cycle 2 Day 1  as well as the EOT visit .   
10.2. Physician -Reported Global cGVHD Act ivity Assessment  
Activity  in terms of cGVHD severity also will be evaluated using the Physician -reported Global 
cGVHD Activity Assessment (see Appendix A  for form). cGVHD severity will be performed on 
Day 1 of each cycle starti ng on Cycle 1 Day 1  as well as the EOT visit . 
10.3. cGVHD Activity Assessment - Patient Self Report  
Activity  in terms of symptom burden also will be evaluated using the cGVHD Activity 
Assessment - Patient Self Report (see Appendix C  for report). Symptom burden will be assessed  
on Day 1 of each cycle starting on Cycle 1 Day 1  as well as the EOT visit . 
10.4. Failure -Free Survival  
Failure -free survival data will be collected throughout the study .     
10.5. Overall Survival  
Overall Survival data will  be collected throughout the study .

 10.6. Corticosteroid and Calcineurin Inhibitor Use 
Corticosteroid and CNI dose will be collected throughout the study and changes in requirements 
will be documented. Corticosteroids may be tapered at the discretion of the inve stigator after 4 
weeks of KD025 administration.  In addition, data on use of non -immunosuppressive therapy , 
such as ECP , will be collected as well.  
10.7.  Time to Next Treatment (TTNT)  
Time to Next Treatment  data will be collected throughout the study . 
10.8. Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale  
Changes in symptom burden/bother will be documented  using the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale  
(see Appendix D). Symptom burden will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle starting on Cycle 1 
Day 1; as well as at the EOT  visit. Lee et al ., 200 2 developed  a symptom scale designed for 
individuals with chronic GVHD. The questionnaire asks subject to indicate the degree of bother 
that they experienced due to symptoms in seven domains potentially affect ed by chronic GVHD 
(skin, eyes , mouth, breathing, eating and digestion, energy, and emotional distress).  
The degree to which subject s report that they are bothered by a symptom represents a global 
assessment incorporating not only the intensity of the symp tom and its frequency, but also the 
degree to which it causes emotional disturbance or interferes with functioning.

Day 1 of Cycle 7.  Subjects should be instructed to withhold taking study drug on these days as 
dosing will be performed at the clinic.   
The pre -dose and all post -dose PK collection time  points are to be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF. Additionally, th e time of a subject’s dose of study drug is to be documented 
(for subjects receiving study drug BID, the time of the previous evening’s dose administration 
also is to be noted).   
A total of 16 samples will be collected ( 80 mL) from subjects in the dose es calation portion of 
the study . KD025 and metabolite concentrations will be used to calculate the following PK 
parameters: C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-6hr. 
Detailed instructions for sample collection and preparation will be provided in a separate manual.

All subjects will have PD blood samples drawn 4 times over the course of the study: Pre -dose on 
Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 (4 weeks),  Cycle  4 Day 1 (12 weeks) and Cycle 7 Day 1 (24 
weeks) .  Samples  will be analyzed to evaluate changes in the exp ression of several cytokines in 
plasma (including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2), and changes in percentages of circulating Th17 and 
Treg cells in blood.   
Detailed instructions for sample collection and preparation will be provided in a separate manual.

 13. REMOVIN G SUBECTS  FROM  STUDY  
Every reasonable effort will be made to keep the subject in the study; however, in the event that 
a subject is withdrawn from the study, every effort will be made by the investigator to complete 
and report the reasons for withdrawal as  thoroughly as possible. This evaluation should include 
final observations, as required by the protocol at the time of the subject’s withdrawal. The 
reason(s) for termination must be clearly documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF. A 
termination eCR F page must be completed for any subject who is enrolled in the study.  
13.1. Subject s’ Decision to  Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Subjects can decline to continue receiving study drug and/or other protocol -required therapies or 
procedures at any time during the study. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate processes for discon tinuation  from study drug or other protocol -required 
therapies and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Table 1) and collection of data, including endpoints and  adverse events.   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol -required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is unable to 
continue further study participation. Subject data up t o withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available data can be included after 
withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for 
withdrawal from th e study.   
13.1.1  Treatment Discontinuation  
Treatment discontinuation reasons include any of the following:  
• Disease Progression  
• An AE requires permanent discontinuation of study drug  (refer to Section  14.4)  
• Investigat or decision  
• Voluntary withdrawal by subject  
• Noncompliance to protocol

 • Subject lost to follow -up 
• Termination of the study by sponsor  
• Subject death  
13.1.2  Study Termination  
Reasons for study termination include :  
• Completion of follow -up period  
• Voluntary withdrawal by subject  
• Subject lost to follow -up 
• Termination of the study by sponsor  
• Subject death  
In the event of premature discontinuation  of treatment , subjects must return to the clinic  to 
complete the EOT Visit and 28 -Day Follow -Up assessments .  Refer to Section 8.5 for a complete 
list of procedures to be performed  at these visits . If a subject dies, Kadmon Corporation will 
actively seek to know the date of death.  
If there is an ongoing toxicity because of  KD025, subje cts must be followed with appropriate 
medical management until resolution or stabilization . 
A reasonable effort should be made to contact any subject lost to follow -up during the course of 
the study in order to complete assessments and retrieve any outstan ding data. If the subjects are 
unreachable by telephone after 3 attempts, a certified registered return receipt letter should be 
sent requesting that contact be made with the investigator to report survival information.  
13.2. Stopping Rules  
Stopping criteria wil l be assessed using the CTCAE scale v.4.03 . 
13.2.1  Adverse Events Stopping Criteria  
AEs that  require  consideration of study drug discontinuation or dose reduction (see Section  14.4) 
include  the following:  
• AEs of clinical concern  
• Treatment -related Grade 3 TEAEs t hat cannot definitively be attributed to a cause other 
than the study drug

13.3. Study Discontinuation  
Kadmon Corporation  has the right to terminate or to stop the study at any t ime. Reasons for 
study discontinuation may include, but are not limited to the following:  
• If ≥ 25% of subjects in the 200 mg QD cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 liver 
toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or higher) AE in the same organ or body system , or if 
> 25% of subjects in a cohort are discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then 
further dosing will not occur and the study will be terminated.    
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Drug supply  issues  
• Excessive subject self -withdrawal  
• Significant protocol violations ( eg, violation of eligibility criteria, dosing errors, missing 
data for study endpoint analysis)

 14. STUDY DRUG  
14.1. Dose and Schedule of Study Drug  
Kadmon will provide each investigator with adequate supplies of KD0 25.  
Eligible s ubjects will receive KD025 200 mg QD, KD025 200 mg BID, or KD025 400 mg QD . 
Study drug will be dispensed by the s ite pharmacist. After the completion and review of all 
screening and baseline procedures, qualified subjects will receive study drug.   
Cohort  No. of 
Subjects  Dosage  Number of 100  mg capsules to 
be administered per dose  Number of 200  mg 
tablets to be 
admin istered per dose  
Cohort 1  16 subjects  200 mg KD025 QD  2 1 
Cohort 2  16 subjects  200 mg KD025 BID  2 1 
Cohort 3  16 subjects  400 mg KD025 QD  4 2 
 
KD025 will be supplied as 100 mg capsules  or 200  mg tablets .

Cohort 1:  Subjects should take 2 capsules /1 tablet  with their morning meal  or within 
5 minutes of finishing the meal .  
Cohort 2:  Subjects should take 2 capsules /1 tablet  with their morning meal or within 
5 minutes of completing the meal  and 2 capsules with their evening meal  
or within 5 minutes of finishing the meal . 
Cohort 3:  Subjects should take 4 capsules /2 tablets  with their morning meal  or 
within 5  minutes of finishing the meal . 
Subjects who have SD, PR, or  CR at the time of decision to discontinue treatment and who come 
off study for reasons other than AEs will be tapered off KD025 by lowering the dose by 
50% every 2 weeks  until they reach a dose of 100 mg QD or equivalent .  Further instructions 
will be listed in the pharmacy manual.

 Subjects will be dispensed study drug to self -administer while on an outpatient basis  and subjects 
will be provided a study drug diary in which to record the day and time of dosing . Subjects will 
return to the clinic as outlined in the Study Assessments table (Table 1 ), and will receive that 
day’s dose of study drug (first dose for BID subjects) while at the clinic.  
14.2. Dose Escalation  
Prior to enrolling subsequent cohorts, t he safety data in each prior cohort will be evaluated after 
8 subjects have reached 2 months of treatment to assure there is no safety signal. Two months 
was selected as the time for the safety review because all of the clinically significant 
KD025 -related AEs to da te occurred within 36 days or less  of starting dosing with KD025 . As 
this is an open -label study , safety results will be continuously monitered. If ≥ 25% of subjects in 
a cohort experience a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 liver toxicity or a CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 (or 
higher) AE in the same organ or body system, or if >  25% of subjects in a cohort are 
discontinued for toxicity that persists for 14 days, then dose e scalation to the next cohort will not 
occur, and all patients in that dose cohort will be dose reduced.   
14.3. Missed Doses  
Subjects should make every effort to take the study drug at the same scheduled time daily . In the 
event that the subject misses the planne d dose of study drug, the following protocol should be 
followed:  
For subjects receiving study drug on a QD dosing schedule:  
• If less than 12 hours of time have elapsed after the scheduled dose, the drug should be 
taken. The subject should then resume the re gular planned daily dosing schedule the 
following day.  
• If more than 12 hours of time have elapsed after the scheduled dose, the drug should be 
skipped for that day. The subject should then resume the regular planned dosing schedule 
the following day.  
For s ubjects receiving study drug on a BID dosing schedule:  
• If less than 6 hours of time have elapsed after the morning scheduled dose, the drug should 
be taken. The subject should then resume the regular planned dosing that evening. If less 
than 6 hours of tim e have elapsed after the evening scheduled dose, the drug should be 
taken. The subject should then resume the regular planned dosing the following morning.

 • If more than 6 hours of time have elapsed after the morning scheduled dose, the drug 
should be skip ped and the subject should resume the regular planned dosing schedule that 
evening. If more than 6 hours of time have elapsed after the evening scheduled dose, the 
drug should be skipped and the subject should resume the regular planned dosing the 
followin g morning.  
If the subject skips more than 7 consecutive days of drug, the subject should be discontinued 
from  the study.  
14.4. Dose Pause or Reduction of KD025  
Exacerbation of any of the signs or symptoms of the disease will constitute a potential rationale 
for cessation of therapy. Any clinically significant toxicity will necessitate consideration of 
either a pause or cessation of therapy. Both laboratory and clinical data may constitute a reason 
to pause or cease therapy. Previous studies have indicated that r eversible and modest liver 
toxicity may occur spontaneously after a few weeks of initiation of therapy.   
• When treatment -related Grade 3 toxicities occur, drug administration will be halted until 
recovery to at least Grade 1, at which time study drug may b e resumed at a reduced dose.   
• When treatment -related Grade 2 toxicities , other than liver toxicities , occur, drug 
administration will be halted until recovery to at least Grade 1 at which time study drug 
administration may resume  at the same dose .   
• When greater then Grade 2 liver toxicities  occur , drug administration will be halted until 
recovery to at least Grade 1 at which time study drug administration may resume at a 
reduced dose.   
Pauses in therapy may not last more than 14 days; subjects requiring pauses of more than 
14 days will be discontinued from the study.  If treatment -related Grade 2 or treatment -related 
Grade 3 toxicities  persist for 14 days, subjects will be discontinued from the study.    
14.4.1  Dose Reduction  Steps  
Every effort should be made to keep the subject on the full dose of drug. When dose reduction is 
necessary  (see Section 14.4), the drug should be decreased as shown in  Table 5 (for subjects on 
100 mg capsules) and  Table 6 (for subjects on 200 mg tablets) ,  until the event has resolved.  
Once a subject has the dose decreased, an increase is not allowed.

KD025 will be supplied by Kadmon  Corporat ion.   
14.6. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
KD025 will be packaged and labeled by the sponsor.  The label attached to each bottle will 
provide the following information:  
• Description of contents (number and strength of capsule s) and route of administration  
• Directions for use  
• Storage conditions  
• Product identification code  
• Lot Number identification

 14.7. Dispensing of Study Drug and Dosing Compliance  
Subjects will be dispensed study drug to self -administer while on an outpatient basis. Subjects 
will return to the clinic as outlined in the Study Assessments ( Table 1), and will receive that 
day’s dose of study drug while at the clinic.  
The amount of study drug dispensed to the subject at the beginning of each dosing month  should 
be sufficient to allow for 1 month of dosing with KD0 25. 
The investigato r (or designee) will be responsible for recording this information on the 
appropriate study drug inventory. This inventory will be maintained throughout the duration of 
the trial and will be periodically reviewed by a representative of the sponsor.  
The inv estigator (or designee) will instruct the subject that all dispensed bottles must be returned 
at each follow -up visit, at which time a capsule /tablet  count will be conducted to assure subject 
dosing compliance.  
Additionally, subjects will be required to ke ep study drug diaries in which they will record the 
date and time of study drug administrations. These diaries will be dispensed and/or 
reviewed/ collected at each visit.  
14.8. Study Drug Storage  
All supplies of study drug are to be stored at USP controlled room temperature of 20−25°C 
(66−77°F)  with excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). At the clinic, the 
study drugs are to be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized persons only, until 
needed for dosing.  
14.9. Study Drug Accountability  
The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and other regulatory agencies require accounting 
for the disposition of all investigational drugs received by each clinical site. Information on drug 
disposition required by law consists of the date received, date administer ed, quantity 
administered, and the subject to whom the drug was administered. The principal investigator is 
responsible for the accounting for all unused study drugs and all used study drug containers. The 
investigator must maintain a complete and current dispensing and inventory record that has been 
supplied by the sponsor.

At the termination of the study, a final drug accountability review and reconciliation must be 
completed and any discrepancies must be investigated and their resolution documented.  
14.10.1  Disposition of Used Supplies  
At the completion of a subject’s participation in the trial, all partially used  and empty  study drug 
containers must be returned to the investigator (or designee) so that a final subject -dosing 
inventory may be conducted. This information will be recorded on the Drug Dispensing Log .  
14.10.2  Inventory of Unused Supplies  
Periodically throughout and at the conclusion of the study, an inventory of unused study drug  
will be conducted by a representative of the s ponsor.

 15. CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ON AND TREATMENT  
If the subject must use a concomitant medication during the study, it is the responsibility of the 
principal investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF . 
A reasonable  effort is to be made to document any medications the subject received at the time 
of signing the ICF through the end of the study (follow -up visit). After discontinuation of study 
drug, any concomitant medication used during the study in response to an AE  is to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF.  
Subjects must be receiving glucocorticoid therapy for cGVHD at study entry  (subjects also may 
be receiving CNI therapy) . Any changes in corticosteroid , CNI, or ECP  doses will be 
documented.   
Use of drugs that pr olong QT/QTc should be used with caution in subjects who are receiving 
KD025. Discuss with medical monitor the appropriate monitoring of subjects while receiving 
any of these drugs in conjunction with KD025.  
The concomitant medication names will be coded by the sponsor according to the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD) and classified by anatomical therapeutic chemical 
categories.  
The use of medications that are strong CYP3A4  inducers is prohibited.  Other CYP3A4 
inhibitors / inducers should  be used with caution.  (See Appendix H  for a listing of these drugs .) 
CYP1A2 inhibitors/ inducers should be used with caution.

 16. SAFETY  
16.1. Safety Parameters  
The CTCAE v.4.03  will be used for grading toxicities . Laboratory results  also will be classified 
using the CTCAE v4.03. Subjects will be monitored throughout the treatment and follow -up 
period for occurrence of AEs (acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in 
clinical status, vital sign measurements, and labo ratory data. Safety parameters to be 
measured/assessed include vital sign measurements, PE finding s, hematology, serum 
chemistries, and urinalysis  results , and ECG  recordings . 
16.2. Adverse Event  Definition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject associated with the 
use of a drug, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory value finding), a symptom, or a disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without judgment as to causality. An AE can arise from use of the drug (eg, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation or dose, including 
an overdose. An AE also includes, but is not limited to, any clinic ally significant worsening of a pre -
existing condition. Examples include:  
• Any sign, symptom, physical finding, or laboratory result that has worsened in nature, 
severity or frequency compared to baseline;  
• Reactions from an investigational drug, including t hose occurring as a result of an 
overdose, abuse of the study drug, withdrawal phenomena, sensitivity or toxicity;  
• Concurrent illness that was not present or worsens in nature, severity, or frequency 
compared to baseline;  
• Injury or accident; and/or  
• Exacer bation of a pre -existing condition  
For the purpose of data collection, all untoward events that occur after informed consent through 
28 days after last dose of study drug are to be recorded on eCRF s by the investigational site .

 16.3. Evaluating Adverse Events  
The investigator will determine the seriousness, intensity, and causality of an AE associated with 
the use of the study drug (ie, events where there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by the study drug) bas ed on the definitions  that follow.  
16.3.1  Serious Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours)  
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with Title 21 Part Code of 
Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32 and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators Sa fety 
Reporting Requirements for Investigational New Drug ( INDs ) and 
Bioavailability /Bioequivalence  Studies.  
SAE: An adverse event is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death:  This includes any death that occurs while the subject is “on study” as well as any death 
that occurs within 28 days after study drug discontinuation .  
Note : Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself. The event(s) that 
caused death ( eg, illness, accident) is the SAE. Death due to any other 
cause(s) must also be reported as an outcome of the reportable SAE.  
• Life-threatening AE:  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in 
the view of either the investigator or  sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death .  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of e xisting hospitalization :  In the absence of an AE, 
the investigator should not report hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. This is the 
case in the following situations:  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a proce dure required by the 
protocol  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of routine procedure followed by 
study center  
• Hospitalization for survey visits or annual physicals

Confidential and Proprietary  28 October  2019  
 In addition, a hospitalization planned before the start of the stud y for a pre -existing condition 
which has not worsened does not count as a n SAE .  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical event:   An ev ent that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   
16.3.2  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first awareness)  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  is any adverse drug event, the specificity or 
sever ity of which is not consistent with those noted in the current protocol and/or IB. This refers 
to any AE that has not been previously observed (eg, included in the I B), rather than from the 
perspective of such an event not being anticipated from the pharma cological properties of the 
product.  
16.3.3  Unexpected Adverse Events  
(Notify sponsor or designee by the next business day)  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB  or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or , if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. Also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs o r 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation . 
16.3.4  Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All other AEs, not fulfilling the previous definitions, are classifi ed as nonserious.  
16.3.5  Protocol -Related Adverse Events  
AEs that are not study drug related may nevertheless be considered by the investigator or the 
medical monitor to be related to the conduct of the clinical study. That is, the event may be

Confidential and Proprietary  28 October  2019  
 related to the fac t that a subject is participating in the study. For example, a protocol -related AE 
may be an event that occurs during a washout period or that is related to a procedure required by 
the protocol.  
16.3.6  Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will attempt to a ssess the relationship of the event  to study drug using a 5 -point 
scale (not related, unlikely -related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related ; (see 
Appendix G ). 
16.3.7  Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the Adverse Event  page of the 
subject’s eCRF  during the subject’s participation in the study . The severity of each AE will be 
graded using the CTCAE v 4.03 scale . The date of onset as well as the end date of the event a lso 
should be recorded  or the event should be entered  as “ongoing” . In addition, the method used to 
treat the AE and the outcome of the AE also will be noted. In the event that the grade of an AE 
worsens , an end date should be entered to the initial AE and  a new AE entered with the updated 
grade and date of onset. The investigator will assess the relationship of the event to study drug. 
Note: All SAEs also are to be entered onto an SAE form and sent to sponsor or designee.  
16.3.8  Hospitalization  
In the absence of an AE, the investigator should not report hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization. This is the case in the following situations:  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure required by the 
protocol.  
• Hospitalizati on or prolongation of hospitalization is part of routine procedure followed by 
study center.  
• Hospitalization for survey visits or annual physicals.  
In addition, a hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a pre -existing condition that 
has n ot worsened does not count as a n SAE .

 16.3.9  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
16.3.9.1.  Governing Regulatory Requirements  
Compliance with this request for prompt reporting is essential in that the sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US FDA as well as all other particip ating investigators of the event.  
Under FDA ruling (US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the 
Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE 
Studies, the sponsor is required to submit writt en documentation, in the form of an IND safety 
report, detailing : 
• Any event associated with the use of the drug, that is both serious and unexpected, or  
• Any findings from clinical, epidemiological, or pooled analysis of multiple studies or any 
findings fr om animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to 
the drug .  
Written submission must be made by the sponsor to the FDA  and the IRB /IEC s as soon as 
possible and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s ini tial notification of the 
event. Any unexpected death or life -threatening suspected adverse drug reaction must be 
reported to FDA no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the 
information . The sponsor shall also inform all investi gators.  
16.3.9.2.  Time -Frame for Reporting  
Any death, SAE,  pregnancy  (including pregnancy of a partner) , or unexpected (and severe) AE 
experienced by a subject while receiving or within 28 days of receiving study drug, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, or an y death that occurs more than 28 days after receiving study drug, 
and is believed to be study drug -related, must be promptly reported (within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event) by e -mail to the sponsor (or designee).

 16.3.9.3.  Information to be Provided by the Investigator  
SAEs for all enrolled subjects must be recorded on the SAE form  (during study participation) . 
This requirement includes all SAEs that occur after informed consent and through 28 days after 
last dose of study drug, and in addition, any SAEs that are assessed  as possibly related to study 
drug by the investigator, even if the SAE occurs more than 28 days after the last dose of study 
drug must be reported to the Kadmon Corporation Pharmacovigilance Department (or designee) . 
The minimum information required for S AE reporting includes identity of investigator, site 
number, subject number, an event description, SAE term(s), onset date, the reason why the event 
is considered to be serious (ie, the seriousness criteria) and the investigator’s assessment of the 
relatio nship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE information including medications or 
other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, action taken with the study drug due to the 
event, and the outcome/resolution of the event will be recorded on the SAE  form . Forms for 
reporting SAE will be provided to the study sites.  
In all cases, the investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE . Furthermore, the investiga tor 
may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by the Kadmon Corporation 
Drug Safety personnel or designee.  
When reporting SAE, the following additional points should be noted:  
• When the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the investigator should report the 
diagnosis or syndrome as the primary SAE term, rather than as signs or symptoms . Signs 
and symptoms may then be described in the e vent description . For example, d yspnea 
should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which  caused the dyspnea is known to 
be malignant pleural effusion .

 • Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown . In the exceptional case where the events leading to 
death are unk nown, then death may be used as an event term . If an autopsy was performed, 
the autopsy report should be provided.  
• While most hospitalizations necessitate reporting of an SAE, some hospitalizations do not 
require SAE reporting, as follows:  
o Elective or pr eviously scheduled surgery  (eg, a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair ) 
o Procedures for pre -existing conditions that have not worsene d after initiation of 
treatment  
o Pre-specified study h ospitalizations for observation  
o Events that result in hospital st ays of less than 24 hours and that do not require 
admission (eg, an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of 
cystitis and discha rge to home on oral antibiotics ) 
o SAE s must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural complic ation 
resulting in prolongation of the hospitalization.  
16.3.9.4.  Regulatory Reporting  
Kadmon Corporation Drug Safety (or designee) will process and evaluate all SAE s as soon as 
the reports are received . For each SAE  received, Kadmon Corporation will make a determin ation 
as to whether the criteria for expedited reporting have been met.  
Kadmon Corporation (or designee) will submit SAE s that meet the criteria for expedited 
reporting to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local regulations governing safety 
reporting . Reporting of SAE s by the investigator to his or her IRB /IEC  will be done in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB /IEC . Adequate 
documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB /IEC  was properly notified.  
16.4. Other Safety Considerations  
16.4.1  Laboratory Data  
All laboratory data obtained during the course of the study  should be reviewed . Any abnormal 
value that leads to a change in subject management ( eg, dose reduction or delay, requirement for 
additional medication or monitoring) or is considered to be of clinical significance by the 
investigator should be reported as an AE and/or SAE  as appropriate, unless this value is

 consistent with the subject’s present disease state or is consistent with values obtained before  
entry into the study.  
Laboratory results will be classified using the CTCAE v4.03 . 
16.4.2  Medication Errors  
Any medication error that results in an AE, even if it does not meet the definition of serious, 
requires reporting within 24 hours to the safety monitor . 
16.4.3  Follow-Up of Adverse Events  
Any SAE  or AE assessed as at least possibly related that led to treatment discontinuation 
(including clinically significant abnormal laboratory values that meet these criteria) and is 
ongoing 28 days after last dose of study drug must be followed until either resolution of the 
event or determination by the investigator that the event has become stable or irreversible . This 
follow -up guidance also applies to possibly related SAE s that occur more  than 28 days after last 
dose of study drug. The status of all other continuing AEs will be documented as of 28 days after 
last dose of study drug.

 17. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
All descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, 
Cary, North Carolina ) statistical software, unless otherwise noted . For categorical variables, the 
number and percent of each category within a parameter will be calculated for non -missing data . 
For continuous variables, the mean, median and standard deviation, as well as the  minimum and 
maximum values, will be presented.  
Statistical significance will be declared when the P value is found to be ≤ 0.05, unless otherwise 
noted . All clinical data captured will be provided in data listings.  
17.1. General Design  
All data for enrolled subjects will be presented in data listings by subject number. For those 
summary tables in which baseline  and change from baseline  measurements will be presented, the 
last observed measurement prior to the initial dose of KD025 will be considered the baseline  
measurement.   
Continuous data will be described using descriptive statistics: number of observations (n), mean, 
standar d deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be used 
for summarizing discrete (categorical) data. When categorical data are presented, the percent will 
be suppressed when the count is zero in order to draw attention to the non zero counts. The 
denominator for all percentages, unless otherwise specified, will be the number of subjects in the 
specified analysis population.  Two-sided 95% confidence interval employing the exact binomial 
method will be provided for activity outcomes.  
Hypothesis testing , if appropriate,  will be carried out at the 5% (2 -sided) significance level . 
Because of  the exploratory nature of the study, no adjustments will be made for the multiplicity 
of endpoints . Nonparametric tests may be used in preference to  parametric tests if parametric 
assumptions are notably violated . Missing values will not be imputed . If a subject does not have 
sufficient data for a particular analysis, they will be excluded from that analysis . Endpoints 
defined as an average of multipl e measurements will be used those data points that are 
non-missing, and the denominator was adjusted accordingly.

 17.2. Sample Size Justification  
The total sample size of 16 subjects per KD025 dose group will provide > 90% probability of 
one or more KD025 subje cts experiencing an AE that has an underlying rate of ≥ 14% and 
> 80% probability of one or more subjects in the study experiencing an AE that has an 
underlying rate of ≥ 10%.  
Assuming an underlying 25% rate for subjects to meet the ORR , each treatment gro up of 
16 subjects has an approximately 80% chance of having at least 3  subjects meet the overall 
response criteria, and approximately 90% chance of at least 2  subjects meet the overall response 
criteria.  
17.3. Statistical Considerations  
The statistical methodol ogy will be further described in a Statistical Analysis Plan , which will be 
finalized prior to database lock.  
17.3.1  Study Populations  
Four  populations will be employed in the analysis of study data:  
• The modified intent -to-treat ( mITT) population will consist of  all subjects who are enrolled 
in the study and receive at least 1 dose of study medication .  
• The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of KD025  
• The PK population which will consist of all subjects who receive at lea st one dose of study 
drug and have at least 1 post -dose PK sample drawn  
17.3.2  Subject  Accountability, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics, subject disposition, and screening and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized for the mITT popula tion.  
17.3.3  KD025  Exposure  
The amount of KD0 25 administered by visit and overall will be tabulated and presented by 
subject  in data listings . In addition, delays and all other alterations in KD0 25 administration will 
be presented.

 17.3.4  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO -DD and the data will be summarized by 
treatment group and presented in tables and listings.  
17.4. Activity  Analysis  
The primary activity  outcome will be the percentage of subjects who meet the OR criteria  (PR + 
CR). This will be assessed overall ( ie, any subject meeting the PR or CR criteria at any time 
point).   For clarity, addition of new systemic therapy for cGVHD will be considered a KD025 
treatment failure and will be considered progression of cGVHD for analysis purposes.  
Secondary Endpoints   
• Number and percentage of KD025 in subjects with steroid -dependent cGVHD who have  a 
best response of PR or CR  
• Change in cGVHD severity as based on the Physician -reported Global cGVHD Activity 
Assessment  
• Change in  symptom acti vity as based on cGVHD Activity Assessment Patient Self -Report  
• Median  FFS will be defined as the time from first dose of study drug to either the start of 
another treatment, relapse of the underlying disease, or death.   
• Changes in corticosteroid and calc ineurin inhibitor dose  
• To evaluate DOR , which will be defined as the time of initial response until documented 
progression.  
• To evaluate response by organ system . The response by organ system (PR and CR) will be 
assessed based on the 2014 NIH Consensus De velopment Project on Clinical Trials in 
cGVHD.  
• Analyses of plasma PK of KD025 in subjects with cGVHD  
• OS will be defined as the time from first dose of KD025 to the date of death due to any 
cause. Kaplan -Meier plots, descriptive statistics of OS and landmar k OS at 6, 12, 18 and 24 
months will be  provided . 
• TTNT will be defined as the defined as the time from the first dose of KD025 to the start of 
additional systemic cGVHD therapy Change in symptom burden/bother using the Lee 
cGVHD Symptom Scale .

 Exploratory Endpoints  
• Changes in the expression of several cytokines ( including IL -17A, IL -21, and IL -2) in 
plasma after KD025 administration to subjects with cGVHD  
• Changes in percentage of immune -cell subtypes (including  Th17 and Treg cells)  in whole 
blood after KD0 25 administration to subjects with cGVHD  
17.5. Safety Data  
The primary safety endpoint is the percent of subjects experiencing AEs in Cohort 1 
(200 mg QD), Cohort 2, ( 200 mg BID), and Cohort 3 (400 mg QD).  
Safety assessments include AEs, SAEs, PEs, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory 
evaluations  (including TSH measurements) , ECGs, PFTs, and reasons for treatment 
discontinuation due to toxicity.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be evaluated using the CTCAE v4.03. The secondary safety 
outcome will be the num ber and percent  of subjects experiencing AEs overall. The total sample 
size of 16 subjects per KD025 dose group will provide >  90% probability of one or more KD025 
subjects experiencing an AE that has an unde rlying rate of ≥  14% and >  80% probability of one 
or more subjects in the study experiencing an AE that has an underlying rate of ≥  10%.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment group using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDR A®) System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term, classified 
from verbatim terms.  MedDRA® Version  20.0 or higher will be used.  The incidence and 
percentage of subjects with at least 1  occurrence of a preferred term will be included. The 
number of events p er preferred term will also be summarized. Causality (relationship to study 
treatment) will be summarized separately.  
All AEs, SAEs, treatment -related AEs, treatment -related SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, treatment -related 
≥ Grade 3 AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal, or treatment discontinuation will be summarized 
overall and by treatment group according to SOC and preferred terms. AEs will also be presented 
in listings. Durati on of AEs will be determined and included in listings, along with action taken 
and outcome.  
Laboratory results will be classified using the CTCAE v4.03 and summarized by treatment 
group. Incidence of laboratory abnormalities will be summarized. The worst o n-study grade after

 the first dose of study drug will be summarized. The incidence of ≥ Grade 3 laboratory 
abnormalities under treatment and shifts in toxicity grading from baseline to highest grade 
post-baseline will be displayed.  
Vital sign measurements  will be summarized by treatment group at each scheduled time point 
using descriptive statistics.

 19. ETHICAL ASPEC TS 
19.1. Local Regulations  
The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice” 
ICH E6 Tripartite Guideline (January  1997), and in general, be conducted in a manner consistent 
with the most recent version of the Declar ation of Helsinki . The investigator will ensure that the 
conduct of the study complies with the basic principles of GCP as outlined in the current version 
of 21  CFR, subpart  D, Part  312, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, Part  50, 
“Protectio n of Human Subjects”, and Part  56, “Institutional Review Boards”.  
19.2. Informed Consent  
Sample ICFs will be supplied to each site . Kadmon  Corporation  or its designee must review any 
ICF prior to submission for review by the IRB /IEC . The final IRB /IEC -approved d ocument must 
be provided to Kadmon Corporation for regulatory purposes.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, to obtain 
written informed consent from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized repr esentative) 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study  in accordance with federal and state regulations . In the case 
where the subject is unable to read, an impartia l witness should be present during the entire 
informed consent discussion . After the subject has orally consented to participation in the trial, 
the witness’ signature on the form will attest that the information in the consent form was 
accurately explaine d and understood . A copy of the ICF must be provided to the subject or to the 
subject’s legally authorized representative . If applicable, it will be provided in a certified 
translation of the local language.  
The eCRF  for this study contains a section for d ocumenting informed subject consent, and this 
must be completed appropriately . Signed ICFs must remain in each subject’s study file and must 
be available for verification by study monitors at any time . If new safety information results in 
changes in the ri sk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated as 
necessary . All subjects (including those already being treated) should be informed of the new

 information, should be given a copy of the revised form, and should give their consent t o 
continue in the study.  
19.3. Institutional Review Board  
This study is being conducted under a United States IND application . This protocol (and any 
modifications) and appropriate consent procedures must be reviewed and approved by an 
IRB/IEC . This board must o perate in accordance with the current federal or local  regulations . 
The investigator will send a letter or certificate of IRB /IEC  approval to Kadmon Corporation (or 
designee) before subject enrollment and whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol a re 
made.  
19.4. Future Use of Subject Samples  
Not all of the tissue and blood components obtained during this study may be required for the 
tests that are part of the clinical trial . Following the conclusion of the study, the samples may be 
used for additional re search . This research will help to understand disease subtypes, drug 
response and toxicity, and possibly identify new drug targets or biomarkers that predict subject 
response to treatment . The use of the samples for internal research will be done according  to the 
guidelines defined by the FDA guidance for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover 
Human Specimens that are Not Individual Identifiable (issued 25 April 25 2006) and the 
European Medicines Agency Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenetic Sample s, Testing and Data 
Handling (EMEA/CHMP/PGxWP/201914/2006) . If a subject requests destruction of their tissue 
and blood samples and the samples have not yet been de -identified, Kadmon  Corporation  will 
destroy the samples as described in this FDA guidance . Kadmon Corporatio n will notify the 
investigator in writing that the samples have been destroyed.

 22. STUDY DOCUMENTATION,  CRFS, AND RECORD KE EPING  
22.1. Investigator’s Files and Retentio n of Documents  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified . These documents should 
be classified into 2 separate categories as follows : (1) investigator’s study file s; and (2)  subject 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments, eCRF s, query 
forms, IRB/IEC , and governmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consen t, 
drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents 
and correspondence.  
Subject clinical source documents (usually predefined by the project to record key efficacy and 
safety parameters independent of the eCRF s) may include subject hospital/clinic records, 
physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, 
electroencephalogram, X -ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed ICFs, consultant 
letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs . The investigator must keep these 2 categories 
of documents on file for at least 2  years following the marketing application approval date for the 
study drug and for the indication being investigated or for 2  years after the investigatio n is 
discontinued and the FDA notified . After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed 
subject to local regulations with prior written permission from Kadmon Corporation . If the 
investigator wants to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, 
Kadmon Corporation  must be notified in advance.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee the archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and Kadmon 
Corporation  to store these in a sealed container outside of the study site so that they can be

 22.2. Source Documents and Background Data  
Upon request, the investigator will supply Kadmon Corporation  with any required background 
data from the study documentation or clinic records . In case of spec ial problems or governmental 
queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study 
records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected.  
22.3. Audits and Inspections  
The investigator should understand that so urce documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Kadmon Corporation  Quality Assurance 
Unit (or designee), or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification . The 
verification of the eCRF  data must be by direct inspection of source documents.  
22.4. Electronic Case Report Forms  
Clinical trial data for this study will be captured on electronic eCRF. The investigator agrees to 
provide all information requested on the eCRF in an accurate manner accordin g to instructions 
provided. Electronic CRFs are designed for computer processing and analysis. The investigator 
should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to Kadmon 
Corporation  (or designee)  in the eCRF and in all require d reports.  
An eCRF is required to be submitted for every subject  who receives any amount of study drug. 
This includes submission of retrievable data on subject s who withdraw before completion of the 
study. eCRFs must be reviewed for completeness and accura cy, and electronically signed where  
indicated, by  the principal investigator or authorized delegate from the study staff. If a subject 
stops treatment or terminates from the study, the dates and reasons must be noted on the eCRF .

 23. MONITORING THE STUDY  
It is understood that the responsible Kadmon Corporation  monitor (or designee) will contact and 
visit the investigator regularly and will be allowed on request to inspect the various records of 
the trial ( eCRF s and other pertinent data) provided subject confide ntiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements.  
It will be the monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF s at regular intervals throughout the 
study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of  
the data being entered on them . The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and 
other subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF . The investigator (or designee) 
must agree to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any proble ms detected in the course of 
these monitoring visits are resolved.

Appendix G: Clinical Adverse Events: Determining Relationship to Study Drug  
 
1 NOT RELATED  
This category applies to those AEs, which after careful medical consideration, are clearly 
felt to be due to e xtraneous causes ( eg, disease , environment, etc.) that are unrelated  to 
the administration of study drug.  
 
2 UNLIKELY RELATED  (must  have first 2)  
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt 
unlikely to be related to the administration of the study drug.  The relationship of an AE 
to the study drug can be considered unlikely  if: 
 
• It does not  follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could readily have been a result of the subject’s clinical state, environmental or to xic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
• It does not follow a known r esponse pattern to the suspected drug.  
• It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
 
3 POSSIBLY RELATED  (must have first 2)  
 
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt 
unlikely to be related t o the administration of the study drug, but the possibility cannot be 
ruled out with certainty.  The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered 
possible  if: 
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could  readily have been a result of the subject’s clinical state, environmental or to xic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug.  
 
4 PROBABLY RELATED  (must have first 3)  
 
This categ ory applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt 
with a high degree of certainty to be related to the administration of the study drug.  The 
relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered probable  if: 
 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
• It could not be reasonably e xplained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors  or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject.  
• It disap pears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction in dose.*

5 DEFINITELY RELATED  (must have first 3)  
 
This category applies to those AEs, which after careful medical consideration, are felt t o 
be related to the administration of the study drug.  The relationship of an AE to the study 
drug can be considered related  if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or drug 
levels have been established in body fluids o r tissues.  
• It could not be reasonably e xplained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors  or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject.  
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reducti on on dose and appears 
upon rechallenge.*  
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug.  
 
 
 
*There are e xceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly e xists.

Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) 
for determination of plasma 
concentrations of KD025 and its 
metabolites, will be collected on Day 1 
of Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time 
points: Pre -dose (Time 0), and 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing (after 
first dose for subjects in the BID

samples c ollected pre -dose on Day 1 of 
Cycle 4, and pre-dose at t he Cycle 7, 
Day 1 visit ., and at the EOT visit. 
Also, if appropriate, a sample will be 
requested if a subject discontinues 
treatment prematurely.  Subjects should 
be instructed to withhold taking study  
drug on these days as dosing will be 
performed at the clinic.  
Subjects will have a total 17 16

Response Activity and Assessments  
Activity i n terms of cGVHD severity 
will be evaluated using the Physician -
reported global cGVHD Activity 
Assessment form (see Appendix A ), 
while activity in terms of symptom 
burden will be evaluated using the 
cGVHD Activity Assessment - Patient 
Self Report (see Appendix C ). Failure -
free survival (FFS), Overall Survival 
(OS) and Time to Next Treatment 
(TTNT) will be evaluated at the same 
time points. Changes in corticosteroid 
and calcineurin inhibitor dose will  be 
documented as they occur on the 
appropriate eCRF. Changes in 
symptom burden/bother will be 
documented using the Lee cGVHD 
Symptom Scale (see Appendix D ).

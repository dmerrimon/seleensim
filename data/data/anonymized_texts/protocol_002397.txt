 Study Design:  This is a multicenter, open -label, Phase 1b/2 study  to evaluate the 
immunotherapy agents APX005M and nivolumab, in combination with Gem and 
NP in patients  with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
 
Phase 1 b 
In the Phase  1b portion of the study, the following 4 treatment cohorts  will be 
evaluated for feasibility and safety : 
B1: NP/Gem/APX005M 0.1 mg/kg  
B2: NP/Gem/APX005M 0.3 mg/kg  
C1: Nivolumab/ NP/Gem/APX005M 0.1 mg/kg  
C2: Nivolumab/ NP/Gem/APX005M 0.3 mg/kg  
Enrollment in Cohorts B2 and C1 may occur concurrently. Enrollm ent in 
Cohort  C2 may begin once enrollment in Cohort C1 has been completed.  
Each cohort in the Phase 1b portion of the study will include  approximately 
6 DLT -evaluable patients . A cohort corresponding to Arm A of Phase 2 
(nivolumab/ NP/Gem) will not be tested, since an external study is being 
conducted to confirm the safety  of nivolumab in combination with NP/Gem.  
DLT is defined as  any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that is treatment -related but not 
related to the natural progression of the tumor and occurs during the DLT 
observation period . 
 
Phase 2  (Randomized)  
Patients  will be randomized to one of three arms: Arm A1, Arm B2, or Arm C2 
(shown below).  
Treatment arms:  
A1: Nivolumab/ NP/Gem   
B2: NP/Gem/APX005M 0.3 mg/kg  
C2: Nivolumab/ NP/Gem /APX005M 0.3 mg/kg   
 
A total of approximately 93 patients  will be randomized /enrolled  in Phase  2 (35 
Arm A1, 29 Arm B2, 29  Arm C2).  Twelve DLT -evaluable patients  from the 
Phase 1b study, enrolled at the RP2D  of APX005M in Arm C (i.e., 6 patients  on 
B2 and 6 patients  on C2) will be included in the Phase 2 analysis.  Thus, each arm 
will enroll 35  patients , for a total of approximately 105 patients . In the first step 
of randomization, 12  patients  will be randomize d in a 4:1:1 allocation to achieve 
balance in the total number of patients  in each arm (since Arm A1 did not enroll 
patients  in Phase 1b, more patients  have to be allocated to Arm A1).  Once the 12  
patients  are randomized, step 2 will randomize the remaining 81  patients  in a 
1:1:1 allocation.

 Treatment Duration:  Assuming all 4 cohorts are tested , upon completion of enrollment to Phase 1b , 1 
additional month of follow -up will occur before declaring the RP2D of 
APX005M. Then the Phase 2 portion of the study  will have 12 additional 
months of follow -up. Target enrollment completion is within 24 months; 
however, enrollment will proceed until met or as determined by the study 
sponsor ( Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy [ PICI ]). Considering 
several months for data management and statistical analysis, the total duration 
of the study  is likely to be  5 years.  
Patients  will undergo screening and, if eligible, will undergo treatment in the 
assigned arm of the study until unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or 
withdraw al of consent.  All patients  will be followed for survival status until 
death or a maximum of 5  years.  
Study Endpoints:  Phase 1b:  
Primary : 
• The frequency of DLT  
• The RP2D  of APX005M when combined with NP/Gem  or 
nivolumab/ NP/Gem   
• The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ), and adverse events ( AEs) causing discontinuation  
Secondary:  
• OR is determined by RECIST  v1.1 
• DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of response 
(complete response [ CR] or partial response [ PR]) to first 
documentation of progressive disease  (PD)  
Exploratory:  
• PK of APX005M  will be  determined in Cycles 1 to 4 . 
• Immune pharmacodynamic endpoints may  include, but are  not limited 
to, the following : 
o Changes in the tumor microenvironment (including cellularity, 
stromal content, cellular infiltration, and t umor apoptosis) may be 
assessed by tumor multiplex immunohistochemistry  or other 
appropriate technology . Pharmacodynamic and PK parameters, if 
available, may be used to influence the RP2D.  
o Gene expression may be determined by tumor RNA sequencing , 
peripher al blood RNA sequencing,  or other appropriate technology . 
Other sequencing technologies, such as ATAC sequencing, may be 
performed.  
o Tumor genomics may be determined when possible by Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendment -certified  mutational panel 
assessments and /or by whole exome sequencing.  
o For variant calling and human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) 
determination, normal tissue whole exome sequencing may  be 
performed.  In some cases, data regarding germ -line BRCA1/2 
mutations or microsa tellite instability  may be incorporated into 
analyses.  
o Cytokine and/or circulating factor analysis may be determined by a 
multiplex assay  or other appropriate technology . 
o Flow cytometry  or other related technologies, such as CyTof analysis  
of peripheral bl ood, may be used to assess phenotype, function, and 
other changes in immune cellular subsets .

 Phase 2:  
Primary:  
• OS is defined as the time from initiation of study therapy to date of death 
due to any cause or date of most recent patient  contact.  Patients  who 
have not died are censored on their most recent contact date.  
• 1-year OS rate in each treatment arm . 
Secondary : 
• Investigators’ assessment of OR is determined by RECIST v1.1 and the 
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients  who achieve a CR or PR . 
• DCR is defined as the proportion of patients  who achieve a CR or PR or 
SD. 
• DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of response (CR 
or PR) to first documentation of PD . 
• PFS is defined as the time from initiation of study therapy to date of first 
documented progression of disease, date of death due to any cause or 
date of most recent patient  contact which documented progression -free 
status (i.e., clinic visit date or scan date). Patients  who have not 
progressed or died are censored on their most recent progression -free 
date.  
• The incidence of AEs defined as unacceptable t oxicities in Phase 2 , 
TEAEs, SAEs, and AEs causing treatment discontinuation  
• Clinical laboratory data and vital signs (descriptive statistics) and 
numbers of patients  with values outside limits of the normal range at 
each time point.  
Exploratory:  
• The exploratory endpoints for Phase 2 are the same as those described 
above for Phase 1b  with the addition of evaluation of baseline and on -
treatment microbiome profiles with treatment outcomes.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  This is a multi -center, open -label Phase 1b/2 study  of CD40 agonistic 
monoclonal antibody, APX005M, and/or PD -1 blocking antibody, nivolumab, 
in combination with NP and Gem and for patients  with newly diagnosed 
metastatic pancreatic cancer.  The primary obj ectives of the Phase  1b study  are 
to determine the feasibility, safety and DLT of each treatment cohort and to 
determine the RP2D  of APX005M in combination with NP/Gem and with 
nivolumab/NP/ Gem . The primary objective of the randomized Phase 2 study  is 
to evaluate OS in three treatment arms: nivolumab/ NP/Gem, 
NP/Gem/APX005 M and nivolumab /NP/Gem/APX005M by comparing the 
1-year OS rate with the historical value  for NP/Gem . 
The safety population  consists of all patients  who received at least 1 dose of any 
study drug . This is the population for the primary analyses of safety.  
The DLT -evaluable population  consists of patients who received 2 or 3 doses 
of NP/Gem  and 1 dose of APX005M  during Cycle 1 , thus have completed the 
DLT observation period (ie, from the time of first administration of study drugs  
until prior to Cycle 2 Day  1) Patients who do not meet these criteria will be 
replaced in Phase 1b only, to assist with DLT and RP 2D decision -making.  
The efficacy population  consists of (1) all patients  who were  
randomized /enrolled  in Phase  2 and received at least 1 dose of any study drug 
and (2) the 12 DLT -evaluable patients  (6 on Arm B and  6 on Arm C) who were 
enrolled in Phase 1b at the RP2D. The efficacy population is the population for 
the primary analyses of efficacy.  
Phase 1b Design:  Four treatment cohorts will be evaluated for feasibility and 
safety. Cohorts B1 and B2 will escalate th e dose of APX005M when combined 
with NP/Gem , and then Cohorts C1 and C2 will escalate the dose of APX005M 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
11 
 when combined with nivolumab/ NP/Gem.  Enrollment in Cohorts B2 and C1 may 
occur concurrently. Enrollment in Cohort C2 may begin once enrollment in 
Coho rt C1 has been completed. Approximately 6  DLT -evaluable patients  will be 
enrolled in each cohort.  A1 (nivolumab/ NP/Gem) will not be tested  in Phase 1b , 
since an external study is being conducted to confirm the safety  of nivolumab in 
combination with NP/Gem.  
Statistical analyses will include the following:  
• The number of patients  treated in each cohort will be reported, and 
reasons why any patient  is not DLT evaluable will be summarized.  
• Approximately 6  DLT -evaluable patients  will be fully analyzed in each 
treatment cohort.  
• Feasibility issues will be described for each treatment cohort.  
• Toxicities will be graded by NCI -CTC AE, causality attributed, and 
tabulated by treatment cohort.  
• RP2D  of APX005M when combined with NP/Gem and with 
nivolumab/ NP/Gem will be determined.  
• RECIST OR will be scored and tabulated along with DOR , by treatment 
cohort.  
• PK of APX005M . 
• Immune pharmacodynamic effects will be mea sured, including change 
from baseline, and reported by treatment cohort.  
 
Phase 2 Design:  Once the RP2D  of APX005M has been defined, the randomized 
Phase 2 portion of the study will commence.  Patients  will be randomized to one 
of 3 arms, defined by the addition of one or more immunotherapy agents to 
standard of care NP/Gem.  The arms will be either A1 vs B2 vs C2 or A1 vs B1 
vs C1.  Note  that the APX005M dose must be the same in Arms B and C, 
regardless of whether a higher APX005M dose was determined to be safe in Arm 
B. For each regimen, efficacy will be evaluated by co mparing the 1 -year overall 
survival (OS)  rate to the historical value for NP/Gem.  
Statistical analyses will include the following:  
• Thirty -five patients  will be analyzed on each treatment arm. Twelve  
DLT -evaluable patients  from Phase 1 b (Arms B and C) and 93 patients  
from Phase 2 will comprise the population for the final analysis of 
efficacy . 
• OS will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method for each treatment 
arm. 
• The 1 -year OS rate and 1 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be 
calculated for each treatment arm, to  determine whether the lower bound 
of the CI excludes the historical value for NP/Gem. A 1-sided one -
sample Z test will also be conducted. The goal is to compare the survival 
probability at 1 -year to the historical value of 0.35.  
• ORR and DCR and their 95% CIs will be calculated for each treatment 
arm. 
• PFS will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method for each treatment 
arm.  
• DOR will be calculated from dates of first documented response and 
progression of disease.  
• Toxicities will be graded by CTCAE v4.03 and  tabulated by treatment 
arm.  
• PK of APX005M  in Cycles 1 to 4  (Arms B and C) . 
• Immune pharmacodynamic effects may be measured, including  but not 
limited to  change from baseline, and reported by treatment arm.  
• Test of associations between immune biomarkers and clinical outcomes

 4 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  on Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer  
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract , with 
a 5-year survival of about 8%.  In the United States (US) an estimated total of 53,070  PCs will 
occur in 2016, with 41,780 estimated deaths among these patients . In 2016, PC surpassed 
breast cancer to become the third leading cause of cancer death in the US and is projected to 
become the  second leading cause of cancer death by 2030. 1 There are several potential reasons 
for the increased mortality associated with pancreatic adenocar cinoma. First, the majority of 
patients  are diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma at an advanced stage, when the patient  
has unresectable disease and is therefore incurable. Even in the 15% to 20% of patients  with 
resectable, and therefore potentially c urable, disease at diagnosis, only about 10 % to 15% of 
those patients  are alive at 5  years with surgery alone.  This only improves to 20 % to 25% with 
gemcitabine (Gem) and/or concurrent chemoradiation adjuvant therapy .2-4 The low survival 
associated with re sectable disease is thought to be due to microscopic metastases emerging 
early in the course of PC development. Furthermore, PC tends to be relatively resistant to 
chemotherapy, which accounts for the modest benefit of adjuvant therapy as noted above.  Even  
with the development of more aggressive and effective regimens – namely FOLFIRINOX and 
Gem  and nab-paclitaxel  (NP)  – the median overall survival  (OS)  is still less than a year for 
patients  with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 5,6 Continued advancements in treatment 
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are imperative.  
Immunotherapy  
Among the promising approaches to activating therapeutic antitumor immunity is the 
modulation of host immune system. Immune modulation includes inhibitory or st imulatory 
pathways in the immune system that are crucial for activating the immune response, 
maintaining self -tolerance, and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological 
immune responses. Modulation of immune checkpoints by antibodies against imm une 
inhibitory molecules has shown clinical benefits for patients  with malignancies such as 
melanoma. 7,8 Currently, antagonistic antibodies against immune inhibitory molecules such as 
cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated protein 4 ( CTLA -4) and programmed cell death -1 (PD-1)/
programmed  cell death ligand -1 (PD-L1) and agonistic antibodies against immune 
costimulatory molecules such as cluster of differentiation ( CD)40 are under active 
development for different cancer indications. To date, the anti-CTLA4 antibody  ipilimumab  is 
US Food and  Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved for use in metastatic melanoma both as a 
single agent or in combination with PD -1 inhibitors (nivolumab).  The PD -1 inhibitors 
nivolumab and pembrolizumab are now approved in various diseases.  
Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer  
While checkpoint  inhibitors have been effective in melanoma and lung cancer, clinical benefit 
of CTLA -4 and PD -1 inhibitors as single agents in the management in PC patients  has not been 
noted. 9,10 Current immunotherapy studies  utilize a combination of traditional anti -cancer 
therapy with checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, or other immunotherapy agents as single or 
combination therapies, such as CD40 monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs ).11

 In this study, we are evaluating the combination of a CD40 agonist, APX005M, with a PD -1 
inhibitor, nivolumab, and standard chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Gem  and NP. 
CD40 Monoclonal Antib odies  
The cell surface molecule CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 
superfamily, plays an important role in induction of tumor apoptosis and regulation of immune 
activation, especially in crosstalk between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). 12 
CD40 is expressed by dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, monocytes, and some non -lymphoid 
cells. 13 The natural ligand (CD40L) for CD40 is CD154, which is expressed on activated T 
cells and provides a major component of T cell “help” for immune response.  Agonistic CD40 
antibodies can substitute for the function of CD154 on T cells to boost immunity.  
Signaling through CD40 on APCs, including DCs, monocytes, and B cells, can, in turn, 
enhance the T cell response via improvement in antigen processing and presentation, and 
through the release of cytokines from activated APCs. 14,15 Therefore, an agonistic CD40 
antibody can activate and stimulate both innate and adaptive immunity.  
CD40 is also expressed on many tumor cells and can mediate a direct cytotoxic effect. In 
addition to B cell lymphoma, CD40 expression has b een reported in 30% to 70% of primary 
human solid tumor samples, including melanoma and carcinomas 16 and 25% of PCs.17 
Activation of CD40 on tumor cells results in tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor 
growth. 18 Due to its action on both immune and tumor cells, CD40 has been studied as a target 
for novel cancer immunotherapy; agonistic anti -CD40 antibodie s have been demonstrated to 
be potent stimulators of tumor immune responses in both animal models and cancer 
patients .19-22 
The potential mechanisms of action for an agonistic anti -CD40 antibody, depending on its 
isotype, include stimulation of immune response by activating antigen processing a nd 
presentation, recruitment of immune effectors such as natural killer (NK) cells and 
macrophages, and direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Thus, the desired therapeutic CD40 
agonist antibody should have these functionalities.  
A few CD40 agonistic ant ibodies have been evaluated in human clinical studies . Objective 
responses  (ORs)  have been observed with nearly every CD40 antibody formulation used as 
single agents across a variety of diseases, including PC. Toxicities have been transient and 
manageable.  The majority of the clinical studies in cancer patients  with solid tumors have been 
conducted with the fully human immunoglobulin G ( IgG)2 CD40 antibody CP -870,893.  In a 
Phase 1  clinical study , CP-870,893 was well tolerated; the  maximum tolerated dose  (MTD ) 
was found to be 0.2 mg/kg.  The main toxicity of CP -870,893 was cytokine release syndrome 
of mild to moderate severity. Antitumor activity was observed in several melanoma patients  
treated with CP -870,893. 23,24 
One study indicated that CP -870,893 can also mediate an  antitumor effect when combined with 
chemotherapy in patients  with metastatic PC.25 Other CD40 agonistic antibodies that have 
been studied in human clinical studies  are SGN -40 and ChiLob 7/4. SGN -40 is an IgG1 
humanized anti -CD40 antibody that is a weak CD40 agonist, which has been tested 
predominantly in hematological malignancies as mon otherapy or in combination with 
rituximab and chemotherapy .26,27 The major adverse effects of SGN -40 were anemia, pleural 
effusion, and thrombocytopenia. 26

 SEA -CD40 is an engineered ver sion of SGN -40. SEA -CD40 and SGN -40 have the same amino 
acid sequences, but the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of SEA -CD40 is defucosylated, 
leading to increased binding to and cross -linking  by FcγRIIIa . 
ChiLob 7/4 is an IgG1 chimeric CD40 agonistic a ntibody that has been tested in a Phase 1  
clinical study  in patients  with solid tumors.  The MTD of ChiLob 7/4 is 200mg/weekly × 4 , and 
the major dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was reversible liver enzyme elevation. 28 Although 
CP-870,893 has potent CD40 agonistic activities, it is an IgG2 antibody, and thus lacks 
antibody effector functions that constitute an i mportant mechanism of action for CD40 
antibody -mediated antitumor activities. 24 Due to its chimeric structure, ChiLob 7/4 might be 
immunogenic , especially considering that the immune response is boosted by its CD40 
agonistic effects.  
ADC -1013 is a fully human IgG1 CD40 -agonistic antibody in Phase 1 clinical trial for 
treatment of solid tumors. 29 ADC -1013 is intended for intra -tumoral delivery.  
SGN -40 is an IgG1 antibody, but a weak CD40 agonist. Due to its chimeric structure, 
ChiLob  7/4 may potentially be more immunogenic considering that the immune response may 
be boosted by its CD40 -agonistic effects. ADC -1013 has similar binding affinity as APX005M 
but is a weaker CD40 -agonistic antibody likely due to its lack of binding to Fc γRIIb. Although 
SEA -CD40 has increased potency compared with SGN -40, its high-affinity  binding to 
FcγRIIIa may lead to enhanced antibody effector functions such as antibody -dependent cell -
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) on CD40 -expressing cells such as DCs and B cells.  
An IgG1 humanized antibody that can utilize Fc receptor s to cluster CD40 and enhance CD40 -
agonistic effects, like APX005M, might be preferable both in terms of potential decreased 
immunogenicity and increased anti -tumor activity for use in  cancer immunotherapy.  
4.2 Background on  APX005M  
4.2.1 Pharmacology  
APX005M is an IgG1 humanized mAb with the S267E mutation at the Fc region. APX005M 
binds with high affinity to human CD40 (Kd = 1.2 × 10 -10 M) and monkey CD40 
(Kd = 3.5 × 10−10 M), but does not cross -react with mouse or rat CD40. APX005M blocks 
the binding of CD40 to CD 40L. The APX005M binding epitope has been mapped to 2  specific 
regions on CD40. These are 92TSEACESCVLHRSCSP107 and 
125PCPVGFFSNVSSAFEKCHPW144. The region 92TSEACESCVLHRSCSP107 is known 
as a CD40L -binding domain. It has been shown that CD40L -blocking antib odies tend to have 
more potent CD40 agonistic activities than CD40L -non-blocking antibodies .31 
Preclinical experiments with APX005M showed that it a ctivates the CD40 signaling pathway, 
leading to APC activation, as demonstrated by an increased expression of CD80, CD83, and 
CD86 and by expression and release of cytokines from human DCs and lymphocytes. As a 
result of APC activation, APX005M enhances T -cell proliferation to alloantigen, triggers 
production of interferon -gamma ( IFN-γ) in response to viral antigens, and enhances T -cell 
response to tumor antigens. APX005M combined with a toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) agonist or 
an antibody against PD -L1 synergistically enhances T -cell responses. In comparison with other 
CD40 -agonistic anti bodies, such as CP -870,893, SGN -40, and ADC -1013 analogs, APX005M 
is the most potent CD40 agonist. APX005M did not appear to have a substantive effect on 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
28 
 normal human DC and T -cell counts, but could partially reduce B -cell counts in vitro. The 
potential fo r APX005M to induce expression of cytokines was evaluated with peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from normal humans and treatment naïve cynomolgus 
monkeys, including anti-CD3 antibody as a positive control. Cytokine secretion differed 
significantly between species with much less secretion from monkey PBMCs compared with 
human PBMCs. These data suggest that APX005M is a strong CD40 -agonistic antibody that 
can activate APCs (DCs, B cells, and monocytes) and in turn stimulate T -cell response.  
The direct cytotoxicity effect and the antibody effector functions such as antibody -dependent 
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of APX005M were determined in CD40 positive human 
lymphoma xenograft models in mice. In human lymphoma Ramos models, APX005M was 
capable of inhibiting tumor growth in a dose -dependent manner, and eradicated established 
tumors at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. A significant anti -tumor effect was also observed in the 
rituximab -resistant Namalwa model [APX005M IB]. These data suggest that APX005M, as a 
single agent, can induce potent growth inhibition of CD40 -expressing human tumors.  
Preliminary human data show that APX005M induces a dose -dependent activation of APCs 
(as demonstrated by increases in expression of activation markers such as CD54, CD7 0, CD80, 
CD86, human leukocyte antigen [ HLA ]-DR), T cell activation and increases in circulating 
levels of interleukin ( IL)12, IFN-γ, TNF -α and IL6.  
4.2.2 Pharmacokinetics  
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of APX005M were determined in a Good Laboratory 
Practice  (GLP) repeat -dose toxicology study using cynomolgus monkeys. Weekly intravenous 
(IV) administration of 5 doses of APX005M was well tolerated at 0.3, 3, and 30  mg/kg. The 
PK properties of APX005M are typical of other mAbs and comprise low clearance (averag e 
range of 0.401 –7.27 mL/h/kg), small volume of distribution (average range of 57 –80.1 mL/kg), 
and long terminal half -life (average >  66 hours at 3 mg/kg and 30  mg/kg). Positive anti -drug 
antibodies (ADA) titers were observed in all animals in the low -dose group (0.3 mg/kg) but 
not in the high -dose group (30 mg/kg) [IB]. Based on these results, the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was considered 30 mg/kg.  
There are limited human PK data with APX005M at this time.  In the first in human study of 
APX00 5M, exposures to APX005M at dose levels of 0.03 mg/kg or less were for the most part 
below the limit of quantitation ( BLO Q). IV administration of APX005M at doses between 
0.1 and 1 mg/kg led to rapid increase in serum concentrations, reaching a maximum jus t after 
the end of the infusion. Levels declined rapidly thereafter and were for the most part BLOQ 
between 24 and 168 hours after the start of dosing. Increases in the dose of APX005M 
(0.1 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg) led to approximately dose -proportional increases  in maximum serum 
concentration (C max) and area under the curve at the last measurable time point (AUC 0–t). No 
accumulation of APX005M was observed with every 21 days dosing.  
4.2.3  Clinical Experience  
Study APX005M -001 is a first -in-human Phase 1 dose -escalation study of APX005M with 
8 pre-planned dose levels. APX005M was administered to study subjects at doses up to 
1 mg/kg. At the 1 mg/kg dose level, 1 out of 6 DLT -evaluable subjects experienced a DLT 
(Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome). Two additiona l subjects at the 1  mg/kg dose level 
experienced serious adverse events (SAE) in later cycles (Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
29 
 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia). On May 2, 2016 Apexigen decided to discontinue dose 
escalation and enroll up to 6 subjects in do se level 0.6 mg/kg (originally designed as an 
intermediate de -escalation dose level) and an additional 3 subjects at the previously completed 
dose level 0.3 mg/kg to better characterize the safety and pharmacodynamics of APX005M 
and to help establish the s ingle agent recommended Phase  2 dose (RP2D).  
As of 08 November  2016, 30 subjects have received APX005M with a median exposure of 
3 cycles and had 321 adverse events (AE):  
• 89% of AEs were ≤ Grade 2 . 
• 9% AEs were Grade 3 . 
• 1.5% of AEs were Grade 4.  
• The majorit y of AEs were considered unrelated to APX005M by the Investigator.  
APX005M demonstrated a dose -dependent activation of APCs (as demonstrated by increases 
in expression of activation markers such as CD54, CD70, CD80, CD86, HLA -DR), T -cell 
activation and inc reases in circulating levels of IL12, I FN-γ, TNF -α and IL6.  
For further details on the APX005M -001 study , please refer to latest version of the APX005M 
Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). 
4.2.4  Summary of the Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Sympt oms assoc iated with cytokine release syndrome (including but not limited to flushing, 
itchiness, chills, fever, rash, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, rigor, and myalgia) after 
administration of APX005M are possible and have been observed in some of the patients 
receiving APX005M. Guidance for monitoring and management of cytokine release syndrome 
are included  in Section 16.3 of this protocol and in the APX005M IB.  
Transient transaminase elevations (≤ Grade 2) have been observed in several patients  with liver 
metastases, which were not associated with a particular dose of APX005M. Six patients  with 
liver metastases enrolled in the study experienced a transient increa se in total bilirubin. Liver 
function test abnormalities tend to resolve to baseline within 7 days from APX005M 
administration.  
Transient decreases in peripheral blood lymphocyte count in general and B -cell count in 
particular have been observed for APX005 M as well as for other CD40 -agonistic mAbs, and 
are believed to be a pharmacodynamic effect. Transient decreases in platelet counts were 
observed for some of the patients  receiving higher doses of APX005M but were not associated 
with bleeding or other clin ical manifestations.  
Other symptoms might also occur, including allergic reactions, which could be severe, 
pulmonary edema, and rarely, thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction and/or death.  
In the ongoing Phase 1 study APX005M -001, APX005M demonstrate d a dose -dependent 
activation of APCs, T cell activation and increases in circulating levels of cytokines.  
The biological effects and the overall tolerability of APX005M up to 1  mg/kg suggest a best 
in class profile for APX005M and the possibility of a saf e and tolerable combination with other 
immunomodulatory antibodies such as nivolumab.

 4.2.5  Dose Rationale  
APX005M has been administered in the APX005M -001 study to patients  with solid tumors as 
a single  agent at 7 dose levels starting at 0.1 mg/kg up to 1.0 mg/kg every 21  days.  At 0.6 and 
1 mg/kg dose level s 1 out of 6 patients  experienced a DLT. The RP2D for APX005M as a 
single agent every 21 days is 0.3 mg/kg.  
The proposed doses of APX005M are 0.1 mg/kg  (10 times lower than the highest dose of 
APX005M administered to human patients ) and 0.3 mg/kg (approx imately  3.3 times lower 
than the highest dose of APX005M administered to human patients ).  
At all dose levels proposed, APX005M has been well tolerated; all adverse reactions have been 
moderate (≤ Grade 2), transient and easily managed in outpatient setting.  All available data 
suggests that 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg every 21 days is a safe and pharmacodynamically active dose 
of APX005M.  
4.3 Background on Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 that targets the PD -1 blocking 
antibody.  PD-1, also known as CD279, is a cell surface membrane recep tor pred ominantly 
expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes and memory T ly mphocytes and, when bound to 
its ligands PD -L1 or programmed cell death ligand -2 (PD-L2), negatively regulates the 
immune system.  While PDL -1 and PDL -2 are common ly expressed on DCs and other APC s, 
a variety of different tumor cells can also express these ligands .32 
4.3.1 Clinical Studies of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is a human  IgG4 mAb  has specific FDA -approved indications in multiple diseases: 
metastatic melanoma, non-small -cell l ung cancer ( NSCLC ), renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ), 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,  and Hodgkin’s disease.  Single -agent 
nivolumab has been studied 33 at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks  (Q2W)  in 296 subject s 
with melanoma (n  = 104), NSCLC (n  = 122), castration -resistant prostate cancer (n  = 17), RCC  
(n = 34), or colorectal carcinoma (n = 19). Drug -related Grade 3 or 4 AE s occurred in 14% of 
subject s, and there were 3 deaths from pulmonary toxicity.  No MTD  was defined at the doses 
tested.  A relative dose intensity of ≥  90% w as achieved in 86% of subject s. Fifteen of 
296 subject s (5%) discontinued due to treatment -related AEs. The most common AEs , 
irrespective of causality , were  fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, cough, dyspnea, constipation, 
vomiting, rash, pyrexia, and headache.  Common treatment -related AEs included fatigue, rash, 
diarrhea, prurit us, anorexia and nausea.  The most common (≥  5%) Grade ≥  3 AEs included 
fatigue (5%).  Treatment -related SAEs occurred in 32 of 296  subject s (11%) and >  1% included 
pneumonitis (2%).  Drug -related events of special interest included pneu monitis, vitiligo, 
colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, uveitis, and thyroiditis.  The spectrum, frequency and severity 
of treatment -related AEs were sim ilar across dose levels tested.  
Antitumor activity was observed at all doses tested.  ORs were observed NSCL C, melanoma, 
and RCC  and in sites of metastasis including liver, lung, lymph nodes and bone.  In subject s 
with NSCLC, ORs were observed at doses of 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 mg/kg with rates of 6%, 32%, 
and 18% respectively.  Responses  were observed in 6/18  subject s with squamous tumors (33%), 
in 7/56 (12%) of those with non -squamous histology, and in 1 of 2 (50%) of those with 
unknown histology.  Stable disease (SD) lasting ≥  24 weeks was observed in 7 subject s (7%) 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
31 
 with lung cancer.  In melanoma, 26 ORs were observed at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10.0  mg/kg.  
At a dose of 3.0 mg/kg ORs were observed in 7 of 17  subject s (41%).  SD lasting ≥  24 weeks 
was observed in 6  subject s (6%).  In RCC , ORs were seen in 4 of 17 subject s (24%) treated 
with 1.0 mg/kg and in 5 of 16 subject s (31%) treated with 10.0  mg/kg.  SD lasting ≥  24 weeks 
was observed in 9 subject s (27%).  No responses were observed in subject s with  colorectal or 
prostate cancer.  
A Phase 1 study has investigated nivolumab in combination with platinum -based doublet 
chemotherapy in chemotherapy -naïve NSCLC. 34 Subject s with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were 
randomized by histology to nivolumab (10 mg/kg Day 1/21)/ Gem  (1250 mg/m 2 Days 1, 
8/21)/cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 Day 1/21), nivolumab (10  mg/kg Day 1/21)/pemetrexed (500  mg/m 2 
Day 1/21)/cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 Day 1/21) or nivolumab (10 mg/kg Day 1/21)/carboplatin 
(AUC  6 Day 1/21)/paclitax el (200 mg/m 2 Day 1/21).  Nivolumab doses were started at 
10 mg/kg every 3 weeks  until progressive disease  (PD) ; platinum doublet chemotherapy was 
given for a maximum of 4 cycles.  Across the treatment arms of the study, no DLTs  were seen 
at the 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose in combination with the platinum doublets.  Tumor responses 
ranged from 33 % to 47%, with carboplatin/paclitaxel in combination with nivolumab 10 mg/kg, 
demonstrating a 47% objective response rate ( ORR ). An additional arm assessed 
carboplatin/paclitaxel with 5  mg/kg nivolumab , which showed similar ORR of 43%, 
suggesting a lack of a correlation of dose with response at these doses tested.  Across the arms, 
responses were du rable , with an estimated median duration of 24 to 85 weeks.  Median 
progression -free survival ( PFS) in the carboplatin/paclitaxel arm in combination with 5 and 
10 mg/kg nivolumab was 31 and 21  weeks, respectively; and 1 -year overall survival ( OS) rate 
was 8 6% and 60%.  The most common treatment -related Grade  3 or 4 AEs were pneumonitis 
(4 subject s, 7%), fatigue (3  subject s, 5%) and acute renal failure (3 subject s, 5%). 34 
A Phase 1 study is exploring nivolumab in combination with taxanes chemotherapy in PC, 
NSCLC , and metastatic breast cancer.  The interim results from the PC and NSCLC cohorts 
were published re cently. 35-36 
The primary objective of Part 1 is to evaluate DLTs.  Subjects  treated with ≥ 2 cycles of 
nivolumab with chemotherapy  and remained on study for 14  calendar days or who 
discontinued due to DLT prior to completing 2 cycles of nivolumab were considered DLT 
evaluable.  If deemed safe, treatment arms will be expanded in Part 2 to further assess safety, 
tolerability, and antitumor activity.  In Arm A Part 1, subject s with advanced PC and 1 prior 
chemotherapy  regimen received NP 125 mg/m 2 on D ays 1, 8, and 15 and nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
on Days 1 and 15 of a 28 -day cycle. 35-36 
If Arm A is safe, a cohort of CT -naive subject s will be enrolled in Arm B and tre ated with NP 
and Gem 1000 mg/m once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks  + nivolumab.  In Arm C, 
treatment -naive subject s with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC received 4 cycles of NP 100 mg/ m2 on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 and carbopla tin AUC 6 on D ay 1 and nivolumab 5 mg/kg on D ay 15 of a 
21-day cycle.  If Arm C is safe, subject s in Arm D will receive the Arm C regimen, except 
nivolumab will start at Cycle  3. In both NSCLC arms, nivolumab monotherapy begins at 
Cycle  5.35-36 
As of June 28, 2016, 11 and 6 subjects were treated in Arms  A and B in Part 1, respectively. 
No DLTs were reported in Arm A, and 1 in Arm B (nonimmune hepatitis,  suspected to be due 
to Gem; resolved and subject continued nivo lumab  + NP without Gem). The most common 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
32 
 Grade 3 or 4 treatment -emergent AEs were pulmonary embolism, neutropenia, and anemia in 
2 of 11 subjects (18%) in Arm A and  anemia  in 2 of 6 subjects (33%) in Arm B. Nine subjects 
discontinued due to PD (8 in Arm A, 1 in Arm  B). Of the  9 response -evaluable subject s in 
Arm A, 2 had a partial response ( PR), 4 had a SD and 3 had PD. Of the  6 response -evaluable 
subject s in Arm B, 3 had a PR and  3 had a SD. 36 
It was concluded that adding  nivolumab  to NP ± Gem is feasible for subjects  with advanced 
PC, and antitumor activity of this regimen appears to be  encouraging .36 
Dose Rationale for Nivolumab  
The safety and efficacy of a 240  mg Q2W  flat dose of nivolumab is expected to be similar to 
the 3 mg/kg Q2W  dosing regimen. Per the nivolumab IB, a flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg 
Q2W  was selected since it is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80  kg, the 
observed median body wei ght in nivolumab treated cancer subject s. Using a population PK 
model, the overall distributions of nivolumab exposures ( average concentration at steady state 
[Cavgss], minimum concentration at steady state [ Cminss], Cmaxss, and minimum concentration at 
1 hour [Cmin1]) are comparable after treatment with either 3  mg/kg or 240 mg nivolumab.  The 
predicted range of nivolumab exposures (median and 90% prediction intervals) resulting from 
a 240 mg flat dose across the 35 to 160 kg weight range is maintained well  below the 
corresponding exposures observed with the well tolerated 10  mg/kg nivolumab Q2W  dosage.  
In a clinical study, a dose association was observed for infusion site reactions and 
hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5%  at 10 mg/kg).  All 
the events were Grade 1 to 2 and were manageable.  An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 
3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any 
safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg  nivolumab dose infused over a 
60-minute duration.  The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered as a 30 -minute infusion 
was assessed in CA209153 in subject s (n = 322) with previously treated advanced NSCLC.  
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infusion -related reactions (of any cause or treatment -related) in subject s 
administered nivolumab over a 30 -minute infusion compared with that reported for subjec ts 
with the 60 -minute infusion.  Thus, it was shown that nivolumab can be safely infused over 
30 minutes. 
4.4 Background on Gemcitabine and nab -Paclitaxel  
In 1996, Gem was approved for the management of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma due 
to an improvement  in median OS over 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU; 5.65 versus 4.41 months). 37 Gem 
monotherapy was the mainstay of treatment for over 10 years, before FOLFIRI NOX 
demonstrated an improved 11.1 -month median OS compared with 6.8  months with Gem 
monotherapy. 5 Though there was a marked improvement in OS, FOLF IRINOX was also 
associated with significant AEs, including Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (45.7%), neutropenic fever 
(5.4%), fatigue (23.6%), vomiting (14.5%), diarrhea (12.7%), and neuropathy (9%).  
In 2013, Gem and NP was approved for use in subjects with metas tatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, with studies demonstrating an 8.5 -month median OS compared with 
5.7 months with Gem monotherapy.  The most common Grade 3 or greater AEs associated with 
Gem and NP included neutropenia (38%), fatigue (17%), neutropenic fever  (3%), and 
neuropathy (17%) .6 Though Gem plus NP has not been compared head -to-head with 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
33 
 FOLFIRINOX, the side effects from Gem and NP tend to be less frequent, and this result may 
better allow for testing additional chemotherapy combinations.  Results from a randomized 
Phase 3 clinical study comparing NP plus Gem versus Gem alone in 861  first-line PC subjects 
showed subjects on NP plus Gem had a median survival of 8.5  months compared with 
6.7 months for those who received Gem alone .6 At the end of 1  year and 2  year, 35% and 9%, 
respectively, of those receiving the combination were alive, compared with 22% and 4% of 
those being treated with Gem only.  Toxicities were modest and cente red on reversible 
myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy.  
4.5 Rationale  
Scientific Summary  
Preclinical studies show that in mouse models of pancreatic carcinoma, the combination of 
Gem and NP with agonist CD40 mAb triggers an effective T cell response, for which clinical 
benefit can be safely extended with anti -PD-1. NP/Gem is poorly effective i n this model as is 
either single agent CD40 or PD -1 mAb. Combination therapy, however, induces a robust T -cell 
response, marked infiltration of T cells into the tumor (not otherwise observed) and tumor 
response and increased survival.  
Clinical Summary  
Tumor regressions in patients with metastatic PC have been observed with NP/Gem, 
nivolumab/ NP, nivolumab/ NP/Gem, and Gem/CP870,893 (anti -CD40). The protocol now 
incorporates all four of these approaches by combining NP/Gem with nivolumab and 
APX005 M (anti -CD40).  
Currently, no clin ical data are available for the combination of APX005M plus Gem  and NP 
with or without nivolumab.  This combination is going to be expl ored in this Phase 1b/2 study , 
which  includes a Phase 1 b dose-finding part and a Phase 2 efficacy evaluation part in patients  
with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma  (see Section 6.1 for study 
design details) . The Phase 1 data will define the RP2D  of APX005M when combined with the 
standard dose of Gem  and NP, with or without nivolumab . 
Two doses for APX005M are being explored, based on data from its manufacturer , Apexigen , 
from findings of the first -in-human Phase  1 dose -escalation study.  The doses of APX005M 
chosen for this study are 0.1 mg/kg (10 times lower than the highest dose of APX005M 
administered to human patients ) and 0.3 mg/kg ( the recommended single -agent dose; 
approximately 3.3 times lower than the highest dose of APX005M administered to human 
patients ). Doses for nivolumab are based on prior experience of using this antibody in 
combination with Gem  and NP.  The doses of nivolumab, Gem , and NP selected for this study 
are per the FDA -approved US labeling.  
The secon d part of the study  is aimed to evaluate in an exploratory manner the activity of 
APX005M combined with Gem  and NP, with or without nivolumab in metastatic pancreas 
cancer patients . A randomization process will be used  to avoid the potential bias in patient  
selection and to balance risk factors between treatment arms . 
Following FDA approval in 2013, t he combination of Gem  and NP has become a gold standard 
in the f irst-line setting for patient  with me tastatic PC; however , the prognosis remains poor.

 This persistent unmet medical need in PC is directi ng researchers to explore new treatments, 
including immunological approaches.  
Nivolumab, a PD -1-specific antibody, has been shown to produce long -term remissions with 
limited toxicity in patients  with advanced melanoma, and also showed activity in NSCLC, 
RCC , and Hodgkin ’s lymphoma . So far, PC appeared refractory to single -agent checkpoint 
blockade alone. 10 
Preclinical data support the rationale of this clinical study . A recent study using a genetically 
engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA ), which like human PDA 
exhibits minimal spontaneous immunity, demonstrated that despite robust expression of PD -1 
and PD -L1 in the tumor microenvironment, treatment with αPD -1 with or without αCTLA -4 
failed to improve the survival of mice or slow the growth of PDA tumors.  However, 
administration  of αCD40, Gem , and NP, induces T -cell immunity in mice with PDA,  controls 
tumor growth and significantly improves survival in a CD8+ T -cell-dependent manner.  In 
particular, αCD40/ NP/Gem  plus αPD -1 nearly doubles the median OS in genetically 
engineered Pdx1-Cre ( KPC ) mice with pre -established spontaneous pancreat ic tumors .38 
Moreover, the capability of treated mice to reject second and third subcutaneous tumor 
challenges in a CD8+ T -cell-dependent fashion , thereby rendering long -term survival , suggests 
the establishment of antitumor immune memory with curative potential.  These findings 
indicate that poorly immunogenic tumors, epitomized by the  KPC pancreatic tumor model, can 
nevertheless be controlled by the adaptive immune system provided a dual approach of 
therapeutic T cell induction and checkpoint blockade is utilized.  
Mechanistically, a  preclinica l study in the KPC mouse model in PDA showe d the ability of a 
single dose of αCD40 to alter T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment ( TME ), expand 
clonal T -cell populations, and convert the TME in PC to a site replete with infiltrating T  cells. 39 
In combination with a novel chemotherapy doublet, αCD40 treatment bypasses innate immune 
sensors to generate functional APCs and T cells, culminating in durable responses with 
curative potential,  even in a highly immunosuppressive TME.  
In this study, we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of αCD40 agonist, 
APX005M, with a PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab, and standard chemotherapy for pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, Gem  and NP.

a Enrollment in Cohorts B2 and C1 may occur concurrently . 
b Enrollment in Cohort C2 may begin once enrollment in Cohort C1 has been completed.  
In both Phase 1b and Phase 2 , participants will undergo the following  tumor biopsy procedures 
to assess tumor and immune markers : 
1. Prior to beginning study treatment  (i.e., baseline biopsy, mandatory . Archival tissue is 
acceptable )  
2. During treatment  (i.e., on-treatment biopsy; mandatory , if medically feasible) ; Cycle 2  
after second dose of  APX005M , or after third d ose Nivolumab for arms not including 
APX005M.  Otherwise, any on -treatment biopsy will be accepted unless there is no 
lesion that can be safely biopsied  
3. Additional biopsies may be performed for patients who have prolonged  stable diseas e, 
defined as stable for more than two, consecutive disease assessments by  RECIST  v1.1, 
and/or if  tumor shrinkage  is dem onstrated , followed by  a new lesion and/or  radiological  
disease progression  
4. Ad hoc collections may be performed with Medical Monitor approval

Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
39 
 In both Phase 1b and Phase 2, NP/Gem could be dosed according to one  of the schedules  below 
depending on whether or not the patient experiences toxicity : 
1. 2 weeks on, 1 week off  
2. 3 weeks on, 1 week off  
Please note : Day 15 assessments are still required on the 2 weeks on, 1 week off  schedule.  
Phase 1 b 
In the Phase  1b portion of the study, 4 t reatment cohorts  will be evaluated for feasibility and 
safety  (see Section 8.6.1 ). Enrollment in Cohorts B2 and C1 may occur concurrently.  
Enrollment in Cohort C2 may begin once enrollment in Cohort C1 has been completed. Each 
cohort  of the study will include  approximately 6 DLT -evaluable  patients , defined as patients 
who received 2 or 3 doses of NP/Gem and 1 dose of APX0 05M during Cycle 1 , thus have 
completed the DLT observation period  (ie, from the time of first administration of 
investigational agents  until prior to Cycle 2 Day 1 ). Patients who do not remain on study up to 
this time for reasons other than DLT will be replaced . DLT s will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) 
version 4.03 .  
A DLT is defined as  any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that is treatment -related but not related to 
the natural progression of the tumor and occurs during the DLT observation period. The 
following will be considered DLTs:   
1. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥ 7 days  
2. Grade 3 or  4 neutropenia with a single temperature of >  38.3ºC (101 ºF) or a sustained 
temperature of ≥ 38ºC (100.4 ºF) for more than one hour  
3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count <  25,000 cells/mm 3) if associated with:  
a. A bleeding event which does not result in hemodynamic instability but requires 
an elective platelet transfusion, or  
b. A life -threatening bleeding event which results in urgent intervention and 
admission to an Intensive Care Unit  
4. Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity (not laboratory)  
5. Grade 3 non -hematolog ic toxicity (not laboratory) lasting >  3 days despite optimal 
supportive care  
6. Any Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic laboratory value if:  
a. Medical intervention is required to treat the patient , or 
b. The abnormality leads to hospitalization, or  
c. The abnormality persists for >  1 week  
7. Grade 3 AEs that compr omise  a major organ (e.g. , congestive heart failure) regardless 
of duration  
8. Grade 5 toxicity.

 Randomized Pha se 2 
Once the RP2D of APX005M in combination with nivolumab in the Phase 1b portion of the 
study is determined , the randomized Phase  2 portion will commence. Patients  will be 
randomized to Arm A1, Arm B2, or Arm C2, or to Arm A1, Arm B1, or Arm C1, if Cohort  B2 
and/or C2 are deemed unsafe in Phase 1b (see Section 8.6.2 ). Note that the APX005M dose 
must be the same in Arms B and C, regardless of whether a higher APX005M dose was 
determined to be safe in Arm B . For each regimen, efficacy will be evaluated by comparing 
the 1 -year OS rate to the historical value for NP/Gem.  A total of approximately  93 patients  
will be randomized /enrolled  in Phase  2 (35 Arm A1, 29 Arm B2, 29 Arm C2).  
Based on the safety and effica cy data from Phase 1b, Arm B2 and C2 were selected for Phase 
2. 
Randomization will be managed by the Parker Institute  for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI) , 
using an interactive web response system (I WRS). Patients must  receive the first dose of study 
drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) within 3 days of randomization.  
An unacceptable toxicity is defined as any ≥ Grade 3 toxicity that is treatment -related but not 
related to the natural progression of the tumor and occurs during the Phas e 2 period.  The 
following will be considered unacceptable toxicities :  
1. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count <  25,000 cells/mm 3) if associated with:  
a. A life -threatening bleeding event which results in urgent intervention and 
admission to an Intensive Car e Unit  
2. Any ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic laboratory value if:  
a. Medical intervention is required to treat the patient, and  
b. The abnormality leads to hospitalization, and  
c. The abnormality persists for >  1 week  
3. Grade 3 or 4 AEs that  compromise a major organ (e.g. , congestive heart failure ) 
regardless of duration  
4. Grade 5 toxicity  
 
6.1.1 Duration of Study Participation  
The Phase 1b study will enroll for at least  9 months, assuming all 4 cohorts are tested, and 
have  1 additional month of follow -up before declaring the RP2D of APX005M.  The Phase  2 
portion of the study will enroll for approximately  18 months and have 12 additional months of 
follow -up. All patients will be followed for survival status until death or a maximum of 5 years.  
Considering several months for dat a management and statistical analysis, the total duration of 
the study is likely to be  5 years . In both Phase 1b and 2, enrollment will proceed until met  or 
as determined by the study sponsor ( Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy ). 
Patients  will undergo screening and, if eligible, will undergo treatment  in the assigned  arm of 
the study until unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or withdraw of consent as noted 
above.  Treatment schedules per cohort/ arm and phase of study are detailed  in Section  8. All 
patients  will be followed  for survival status until death or a maximum of 5  years.  Once a patient  
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
41 
 is in follow -up, patients will be followed by a clinic visit or phone call approximately every  
3 month s as specified in Table 11, Table 12 and Table 13. In addition, ad hoc collection of 
survival and new anti -cancer therapy for active patients may be requ ested by the Sponsor.  
6.1.2 Total Number of Patients  
Up to 24 DLT -evaluable patients  will be enrolled in Phase 1b. A total of approximately 
93 patients  will be randomized /enrolled  in Phase 2. Thus , the total sample size is expected to 
be approximately 117  patients . 
6.1.3 Early Termination Rules for Unacceptable Toxicity in Phase 2  
A Bayesian ru le will be employed to monitor toxicity during Phase 2  (as described in 
Section  13) to determine whether a study arm or the study needs to be terminated . A Medical 
and Statistical Supervision (MSS) process involving a Data Review Team (DRT) will be 
responsible for monitoring toxicity , as described in Section 13.8.1 .  
6.1.4 Treatment Beyond Unequivocal Disease Progression  
Treatment decisions, particularly  continuation versus  discontinuation, will be made by the 
investigator on the basis of available clinical and imaging data at the site  
For patien ts with radiological progression according to RECIST  v1.1, in the absence of 
performance status decline and significant symptoms due to disease progression, the 
investigator may elect to keep the patient on treatment, and repeated assessment of disease 
status will be performed . 
Patients  must be informed of tr eatment beyond progression  and this must be documented .

 7 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS  
Patients  will be identified by referrals from physicians  at participating cancer centers within 
the PICI , by outside physicians or health care provider s, or by self -referral . 
To enroll patients  into Phase 1b cohorts, sites will have to contact PICI  to request an 
assignment.  During Phase  1b, dosing of the first 3 patients of each cohort will be staggered by 
at least one week.  If at one week , and for each of the 3 patients,  there are no ongoing symptoms 
of cytokine release syndrome related to the infusion , and if no DLT occurs, subsequent patients 
to the cohort may be dosed without restriction.  A meeting  of the DRT  will be held prior to each 
dose escalation (i.e., between cohorts); ad hoc meetings may be held if a particular DLT 
requires immediate follow -up.

7.1.1 Childbearing Potential and Highly Effective Methods of Contraception  
A WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not 
undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy  and/or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not 
postmenopausal.  Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in women over the age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes.  In addition, females under the 
age of 55 years must have a ser um follicle st imulating hormone level >  40 mIU/mL to confirm 
menopause.  
WOCBP must ha ve a negative pregnancy test before starting study treatment.  Blood or urine 
pregnancy tests must have a minimum test sensitivity of at least 25 IU/L.  Kits measuring eithe r 
total human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or the beta (β) fraction are acceptable.  Monthly 
pregnancy testing, either serum or urine (with a minimum sensitivity 5  IU/L or equivalent units 
of HCG), is required.  
Females of childbearing potential who are sexu ally active with a nonsterilized male partner 
must use a highly effective method of contraception for 28 days prior to the first dose of 
investigational product, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 5 months after 
the final dose of investi gational product; cessation of contraception after this point should be 
discussed with a responsible physician.  Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the 
withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  They must also refrain from 
egg c ell donation for 6 months after the final d ose of investigational product.  
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate 
(i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.  The acceptable methods of 
contraception are described in Table 1. 
Nonsteril e males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing poten tial must 
use a highly effective method of contraception (see Table 1) from Day 1 through 7 months  post 
last dose.  For males adequate birth control met hods is defined as double barrier contraception, 
i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm +  sperm icidal gel or foam.  In addition , they 
must refrain from sperm donation for 7 months  after the final dose of investigational product.

7.3 Discontinuation, Withdrawal, and Replacement of Patients  
7.3.1 Discontinuation of Study Drug  
An individual patient  will not receive any further study drug (discontinue study drug) if any of 
the following occur in the patient  in question:  
• Radiological progression, according to RECIST v1.1 (see Section 10.1), with a decline 
in perfo rmance status and significant symptoms due to PD . For criteria for treatment 
beyond disease progression please s ee Section 6.1.4 . 
• Complete withdrawal of consent from the study  (no further data collection permitted)  
• Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with study drug  (data collection as per 
study schedule permi tted) 
• Lost to follow -up 
• An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, contraindicates further 
dosing  
• DLT  during Phase 1b  
• Unacceptable Toxicity during Phase 2  
• Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant  
• Patient  noncompliance that, in the opinion  of the Investigator or Sponsor, warrants 
withdrawal (e.g., refusal to adhere to the scheduled visits)  
• Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy  (excluding surgery or palliative radiotherapy , 
as permitted per Section 8.9.3 ), including another investigational agent  
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
47 
 • Intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis 
that became apparent during treatment and necessitated the patien t's termination from 
the study  
• General or specific changes in the patient ’s condition that renders him/her ineligible 
for further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
The primary reason for study drug discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate 
Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) page.  
7.3.2 Withdrawal /Discontinuation of  Patients  
When study drug is discontinued, patients  should have an end of treatment  
(EOT) /discontinuation assessment and continue  follow -up assessments as outlined in the 
SOAs. Information on survival follow -up and new anticancer therapy will be collected for all 
patients  via telephone calls, patient  medical records, and/or clinic visits, for a maximum of  5 
years or until any of  the following occurs:  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Study termination by the Sponsor  
• Patient  requests to be withdrawn from follow -up 
• Investigator requests that the patient is withdrawn from follow -up 
If a patient  requests to be withdrawn from the study, the request  must be documented in the 
source documents and signed by the Investigator. The primary reason for withdrawal from 
study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. If the patient withdraws from study, 
the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of 
consent. In addition, the study staff may use a public information source (eg, county records) 
to obtain information about survival status only. However, patients  who withdraw consent will 
not be followed for any re ason after consent has been withdrawn. Patients who withdraw from 
the study will not be replaced.  
7.3.3 Replacement of Patients  
In Phase 1b only, patients  who do not complete the DLT observation period  (as defined in 
Section 6.1) will be replaced , but these patients  will continue on study for safety evaluation 
until PD or administration of differ ent anti -cancer therapy.   
7.4 Follow -Up for Drug Discontinuation/ Patient  Withdrawal from Study  
If a patient  discontinues study treatment or is withdrawn from the study  and/or treatment  for 
any reason, the study site must immediately notify PICI . The date and t he reason for study 
and/or treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate  eCRF . Patients  who 
discontinue  study treatment are to attend the EOT, Day 30 and Day 100  Follow -up Visit s to 
complete all assessments.  
In the event that a patient  discontinues treatment prematurely due to a TEAE or serious TEAE, 
the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline

Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
48 
 values) or stabilizes, is judged by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant  or is 
deemed irreversible.  
Once a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the patient  may not re -enter the study.  
7.5 Lost to Follow -Up 
A patient  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the patient  and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the patient  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.  
• Before a patient  is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact with the patient  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mail ing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should documented in the patient ’s 
medical record or study file.  
Should the patient  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered lost to follow -up and 
will have completed the study .  This should be reflected in the End of Study  eCRF.  
7.6 Study Termination  
This study may be terminated at the discretion of the Sponsor or any regulatory agency.  An 
Investigator may elect to discontinue or stop the study at his or her site for any reason inclu ding 
safety or low enrollment.

 8 TREATMENTS  
In Phase 1b, patients  will be enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts ( Cohort  B1, Cohort  B2, Cohort  C1, 
and Cohort  C2), as outlined in Table 2. A cohort corresponding to Arm A1 of Phase 2 
(nivolumab/ NP/Gem) will not be tested, since an external study is being conducted to confirm 
the safety  of nivolumab in combination with NP/Gem.  
Once the RP2D  of APX005M in combination with nivolumab/ NP/Gem  is determined , patients  
in Phase 2 will be randomized between Arm A1, Arm B2, or Arm C2.  If Arm B2 and/or C2 
are determined to be toxic in the Phase 1b study , patients will be randomized be tween Arm A1, 
Arm B1, and Arm C1.  Arms B1, B2, C1, and C2 will be  the same as  the corresponding cohorts 
in the Phase 1b study  and Table 2. In Arm  A1, patients  will receive infusions of nivolumab 
240 mg, NP 125  mg/m 2, and Gem  1000  mg/m 2. Twelve  DLT -evaluable  patients  from the 
Phase  1b study , enrolled at the RP2D  of APX005M (i.e., 6 patients  on B2 and 6 patients  on 
C2), will be included in the efficacy analysis in Phase 2.  The remaining 93 patients  will be 
randomized as per Section 8.6.

 8.1 Details of Study Treatments  
Details of APX005M, n ivolumab, NP, and Gem are provided below.  Delay of treatment 
schedule, as allowed by the protocol, is permitted at the discretion o f the treating Investigator 
(e.g. toxicity, weather).  
8.1.1 APX005M  
Classification:  Humanized IgG1 CD40 agonistic an tibody  
Mechanism of Action:  APX005M is a humanized IgG1 CD40 agonistic antibody that binds 
to CD40, activating the CD40 pathway, leading to activa tion of APCs, including B cells, 
monocytes, and DCs, and stimulates cytokine release . 
Storage and Stability:  APX005M must  be stored in a secure location  with limited access 
under controlled temperature  conditions  of 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46 °F) and in accordance with 
local regulations . Vials should be stored in their original folding carton to protect from light. 
During preparation and administration of diluted APX005M product, protection from light is 
not required.  
Dose Specifics:  0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg IV on Day 3 of every Cycle  (or Day 10 if delayed) . Patients 
may only receive the delayed dose on Day 10 if they have received NP/Gem on Day 8. 
APX005M doses should not be administered <  2 weeks apart.   
Preparation:  APX005M is prepared  in normal saline per the Pharmacy Manual.  
Administration:  Premedication is given as noted in Table 3. After dilution in normal saline, 
APX005M is administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes.  It is recommended that the 
APX005M infusion does not exceed 120 minutes.  APX005M must be administered  to study 
patients  by qualified personnel.  
Safety Precautions : When handling APX005M, study personnel should wear laboratory coats 
and disposable protective gloves  and avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing.  APX005M 
should be p rotect ed from light and contamination.  
Availability : APX005M will be provided by Apexigen . APX005M must be dispensed only 
from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations.  It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that APX005M  is only dispensed to study patients .  
Packaging and Labeling : APX005M is supplied in 20 mL Type 1 clear glass vials for IV 
injection.  Each depyrogenated  vial contains 10 mg/mL APX005M in a  sterile, clear to slight 
opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow, preservative -free solution (pH 5.5) containing 25  mM 
sodium acetate, 248 mM trehalose, and 0.02% polysorbate 20 in water for injection with a 
target fill volume of 16.9 mL per vial.  Glass vials are plugged with Teflon -coated rubber 
stoppers and sealed with aluminum seals.  The 20 mL vials (16.9 mL/vial) are intended for 
single use.  Additional APX005M details are provide d in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Return and Destruction of APX005M : Upon c ompletion or termination of the study, all 
unused and/or partially used APX005M must be return ed to Apexigen or designee if not 
authorized by Apexigen or designee to be destroyed at the site.  All returned APX005M must 
be accompanied by the appropriate docu mentation and clearly identified by protocol number 
and study site number on the outermost shipping container.  Return supplies should be in the 
original containers (e.g. , kits that have clinical labels attached).  Empty containers should not 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
51 
 be returned.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers, 
provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to the applicable 
federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures and app ropriate records of 
disposal are kept.  The return of unused APX005M should be arranged by the responsible Study 
Monitor.  
Side Effects : Symptoms associated with cytokine release syndrome (including but not limited 
to flushing, itchiness, chills, fever, rash , tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, rigor, and 
myalgia) after administration of APX005M are possible and have been observed in some of 
the patients  receiving APX005M.  Guidance for monitoring and management of cytokine 
release syndrome is included  (in Section 13.6 of this protocol and in the A PX005M IB). 
Transient transaminase elevations (≤ Grade 2) have been observed in several patients  with liver 
metastases, which were not associated with a particula r dose of APX005M.  Six patients  with 
liver metastases enrolled in the study experienced a transient increase in total bilirubin.  Liver 
function test abnormalities tend to resolve to baseline within 7 days from APX005M 
administration.  
Transient decreases in  peripheral blood lymphocyte count in general and B -cell count in 
particular have been observed for APX005M as well as for other CD40 -agonistic mAbs, and 
are believed to be a PD effect.  Transient decreases in platelet counts were observed for some 
of the patients  receiving higher doses of APX005M but were not associated with bleeding or 
other clinical manifestations.  
Other symptoms might also occur, including allergic reactions, which could be severe, 
pulmonary edema, and rarely, thromboembolic events, myoc ardial infarction and/or death.  
In the ongoing Phase 1 study APX005M -001, APX005M demonstrated a dose -dependent 
activation of APCs, T cell activation and increases in circulating levels of cytokines.  
8.1.2 Nivolumab  
Other Names:  Opdivo, BMS -936558, MDX -1106  
Clas sification:  Human PD-1 antibody  
Mechanism of Action:  Binding of the PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, to the PD -1 receptor 
found on T cells, inhibits T -cell proliferation and cytokine production.  Upregulation of PD -1 
ligands occurs in some tumors and signalin g through this pathway can contribute to inhibition 
of active T -cell immune surveillance of tumors.  Nivolumab is a human IgG4 mAb  that binds 
to the PD -1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2, releasing PD -1 
pathway -mediated inhibition of  the immune response, including the anti -tumor immune 
response.  In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD -1 activity resulted in decreased 
tumor growth.  
Storage and Stability:  Vials of n ivolumab injection  must be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 
46°F) and protected from  light and  freezing. The unopened vials can be stored at room 
temperature (up to 25 °C, 77 °F) and room light for up to 48  hours. The a dministration of 
infusion must be completed within 24 hours of preparation. If not used immediately, the  
infusion solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions ( 2°C to 8°C, 36°F to 46 °F) for 
up to 24 hours, and a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperature 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
52 
 (20°C to 25 °C, 68 °F to 77 °F) and room light. The maximum 8-hour period under room 
temperature and room light conditions includes the product administration period.  
Dose Specifics:  240 mg IV Day 1 and 15 of every 28-day cycle . Nivolumab doses should not 
be administered  < 2 weeks apart. N ivolumab should not be administered on Day 15 if NP/Gem 
is held on Day 15.  
Preparation:  Withdraw the required volume of nivolumab and transfer to an IV container.  
Dilute nivolumab with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, United States Pharmacopeia ( USP) or 
5% dextrose injection, USP , to prepare an infusion with a final concentration ranging from 
1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL.  Mixed diluted solution by gentle inversion; do not shake.  Discard 
partially used vials of nivolumab.  
Administration:  Administer the infusion over 30 minutes through an  IV line containing a 
sterile, nonpyrogenic, low protein binding in -line filter (pore size of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm).  Do not 
co-administer other drugs through the same IV line. Flush IV line at the end of the infusion.  
Safety Precautions : When handling nivolumab, wear laboratory coats and disposable 
protective gloves.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing.  Protect from light and 
contamination.  
Availability : Nivolumab will be provided by Bristol -Myers Squibb in 100 mg vial s 
(10 mg/mL) and labeled appropriately  as investiga tional material for this study.  
Side Effects : 
• General disorders: Fatigue, anorexia, pyrexia, headache  
• Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Cough, upper respiratory tract 
infection, pneumonitis  
• Hepatic: Increased AST, ALT, alkaline  phosphatase, hepatitis  
• Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, colitis  
• Skin: Rash, prurit us, vitiligo  
• Endocrine: Hypophysitis, thyroiditis  
• Ophthalmologic: Uveitis  
For manageme nt of toxicities, see Section 8.5. 
8.1.3 Nab-Paclitaxel  
Other Names:  Abraxane  
Classification:  Mitotic inhibitor (cytoskeletal target)  
Mechanism of Action:  NP is a Cremophor EL -free, a lbumin -bound paclitaxel particle with a 
mean size of approximately 130 nm.  NP is a unique protein formulation of a non -crystalline, 
amorphous form of paclitaxel in an insoluble particle state.  
Paclitaxel is a cytoskeletal drug that targets tubulin.  Unlike tubulin -targeting drugs (such as 
colchicine ) that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer 
and protects it from disassembly.  Therefore, chromosomes are unable to form a metaphase 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
53 
 spindle formation.  This blocks progression  of mitosis.  Prolonged activation of the mitotic 
checkpoint will then lead to apoptosis or lead the cell to return to G -phase without cell division.  
Storage and Stability: NP should be stored as vials in original cartons at 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF 
to 77ºF) and protected from bright light.  
Dose Specifics:  In the absence of toxicity, NP will be administered at 125 mg/m 2 IV Day 1, 8 
and 15 of every 28-day cycle  (ie, 3 weeks on, 1 week off cycle) . If toxicity occurs, NP could  
be administered on a 2 weeks on, 1 week off cycle (see Section 8.5 for dose modification 
guidelines) . For example, patients whose Day 8 dose of NP is delayed due to toxicity may 
receive the dose on Day 22 . However , to receive the Day 22 dose, they must have received 
APX005M on Day 3.  
Preparation:  Reconstitute each vial containing 100 mg of NP by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection.  Each mL of the reco nstituted formulation will contain 5  mg/mL 
paclitaxel.  
Administration:  This drug may be administered IV as prepared above over 30  minutes.  Given 
the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible 
infiltration during drug administration.  
Availability:  NP is commercially available as 100 mg of paclitaxel in a single -use vial.  
Side Effects:  
• Hematologic Disorders:  Neutropenia was dose dependent and reversible.  Pancytopenia 
has been observed in clinical  studies . 
• Infections:  Infectious episodes were reported in 24% of the patients  treated with 
paclitaxel.  Oral candidiasis, respiratory tract infections and pneumonia were the most 
frequently reported infectious complications.  
• Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSR s): Grade 1 or 2 HSRs occurred on the day of 
paclitaxel administration and consisted of dyspnea (1%) and flushing, hypotension, 
chest pain, and arrhythmia (all <  1%).  
• Cardiovascular:  Hypotension, during the 30 -minute infusion, occurred in 5% of 
patients . Bradycardia, during the 30 -minute infusion, occurred in <  1% of patients . 
These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither specific 
therapy nor treatment discontinuation.  Severe cardiovascular events possibly related to 
single -agent paclitaxel occurred in approximately 3% of patients . These events 
included cardiac ischemia/infarction, chest pain, cardiac arrest, supraventricular 
tachycardia, edema, thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary emboli, and 
hypertension.  Cases of cerebrovascular attacks (strokes) and transient ischemic attacks 
have been reported.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among 
patients  at baseline.  ECG abnormalities on study did not usually result in symptoms, 
were not dose -limiting, and re quired no intervention.  ECG abnormalities were noted in 
60% of patients . Among patients  with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 35% of all 
patients  developed an abnormal tracing while on study.  The most frequently reported 
ECG modifications were non-specific repolarization abnormalities, sinus brad ycardia, 
and sinus tachycardia.

Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
54 
 • Respiratory:  Dyspnea (12%), cough (7%), and pneumothorax (<  1%) were reported 
after treatment with paclitaxel.  
• Neurologic:  The frequency and severity of sensory neuropathy  increased with 
cumulative dose.  Sensory neuropathy was the cause of paclitaxel discontinuation in 
7/229 (3%) patients . Twenty -four patients  (10%) treated with paclitaxel developed 
Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy; of these patients , 14 had documented improve ment 
after a median of 22 days; 10 patients  resumed treatment at a reduced dose of paclitaxel 
and 2 discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy.  Of the 10 patients  without 
documented improvement, 4 discontinued the study due to peripheral neuropathy. No 
Grad e 4 sensory neuropathies were reported.  Only one incident of motor neuropathy 
(Grade 2) was observed in either arm of the controlled study . 
• Vision Disorders:  Ocular/visual disturbances occurred in 13% of all patients  (n = 366) 
treated with paclitaxel and 1 % were severe.  The severe cases (keratitis and blurred 
vision) were reported in patients  who received higher doses than those recommended 
(300 or 375 mg/m 2). These effects generally have been reversible.  Other possible side 
effects include conjunctivitis a nd increased lacrimation.  
• Arthralgia/Myalgia:  The symptoms were usually transient, occurred two or three days 
after paclitaxel administration, and resolved within a few days.  
• Hepatic:  Grade 3 or 4 elevations in gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase were reported  
for 14% of patients  treated with paclitaxel.  
• Renal:  Overall 11% of patients  experienced creatinine elevation, 1% severe.  No 
discontinuations, dose reductions, or dose delays were caused by renal toxicities.  
Other Clinical Events:  Nail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) 
have been reported.  Edema occurred in 10% of patients ; no patients  had severe edema.  
Dehydration and pyrexia were also reported.  Skin reactions including generalized or 
maculopapular rash, erythema, an d pruritus have been observed with paclitaxel.  There have 
been case reports of photosensitivity reactions, radiation recall phenomenon, and in some 
patients  previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia . 
Stevens -Johnson s yndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.  There have 
been reports of conjunctivitis, cellulitis, and increased lacrimation with paclitaxel injection.  
8.1.4 Gemcitabine  
Other Names:  2'-Deoxy -2', 2’ -difluorocytidine  monohydrochloride, Gemzar  
Classification:  Antimetabolite (nucleoside analog)  
Mechanism of Action:  Gem  exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing 
DNA synthesis (S phase) and also blocking the progression of cells through the G1/S p hase 
boundary.  Gem  is metabolized intracellularly by nucleoside kinases to the active diphosphate 
and triphosphate nucleosides.  The cytotoxic effect of Gem  is attributed to a combination of 
two actions of the diphosphate and the triphosphate nucleosides, w hich leads to inhibition of 
DNA synthesis.  First, Gem  diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible 
for catalyzing the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis.  
Inhibition of this enzyme by the dipho sphate nucleoside causes a reduction in the 
concentrations of deoxynucleotides, including deoxycytidine triphosphate ( dCTP ). Second, 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
55 
 Gem  triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA.  The reduction in the 
intracellular concentration of dCTP (b y the action of the diphosphate) enhances the 
incorporation of Gem  triphosphate into DNA (self -potentiation).  After the Gem  nucleotide is 
incorporated into  DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands.  
After this addition, there is inhibition of further DNA synthesis.  DNA polymerase epsilon is 
unable to remove the Gem  nucleotide and repair the growing DNA strands (masked chain 
termination). In T lymphoblastoid cells  of the CEM  cell line , Gem  induces internucleosoma l 
DNA fragmentation, one of the characteri stics of programmed cell death.  
Storage and Stability:  Un-reconstituted drug vials are stored at controlled room temperature.  
Reconstituted solution should be stored at controlled room temperature and used within 
24 hours.  Solutions of Gem  should not be refrigerated; crystallization may occur.  The unus ed 
portion should be discarded.  
Dose Specifics:  Gem  is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of PC. In this indication, 
a dose of 1000  mg/m 2 over 30 minutes on ce weekly for up to 7  weeks followed by a week of 
rest, then once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks is used.  In this protocol, in the absence of 
toxicity, we use a common modification of Gem dosing of 3 weeks on, 1 week off.  Therefore, 
1000 mg/m 2 IV is used on Days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 -day cycle.  If toxicity occurs, Gem 
could  be administered on a 2 weeks on, 1 week off cycle (see Section 8.5 for dose modifi cation 
guidelines) . For example, patients whose Day 8 dose of Gem is delayed due to toxicity may 
receive the dose on Day 22. However, to receive the Day 22 dose, they must have received 
APX005M on Day 3.  
Preparation:  Reconstitute the 200 -mg vial with 5  mL and the 1 -g vial with 25  mL 
preservative -free normal saline to make a solution containi ng 38 mg/m L. Shake to dissolve.  
Administration:  The drug may be administered IV as prepared above or further diluted with 
normal saline to a minimum concentration of 0. 1 mg/m L. Gem  is commonly diluted in 100  or 
250 mL of saline.  Gem  administration will be over 30  minutes.  
Availability:  Gemcitabine is commercially available in 200 -mg and 1 -g vials.  
Side Effects:  
• Hematologic:  Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
anemia occurs with Gem  as a single agent and the risks are increased when 
Gem citabine  is combined with other cytotoxic drugs.  In clinical studie s, Grade 3 -4 
neutropenia, anemia, and thromboc ytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, 
respectively of patients  receiving single -agent.  The frequencies of Grade 3 -4 
neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 % to 28%, and 
5% to 55%, respectively, in patients  receiving Gem  in combi nation with another drug.  
• Dermatologic:  A rash is seen in about 25% of patients  and is associated with pru ritus 
in about 10% of patients . The rash is usually mild, not dose -limiting, and responds to 
local therapy.  Desquamation, vesiculation, and ulceration  have been reported rarely. 
Alopecia is reported in <  1% of patients . 
• Gastrointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting are reported in about two -thirds of patients  and 
requires therapy in about 20% of patients . It is rarely (<  1%) dose -limiting, and is easily

 managea ble with standard antiemetics.  Diarrhea is reported in 8% of patients , 
constipation in 6%, and oral toxicity in 7%.  
• Hepatic:  Abnormalities of hepatic transaminase enzymes occur in two -thirds of patients , 
but they are usually mild, nonprogressive, and rarely necessitate stopping treatment.  
Drug -induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in 
patients  receiving Gem  alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic 
drugs.  Administration of Gem  in patients  with concurrent liver metastases or a pre -
existing medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to 
exacerbation of t he un derlying hepatic insufficiency.  
• Pulmonary:  Bronchospasm after injection has been reported in less than 1% of patients  
and is usually mild and transient, but parenteral therapy may be required.  Dyspnea 
within a few hours of injection is reported in 10%  of patients . It is usually mild, short -
lived, rarely dose -limiting, and usually abates without any specific therapy.  Cough and 
rhinitis are also commonly reported.  Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial 
pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema , and adult respiratory distress 
syndrome, has been reported.  In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal 
respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy.  The onset of pulmonary 
symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gem . 
• Neurologic:  Somnolence has been reported in 10% of patients , and insomnia is 
common.  
• Cardiovascular:  A few cases of hypotension were reported . Some cases of myocardial 
infarction, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia have been reported, but there is no 
clear evidence that Gem  causes cardiac toxicity.  Peripheral edema is reported in about 
30% of patients . Some cases of facial edema have also been reported.  Edema  is usually 
mild to moderate, rarely dose -limiting, sometimes painful, and reversible after stopping 
Gem  treatment.  
• Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS):  HUS to include fatalities from renal failure or 
the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients  treated with Gem . In clinical studies , 
HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients  (0.25%).  Most fatal cases of renal failure were 
due to HUS.  Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy.  
• Embryofetal Toxicity:  Gem  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman, based on its mechanism of action.  Gem  was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and 
fetotoxic in mice and rabbits.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman 
becomes pregnant while taking Gem , the patient  should be apprised of t he potential 
hazard to a fetus.  
• Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity:  Gem  is not indicated for use in 
combination with radiation therapy.  Concurrent (given together or ≤  7 days apart) — 
Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a study  
in which Gem  was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m 2 to patients  with non -small 
cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concur rently with thoracic radiation.

Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
57 
 • Capillary Leak Syndrome:  Capillary leak syndrome with severe consequences has been 
reported in patients  receiving Gem  as a single agent or in combination with  other 
chemotherapeutic agents.  
• Other:  Flu-like symptoms are reported for about 20% of patients . This includes fever, 
headache, back pain, chills, myalgia, asthenia, and anorexia.  Malaise an d sweating are 
also commonly reported.  
8.2 Preparation and Administration of Study Treatment  
For all study drugs, either a peripheral IV or a central port or line is acceptable for infusion.  
Patient weight will be assessed at Screening and Day 1 of each cycle.  Dose adjustments are 
not required unless the subject has a ≥ 5% change in comparison to their in itial weight on 
Cycle  1, Day 1 . 
8.2.1 APX005 M 
APX005M will be prepared as per the Pharmacy Manual. Briefly, APX005M will be diluted 
in normal saline.  After dilution in normal saline, APX005M will be administered by IV 
infusion over 60 minutes on Day 3 of each 28-day cycle.  The APX005M infusion can be 
interrupted in the case of infusion reaction.  Once  symptoms resolve, infusion should be 
restarted at 50% of the initial infusion rate (e.g., from 50 mL/h to 25 mL/h ). 
For each treatment cycle, APX005M should only be administered  if patients receive d 
NP/Gem  on Day 1.  For APX005M dose delays (from Day 3 to Day 10), patient s may only 
receive the Day 10 dose if they have received NP/Gem on Day 8.  
8.2.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab will be prepared according to the package insert.  Briefly, the required volume of 
nivolumab will be withd rawn and transferred to an IV container.  Nivolumab will be diluted 
with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP or 5% dextrose injection, USP, to prepare an 
infusion with a final concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL.  This diluted solution 
will be mix ed by gentle inversion.  
The dose will be administered over 30 minutes through an IV line containing a sterile, 
nonpyrogenic, low protein binding in -line filter ( pore size of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm) on Days 1 and 
15 of each 28 -day cycle.  Nivolumab doses should no t be administered <  2 weeks apart.  
Nivolumab should not be administered on Day 15 if NP/Gem is held on Day 15.  On each day 
nivolumab is given, it should be administered before Gem  and NP. Do not co -administer 
other drugs through the same IV line. The IV line should be flushed at the end of the infusion.  
8.2.3 Nab-paclitaxel  
NP will be prepared according to the package insert.  Briefly, each vial of NP containing 
100 mg of drug will be reconstitute d by injecting 20  mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection.  
Each milliliter of the reconstituted formulation will contain 5  mg/mL paclitaxel.  This dose will 
be administered IV as prepared above and over 30  minutes . In the absence of toxicity, NP 
could be admin istered  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle  (ie, 3 weeks on, 1 week off 
cycle) . If toxicity occurs, NP may be administered on a 2 weeks on, 1 week off cycle.  NP 
should be given after nivolumab and before Gem  when given on the same day s as either 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
58 
 of these drugs . Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the 
infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.   
For NP dose delays (from Day 8 to Day 22), patients m ay only receive the Day 22 dose if 
they have received APX005M on Day 3.  
8.2.4 Gemcitabine  
Gem  will be prepared according to the package insert.  Briefly, the 200 -mg vial of Gem  will be 
reconstituted with 5  mL and the 1 -g vial with 25  mL preservative -free- normal saline to make 
a solution containing 38  mg/ml.  This will be shaken and dissolved.  The dose will be 
administered IV as prepared above or further diluted with normal saline to a minimum 
concentration of 0.1  mg/mL.  Gem  is commonly diluted in 100  mL or  250 mL of saline, and 
administered IV over 30  minutes . In the absence of toxicity, Gem could  be administered  on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle  (ie, every 3 weeks on, 1 week off cycle) . If toxicity 
occurs, Gem  may be administered on a 2 weeks on, 1  week off cycle.  Gem  should be 
administered after nivolumab and NP when given on the same days . 
For Gem dose delays (from Day 8 to Day 22), patients may only receive the Day 22 dose 
if they have received APX005M on Day 3.  
8.3 Monitoring Following APX005M  Administration  
Patients  will be monitored during and after the infusion of APX005 for at least 5  hours after 
the first 2 infusions of APX005M and as clinically indicated thereafter.  All patients  will be 
discharged from the clinic after clinical eva luation.  Patients  should have stable vital signs, 
including lack of orthostatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure >  100 mmHg, or a reduction 
to no lower than 10 mmHg from baseline) without IV hydration (no hydration for at least 2 
hours before discharge ), lack of hypoxia (oxygen saturation >  90% without oxygen), 
temperature <  38ºC, and heart rate <  110 beats/min.  After discharge, all patients  should be 
monitored by a caregiver or by a healthcare professional for 24 hours after the first 2  infusions 
of AP X005M and as clinically indicated thereafter .

a Each cycle is 28 days. However, depending on whether or not the patient experiences toxicity, NP/Gem could be 
administered according to one of the following dosing schedules: (1) 3 weeks on, 1 week off; and (2) 2 weeks on, 1  week 
off. Nivolumab should not be administered on Day 15 if NP/Gem is held on Day 15. Nivolumab and APX005M doses 
should not be administered <2 weeks apart. Delay of treatment schedule, as allowed by the protocol, is permitted at the 
discretion of the treating Investigator (e.g. toxicity, weather).  
b Institutional standards may include a 5 -HT3 antagonist (ondansetron, granisetron), but steroids  such as dexamethasone 
should not be given as an anti -emetic unless treatment with a 5 -HT3 antagonist or other nausea medications is ineffective 
in treating nausea and the overall PI has been notified.  
c Per commercial package insert.  
d Premedication is gi ven 30 minutes before each administration of APX005M and includes a regimen containing an oral 
H1 antagonist (e.g., loratadine 10 mg), oral non -steroidal antiinflammatory - (e.g., ibuprofen 400  mg), acetaminophen 
650 mg, and optionally an oral H 2 antagonist  (e.g., ranitidine 150 -300 mg, famotidine 10 -40 mg), or also optionally, 
ondansetron doses (route of administration, and frequency per institutional standards). A window of -10 minutes is permitted 
(e.g. premedications may be administered up to 40 minutes,  but no later than 30 minutes, prior to APX005M).  
 
8.5 Management of Study Drug-Related Toxicities  
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary treatment hold, 
reducing the dose of APX005M, NP or Gem , or discontinuation of some or all investigational 
products as presented in the following sections . If a patient  experiences severa l toxicities, the 
recommended dose modification should be based on the highest grade toxicity.  
Up to 2 dose reductions are permitted for APX005M and Gem , and up to 3 dose reductions are 
permitted for NP.  No dose reductions will be permitted for nivolumab  per Table  4 and Table  
7. 
These dose adjustments are for AEs deemed related to the study medications.  If, in the opinion 
of the treating Investigator, a toxicity is thought to be unrelated to study medications and 
resolves to a “Continue” or below lowest grade in Table  4, no dose adjustments  for the study 
medications are necessary.  
For NP and/or Gem -related toxicity leading to discontinuation of the chemotherapy, treatment 
with APX 005M  and nivo lumab , or either agent alone , may be continued with approval  of the 
Medical Monitor.   
For any  toxicity (regardless of grade)  that, despite optimal supportive care, is felt by the 
treating Investigator to present a risk to the patient  safety, additional dose reduction, treatment 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
60 
 delay, or treatment discontinuation is permitted at the discretion of the treating Investigator.  
Dose re -escalation will be permitted with approval of the Medical M onitor .  
In the event APX005M is discontinued, due to drug -related toxicities, the participant may 
continue other study treatments with the approval of the Medical Monitor.  In this case, Day 3 
assessm ents listed in Section 9 will no longer be required.

8.6 Study Treatment Assignment  
Treatment assignments and randomization will be managed by PICI . 
8.6.1 Phase 1b  
In Phase 1b, patients  will be enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts (B1, B2, C1, and C2) as summarized 
in Table 9. 
Table 9 Phase 1b Treatment Assignment  
Arm  Regimen  Number of DLT -Evaluable Patients  
B1 NP/Gem/APX005M 0.1 mg/kg  6 
B2 NP/Gem/APX005M 0.3 mg/kg  6 
C1 Nivolumab/NP/ Gem/APX005M 0.1 mg/kg  6 
C2 Nivolumab/NP/ Gem/APX005M 0.3 mg/kg  6 
DLT = dose -limiting toxicity ; Gem = gemcitabine; NP = nab-paclitaxel  
 
8.6.2 Phase 2  
A total of approximately 105 patients  will be randomized/ enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of 
the study, including 12  patients  from Phase 1b  (i.e., 6 patients  on B2 and 6 patients  on C2) .  
Approximately 93 patients  will be randomized /enrolled  and treated only in Phase 2.   
Recruitment is competitive and regulated in the current version of the Cohort Management 
Plan (a separate document) . In step 1 of randomization, 12 of the 93 new patients  will be 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
71 
 randomized to the 3 arms in a 4:1:1 ratio in Arms A1 , B2, and C2 , to achieve balance in the 
total number of patients  enrolled on the arms (since Arm A1 does not accrue in Phase 1b, more 
patients  need to be enrolled in Arm A1).  In step 2 of randomi zation, 81 patients  will be 
randomized to Arms A1 , B2, and C2  in a 1:1:1 allocation.  The randomization cohorts are 
outlined in Table 10.

Gem = gemcitabine; NP = nab -paclitaxel  
a If Arm B2 and/or C2 is too toxic in Phase 1b, Arms B1 and C1 (APX005M 0.1 mg/kg) will be used in the Phase 2 portion. 
The dose of APX005M will remain the same in each arm in Phase 2, so even if B2 is safe and C2 is toxic, B1 and C1 will 
still be used in the randomization  
8.7 Blindin g 
This is an open -label study with no blinding.  
8.8 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
Administration of study drug s will be supervised by  study personnel  or assigned infusion ro om 
nursing staff, who will monitor  compliance.  
8.9 Prior and Concomitant Illnesses and Medications  
8.9.1 Prior and Concomitant Illnesses  
Investigators should document all prior significant illnesses.  Additional illnesses present at the 
time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing ( Cycle  1 Day 1) are to 
be regarded as concomitant illnesses.  Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study 
and/or worsening of a concomitant illness du ring the study are to be documented as AEs on 
the appropriate eCRF.  
8.9.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications and other treatments taken by the patient  during the study, including those 
treatments initiated prior to the start of the study, must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
The entry must include the dose, regimen, route, indication, and dates of use.  
Medications taken by or administered to the patient  for the time period before screening will 
be recorded on the eCRF.  
Patients  who are taking the following medications prior to screening must have the minimum 
washout periods specified below and must not take the medications for the duration of the 
study.

 a Screening evaluations are to be conduct ed within 28 days before the start of protocol therapy. Some screening procedures may occur on Cycle 1 Day 1 as appropriate.  
b Patients receiving APX005M on Day 3 must return to the study site within 24 hours after dose administration (ie, on Day 4) fo r assessment of AEs, vital signs, and collection of 
samples for clinical laboratory tests, PK/ADA and translational assessments. If APX005M dosing is delayed from Day 3 to Day 1 0 due to toxicity, as noted in Section 8.5.5 , then 
the Day 4 assessments must be performed on Day 11.  
c Pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential), at Screening and within 24 h before first dose protocol therapy unless scre ening happens with 24 h of first dose, in which cases 
testing is not to be done twice. Either serum or urine testing may be used. During the study, monthly pregnancy testing (on D ay 1 of each cycle) is required.  
d Performed in triplicate. May be repeated if nece ssary.  
e See Table 14 for specific chemistry and hematology laboratory assessments. All laboratory assessments should be reviewed prior to Day 8 of  each cycle.  
f For Cycles 1 -2, on days when APX005M is given, vital signs should be measured pre -infusion, at the end of infusion (EOI), as well as 2 and 5 hours post -EOI. During all other 
visits, vital signs should be measured pre -infusion. A window of ±10 mi nutes is permitted.  
g Premedication is given 30 minutes before each administration of APX005M and includes a regimen containing an oral H 1 antagonist (e.g., loratadine  10 mg), oral non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory - (e.g., ibuprofen 400  mg), acetaminophen 650 mg, and optionally an oral H 2 antagonist (e.g., ranitidine 150 -300 mg, famotidine 10 -40 mg), or also optionally, 
ondansetron doses (route of administration, and frequency per institutional standards). A window of -10 minutes is permitted (e.g. premedications may be administered up to 
40 minutes, but no later than 30 minutes, prior to APX005M).  
h See Section  12 for detailed SAE and AE reporting requir ements. The observation period for collection of AEs  and AESIs  extends from the start of  study drug through 100 days 
after the last dose of study drug or  the initiation of new  anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurs first) . The observation period for collection of SAEs extends from the time the 
patient signs consent  through 100 days after the last dose of study drug or  initiated of new  anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurs first) .  After treatment discontinuation , AEs 
related  to study drug are to be followed until resolution or deemed irreversible by Investigator.  SAEs related to study drug must be reported  at all times , regardless of whether  
new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated, and followed until resolution or deemed irreversible by the Investigator.   
i Blood samples for PK analysis are to be collected in Cycle 1 at pre -dose, EOI, 4 h (after starting infusion), Day 4 (24 h), Day 8, and Day 15. In Cycles 2 -4, samples are to be 
collected at pre -dose and EOI, as described in the Laboratory Manual.  
j Blood samples for detection of ADA are to be collected, before APX005M administration, at Day 3 of Cycles 1 -4 and at EOT. PK and ADA sampling will occur as a single blood 
draw, as described in the Laboratory Manual.   
k Only to be collected if the patient has given consent to keep tissue and blood biomarker samples for research at the time of screening assessment.  If a patient discontinues treatment 
and begins any new anti -cancer therapy  prior to the EOT visit , then EOT  blood samples for immune biomarkers will not be collected.   For patients that remain on study for 1 year 
or more, immune biomarkers should be collected at 1 year and then Q6M  thereafter, as specified in Section 11.   
l Circulating soluble analytes only.  
m CA19 -9 and CEA will be collected if performed as part of standard of care.  
n Per standard of care to provide data for RECIST measurements as appropriate for each pa tient per the investigator physician. At a minimum at baseline this includes imaging of 
the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  
o Restaging radiographic studies will be obtained at 8 -week  intervals after initiating study treatment for the first year, and at 3 -mont h intervals thereafter. A window of -7 days is 
permitted  (see Section 10). 
p See Section 10 for description of disease  assessment  collection after EOT . 
q A baseline tumor tissue sample is mandatory for enrollment. Archival tissue must be identified or a fresh tumor biopsy (3 to 4 core needle or excisional biopsies) obtained. Fine 
needle action is not acceptable. If medically feasibl e, a mandatory biopsy will also be obtained during Cycle 2 (after second dose APX005M). Otherwise, any on -treatment biopsy 
will be accepted unless there is no lesion that can be safely biopsied.  Additional biopsies may be performed for patients who have pr olonged stable disease, defined as more than

 two, consecutive disease assessments by RECIST v1.1 and/or if tumor shrinkage is initially demonstrated, followed by a new le sion and/or radiological disease progression.   Ad 
hoc biopsy collection is also permi tted with the approval of the medical monitor.  
r Thyroid function testing is performed at Screening and on Day 1 of every other cycle starting from Cycle 3.

 a Screening evaluations are to be conducted within 28 days before the start of protocol therapy. Some screening procedures may occur on Cycle 1 Day 1 as approp riate.  
b For patients receiving APX005M, the Day 4 visit (or Day 11 visit if dosing is delayed) is optional  after Cycle 2 . 
c Pregna ncy test (women of childbearing potential), at Screening and within 24 h before first dose protocol therapy unless screening happens with 24 h of first dose, in which cases 
testing is not to be done twice. Either serum or urine testing may be used. During the study, monthly pregnancy testing (on Day 1 of each cycle) is required.  
d Performed in triplicate. May be repeated if necessary.  
e See Table 14 for specific chemistry and hematology laboratory assessments. All laboratory assessments should be reviewed prior to Day 8 of eac h cycle.  
f For Cycles 1 -2, on days when APX005M is given, vital signs should be measured pre -infusion, at the end of infusion (EOI ), as well as 2 and 5 hours post -EOI. During all other 
visits, vital signs should be measured pre -infusion. A window of ±10 minutes is permitted.  
g Patients must  receive the first dose of study drug within 3 days of randomization . 
h Premedication is given 30 minutes before each administration of APX005M and includes a regimen containing an oral H 1 antagonist (e.g., loratadine  10 mg), oral non -steroidal  
anti-inflammatory - (e.g., ibuprofen 400  mg), acetaminophen 650 mg, and optionally a n oral H 2 antagonist (e.g., ranitidine 150 -300 mg, famotidine 10 -40 mg), or also optionally, 
ondansetron doses (route of administration, and frequency per institutional standards). A window of -10 minutes is permitted (e.g. premedications may be administer ed up to 40 
minutes, but no later than 30 minutes, prior to APX005M).

 Timing of Study Assessments for Treatment Delays  
Study assessments must be completed on the day the patient receives treatment. If treatment is 
delayed, the study assessments will be postponed. Only clinical laboratory assessments that 
were not completed, or were clinically relevant on the missed treatment day, are required be 
performed/repeated on the day treat ment resumes.  
APX005M Dose D elays:  Patients in Phase 1b  receiving APX005M on Day 3  must return to 
the study site within 24 hours after dose administration (ie, on Day 4 ) for assessment of AEs, 
vital signs, and collection of samples for clinical laboratory tests, PK/ADA and translational 
assessments . If APX005M dosing is delayed from Day 3 to  Day 10  due to toxicity , as noted in 
Section 8.5.5 , then the Day 4 assessmen ts must  be performed on Day 11.  For patients receiving 
APX005M in Phase 2, the Day 4 visit (or Day 11 visit if dosing is delayed) is optional  after 
Cycle 2 .

 10 EFFICACY A SSESSMENT S 
Participants will undergo tumor assessments as described in the Schedule of Assessments (see 
Section  9): 
• Disease assessments are performed to provide data for RECIST. At a minimum , at 
baseline, this should include imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  
• Throughout the study, restaging radiographic studies will be obtained at 8-week  
intervals after initiating study treatment for the first year, and at 3 -month interval s 
thereafter. A window of ±7 days is permitted.  
Disease assessments performed as part of standard of care will continue to be collected after 
treatment discontinuation.  The following criteria  serve to provide additional guidelines  around 
when disease asse ssments (i .e., RECIST measurements) should be collected  after a patient has 
discontinued study treatment , and if treatment is continued beyond radiological progression : 
• If a patient discontinues treatment due to radiographic disease progression (PD), as 
defined by RECIST v1.1, then no additional disease  assessments are collected . These 
patients should be followed for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or 
study termination. Safety follow -up should continue as described in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Section 9). 
• If a patient has elected to continue tre atment after having demonstrated PD per 
RECIST  v1.1 criteria, disease assessments should continue  to be collected  as described 
in the Schedule of Assessments (Q8W; Section 9). 
• If a patient discontinues treatment due to symptomatic deterioration, every attempt 
should be made to continue  collecting standard of care  disease assessments : 
o If not medically feasible, clinical progression needs to be documented  as the 
reason for treatment discontinuation.  
o If medically feasible, standard of care disease  assessments  should continue to 
be collected until the patient has demonstrated PD per RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
o In either scenario, these patients should be followed for survival status until 
death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Safety follow up should 
continue as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 9). 
• If a patient discontinues treatment for any other reason (e.g. toxicity, protocol 
deviation), standard of care disease assessments should continue  to be collected until 
the patient has demonstrated PD per RECIST  v1.1 criteria. T hese patients should be 
followed for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. 
Safety follow up should continue as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 
9). 
• If a patient initiates new anti-cancer therapy, collection of disease assessments is no 
longer required. These patients should be followed for survival status until death, 
withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Safety follow up should continue as 
described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 9). 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
84 
 • If a patient discontinues treatment and withdraws consent, no additional assessments 
or follow -up should be performed.  
10.1 Response Criteria  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed by the RECIST  Version 1.1  Committee.  Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
Note: Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below.  The 
term “ evaluable ” in reference to measurability will not be used  because it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  The irradiated index lesion is not included in the RECIST 
determination; however, tumor response of this lesion will be assessed and tabulated separately 
using criteria from RECIST.  
10.1.1  Definitions o f Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease   
Measurable disease is defined as at least 1 lesion whose longest diameter can be accurately 
measured as ≥  2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as ≥  1.0 cm with spiral computed 
tomography ( CT) scan . Clinical lesion s will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable 
as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, 
CT is preferable.  
Lymph n odes with a short axis of >  15 mm by CT are considered measurable and assessable 
as target lesions.  Only the short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in 
calculation of tumor response.  Nodes that shrink to <  10 mm short axis ar e considered normal.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <  2.0 cm with 
conventional techniques or as <  1.0 cm with spiral CT) are considered non -measurable disease.  
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascite s, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/ pulmonis , abdominal masses (not followed by CT or magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ]), 
and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
10.1.2  Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
Assessment of measurable di sease will be performed locally at each study site.  
Measurement Methods:  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be 
used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. For 
patients  having only lesi ons measuring at least 1 cm to < 2 cm , spiral CT imaging must be used 
for both pre - and post -treatment tumor assessments.  Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used at the same evaluation 
to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
New lesions on the basis of positron emission tomography ( PET)/CT using 
fluorodeoxygluc ose (FDG )-PET/CT imaging can be identified according to the following:  
• Negative FDG -PET/CT at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET/CT at follow -up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG -PET/CT at baseline and a positive FDG -PET/CT at follow up:  
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
85 
 o If the positive FDG -PET/CT at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD.  
If the posi tive FDG -PET/CT at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring 
at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET/CT scan).  
If the positive FDG -PET/CT at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  A “positive”  FDG -
PET/CT scan lesion means one that is visually FDG avid rela tive to the background tissue on 
the attenuation corrected image.  
10.1.3  Mea surement of Effect  
10.1.3.1  Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measure d at baseline.  If the protocol 
specified studies are performed, and there are fewer than 5 lesions identified (as there often 
will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol 
to discover new lesions.  For any  1 organ, no more than 2 lesions need to be measured.  Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  
A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the 
objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
10.1.3.2  Non-Target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and these lesions should be followed 
in accord with the following section.  
10.1.3.3  Respon se Criteria  
All identified sites of disease must be followed on re -evaluation.  Specifically, a change in 
objective status to either a PR or CR  cannot be done without rechecking all identified sites (i.e., 
target and non -target lesions) of pre -existing dise ase. 
10.1.3.4  Evaluation of target lesions  
• CR: Disappearance of all target lesions  
• PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD  of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum LD  
• PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note: the appearanc e of one or more new lesions at the end of cycle scan is also 
considered progression).  
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
86 
 • SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
10.1.3.5  Evaluat ion of non -target lesions  
• CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions  
• Non-CR/Non -PR: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion without evidence of 
unequivocal progression of the non -target lesions or appearance of new lesions  
• PD: Appearance of one or m ore new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances 
the opinion of the treating physician should prevail, and the progression status s hould be 
confirmed at a later time by the PI.  
10.1.3.6  Overall Objective Status  
The overall OR status for an evaluation is determined by combining the patient ’s status on 
target lesions, non -target lesions, and new disease.  
Symptomatic deterioration: Patients  with global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, 
and not either related to study treatment or other medical conditions, should be reported as PD 
due to “symptomatic  deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic deterioration that may 
include weight loss >  10% of body weight, worsening of tumor -related symptoms, and/or 
decli ne in performance status of >  1 level on ECOG scale.

Phase 1b:  PK in Cycle 1 at pre -dose, end of infusion (EOI), 4 h  (after starting infusion) , 24 h, 
Day 8, and Day 15. Cycles 2 -4: pre-dose, EOI and EOT . 
Phase 2: Pre-dose and EOI samples in Cycle s 1-4 and EOT . 
For patients who begin a new anti -cancer therapy prior to their EOT visit, an EOT PK blood 
draw is not required.   
Samples will be collected at the time points indicated  in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 
11 and Table 12). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded.  
The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional 
time points to ensure thor ough PK monitoring.  
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping procedures are 
provided in a separate Laboratory Manual .  
11.1.2  Analytical Methodology  
The concentration of APX005M  will be determined from the samples using a validated  
analytical method.  See Section 13.5 for a list of PK parameters that will be calculated.  
11.2 Immune Endpoints  
Specimen Collection : Tumor tissue ( archival , fresh core or excisional tumor biopsies ) must 
be available or collected prior to the start of treatment.  If medically feasible, a  mandatory  
biopsy  will also be obtained during Cycle 2 . For arms including APX005M , the biopsy will 
take place after the second dose of APX005M  and, for arms not including APX005M , after the 
third dose of n ivolumab . Otherwise,  any on -treatment biopsy will be accept ed unless there is 
no lesion that can be safely biopsied . Additional biopsies may be performed for patients who 
have prolonged  stable diseas e, defined as stable for more than two, consecutive disease 
assessments by  RECIST  v1.1, and/or if  tumor shrinkage  is demonstrated,  followed by  a new 
lesion and/or  radiologica l disease progression  Ad hoc collections may also be performed with 
Medical Monitor approval.   
Blood for plasma , serum, circulating tumor DNA  and PBMC will be collectedly at baseline 
and serially during therapy as noted above.  Tumor samples and blood sampl es will be 
processed according  to the study Laboratory Manual.  
Blood samples will be collected for immune biomarkers  at Cycle  1 pre -dose on Day 3, Day 4 
(24 hours after start of APX005M infusion ), and Day 8 during Phase  1b. For Phase 2, blood 
samples will be collected as outlined in the schedule of assessments at screening, through 
Cycle  4 and EOT . Ad hoc collections may also be performed with Medical Monitor approval.

 For any patient who remains on study for 1 year, immune biomarkers may  also be collected at 
1 year and then every 6 months (12, 18, 24, 30, etc. months).  
Blood samples for detection of ADA  are to be collected before APX005M administration in 
Cycles 1 -4, and at the EOT . 
Stool samples will be collected at screening (prior to C ycle 1 , Day 1 ) and during Cycle 2 , if 
possible . Otherwise,  any on -treatment stool sample will be accepted.  
11.2.1  Immune Biomarkers  
Detailed sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping procedures are provided in a 
separate Laboratory Manual . Depending on sample availability, a battery of immune assays is 
planned, that may includ e but will not necessarily limited to the following : 
Analy sis of Myeloid and B Cell Activation : Using un -manipulated peripheral blood, monocytes, 
B cells, dendritic cells before and after treatment can be analyzed using flow cytometry to 
measure cell surface immune markers using a panel of immune parameters such as CD11b, 
CD19, CD123, CD11c (to define the subsets) and CD86, MHC class I and II, CD70, and CD54 
(to measure activation).  For each parameter and each cell type, the percentage of cells positive 
for the marker and/or mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI) at time points after treated can be 
compared to baseline and the change are calculated as % after/%baseline  or MFI after/MFI baseline . 
Tissue Assessment : Tissue can be analyzed by hematox ylin and eosin staining  and by 
immunohistochemistry  for PD -L1 and for immune markers (such as CD45, CD68, CD3, CD8, 
CD4, Foxp3, CD20, myeloperoxidase), tumor markers (AFP, Ki -67, cleaved caspase 3), 
vascular (CD31) and stromal markers (collagen type I); and by Masson’s trichrome.  The tumor 
may also be assessed by a mutationa l panel and if sufficient material is available, tumor whole 
exome sequencing (WES)  and RNA sequencing may be performed.  If RNA quality is 
insufficient, Nanostring technology or equivalent for immune activation gene expression may 
be performed instead of R NA-Seq or in addition.  From germline WES from PBMC, HLA type 
can be determined.  From tumor WES, tumor RNA -Seq, and germline WES, patient -specific 
neo epitopes arising from tumor somatic missense mutations can be predicted 
bioinformatically.  
Analysis of T -cell Activation : Together with complete blood count differentials, multiplex flow 
cytometry analysis of PBMC can be used to measure both the percentages and absolute count 
(cells/mm 3) of important T -cell subsets defined by immunophenotyping, such as total C D3+ 
cells, CD3+ CD8+ T cells, CD3+ CD4+ T cells, and CD3+ CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.  
For each subset, differentiation status (e.g. , naïve, central memory, effector memory) or 
activation vs. exhaustion status can be assessed using additional markers su ch as Eomes, Tbet, 
Granzyme B, Ki -67, CD45RA, ICOS, CD45RO, CCR7, CD28, CD27, CD57, CD25, CD69, 
HLA -DR, CTLA4, and PD -1. When possible, trends may be tracked in T -cell subsets based 
on analysis of multiple post -treatment samples.  NK cells subsets may also be assessed using 
CD16 and CD56, with CD69 as an activation marker.  
An analysis of PBMC may be additionally performed using CyTOF technology for deeper 
analysis of immune subsets and activation status in peripheral blood.  
Immune activation may be addi tionally assessed using RNA -Seq of PBMC.

Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
89 
 Inflammatory Cytokines/Chemokines : Blood may be used to determine concentrations of 
cytokines and other circulating factors that may includ e but not limited to  transforming growth 
factor ( TGF )-β, IL -1, TNF -α, IL -6 and others using a multiplex platform  or other standard 
analytical methods . 
T-cell Receptor ( TCR) Deep Sequencing : DNA isolated from PBMC (as well as from paraffin -
embedded  tissue ) can be analyzed by deep sequencing to detect and track specific TCR clones.  
This technique permits assessment of specific adaptive immune response independent of 
having to know the particular relevant tumor antigen, which of course may vary patient  to 
patient . Comparison of TCR beta sequence data in serial samples from blood and t umor can 
demonstrate de novo evolution of an anti -tumor T cell repertoire.  
Circulating tumor material : Blood  samples may be tested for circulating biomarkers including 
cell-free DNA and tumor cells . 
Stool : Stool  samples may be tested for microbiome profile using sequencing or metabolomic 
methods.  
Additional Research : Beyond the assays noted above, and provided that sample material is 
left over, and with approval of the overall PI and sponsor, investigators /sponso r may perform 
additional research assays on tumor or blood samples collected in this protocol.  Future 
Biomedical Research may be conducted on specimens consented for future biomedical 
research during this clinical trial.  This research may include genetic a nalyses (DNA), gene 
expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma) and/or the 
measurement of other analytes, depending on which specimens are consented for future 
biomedical research.  
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main trial) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriately consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for 
Future Biomedical Research is to e xplore and identify biomarkers that inform the scien tific 
understanding of disease and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to understand disease, safety and potential treatments for future patients.  
11.2.3  Anti -drug antibodies  
Pre-APX005M samples for PK/ADA are planned for ADA analysis , as well as at EOT .

 12 SAFETY ASSESSMENT S 
Safety assessments (vital signs, physical examinations , ECG recording , AEs, clinical 
laboratory results (routine hematology and biochemistry ) are to be performed at protocol -
specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 11, Table 12, and Table 
13). 
12.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Ass essments  (Table 
11, Table 12, and Table 13). Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for 
the duration of the study.  Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded whenever vital sign s 
are recorded, and height (without shoes) will be recorded at Screening only.  
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur.  Out-of-range blood pressure, respiratory rate  or heart rate  measurements wi ll be 
repeated at the Investigator’s discretion.  Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign 
measurements must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening Visit  1, according to 
institutional standards . Physical examinations will be performed by a physician  or designated 
nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant . In addition, medical history will be recorded at 
Screening, including smoking history, if applicable.  
A limited physical exam ination  to verify continued patient  eligibility and to follow up any 
change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Table 11, Table 12, and Table 13). Symptom -driven limited physical 
exam ination s will be performed as clinically indicated at any study visit.  All changes not 
present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as clinically 
noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.3 Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead resting ECG  will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table 11, Table 12, and Table 13). 
At Screening , the Investigator  will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that 
could exclude the patient  from the study.  An assessment of normal or abnormal will be 
recorded and if the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the 
CRF.  ECGs will be repeated if clinically signi ficant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are 
present.  
12.4 Laboratory Assessments  
Samples for l aboratory assessment s (listed in  Table 14) are to be obtained at designated visits 
as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 11 and Table 12 for arms including 
APX005M and Table 13 for arms not including APX005M) .

 All laboratory reports must be reviewed, signed , and dated by the Investigator . A legible copy 
of all reports must be filed with both the patient 's CRF and medical record (source document) 
for that visit.  Any laboratory test result considered by the Investigator  to be clinically 
significant should be considered an AE (cl inically significant AEs include those that require 
an intervention).  Clinically significant abnormal values occurring during the study will be 
followed until repeat test results return to normal /baseline , stabilize, or are no longer clinically 
significant .

12.5 Adverse Event s, Adverse Events  of Special Interest , and Serious Adverse 
Events  
12.5.1  Time Period and Fre quency for Collecting Adverse Events , Serious Adverse 
Events , and Other Reportable Safety Event Information  
All AE s will be collected from the start of study drug through 100 days after the last dose of 
study drug , or until initiation of a new systemic anti -cancer therapy  (whichever occurs first). 
All treatment -related AEs ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation  are to be followed 
until resolution , or deemed irreversible  by the Investigator , regardless of w hether new anti -
cancer therapy has been initiated.  
All SAEs, will be collected from the time the patient  signs informed consent through  100 days 
after the last dose of study drug, or until initiation of a new systemic anti -cancer therapy  
(whichever occurs first).  SAEs related to study drug must be reported at all times, regardless 
of whether new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated.  All treatment -related SAEs must also 
to be followed until resolution , or deemed irreversible by the Investigator , regardle ss of 
whether new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated.   
Prior to initiation of study drug, only  SAEs that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, 
including those that occur prior to the assignment of study procedures (eg, screening invasive 
procedures, such as biopsies) should be reported. After obtaining informed consent, but prior 
to init iation  of study drug, other  medical occurrences will be recorded as medical history.  Hematology  Chemistry  Urine  Thyroid Function Tests

 If the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after the end of the AE 
reporting period, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the st udy drug or 
study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor or its designee. The 
Investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing 
or emailing the study -specific Serious Adverse E vent Report Form (SAERF).  
12.5.2  Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient , temporally associated with the use of 
study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study drug. 
Investigators will seek information on AE at each patient  contact. AEs  reported by the patient  
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the patient ’s legally authorized  
representative) or noted by study personnel will be recorded in the patient ’s medical record  
and on the Adverse Event eCRF page.  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and  
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following  
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study drug or study procedures, o r that caused 
the patient  to discontinue the study drug. 
12.5.2.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered “serious” if in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it meets 1  or 
more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life-threatening  
• Results in in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . If 
hospitalization occurs, then the SAE RF must follow initial admission to the hospital, 
regardless of duration of hospitalization.  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life -threatening but are c learly 
of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the patient , and may require intervention 
to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in inpatient  hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would typically be considered serious.  
A planned medical or surgical procedure  is considered  an SAE  for this study , even if it requires 
hospitalization.

93 
 12.5.2.2  Definition of Adverse Events of Spec ial Interest  
An adverse event of special interest ( AESI ) is one of scientific and medica l interest specific to 
understanding of the study drug (s) and may require close monitoring and rapid communication 
by the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be se rious or non -serious.  The rapid reporting 
of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand 
them in association with the use of this/these study drug (s). 
AESIs for this study population , listed below, must be repo rted by Investigators to the Sponsor 
but will not be expedited on an individual basis.  Instead these AESIs will be reviewed in 
aggregate during data review .  
List of Adverse Events of Special Interest  for this Study  
• Cytokine release syndrome  
• Infusional reactions  
• Low platelet count  
• Increased liver function test results  
Infusion of biological products is commonly associated with infusion -related reactions.  
Anaphylaxis and infusion -related reactions have some common manifestations and may be 
difficult to distinguish from each other. Infusion -related reactions are commonly observed 
during or shortly after the first time exposure to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies delivered 
through IV infusion.  These reactions are less common following subsequent exposures. Unlike 
infusion -related reactions, anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent 
exposure to an antigen, and it is most commonly accompanied by severe systemic skin and or 
mucosal reactions.  
The Investigator is advised to carefully examine symptoms of adverse reactions observed 
during or shortly after exposure to APX005M, and consider the above -mentioned  facts prior 
to making a final diagnosis.  Reactions occurring at the time of or shortly aft er subsequent 
infusions of study drug(s) are to be judged by the Investigator at his/her own discretion.  
Should the Investigator determine an infusion -related reaction or cytokine release syndrome 
have occurred, the underlying symptoms must be reported as individual Adverse Events in 
addition to the reaction or syndrome. This applies to the Adverse Event reporting guidelines 
detailed in Section 12.5, as well as Advers e Event eCRF entry.  
AESIs that meet seriousness criteria as defined in Section 12.5.2.1 , should be reported in the 
same way as SAEs, described in  Section 12.5.5 . 
12.5.3  Recordin g Adverse Events  
Patients  will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit.   
All AEs will be collected from the start of study drug through 100 days after the last dose of 
study drug, or until initiation of a new systemic anti -cancer therapy (whichever  occurs first). 
All treatment -related AEs ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation are to be followed 
until resolution , or deemed irreversible by the Investigator , regardless of whether new anti -
cancer therapy has been initiated.

94 
 Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to study drug  are given in  
Table 15 and Table 16. 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the NCI  CTCAE  version 4.03 (Grades 1 to 5).  
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique 
clinical descriptions of severit y for each AE based on the general guideline in  Table 15. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted.  If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Table 15 Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity  
Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated  
Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or  noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting age -appropriate  
instrumental ADL  
Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but  not immediately life -threatening;  hospitalization or prolongation 
of hospitalization indicated; disabling;  limiting self-care ADL  
Grade 4 : Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 : Death related to AE  
 
Table 16 Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study D rug 
UNRELATED : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc.).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test drug, but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found.  An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug  if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria:  (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could r eadily have been produced by the patient ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen whe n the drug is re -administered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by the patient ’s clinical state, environmen tal or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.  
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug.  An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteris tics of the patient ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon  discontinuation of the 
drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or 
tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
DEFINITELY :  This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to 
test drug.  An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrat ion of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with re -exposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known 
pattern of response to the test drug.

95 
 The relationship to study drug (either APX005M or nivolumab) will be recorded o n the eCRF.  
At each contact with the patient , the Investigator will seek information on AEs by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all AEs will be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate AE module o f the CRF.  All 
clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded 
in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
All AEs occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course  of each event 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study 
treatment  or participation is not the cause.  SAEs that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period will be followed up to determine the f inal outcome.  Any SAE  that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment  or study participation will 
be recorded and reported immediately (see Section 12.5.5 ). 
12.5.4  Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events  or Serious Adverse Event s 
Progression of the cancer  under study  is not itself considered a reportable event. Any suspected 
endpoint which upon review from the Investigator is not considered progression of the cancer 
under study must be reported as an SAE. Within 24 hours of determination that the event is 
not progression of the cancer under study, an SAE RF should be forwarded to PICI 
Pharmacovigilance Group as described in Section 12.5.5 . 
All deaths will be recorded on the Death eCRF page.  
12.5.5  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs, will be collected from the time the patient signs informed consent through 100 days 
after the last dose of study drug, or until initiation of a new systemic anti -cancer therapy 
(whichever occurs first) .  SAEs related to study drug must be reported at all times, regardless 
of whether new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated.  All treatment -related SAEs must also 
to be followed until resolution , or deemed irreversible by the Investigator , regardless of 
whether new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated.   
Prior to the initiation of study drug, only SAEs that are related to a protocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported.  
All SAE s must be reported to the PICI Pharmac ovigilance Group . Any SAE occurring after 
the initial study drug due to any cause, whether or not related to the study drug , must be 
reported within 24 hours  of site awareness  of the event.  Please fax or email the SAERF to the 
PICI Pharmacovigilance G roup within 24 hours of event awareness. If technical issues arise, 
please contact the PICI Pharmacovigilance G roup immediately .

Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
96 
 The event must also be recorded on the standard AE eCRF . Preliminary reports of SAEs must 
be followed by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of 
hospital case reports, consultant reports, death certificates , autopsy re ports, and other 
documents when requested and applicable.  SAE reports must be made whether or not the 
Investigator considers the event to be related to the investigational drug.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the respon se should be 
recorded.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed in order 
to determine the etiology of the problem.  The Investigator must report all additional follow -up 
evaluations to the PICI Pharmacovigilance Group when requested . All S AEs will be followed 
until the I nvestigator and Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the patient ’s 
active participation in the study is to be fol lowed until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), is deemed irreversible, or is shown to not be 
attributable to the study drug or procedures.  If a subject withdraws consent for data collection, 
the e vent will not be followed.  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the  initial report and new information arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be 
submitted to the IRB.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE s are followed 
until either resolved or stable . 
12.5.6  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of patients  and the safety of a study 
treatment  under  clinical investigation are met. Investigators must also comply with local 
requirements for reporting SAEs  to the IRB /IEC or other local health au thorit ies. 
12.5.6.1  Sponsor Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs  will be reported by the PICI Pharmacovigilance Group to regulatory authorities, the 
overall PI , Bristol -Myers Squibb,  Apexigen, the IRB, as appropriate.  The process for such 
reporting, including contact information and specific instructions for reporting to each of these 
organizations, is described in the Safety Monitoring  Plan (a separate document).  
12.5.7  Pregnancy  
Female patients  of child -bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening.  
Following administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female patients  or 
female partners of male patients  will be reported until the patient  completes or withdr aws from

 13 STATISTICAL AN ALYSIS  
This is a multi -center open -label Phase  1b/2 trial of CD40 agonistic monoclonal antibody 
(APX005M) administered with nab-paclitaxel and Gem  with or without nivolumab in 
previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  The primary objective s of the 
Phase 1b study are to determine the feasibility, safety and DLT s of each treatment cohort and 
to determine the RP2D  of APX005M in combination with NP/Gem and with 
nivolumab/NP/ Gem.  The primary objective of the randomized Phase 2 study is to evaluate OS 
in three treatment arms: nivolumab/NP/ Gem, NP/Gem/APX005 M and 
nivolumab/NP/ Gem/APX005M by comparing the 1 -year OS rate with the historical value for 
NP/Gem.  The study  is not powered fo r statistical comparison among arms , and no interim 
analyses are planned in Phase  2.  
Phase 1b Design : 
Four treatment cohorts will be evaluated for feasibility and safety, as shown in  Table 17. 
During Phase  1b, dosing of the first 3 patients of each cohort will be staggered by at least one 
week.  If at one week , and for each of the 3 patient s, there are no ongoing symptoms of cytokine 
release syndrome related to the infusion , and if no DLT occurs, subsequent patients to the 
cohort may be dosed without restriction.  Cohorts B1 and B2 will escalate the dose of 
APX005M when combined with NP/Gem , and then Cohorts C1 and C2 will escalate the dose 
of APX005M when combined with nivolumab/NP/ Gem.  Approximately 6  DLT -evaluable 
patients  will be enrolled in each cohort . A1 (nivolumab/NP/ Gem) will not be tested , since an 
external study  is being conducted to confirm the safety  of nivolumab in combination with  
NP/Gem.  For all cohorts , a treatment  cycle is 4 weeks (3 weeks of treatmen t with 1 week of 
rest).  
In general, DLT  is defined as  any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that is treatment -related but not 
related to the natural progression of the tumor and occurs during the DLT observation period  
(see Section 6.1). The DLT observation period is defined as the time from  first administration 
of investigational agents u ntil prior to Cycle 2 Day 1 . 
The DLT -evaluable population consists of patients  who received 2 or 3 doses of NP/Gem and 
1 dose of APX005M during Cycle 1 , thus have completed the DLT observation period . Patients 
who do not remain on study up to this time for  reasons other than DLT will be replaced . 
Dose escalation will proceed if 1 or fewer DLT -evaluable patients  experience DLT during this 
observation period.  Dose escalation will cease if 2 or more DLT -evaluable patients  experience 
DLT.

DLT = dose -limiting toxicity; Gem = gemcitabine; NP = nab-paclitaxel  
On the basis of discussions among the site PIs, Sponsors, and other stakeholders, concerning 
feasibility, safety, clinical and immune PD effects (totality of available data), the RP2D  is 
defined by the highest APX00 5M dose with <  2 DLT in 6 DLT -evaluable patients , unless the 
totality of available data suggests a lower APX005M dose.  
Phase 1b Objectives:  
The primary objectives are to  
1. Determine feasibility, safety , and DLT  of each treatment cohort  
2. Determine the RP2D  of APX005M when combined with NP/Gem  
3. Determine the RP2D  of APX005M when combined with nivolumab/NP/ Gem  
The secondary objectives are to  
1. Determine OR and DOR of each treatment cohort  
The exploratory objectives are:  
1. Assess the PK of APX005M  
2. Assess  immune pha rmacodynamic effects of each treatment arm, in both blood and 
tumor tissue  
Phase 1b Plans for Data Analysis:  Statistical analyses will include the following:  
• The number of patients  treated in each cohort will be reported, and reasons why any 
patient  is not  DLT evaluable will be summarized.  
• Approximately 6  DLT -evaluable patients  will be fully analyzed in each treatment 
cohort . 
• Feasibility, defined by the number of patients  who complete the DLT observation 
period and receive the intended therapy without delays or dose modification, will be 
described for each treatment arm.  
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol

 • Toxicities will be graded by NCI  CTC AE v4.03, causality attributed, and tabulated by 
treatment arm.  
• RP2D of APX005M when combined with NP/Gem and with nivolumab/ NP/Gem will 
be determined . 
• RECIST OR will be scored and tabulated  along with DOR, by treatment arm . 
• PK of APX005M  
• Immune PD effects will be measured  and summarized , including change from baseline, 
and reported by treatment arm.  
Phase 2 Design  
Once the RP2D  of APX005M for Arm C has been defined, the randomized Phase 2 portion of 
the study  will commence  (Table 18). Patients  will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms, defined by 
the addition of one or more immunotherapy agents to standard of care NP/Gem.  The arms will 
be either A1 vs B2 vs C2 or A1 vs B1 vs C1.  Note the APX005M dose must be the same in 
Arms B and C, regardless of whether a higher APX005M dose was determined to be safe in 
Arm B.  For each regimen, efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the 1 -year OS rate to the 
historical value for NP/Gem.  
It is common for randomized Phase 2 studies  that test the addition of an experimental agent to 
a standard of care regimen to include the standard of care arm. However, the setting for this 
study is unique.  NP/Gem, the standard of care regimen, was reported recently in a very similar 
patient  population, and the 1 -year OS rate was estimated with extremely high precision (i.e., 
1-year OS rate was 35% with 95% CI 30% -39%) based on 431 treated patients .6 With hundreds 
of patients  with PC  treated with NP/Gem since that report, experts in this field agree that the 
1-year OS rate estimate appears to be very robust . Thus, this study  will not include a standard 
of care arm.  
As shown in Table 18, 12 DLT -evaluable patients  who were enrolled in Phase 1b at the RP2D  
(6 on Arm B and  6 on Arm C) will be included in the efficacy evaluation  and approximately 
93 additional patients  will be randomized in Phase 2, for a total sample size of approximately 
105 patients  (35 per treatme nt arm).  In step 1, 12 patients  will be randomized in a 4:1:1 
allocation, to achieve balance in the total number of patients  enrolled in the arms (i.e., Arm A1 
must be allocated more patients ). Then, in step 2, 81 patients  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 
allocation.

Phase 2 Objectives:  
The primary objectives are to  
1. Estimate OS of each treatment arm  
2. Compare 1 -year OS rate of each treatment arm to the historical rate for NP /Gem  
The secondary objectives are to  
1. Determine the ORR , DCR, DOR , and PFS of each treatment arm  
2. Further characterize the feasibility and safety of each treatment arm  
The exploratory objectives are to  
1. Assess PK of APX00 5M in Cycles 1 to 4  
2. Assess immune pharmacodynamic effects of each treatment arm, in both blood and 
tumor tissue  
3. Assess associations between immune biomarkers and clinical outcomes  
4. Evaluate baseline and on -treatment microbiome profiles and association with clinical 
outcomes  
5. Construct multivariable linear models to dissect the pharmacodynamic  effects of 
APX005M and nivolumab on immune biomarkers  
Early Termination Rules for Unacceptable Toxicity in Phase 2  
A Bayesian rule will be employed to monitor toxicity during Phase 2  (Table 19). A minimally 
informative beta (0.5,  2.5) prior has been assumed, which is information that  is equivalent to 
half the weight of 1 DLT in 6 patients  treated, the definition of a safe dose in Phase 1b.  For 
each treatment arm, if the number of patients  with an unacceptable  toxicity  (defined in 
Section  6.1) is greater than or equal to the number in  Table 19, then termination  of that 
particular treatment arm will be considered, as it is likely that the toxicity  rate is >  30%, as 
noted by the Bayesian posterior probabilities.  This rule is intentionally conservative early in 
the enrollment phase.  
Table 19 Bayesian Termination Rules  
Rules for Toxicity Rate >30%

Patients  with unacceptable  toxicity  4 6 9 11 13

Action  Consider termination of arm, re -evaluate study design.  
 
Phase 2 Plans for Data Analysis:  
Statistical analyses will include the following:  
• 35 patients  will be analyzed on each treatment arm. 12 DLT -evaluable patients  from 
Phase 1  (Arms B and C) and 93 patients  from Phase  2 will comp ose the population for 
the final analysis of efficacy . 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
102 
 • OS will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method for each treatment arm . 
• The 1 -year OS rate and 1 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calcula ted for 
each treatment arm, to determine whether the lower bound of the CI excludes the 
historical value (or a recently updated value) for NP/Gem . 
• A 1-sided one -sample Z test will also be conducted. The goal is to compare the survival 
probability at 1 -year to the historical value of 0.35.  
• ORR and DCR and their 95% CIs will be calculated for each treatment arm . 
• DOR will be calculated from dates of first documented response and progression of 
disease . 
• PFS will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method and the median PFS and 95% CI 
will be calculated for each treatment arm.  Toxicities will be graded by NCI  CTC AE 
v4.03 and summarized  by treatment arm . 
• PK of APX005M  
• Immune pharmacodynamic endpoints (see Section 5.2.2.3 ) will be measured and 
summarized, including change from baseline, and reported by treatment a rm. In 
addition to scatter and box plots, continuous variables will be summarized with the 
number of patients  (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
by treatment group.  
• Associations between baseline values and changes in immune pharmac odynamic 
variables or microbiome profiles and clinical outcomes will be assessed.  Logistic and 
Cox regression models will be employed for binary (responder/non -responder) 
outcomes and OS or PFS outcomes, respectively.  
• Multivariable linear models will be co nstructed to dissect the effects of APX005M and 
nivolumab on immune biomarkers.  To begin, a linear model is constructed with a post -
treatment value of a biomarker at a selected time point as the dependent variable and 
the pre -treatment value, two indic ator variables for APX005M and nivolumab 
treatment and treatment interaction term, as the independent variables.  To analyze 
serial measurement of immune biomarkers, a linear mixed effects model is constructed 
to assess the impact of the individual and combined  therapies on longitudinal changes, 
taking into account within -patient  corre lation of the serial samples.  
13.1 Determination  of Sample size  
13.1.1  Phase 1b  
Assuming 4 treatment cohorts will be evaluated for feasibility, safety, and DLTs , up to 
24 DLT -evaluable patients  will be enrolled.   
13.1.2  Phase 2  
Approximately n inety -three patients  will be enrolled in Phase 2.  This is a screening study , such 
that for each treatment arm, the 1 -year OS rate  will be estimated and compared with a  historical 
value of 35% for NP/Gem .6 The study  is not powered to detect a meaningful difference in OS 
among the 3 arms, since these are novel experimental arms and OS is unknown.   
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
103 
 The null hypothesis is a 1 -year OS rate of 35% and the alternative hypothesis is a 1 -year OS 
rate of 58%. The 1 -year OS rate is estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method. A sample size of 
35 patients on each arm provides 88% power to test this hypothesis, using a 1 -sided one -sample 
Z test with 5% type I error rate, assuming a minimum of 1 year of follow -up for each patient. 
Moreover, the sample size of 35 patients on each arm provides 81% po wer to statistically test 
the null hypothesis versus a slightly more conservative alternative hypothesis that the 1 -year 
OS rate is 55%, given the same design assumptions.  
These calculations assume that at least 105 patients  (35 patients  x 3 arms) will be enroll ed. 
There is no assumption about the duration of patient enrollment, only that there will be a 
minimum of 1 year of follow -up for each patient.  
13.2 Analysis Populations  
The safety population  consists of all patients  who received at lea st 1 dose of any study drug.  
This is  the population for the primary analyses of safety.  A subset of the safety population is 
the DLT -evaluable population, described in Section 6.1. 
The DLT -evaluable population  consists of patients who received 2 or 3 doses of NP/Gem 
during Cycle 1 , as well as one dose of APX005M,  thus have completed the DLT observation 
period (ie, from the time of first administration of investigational agents until prior to Cycle 2 
Day 1 ). Patients  who do not meet these criteria will be replaced in Phase 1b only, to assist with 
DLT and RP 2D decis ion-making.  
The efficacy population  consists of  (1) all patients  who were randomized /enrolled  in Phase 2 
and received at least 1 dose of any study drug and (2) the 12 DLT -evaluable patients  (6 on Arm 
B and  6 on Arm C) who were enrolled in Phase 1 b at the RP2D. The  efficacy population is  the 
population for the primary analyses of efficacy.  
13.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  Summary statistics will be 
presented by treatment arm.  For continuou s variables, data will be summarized with the 
number of patients  (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum by 
treatment group.  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the number and 
proportion of patients  for each category by treatment arm.  
13.4 Efficacy Analysis  
13.4.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be determined as follows:  
• OS is defined as the time from initiation of study therapy to date of death due to any 
cause or date of most recent patient  contact.  Patients  who were alive are censored on 
their most recent contact date.  
• 1-year OS rate in each treatment arm  
• Subgroup analysis : For each treatment arm, OS will be analyzed in the subset of 
patients  in the efficacy population who remain on study for at least 6 weeks.  This subset 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy  PICI0002  
Amendment 7, dated October  11, 2019  Final Protocol  
 
104 
 is in contrast to the efficacy population in the primary analysis.  The 1 -year OS rate and 
1-sided 95% CI will again be calculated and compared with a historical value.  
 
13.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be determined in the Phase 2 portion of the study:  
• OR is determined by RECIST and the ORR is defined as t he proportion of patients  who 
achieve a CR or PR . A 95% CI for the rate will be constructed. The half -width of this 
confidence interval will be no greater than 16.5%, based on 35 patients in each 
treatment arm  
• DCR is defined as the proportion of patients  who achieve a CR, PR, or SD. A 95%  CI 
for the rate will be constructed. The half -width of this CI will be no greater than 16.5%, 
based on 35 patients in each treatment arm  
• DOR is defined as the time for first documentation of response (CR or PR) to first 
documentation of PD. PFS is defined as the time from initiation of study therapy to 
date of first documented PD, date of death due to any cause or date of most recent 
patien t contact which documented progression -free status (i.e., clinic visit date or scan 
date).  Patients  who have not progressed or died are censored on their most recent 
progression -free date.  
 
13.4.3  Exploratory Endpoints  
Tissue Assessment : From germline WES, HLA ty pe can be determined.  From tumor WES, 
tumor RNA -Seq, and germline WES, patient -specific neo epitopes arising from tumor somatic 
missense mutations can be predicted bioinformatically.  
Analysis of T -cell Activation : For each T -cell subset, differentiation st atus (e.g., naïve, central 
memory, effector memory) or activation vs. exhaustion status may be assessed using additional 
markers such as Eomes, Tbet, Granzyme B, Ki -67, CD45RA, ICOS, CD45RO, CCR7, CD28, 
CD27, CD57, CD25, CD69, HLA -DR, CTLA -4, and PD -1. Whe n possible, trends will be 
tracked in T -cell subsets based on analysis of multiple post -treatment samples.  NK cells 
subsets may also be assessed using CD16 and CD56, with CD69 as an activation marker.  
Analysis of Myeloid and B -cell Activation : For each parameter  of B-cell activation  and each 
cell type, the percentage of cells positive for the marker and/or MFI at time points after treated 
can be compared to baseline and the change calculated as % after/%baseline  or MFI after/MFI baseline . 
Inflammatory Cytok ines/Chemokines : Concentrations of cytokines  and other circulating 
factors may include but are not limited to TGF-β, IL -1, TNF -α, IL -6 and others may be 
determined and summarized . 
TCR Deep Sequencing : Comparison of TCR beta sequence data in serial samples from blood 
and tumor may be used to  demonstrate de novo evolution of an anti -tumor T -cell repertoire.  
Microbiome profile:  Stool  samples may be tested for microbiome profile using sequencing or 
metabolomic methods.

 13.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Circulating  conce ntrations of APX005M will be determined from venous blood samples 
collected periodically during the study, as indicated in  the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 11 
and Table 12). 
The standard PK parameters of peak plasma concentration (C max), area under the curve 
(AUC 0-x), elimination half -life (t 1/2), elimination rate constant (λ), volume of distribution (V z), 
and clearance (C) will be estimated by standard noncompartmental methods.  This description 
could also include single - and multiple -dose parameters, use of Win Nonlin program, and linear 
least squares . 
13.6 Safety Endpoints  
13.6.1  Phase 1b: Assessing Feasibility, Dose -Limiting Toxic ity, and Recommended 
Dose for Phase 2  
The following will be determined for the Phase 1b portion of the study:  
• Feasibility is defined by the number of patients  who complete the DLT observation 
period and receive the intended therapy without delays or dose modification.  
• A DLT  is defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that is treatment -related but not 
related to t he natural progression of the tumor and occurs during the DLT observation 
period . See Section 6.1 for further details.  
• The RP2D  of APX005M when com bined with NP/Gem or nivolumab/NP/ Gem is 
defined by the highest APX005M dose with <  2 DLT s in 6 DLT -evaluable patients , 
unless the totality of available data, including clinical and pharmacodynamic effects, 
suggests a lower APX005M dose.  
13.6.2  Analysis of Advers e Events  
All reported AEs will be coded using the most current version of the Medical Dicti onary for 
Regulatory Activities . The incidence of TEAEs  (events with onset dates on or after the start of 
the study drug)  will be included in incidence tables.  Events with missing onset dates will be 
included as treatment -emergent.  If a patient  experiences more than 1  occurrence of the same 
AE, the occurrence with the greatest severity and the closest association with the study drug 
will be used in the su mmary tables . SAEs and AEs causing treatment discontinuation will be 
tabulated.  All AEs will be listed  by patient , along with information regarding onset, duration, 
relationship  and severity  to study drug , action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome . 
Clinical laboratory data and vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including mean values and mean change from baseline values, as well as numbers of patients  
with values outside limits of the normal range at each time poi nt. 
Summary tables will be provided for concomitant medications initiated during the study  period.

 13.7 Interim Analysis  
Given the hypothesis generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may conduct up to 3 interim 
analyses of safety and efficacy during the Phase 1b and Phase 2 portions of the study. Should 
an interim analysis occur, it will be performed and interpreted by members of the Sponsor 
study team. If warranted, interim safety and efficacy results m ay be shared with study 
Investigators. The decision to conduct an interim analysis, its timing and scope, and who will 
have access to the results, will be documented in the sponsor’s trial master file and statistical 
analysis plan prior to the conduct of t he interim analysis. The clinical study report will also 
document that such an interim analysis occurred.  
13.8 Data Monitoring  
13.8.1  Data Review Team  (DRT)  
To ensure patients ’ safety during Phase 1b  and Phase 2 , a DRT  will review the safety data on 
a regular basis.  The DRT consis ts of members from the Sponsor , the overall PI, the lead 
statistician, and all active PIs . The DRT will decide on DLTs  relevant for the treatment and 
will decide by consensus on dose escalation, dose de -escalation,  prolongation of the DLT 
observation period, suspension of enrollment based on safety, PK or possibly 
pharmacodynamic  data, and will recommend the dose level for the Phase 2 part.

 16.2 Nivolumab Toxicity Management Guide  
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor.  The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncology agents and regimens.  
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice.  Non-inflammatory etiologies should be considered and 
appropriately treated.  
Corticosteroids are a  primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug -related adverse events.  The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients  with 
low-grade toxicity.  The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into 
account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.  
The frequency and severity of the related adverse ev ents covered by these algorithms will 
depend on the immuno -oncology agent or regimen being used.

 16.3 Guidance for the Management of Infusion Reaction/Cytokine Release 
Syndrome  
Precautions should be observed during the administration of APX005M and nivolumab. 
Emergency agents including oxygen, oral and endotracheal airways, intubation equipment 
epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids should be available and used if required at the 
Investigator’s discr etion.  
 
Patients  should be instructed that symptoms associated with cytokine release 
syndrome/infusion reaction can occur within 48 hours following the administration of the 
APX005M or nivolumab, and if such symptoms develop while they are at home, they sh ould 
contact the Investigator and/or seek emergency medical care if appropriate.  
 
• Grade 2:  stop infusion and treat symptoms following guidance  in Table 21. If 
symptoms resolve within two hours, the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original 
infusion rate (e.g., from 100 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr).  
• Grade 3 -4: stop infusion and treat symptoms follo wing guidance in Table 21.

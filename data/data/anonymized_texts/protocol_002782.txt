Trial title  
A phase III, randomi sed, open-label, comparative safety and efficacy trial of intravenous iron 
isomaltoside (Monofer®) and iron sucrose in subjects with iron deficiency anaemia and non -
dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease  
Trial design 
The trial is a randomi sed, comparative, open -label trial. Subjects with iron deficiency ana e-
mia (IDA) and non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD -CKD) will be rando m-
ised 2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:  
 Group A: iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos,  Holbæk, Denmark)  
 Group B: iron sucrose (Venofer®) 
Phase of trial 
The trial is a phase III trial. 
Background  
IDA is often associated with many chronic diseases such as renal diseases, cancer, infections, 
chronic heart failure, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
Subjects are often treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in order to stimulate 
erythropoi esis. This therapy requires rapid mobilisation of iron reserves in order to meet the 
demands of new red blood cell (RBC) growth. Despite normal or even increased iron stores, 
the demands of this therapy can outstrip the body’s ability to mobilise iron stor es resulting in 
“functional iron deficiency”.  
IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and  
treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of no r-
mal haemoglobin (Hb) concent rations and iron stores. Iron replacement can be accomplished 
by the oral or parenteral routes. The KDIGO guidelines recommend either treatment with 
intravenous (IV) iron or alternatively 1 -3 months of oral iron therapy in NDD -CKD subjects 
with IDA based on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to 
prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior iron therapy, subject compliance, and cost . Oral 
iron can be inadequately absorbed in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) subjects and is often as-
sociated with gastro -intestinal adverse effects and therefore IV iron might improve the sub-
ject compliance and treatment success . 
Iron sucrose is a widely used parenteral iron product and therefore this product has been ch o-
sen as comparator in t his trial which is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV iron 
isomaltoside compared to IV iron sucrose in subjects with IDA and NDD -CKD. 
Objectives  
The primary safety objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of IV iron isomaltoside  
compared to iron sucrose  in subjects with IDA and NDD -CKD. 
The primary efficacy objective of the trial is to evaluate and compare the effect of iron iso-
maltoside  to iron sucrose in its ability to increase Hb in subjects with IDA and NDD -CKD. 
The secondary efficacy objective of the trial is to evaluate and compare the effect of iron

Endpoints  
The co-primary safety endpoint is serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction starting on or 
after the first dose of randomised treatment (i.e. treatment -emergent). The hypersensitivity 
terms are defined as standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  query (SMQ) 
terms (including four additional terms) in Appendix A.  
 
The adverse events (AEs) will be adjudicated in a bli nded fashion by an independent C linical 
Endpoint Adjudication C ommittee  (CEAC) (described in a separate adjudication charter ). 
The specified definition of adjudicated endpoints will be given in the charter . 
The secondary safety endpoints are the following:  
 Composite cardiovascular AEs starting on or after the first dose of randomised trea t-
ment (i.e. treatment -emergent). The adjudicated composite AEs  includes the follo w-
ing: 
 Death due to any cause  
 Non-fatal myocardial infarction  
 Non-fatal stroke  
 Unstable angina requiring hospitalization  
 Congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization or medical intervention  
 Arrhythmias  
 Hypertension 
 Hypotension  
 
The AEs will be adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent CEAC (described 
in a separate adjudication charter ). The specified definition of adjudicated endpoints 
is given in Appendix B.  
 Time to first composite cardiovascular safety AE  
 S-phosphate < 2 mg/dL at any time from baseline to week s 1, 2, 4, or 8 
 
In addition, physical examinations and measurements of vital signs, height, weight, electr o-
cardiogram (ECG), and safety laboratory parameters will be measured as part of stan dard 
safety assessments.  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint is change in Hb from baseline to week 8.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are the following:  
 Hb increase of ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline to week s 1, 2, 4, or 8 
 Time to change in Hb ≥ 1 g/dL 
 Hb level of > 12 g/dL at any time from week 1  to week 8

Trial treatment  
The subjects will be dosed with either iron isomaltoside  (group A) or iron sucrose (group B) 
as described below.  
In group A, iron isomaltoside  will be administered as a single IV infusion of 1000 mg at 
baseline diluted in 100 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride and given over approximately 20 min utes 
(50 mg iron/min).  
In group B, iron sucrose will be administered as 200 mg undiluted IV push injections over

Confidential    Page 8 of 53 approximately 2 -5 minutes and repeated according to standard practice or physician choice 
up to a maximum of five times (1000 mg) within the first two weeks starting at baseline.  A 
cumulative dose of 1000 mg is recommended.  The cumulative dose of iron sucrose should be 
specified and documented at baseline.  
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued . 
Sample size calculations  
The co-primary endpoints are treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious 
hypersensitivity AEs and change in Hb from baseline to week 8.  
Safety: 
Data from previous trials conducted with iron isomaltoside suggests that the incidence of 
treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hyperse nsitivity AEs for an IDA pop u-
lation can be expected to be approximately 1 % (IBD -01/IBD-02/CIA-01/PP-01: n = 3/341 = 
0.9 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.2 %; 2.5 %), and similar for iron sucrose (CKD -03: n 
= 1/114 = 0.9 %, 95 % CI: 0.0 %; 4.8 %). A com mon incidence of 1.5 % will be assumed for 
the current trial.  
As these are relatively rare events, an incidence of 0 % for placebo is assumed. Iron is o-
maltoside should be at most 50 % worse than the difference between iron sucrose and plac e-
bo, correspondin g to a maximum relative risk of 2 (1.5 %/(1.5 % -0 %)2). 
This trial will primarily assess the risk of the test drug under investigation. Arguing back 
from a relative risk of 2 gives that the upper bound of the 95 % CI for the incidence of treat-
ment-emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hypersensitivity AEs should be at most 3 % 
(2×1.5 %) for the iron isomaltoside treatment group.  
Efficacy: 
IDA-301 was a double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to compare the safety and 
efficacy of 1000 mg IV feru moxytol to placebo. In this trial, 608 subjects were treated with 
ferumoxytol and 200 received placebo. The change in Hb from baseline to week 5 was the 
primary efficacy endpoint for the European Union regulators, and one of the secondary en d-
points for U.S . regulators. The mean change was 2.6 g/dL (standard deviation (SD): 1.5) for 
IV ferumoxytol and 0.1 g/dL (SD: 0.9) for placebo. The estimated treated effect of IV fe r-
umoxytol (i.e. the difference between ferumoxytol and placebo) was estimated to be appro x-
imately 2.5 g/dL with a 95 % CI ranging from 2.3 to 2.7 g/dL. The point estimate will be 
used as estimate of the treatment effect. Preserving 80 % of this effect is believed to provide 
reasonable assurance that iron isomaltoside is efficacious. Hence, the non-inferiority margin 
is set to (1 -0.8) × 2.5 g/dL ~ 0.5 g/dL.  
Power: 
The significance level is set to 5 %. With n = 1000 in the iron isomaltoside treatment group, 
there is 88 % power for demonstrating that the upper bound of the 95 % CI of the incidence 
of treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hypersensitivity AEs  is less than 3 
%. And with n = 500 in the iron sucrose treatment group, assuming no difference between the 
treatment groups, and assuming a common SD = 1.5 g/dL, there is 100 % po wer for demo n-
strating non -inferiority of the change in Hb from baseline to week 8, using a non -inferiority

Confidential    Page 9 of 53 margin of -0.5 g/dL.  
This yields a total power for demonstrating both co -primary endpoints of 88 % in the trial.  
The IDA-03 trial will run in parallel with this trial and the sample size is the same, yielding a 
total of 2000 subjects to be treated with iron isomaltoside and 1000 with iron sucrose. In a d-
dition to the efficacy and safety analyses performed for this trial alone, an eff icacy and safety 
assessment will be performed for the two trials combined. This is briefly described in Section 
15.6. 
Subjects will be stratified according to current eGFR ( <46, 46-<60, or 60 -<90 
mL/min/1.73m2) and baseline cardiovascular risk (history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or 
congestive heart failure ; yes/no). 
Statistical analyses  
The co-primary safety endpo int will be analysed by constructing an exact two -sided 95 % CI 
of the incidence of treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hypersensitivity 
AEs in the iron isomaltoside  treatment group. If the upper bound of the 95 % CI is < 3 %, the 
safety objective has been met.  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML)-based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. All subjects in the 
intention to treat (ITT) analysis set with p ost baseline Hb data will be included with their o b-
served data. For subjects without post baseline Hb values will have change from baseline set 
to 0 at the first post -baseline visit.  The model will include the fixed, categorical effects of 
treatment ( iron isomaltoside  and iron sucrose), week, treatment -by-week interaction, strata, 
as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline Hb value and baseline Hb -by-week 
interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the within -subject 
errors. If, unexpectedly, this analysis fails to converge, the following structures will be a p-
plied, in the following order; first -order ante -dependence, heterogeneous compound sy m-
metry, compound symmetry. The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to  estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. The primary comparisons will be the contrasts between iron 
isomaltoside  and iron sucrose at week 8 based on the least squares means for the treatment -
by-week interaction effect. The estimated mean difference ba sed on this model will be r e-
ported with two -sided symmetric 95 % CI, and if the lower bound of the 95 % CI is > -0.5 
g/dL, the efficacy objective has been met.  
All the statistical analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan.  
Ethical aspects  
The trial will follow International Conference on Harmonization -Good Clinical Practice  
(ICH-GCP) guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration, and all subjects will sign informed co n-
sent before inclusion.  
The protocol will be submitted to relevant authorities ( Institutional Review Board  
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) , Competent Authorities , and Data Protection 
Agencies) according to local regulatory requirements prior to trial initiation.

2.1 Background 
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common problem associated with many chronic diseases 
such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, infections, chronic heart failure (CHF), and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is also common in pregnant women and occurs in the 
elderly. IDA is primarily caused by chronic blood loss, poor diet, or impaired gastrointestinal 
iron absorption. The major causes of anaemia in CKD subjects are iron and erythropoietin 
deficiencies and a decreased responsiveness to the actions of erythropoietin [Mehdi & Toto, 
2009].  
Subjects are often treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in order to stimulate 
erythropoiesis. This therapy requires rapid mobilisation of iron reserves in order to meet the 
demands of new red blood cell (RBC) growth. Despite normal or even increased iron stores, 
the demands of this therapy can outstrip the body’s ability to mobilise iron stores resulting in 
“functional iron deficiency” [Hotta et al., 1991]. 
IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and 
treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of no r-
mal haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and iron stores. Iron replacement can be accomplished 
by the oral or parenteral routes. The KDIGO guidelines recommend either treatment with in-
travenous (IV) iron or alternatively 1-3 months of oral iron therapy in non -dialysis-dependent 
chronic kidney disease ( NDD-CKD) patients with IDA based on the severity of iron deficien-
cy, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior 
iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost [KDIGO guideline, 2012]. Oral iron can be inad e-
quately absorbed in CKD patients [KDIGO guideline, 2012] and is often associated with ga s-
tro-intestinal adverse effects and therefore IV iron might improve the patient compliance and 
treatment success [Charytan et al., 2005]. 
Iron sucrose (Venofer®) is a widely used parenteral iron products and therefore this product 
has been chosen as comparator in this trial which is planned to evaluate the safety and effic a-
cy of IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos, Holbæk, Denmark) compared to 
IV iron sucrose in subjects with IDA and NDD-CKD. 
2.2 Iron Isomaltoside  
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C nuclear magnetic re s-
onance (NMR) of repeating α- (1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally 
different from the branched dextran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside 
1000 consists predominantly of 3-5 glucose units and is prepared from oligomers used for 
prevention of dextran-induced anaphylactic reaction. These oligomers have been chemically 
modified to further reduce the potential for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, iso-
maltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 2011]. 
Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
and rapid dosing.

Protocol Version: 4.0 (amendment 3)  
Date of Document :  14 June 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 18 of 53 Following IV administration, iron isomaltoside is rapidly taken up by the cells in the reticul o-
endothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen. Due to its molecular weight it is not 
eliminated by the kidneys [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection containing 100 mg iron/ml 
with pH between 5.0 and 7.0.    
2.3 Trial Rationale 
Among the various formulations of parenteral iron available on the market, iron isomaltoside 
may allow flexibility in terms of high and rapid dosing. The use of parenteral iron, especially 
in high doses, may result in better compliance, fewer visits to the medical practitioner, and 
overall improvement in QoL. 
Thus, this trial is planned to compare the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside with another 
parenteral iron preparation (iron sucrose) in subjects with IDA and NDD-CKD. 
3 TRIAL DESIGN  
The trial is a randomised, comparative, open-label trial. The trial duration for the individual 
subject will be approximately 10 weeks and each subject will attend a minimum of 6  visits. 
The subject in group B may attend additional 2 treatment visits (T V1-TV2) if deemed nece s-
sary by the Investigator in order to achieve the cumulative dose of iron sucrose.  The subjects 
will be randomised 2 :1 to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 Group A: Iron isomaltoside (1000  mg infusion) 
 Group B: Iron sucrose (200 mg push injection up to 5 times), a cumulative dose of 
1000 mg is recommended 
4 TRIAL OBJECTIVES

7.6 Height 
Height will be measured. 
7.7 Weight 
Weight will be measured. 
7.8 Vital Signs  
Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured. 
At the treatment visits, heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at the following tim e 
points: 
 For subjects receiving an infusion of iron isomaltoside: approximately 0-10 minutes 
before infusion, during infusion, 5-15 minutes, and 20-40 minutes after the infusion 
has ended 
 For subjects receiving a push injections of iron sucrose: approximately 0-10 minutes 
before injection, 5-15 minutes, and 20-40 minutes after the injection has ended 
7.9 Electrocardiogram 
A standard 12 lead ECG will be recorded (including date, time, and signature). At baseline 
and other treatment visits, two ECGs will be recorded; one before administration of the trial 
drug and one approximately 30 minutes after start of the dosing. Only one ECG should be 
recorded at the follow-up visits. 
The ECGs do not need to be evaluated by a cardiologist. 
7.10 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale 
The FACIT Fatigue Scale is used to measure fatigue symptoms of the subjects [Cella et al., 
2005]. It is a self-administered questionnaire which will be filled out by the subject. 
7.11 Pharmacoeconomics 
The ISDR questionnaire will be used to measure the resources used  to receive treatment at 
one visit by the subject. Questions 5 and 10 of the questionnaire have been rephrased so that 
the questionnaire only includes resources used on preparation for the visit, travel time, and 
receiving the trial drug. Thus, resources used on other trial activities are not included. The 
questionnaire is based on independent research funded by the National Institute for Health 
Research under the Program Grants for Applied Research program (RP- PG-1210-12016). 
The health care resource use questionnaire will include questions regarding time used by the 
health care staff during administration of the trial drug and the administration time (including 
the observational time). The questions will include the following: 
 What is your profession (nurse, doctor, etc.)?

the administration, administration time, and observation time? 
7.12 Laboratory Assessments 
It is requested that the blood samples are drawn before administering the trial drug, and, if 
possible, that they are drawn at the same time of the day at all visits in order to reduce any 
diurnal fluctuation in the parameters.

Subjects may be re-screened 3 times at the discretion of the PI. Each subject re-screened must 
be re-consented and allocated a new subject number. All required screening assessments must 
be repeated in accordance with the protocol. 
9.3 Subject Withdrawal 
The subject has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to his/her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. The PI can wit h-
draw subjects from the trial in the following situations; treatment failure, safety reasons, and 
protocol violations. 
The subject may also withdraw the consent if he/she does not wish to or is unable to continue 
in the trial. The Investigator will discuss with the subject the most appropriate way to with-
draw in order to ensure the subject’s health. If a subject withdraws from the trial, the Invest i-
gator will perform all final visit assessments, besides the scheduled trial assessments for that 
visit. Upon subject withdrawal, the Investigator will fill in the final visit form including the 
reason for withdrawal. 
A subject who withdraws from the trial will not be re-enrolled or replaced with a new subject. 
9.4 Subject Completion 
When the subject has completed the trial, the Investigator will fill in the final visit form.  
9.5 Treatment afte r the Trial 
When the trial has ended or if the subject is withdrawn from the trial, the subject will be trea t-
ed according to standard hospital practice. 
9.6 Early Trial Termination 
Pharmacosmos A/S reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue the 
trial at any time for reasons including, but not limited to; safety or ethical issues, severe non-
compliance, and insufficient subject enrolment. For multi-centre trials, this can occur at one 
or more sites. If Pharmacosmos A/S decides that such action is needed, Pharmacosmos A/S or 
its designee will discuss this with the PI including the reasons for taking such action. The PI 
also has the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this trial for mutually 
agreed reason(s) with Pharmacosmos A/S.  
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will promptly inform all other PIs and/or institutions con-
ducting the trial if the trial is suspended or terminated due to safety reasons.  
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will promptly inform the Competent Authorities of the 
suspension or termination of the trial and the reason(s) for the action. If required by applicable 
regulations, the PI must inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) promptly and provide the reason for the suspension or termination.

10.1 Description of Investigational Products 
Iron isomaltoside 
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C NMR of repeating α-
(1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally different from the branched de x-
tran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside 1000 consists predominantly of 3- 5 
glucose units and is prepared from oligomers used for prevention of dextran-induced anaph y-
lactic reaction. These oligomers have been chemically modified to further reduce the potential 
for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, isomaltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 
2011]. 
Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
dose and rapid dosing. 
Following IV administration, iron isomaltoside is rapidly taken up by the cells in the reticul o-
endothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen. Due to its molecular weight, it is not 
eliminated by the kidneys [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection/infusion containing 100 mg 
iron/mL with pH between 5.0 and 7.0. 
Iron sucrose 
Iron sucrose (Venofer®) is an aqueous complex of polynuclear iron (III)-hydroxide in sucrose 
for IV use. Iron sucrose injection has a molecular weight of approximately 34,000-60,000 
Daltons [Venofer® prescribing information (USA), 01/2014, local Summary of Product Cha r-
acteristics (SmPC), or local product monography].  
Iron sucrose is provided as a brown, sterile solution in 5 mL single dose vials (100 mg el e-
mental iron per 5 mL) and 10 mL single dose vials (200 mg elemental iron per 10 mL). Iron 
sucrose must be administered intravenously by push injections over approximately 2-5 
minutes in this trial, which is an approved treatment course.  
10.2 Dosage, Administration and Blinding of Trial Drug 
The subjects will be randomised 2 :1 to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 Group A, iron isomaltoside will be administered as a single IV infusion of 1000 mg at 
baseline diluted in 100 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride and given over approximately 20 
minutes (50 mg iron/min).  
 Group B, iron sucrose will be administered as 200 mg undiluted IV push injections 
over approximately 2-5 minutes and repeated according to standard practice or phys i-
cian choice up to a maximum of five times (1000 mg) within the first two weeks star t-
ing at baseline. A cumulative dose of 1000 mg is recommended. The cumulative dose 
of iron sucrose should be specified and documented at baseline.

Confidential    Page 31 of 53 No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued. 
The subjects must be observed  for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after 
trial drug administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following compl e-
tion of each administration.  
Details of administration and storage of iron isomaltoside and iron sucrose are further d e-
scribed in the Drug Handling Plan.  
10.3 Dose Rationale 
In the present trial, subjects will be given a cumulative dose of 1000 mg iron isomaltoside 
administered as a single infusion. Justification for this single dose regime is found in recent 
safety data. Up to 31 December 2015, more than 1700 patients have been treated with iron 
isomaltoside including bolus injections and high single dose infusions up to 2500 mg admini s-
tered over 2 minutes for bolus injections and 15-60 minutes for infusions without a test dose. 
No safety concerns were found with these single dose levels.  
In this trial we have included single doses of 1000 mg iron isomaltoside in order to elucidate 
the safety and effect of high doses of iron isomaltoside since higher dosing would result in 
better compliance and increased convenience due to fewer visits necessary to make the su b-
jects iron replete. 
In the majority of the trials with iron isomaltoside, single dose infusions of up to 1000 mg 
have been administered over 15 minutes. There is no apparent indication that there are any 
specific safety concerns related to this speed of administration of iron isomaltoside. In the 
present trial, iron isomaltoside will be administered over 20 minutes. 
10.4 Side Effects of Iron Isomaltoside 
Side effect for iron isomaltoside is described in Investigator's Brochure (current version). 
10.5 Side Effects of Iron Sucrose  
Side effects for iron sucrose are described in Venofer® prescribing information (USA), 
01/2014, local SmPC, or local product monography. 
10.6 Preparation, Handling, and Labelling 
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will be responsible for preparation and packaging of all 
trial medication. No trial product will be used after its expiry date. The contents of the label 
will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 
Details of administration and storage of iron isomaltoside and iron sucrose are further d e-
scribed in the Drug Handling Plan.  
10.7 Handling and Storage 
The investigational product must be dispensed or administered according to procedures d e-
scribed herein. Only subjects enrolled in the trial may receive the investigational product, and 
it must be administered in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. Only a u-
thorised site staff may supply or administer the investigational product. All investigational

ments. 
10.8 Product Accountability 
The PI is responsible for investigational product accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance throughout the course of the trial in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The responsible person(s) will document the amount of investigational products received from 
and returned to Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee, and the amount supplied and/or admini s-
tered to subjects. 
11 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND N ON-DRUG 
THERAPIES  
11.1 Permitted Medications 
Throughout the trial, the subject may take any concomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed in Section 11.2. Any 
concomitant medications administered while the subject is participating in the trial must be 
recorded on the source document and transcribed into the concomitant medication form.  
ESA may be administered to the subjects but must be kept stabile (+/- 20 %) from 4 weeks 
before entering the trial and during the trial. 
11.2 Prohibited Medications and Non-drug Therapies 
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued. 
The following medication and non-drug therapy are not allowed during the trial period since 
they could potentially have an impact on the endpoints: 
 Any iron supplementation other than investigational drug (nutritional supplementation 
including iron is allowed unless it is assumed as treatment of the subject's anaemia) 
 Blood transfusion 
12 ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined in the ICH-GCP guideline as “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not ne c-
essarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). An AE can therefore be 
any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A clin-
ically significant abnormal laboratory finding is also regarded as an AE if the effect is unf a-
vourable for the subject. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review the laboratory test

Protocol Version: 4.0 (amendment 3)  
Date of Document :  14 June 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 33 of 53 results and determine whether an abnormal laboratory value is clinically significant. In gen-
eral, a clinically significant laboratory value which suggests disease progression and/or r e-
quires active management is considered as an AE. Clinical significant efficacy laboratory p a-
rameters (including related parameters) are not to be recorded as AEs unless these are consid-
ered lack of efficacy or overdose.     
Clinical significant findings in physical examinations and ECGs are to be recorded as medical 
history if they are observed at baseline. Otherwise they should be recorded as AEs.  
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (e.g. cancer or diabetes) must also be recorded 
as an AE (e.g. if there is an increase in severity, frequency, duration of the condition or wor s-
ening of outcome). Pre-planned procedures and pre-existing medical conditions (planned or 
present at the time of signing the ICF) that have not worsened are not considered AEs. These 
are recorded on the medical history pages of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
12.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that  
 is fatal 
 is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalisation (a min i-
mum of an overnight stay in a health care facility) 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is a medically important event or reaction 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but might jeopardise the subject or might 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
If the above interventions are performed as standard of care and not associated with an AE, 
the health issue for which the intervention is being performed will not be considered an SAE. 
If there is a complication as a result of the procedure and the complication meets at least 1 
serious criterion, that complication would be reported as an SAE. 
12.3 Definition of an Adverse Drug Reaction 
An adverse drug reaction ( ADR) is an AE that is judged by the Investigator or Pharmacosmos 
A/S to be “related” or “possible related” to the trial drug (see classification of relatedness in 
Section 12.4).  
If the ADR fulfils at least 1 of the criterion for an SAE, it is considered a serious adverse rea c-
tion (SAR). If the SAR is not listed as an expected side effect for iron isomaltoside [Monofer® 
Investigator’s Brochure, current version] or for iron sucrose [Venofer® prescribing info r-
mation (USA), 0 1/2014, local SmPC, or local product monography], it is considered a sus-
pected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR).  
It is the responsibility of Pharmacosmos A/S to evaluate the SARs for expectedness.

Confidential    Page 34 of 53 12.4 Collection of Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in Section 12.1) observed 
by the Investigator or reported by the subject are properly collected and recorded in the sub-
ject’s medical record as well as in the AE pages of the e CRF. 
Screen failures : All SAEs will be reported in the eCRF from the time a subject has signed the 
ICF and until he/she exits the trial.  Non-serious AEs occurring in subjects who are never 
treated with the trial drug will not be collected.  
Randomised subjects : From the time a subject has signed the ICF and until he/she exits the 
trial, all AEs/SAEs will be reported in the eCRF. AEs/SAEs occurring before administration 
of the trial drug are considered as non-treatment emergent, and those occurring after admin-
istration of the trial drug are considered as treatment emergent.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the trial because of an AE, this information must 
be included in the final visit form. 
An AE should be described in the following manner: The nature of the event will be described 
in precise, standard medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by the sub-
ject). If known, a specific diagnosis should be stated. Furthermore, the Investigator should 
describe an AE regarding seriousness (see Section 12.2), severity, relatedness, action taken, 
and outcome.  
Severity 
 Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal 
functioning level, but may be an annoyance 
 Moderate: The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to 
health, but is uncomfortable and/or an embarrassment 
 Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and 
is a hazard to the subject 
Relatedness 
 Related: The AE is related to the medicinal product  
 Possible related: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
 Unlikely related: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the medi c-
inal product 
 Not related: No relatedness to the medicinal product 
The categories "related" and "possible related" will be classified as related AEs and the cat e-
gories "unlikely related" and "not related" will be classified as unrelated AEs in the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
Outcome 
 Recovered/resolved: Complete clinical recovery without any sequel attributable to the 
event as per Investigator’s discretion 
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Complete clinical recovery but with one or more 
sequels attributable to the event as per Investigator’s discretion

Confidential    Page 35 of 53  R
ecovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to r e-
cove
r from the event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed 
the trial 
 Not recovered/not resolved: The subject’s condition has not improved and the symp-
toms ar
e unchanged 
 Fatal 
 Unknown: The subject’s condition is unknown. This term should only be used when 
no other de
finition is possible e.g. the subject is lost to follow-up 
For 
the purpose of medical management, all AEs and laboratory abnormalities that occur du r-
ing the trial must be evaluated by the Investigator. Each of these will be followed to satisfa c-
tory clinical resolution. Insofar as possible, all AEs should be followed-up to determine the 
final outcome of the event. The Investigator must follow-up all subjects with SAEs until the 
event has subsided (or disappeared), the condition has stabilised, the event is otherwise e x-
plained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
12.5 Reporting of SAEs 
The 
Investigator must report all SAEs promptly and within 24 hours to Drug Safety at Pha r-
macosmos A/S after obtaining knowledge of the event.  
The Investigator should report the SAEs by filling out the SAE form and report to Pharm a-
cosmos A/S either by e-mail at pv@pharmacosmos.com or fax number +45 5948 6082 .

After the initial SAE report, the Investigator is required, proactively, to provide further info r-
mation reg
arding the subject’s condition. All follow-up information must be forwarded to 
Pharmacosmos A/S as it becomes available.  
For all AEs with fatal outcome, autopsy reports (if available) and relevant medical reports 
should be reported to  Pharmacosmos A/S, as described above.  
SAEs oc
curring after trial termination must be reported if considered related to the trial trea t-
ment. 
Pharma
cosmos A/S will report SUSARs to the Competent Authorities within 7 calendar days 
for fatal and life threatening SUSARs and follow-up information within the next 8 calendar 
days. All other SUSARs are submitted as soon as possible within 15 calendar days and rel e-
vant follow-up information is subsequently communicated as soon as possible.  
Pharmacosmos A/S will inform any SUSARs to all PI(s) within 15 calendar days by circula t-
ing the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS-I) form.  
All SAEs 
including expected SARs will be reported by Pharmacosmos A/S to the Competent 
Authorities by the annually Development Safety Update Report. 
In addition, 6-monthly safety reports will be prepared by Pharmacosmos A/S and submitted to 
the Inv
estigators for information.

Subjects who become pregnant during the trial should continue the trial but cannot receive 
more trial drug. Thus, the subjects may attend visit 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the trial, they will be required to inform the Investigator 
about the pregnancy, delivery, and the health of the infant until 1 month of age. The Investig a-
tor must report the pregnancy and follow-up within 14 calendar days of obtaining the info r-
mation. Pregnancy complications must be recorded as an AE. If the infant has a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, this must be reported and followed up as an SAE. 
The site will send a copy of the pregnancy form to Pharmacosmos A/S within 1 working day 
to Drug Safety, contact details in Section 12.5. 
14 OVERDOSE 
Overdose may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites eventually leading to haemoside r-
osis. Monitoring of iron parameters such as s-ferritin may assist in recognising iron accumul a-
tion. Supportive measures such as chelating agents can be used. 
An overdose must be reported as an AE. 
15 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
15.1 Hypotheses 
The co-primary endpoints are treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hyperse n-
sitivity AEs and change in Hb from baseline to week 8.  
The following hypotheses will be tested: 
Safety: 
The incidence of treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs 
in the iron isomaltoside treatment group is less than 3 %. 
H01: πiron isomaltoside ≥ 3 % 
against the alternative: 
HA1: πiron isomaltoside < 3 %, 
where, π iron isomaltoside denote the incidence of treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-
serious hypersensitivity AEs.  
The null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative by constructing an unadjusted two-
sided exact 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the incidence. 
Efficacy: 
H02: µiron isomaltoside - µiron sucrose ≤ -0.5 g/dL 
against the alternative: 
HA2: µiron isomaltoside - µiron sucrose > -0.5 g/dL, 
where, µ iron isomaltoside and µiron sucrose denote the change from baseline to week 8 in Hb.

Confidential    Page 37 of 53 The null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative by constructing a two-sided 95 % CI 
of the difference in change in Hb, deducted at week 8 from a mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM). 
15.2 Sample Size Determination 
Safety: 
Data from previous trials conducted with iron isomaltoside suggests that the incidence of 
treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs for an IDA popu-
lation can be expected to be approximately 1 % (IBD-01/IBD-02/CIA-01/PP-01: n=3/341=0.9 
%, 95% CI: 0.2 %; 2.5 %). And similar for iron sucrose (CKD-03: n=1/114=0.9 %, 95% CI: 
0.0 %; 4.8 %). A common incidence of 1.5 % will be assumed for the current trial. 
As these are relatively rare events, an incidence of 0 % for placebo is assumed. Iron isomalto-
side should be at most 50 % worse than the difference between iron sucrose and placebo, co r-
responding to a maximum relative risk of 2 (1.5 %/(1.5 %-0 %)2). 
This trial will primarily assess the risk of the test drug under investigation. Arguing back from 
a relative risk of 2, gives that the upper bound of the 95 % CI for the incidence of treatment-
emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs should be at most 3 % 
(2×1.5 %) for the iron isomaltoside treatment group. 
Efficacy: 
IDA-301 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to compare the safety and eff i-
cacy of 1000 mg IV ferumoxytol to placebo. In this trial, 608 subjects were treated with fe r-
umoxytol and 200 received placebo. The change in Hb from baseline to week 5 was the pr i-
mary efficacy endpoint for the European Union regulators, and one of the secondary en d-
points for U.S. regulators. The mean change was 2.6 g/dL (standard deviation (SD): 1.5) for 
IV ferumoxytol and 0.1 g/dL (SD: 0.9) for placebo. The estimated treated effect of IV fe r-
umoxytol (i.e. the difference between ferumoxytol and placebo) was estimated to be approx i-
mately 2.5 g/dL with a 95 % CI ranging from 2.3 to 2.7 g/dL. The point estimate will be used 
as estimate of the treatment effect. Preserving 80 % of this effect is believed to provide re a-
sonable assurance that iron isomaltoside is efficacious. Hence, the non-inferiority margin is 
set to (1-0.8) × 2.5 g/dL ~ 0.5 g/dL. 
Power: 
The significance level is set to 5 %. With n = 1000 in the iron isomaltoside treatment group, 
there is 88 % power for demonstrating that the upper bound of the 95 % CI of the incidence of 
treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs is less than 3 %. 
And with n = 500 in the iron sucrose treatment group, assuming no difference between the 
treatment groups, and assuming a common SD = 1.5 g/dL, there is 100 % power for demon-
strating non-inferiority of the change in Hb from baseline to week 8, using a non-inferiority 
margin of -0.5 g/dL.  
This yields a total power for demonstrating both co-primary endpoints of 88 %. 
The IDA-03  trial will run in parallel with this trial and the sample size is the same, yielding a 
total of 2000 subjects to be treated with iron isomaltoside and 1000 with iron sucrose. In add i-
tion to the efficacy and safety analyses performed for this trial alone, an efficacy and safety

15.6. 
15.3 Data Analysis Sets 
The following data analysis sets will be used in the analyses of the data: 
Intention to treat (ITT) analysis set: The ITT analysis set will include all randomised subjects. 
Subjects will be included as randomised. This will be the primary analysis set for evaluating 
efficacy. 
Safety analysis set: The safety analysis set will include all randomised subjects who received 
at least one dose of the trial drug. This will be the analysis set for evaluating safety. 
Full analysis set (FAS): The FAS will consist of all randomised subjects, received at least one 
dose of the trial drug, and have at least one post baseline Hb assessment. Subjects will be in-
cluded as randomised. 
Per protocol (PP) analysis set: The PP analysis set will include all subjects in the FAS who do 
not have any major protocol deviation of clinical or statistical significance. Major protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 17.3. 
The classification of the subjects will be performed before database lock. 
15.4 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be performed.  
15.5 Key Elements of the Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses will be described in detail in a statistical analyses plan. 
15.5.1 Safety Analyses 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) current 
version. An AE will be regarded as treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) if it occurs after admin-
istration of randomised treatment. Related or possible related AE’s are defined as ADRs. 
Treatment emergent AEs will be summary tabulated by body system and preferred term ind i-
cating number and percentage of subjects and number of events. Number of subjects who e x-
perience an ADR including SUSARs will be compared between treatment groups.  
The following AE listings will be made as a minimum: 
 Non-treatment emergent AEs (defined as AEs collected before dosing including AEs 
reported for subjects never exposed to trial drug) in randomised subjects 
 Treatment emergent AEs (non-serious and serious) in randomised subjects 
 Treatment emergent SAEs in randomised subjects 
 SAEs in non -randomised subjects 
 ADRs 
 AEs leading to dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment 
 Fatal SAEs 
 Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions

15.5.1.1 Primary Analysis 
The co-primary safety endpoint is treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious h y-
persensitivity AEs. The SMQs/preferred terms are listed in Appendix A. 
An exact two-sided 95 % CI of the incidence of treatment-emergent serious and/or severe 
non-serious hypersensitivity AEs in the iron isomaltoside treatment group will be constructed. 
If the upper bound of the 95 % CI is <3 %, the safety objective has been met. 
In addition, as supportive information, the risk difference between iron isomaltoside and iron 
sucrose will be assessed by constructing a 95 % CI of the risk difference. Both an unadjusted 
CI (with continuity correction), and a CI adjusted for strata using the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel method will be produced. 
15.5.1.2 Secondary Analyses 
The incidence of composite cardiovascular safety AEs will be tabulated and compared b e-
tween the treatment groups by a Fisher’s exact test. 
The time to first composite cardiovascular safety AEs will be presented by a Kaplan-Meier 
plot, and the treatment groups will be compared by a log-rank test. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, ADR, and SARs will be tabulated and co m-
pared between the treatment groups by a Fisher’s Exact Test. 
15.5.1.3 Additional Safety Analyses 
Vital signs, ECG, and standard laboratory data will be presented by descriptive statistics. The 
incidence of treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant laboratory and vital sign 
values will be tabulated. 
Physical examination will be tabulated (by body system) as described for categorical data 
above.  
15.5.2 Efficacy Analyses 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML)-based MMRM approach. All subjects in the ITT with post baseline Hb data will be 
included with their observed data. For subjects without post baseline Hb values will have 
change from baseline set to 0 at the first post-baseline visit. The model will include the fixed, 
categorical effects of treatment (iron isomaltoside and iron sucrose), week, treatment- by-week 
interaction, strata, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline Hb value and bas e-
line Hb-by-week interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the 
within-subject errors. If, unexpectedly, this analysis fails to converge, the following structures 
will be applied, in the following order; first-order ante-dependence, heterogeneous compound 
symmetry, compound symmetry. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate 
the denominator degrees of freedom. The primary comparisons will be the contrasts between 
iron isomaltoside and iron sucrose at week 8 based on the least squares means for the trea t-
ment-by-week interaction effect. The estimated mean difference based on this model will be 
reported with two-sided symmetric 95 % CI, and if the lower bound of the 95 % CI is > -0.5 
g/dL, the efficacy objective has been met. If the lower bound of the two-sided 95 % CI is > 0 
g/dL superiority will be declared, and the p-value for the test of superiority will be presented. 
As sensitivity, the analysis above will be repeated for the FAS and PP analysis sets.

Confidential    Page 40 of 53 Some level of data missingness is expected, and the primary analysis (MMRM) is valid under 
the assumption that the data is Missing at Random (MAR). Simulation trials do suggest that 
MMRM is robust to accommodate some level of data Missing Not at Random. Since it is un-
clear how the level of missingness of this type of data will influence the outcome at this stage, 
choosing a pre-specified primary analysis valid under MNAR accurately will be very difficult. 
As such, sensitivity analyses valid under relevant cases of data MNAR will be performed. In 
particular, pattern-mixture models will be used. Different delta (imputation of how much 
worse response subjects who discontinue would have compared to those who complete the 
trial and who have the same profile up to time to withdrawal) will be applied as described by 
C. H. Mallinckrodt, Q. Lin, and G. Molenberghs [Mallinckrodt et al., 2012]. These analyses 
will be performed for the ITT, FAS, and PP analysis sets.  
The proportion of subjects with an Hb increase of ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline to any time from 
week 1 to week 8 will be compared between treatment groups using a logistic regression 
model with treatment and strata as fixed effects. Subjects without post baseline Hb values will 
be set as failures. The estimated treatment ratio of iron isomaltoside versus iron sucrose will 
be presented with 95 % CIs and corresponding p-value. 
Time to change in Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL will be presented by a Kaplan-Meier plot, and the 
treatment groups will be compared by a log-rank test. Subjects without post baseline Hb va l-
ues will be set as censored at day 0. 
The proportion of subjects who achieve Hb level of > 12 g/dL at any time from week 1 to 
week 8, the proportion of subjects who achieve an increase in Hb concentration ≥ 2 g/dL at 
any time from week 1 to week 8, and the proportion of subjects who achieve serum ( s-) ferri-
tin level of ≥ 100 ng/mL and TSAT of 20-50 % at any time from week 1 to week 8 will be 
analysed by a logistic regression model similar to above. Subjects without Hb values at week 
1-8 will be set as failures. 
The change in concentrations of Hb to weeks 1, 2, and 4, and change in s-ferritin, TSAT, and 
s-iron from baseline to weeks 1, 2, and 8, and change in fatigue symptoms (FACIT) will be 
estimated by MMRM models similar to the one described for the co-primary efficacy end-
point. 
Pharmacoeconomics will be assessed by the ISDR questionnaire and health care resource use 
questionnaire and summarised descriptively.  
15.6 Combined Analysis of IDA-03 and CKD-04 
The two trials IDA-03 and CKD-04 will run in parallel. With n=1000 treated with iron iso-
maltoside and n=500 treated with iron sucrose, each trial is powered to show that the inc i-
dence of serious and/or severe hypersensitivity AEs in the iron isomaltoside group is less than 
3 % and, with a non-inferiority margin of -0.5 g/dL, to demonstrate non-inferiority of iron 
isomaltoside versus iron sucrose for change in Hb to week 8. 
Pooled analyses will be performed of the two trials.  
For safety, in addition to estimating the absolute risk (incidence and 95 % CI) of iron iso-
maltoside, a non-inferiority analysis will be performed of iron isomaltoside versus iron su-
crose. For iron sucrose, a similar rate of 1.5 % will be assumed. As iron isomaltoside should 
be no worse than 3 %, the non-inferiority margin will be set to 1.5 % points. The non-
inferiority assessment will be performed by estimation of the risk difference and the associa t-
ed 95 % CI , adjusting for trial using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method.

Confidential    Page 41 of 53 With a total of 2000 subjects treated with iron isomaltoside, and 1000 subjects treated with 
iron sucrose, assuming common incidences of 1.5 %, and using a significance level of 5 %, 
the power to demonstrate non-inferiority is 87 %. 
As sensitivity, the incidence will be estimated from a Kaplan-Meier curve of time to serious 
and/or severe hypersensitivity AEs. The log-log transformation will be used to estimate the 
standard errors for each treatment group, and the 95 % CI will be constructed by pooling these 
standard errors. 
For efficacy, the same non-inferiority assessment as in the individual trials will be performed, 
including the specified sensitivity analyses. A similar MMRM model as for the individual 
trials will be applied, with trial added as fixed factor. The power for demonstrating efficacy is 
100 %. 
Hence, with a total of 2000 subjects treated with iron isomaltoside, and 1000 subjects treated 
with iron sucrose, the combined power of demonstrating the two primary endpoints is 87 %. 
Similar to the individual trials, if the upper bound of two -sided 95 % CI of the risk difference 
(iron isomaltoside - iron sucrose) < 0 for the incidence of serious and/or severe hypersensitiv i-
ty, or the lower bound of two-sided 95 % CI of the mean difference (iron isomaltoside - iron 
sucrose) in change in Hb from baseline to week 8 is 0 g/dL superiority will be declared, and 
the p-values for the test of superiority will be presented. 
The CSR can be finalised without the combined analysis, which will be done when both trials 
are finalised. The combined analysis will be included as an appendix to the CSR.  
16 DATA MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION  
16.1 Definition of Source Data 
Source data is defined as all information in original records or certified copies of original re c-
ords of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for recon-
struction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original

Pharmacosmos A/S, Contract Research Organizations, IRB/IEC, Competent Authorities, and 
other national authorities (e.g. Data Protection Agency) for the purpose of verification of 
available data. 
If an audit or inspection occurs, the PI and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector d i-
rect access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff 
to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
18.3 Trial and Site Closure 
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the site or trial, the CRA will conduct site 
closure activities with the PI or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with applicable regul a-
tions, ICH-GCP guidelines, and Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee’s procedures.  
18.4 Records Retention 
Following closure of the trial, the PI must maintain all site trial records in a safe and secure 
location mutually agreeable to the PI, Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee. The records must be

Confidential    Page 44 of 53 maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when needed (e.g. audit or inspection) and, 
whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction with assessment of 
the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by local laws/regulations or inst i-
tutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format other than hard 
copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, and electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before 
such action is taken. The PI must assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and 
accurate copy of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re-
generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the PI must ensure there is an acceptable 
back-up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for mak-
ing these reproductions. 
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will inform the PI of the time period for retaining these 
records to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time 
will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the trial, as dictated by any institu-
tional requirements, local laws or regulations, or Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee standard 
procedures; otherwise the retention period will by default be 15 years.  
The PI must notify Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee of any changes in the archival a r-
rangements, including, but not limited to, the following: archival at an off-site facility and 
transfer of ownership of the records if the PI leaves the site.  
18.5 Provision of Trial Results and Information to Principa l Investigators 
When the CSR is completed, Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will provide the PI with a 
summary of the trial results. The PI is encouraged to share the summary results with the sub-
jects, as appropriate. In addition, the PI will be given reasonable access to review the relevant 
statistical tables, figures, and reports and will be able to review the results for the entire trial at 
a Pharmacosmos A/S site or other mutually agreeable location. 
18.6 Finance and Insurance 
All agreements between the PI and Pharmacosmos A/S or designee must be signed prior to 
screening of the first subject in the clinical trial. The agreement must clearly state the rights 
and obligations of the parties concerned and include a detailed financial settlement. 
Every subject participating in the trial will be insured in accordance with the local legal r e-
quirements against trial related injuries to health, which may occur during the trial.  
Excluded from this, however, are injuries to health and deteriorations of illnesses already in 
existence which would have occurred or continued to exist even if the subject had not taken 
part in the clinical trial. 
The insurance cover is jeopardised if the subject fails to report immediately to the PI or r e-
sponsible physician any injury to health, which might have resulted from participation in the 
clinical trial, or if the subject undergoes any other medical treatment without their consent 
before the clinical trial has been completely finished, insofar as the individual subject is con-
cerned. 
The subject insurance will be arranged by Pharmacosmos A/S on the basis of the final trial 
protocol.

treatment of heart failure 
 
6. Arrhythmia will be defined as any symptomatic deviation from normal sinus rhythm exp e-
rienced by the subject that results in an evaluation by a health care provider. The evaluation 
may include a physical exam during an outpatient visit, an ECG, or a hospital admission. A r-
rhythmias may include any conduction abnormality, atrioventricular heart block, prolongation 
of QTc interval, supraventricular/nodal arrhythmia, vasovagal episode, ventricular arrhyth-
mia, or other cardiovascular arrhythmia. 
 
7. Hypertension

(an increase in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg that results in a value > 180 mm 
Hg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg that results in a value > 105 
mm Hg)

 During the observation period immediately following trial drug administration, hypo-
tension will be defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg that r e-
sults in a value < 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg that 
results in a value < 50 mm Hg. 
 Following the release of a subject from the trial visit during which they are receiving 
medication, hypotension will be defined as requiring an unscheduled outpatient health 
care visit, a hospital admission, or a change in medical therapy (e.g. fluid/volume r e-
pletion, holding of antihypertensives) in conjunction with the objective criteria, a de c-
rement in blood pressure (a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg that r e-
sults in a value < 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg that 
results in a value < 50 mm Hg).

The risk of cardiovascular event is calculated based upon the Framingham model [Wilson et 
al., 1998]. A risk of cardiovascular event < 10 % is categorised as low risk (group 1), a risk 
between 10-20 % is categorised as intermediate risk (group 2), and a risk of > 20 % is catego-
rised as a high risk (group 3).

STUDY INDICATION: CHRONIC PAINFUL DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY  
 
The study indication to be evaluated in this study is the relief of chronic foot pain arising 
from diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  
 
STATISTICS  
 
Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chronic diseases and a leading cause 
of adult disability in the U.S. Of the over 100 known types of neuropathy, diabetic 
neuropathy represents over a third of all neuropathies, making diabetes the leading 
cause of peripheral neuropathy. Due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, there are 
now about 15-18 million Americans with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, about 60% to 
70% of the 25.8 million adults and children in the U.S. with diabetes. U.S. ( Source: The 
Neuropathy Association). In addition, there are 79 million individuals in the U.S. with pre-
diabetes who are at risk for developing diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( Source: The 
Center for Disease Control ). 
 
Living with neuropathy can cause tremendous frustration and social isolation for 
patients. The daily chronic pain impacts day -to-day functionality resulting in physical and 
psychological problems including impaired concentration, anxiety, depression, a decline 
in cognitive abilities, and sleep difficulties which in turn can lead to irritability and 
increased pain sensitivity. 
Additionally, the economic burden from medical costs and workplace productivity losses 
are high and on the rise as the incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases. 
Neuropathic pain patients are often high health care system users as they seek relief 
from persistent suffering. Those debilitated by neuropathy or coping with chronic pain 
are challenged with working full -time and may become unemployable or stay under -
employed. 
 
DESCRIPTION & DEFINITION  
 Peripheral neuropathy describes damage to the peripheral nervous system, the vast communications network that transmits information from the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to every other part of the body. Peripheral nerves also send 
sensory information back to the brain and spinal cord, such as a message that the feet 
are cold, or a finger is burned. Damage to the peripheral nervous system interferes with 
these vital connections, distorting and sometimes interrupting messages between the brain and the rest of the body.  
 
 Classification of the Peripheral Neuropathies  
 More than 100 types of peripheral neuropathy have been identified, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms, pattern of development and prognosis. Specific i mpaired 
function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves - motor, sensory, or autonomic - 
that are damaged:  
• Motor nerves  control movements of all muscles under conscious control, such as 
those used for walking, grasping things, or talking 
ERCHONIA® EVRL OTC™ DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY FOOT PAIN PILOT STUDY: 
Study Protocol  
 
Version 1.0    Page 14 April 28th, 2021  
   • Sensory nerves  transmit information about sensory experiences, such as the feeling 
of a light touch or the pain resulting from a cut.  
• Autonomic nerves  regulate biological activities that people do not control consciously, 
such as breathing, digesting food, and heart and gland functions.  
 
 Forms of Neuropathy  
 
• Mononeuropathies : Neuropathies that involve damage to only one nerve. 
• Polyneuropathies : Neuropathies that involve  multiple nerves affecting all limbs. 
• Mononeuritis multiplex : Less commonly, neuropathies wherein two or more 
isolated nerves in separate areas of the body are affected  
 Some neuropathies affect all three types of nerves, but most often, neuropathies primarily affect one or two types. Therefore, neuropathies may be further described as predominantly  motor neuropathy, predominantly sensory neuropathy, sensory -motor 
neuropathy, or autonomic neuropathy. 
  Acute versus Chronic Neuropathies  
 In acute neuropathies , such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, symptoms appear suddenly, 
progress rapidly, and resolve slowly as damaged nerves heal.   In chronic neuropathies , symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly. There may be 
periods of relief followed by relapse. A plateau stage may be reached where symptoms stay the same for months or years. Some chronic neuropathies worsen over time, but 
fatality from neuropathy is extremely rare unless complicated by other diseases. 
Occasionally, neuropathy is a symptom of another disorder.  
  Acquired peripheral neuropathies  
 
Peripheral neuropathy may be either acquired or inherited.  
  Acquired vs. inherited peripheral neuropathies  
 
• Acquired peripheral neuropathies  are grouped into three broad categories; those 
caused by:  
 systemic disease 
 trauma from external agents  
 infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue  
 
Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy  include: 
 physical injury (trauma) to a nerve  
 tumors  
 toxins  
 autoimmune responses  
 nutritional deficiencies  
 alcoholism  
 vascular and metabolic disorders  
 
ERCHONIA® EVRL OTC™ DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY FOOT PAIN PILOT STUDY: 
Study Protocol  
 
Version 1.0    Page 15 April 28th, 2021  
   • Inherited forms of peripheral neuropathy  are caused by inborn mistakes in the 
genetic code or by new genetic mutations. Depending on the genetic 
error/mutati on, inherited peripheral neuropathies can range from those with 
symptoms that begin in early adulthood and are minimal to more severe forms and 
symptoms/impairments that may begin in infancy or childhood. The most common 
inherited neuropathies are a group of disorders c ollectively referred to as Charcot-
Marie -Tooth disease that result from flaws in genes responsible for manufacturing 
neurons or the myelin sheath and are characterized by extreme weakening and wasting of muscles in the lower legs and feet, gait abnormalities, loss of tendon reflexes, and numbness in the lower limbs. 
  Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy  
 
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a chronic acquired form of nerve damage that can 
occur in individuals with diabetes. High blood sugar can injure nerve fibers 
throughout the body, but diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in the legs 
and feet.  
 
ETIOLOGY  
 The primary cause of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is damage to nerve fibers and blood vessels from prolonged exposure to high blood sugar (glucose). While the precise 
mechanism for this damage remains unclear, a combination of factors likely plays a role, 
including the complex interaction between nerves and blood vessels. High blood glucose interferes with the ability of the nerves to transmit signals and weakens the walls of the small blood vessels (capillaries) that supply the nerves with oxygen and nutrients.  
 Other factors that may contribute to diabetic neuropathy include: 
 
• Inflammation in the nerves  caused by an autoimmune response that occurs when the 
immune system mistakenly attacks part of the body as if it were a foreign organism. 
• Genetic factors  unrelated to diabetes that make some people more susceptible to 
nerve damage. 
• Smoking and alcohol abuse which damage both nerves and blood vessels and 
significantly increase the risk of infections.  
 
Risk factors  
Anyone with diabetes can develop neuropathy, but the following factors increase the risk 
of susceptibility to nerve damage: 
 
• Poor blood sugar control  is the greatest risk factor for every complication of diabetes, 
including nerve damage.  
• Duration of diabetes . The risk of diabetic neuropathy increases with increasing 
duration of diabetes, especially if there is also poo control of blood sugar. Peripheral 
neuropathy is most common in people who have had diabetes for at least 25 years. 
• Kidney disease. Diabetes can cause damage to the kidneys, which may increase the 
toxins in the blood and contribute to nerve damage. 
• Smoking narrows and hardens the arteries, reducing blood flow to the legs and feet, 
making it more difficult for wounds to heal and damages the integrity of the peripheral nerves.

   PRESENTATION AND SYMPTOMS 
 
 Early, primary symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  may include:  
 
• tingling, prickling, buzzing, pinching or burning feeling in the feet 
• pins and needles in the feet 
• sharp, jabbing, stabbing pains  
• cramps in the legs and feet 
• cold sensation 
• numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or changes in temperature, especially in 
the feet and toes  
 
Symptoms often worsen at night.  
 
 Progressive symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  may include:  
 
• Touch sensitivity: heightened and/or extreme sensitivity to touch such as the 
weight of sheets or clothes being painful, or heightened tingling or numbness in 
the toes, feet, legs, or hands  
• Muscle weakness :  difficulty walking or getting up from a chair, grabbing things or 
carrying things with the hands as a result of muscle weakness from nerve dam age 
• Balance problems: increased unsteadiness and incoordination when walking, 
occurring as the body adapts to changes brought on by muscle damage 
• Serious foot problems: such as ulcers, infections, deformities, and bone and joint 
pain 
 
 Complications : Diabetic neuropathy can cause numerous  serious complications. 
Among the most serious are the following two complications: 
 
• Loss of a limb: As nerve damage can cause lack of feeling in the feet, cuts and 
sores can go unnoticed and eventually become severely infected or ulcerated. The risk of infection is high because diabetes reduces blood flow to the feet. Infections that spread to the bone and cause tissue death (gangrene) may be impossible to treat and require amputation of a toe, foot or even the lower leg. 
More than half the non-traumatic lower limb amputations performed every year in 
the United States are due to diabetes. 
• Charcot joint: This occurs when a joint, usually in the foot, deteriorates because of nerve damage. Charcot joint is marked by loss of sensation, as well as swelling, instability and sometimes deformity in the joint itself.  
• Neuropathic pain is difficult to control and can seriously affect emotional well -
being and overall quality of life. Neuropathic pain is often worse at night, seriously 
disrupting sleep and adding to the emotional burden of sensory nerve damage.  
 
DIAGNOSIS  
 
Patients being evaluated for diabetic peripheral neuropathy will have already been clinically diagnosed with diabetes and/or be evaluated for and diagnosed with diabetes 
prior to the evaluation for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  
 Diabetic neuropathy is di agnosed by a qualified physician based on a thorough 
evaluation of the patient’s  symptoms, medical history and a physical exam  that includes 
ERCHONIA® EVRL OTC™ DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY FOOT PAIN PILOT STUDY: 
Study Protocol  
 
Version 1.0    Page 17 April 28th, 2021  
   assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, muscle strength and tone, tendon reflexes, 
and sensitivity to touch, position changes, temperature and vibration.  
A comprehensive foot exam assessing the skin, muscles, bones, circulation, and 
sensation of the feet is also performed as part of the diagnostic process.  
 Specific tests that may be conducted as part of the diagnostic process include: 
 
• Filament test. Sensitivity to touch may be tested using a soft nylon monofilament or 
via pin prick . The inabil ity to feel the filament on the f oot or the pin pri ck is a sign that 
sensation in those nerves  has been lost or diminished. 
• Tuning fork . A tuning fork is used for quantitative sensory testing to assess vibration 
and temperature change perception. 
• Nerve conduction studies or electromyography  are sometimes used to help determine 
the type and extent of nerve damage. Nerve conduction studies check the 
transmission of electrical current through a nerve. Electromyography evaluates how 
well muscles respond to electrical signals transmitted by nearby nerves. These tests 
are rarely needed to diagnose neuropathy.  
 
CURRENT THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC 
PAINFUL DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY    
 
Nerve pain from diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be severe, constant, and difficult to 
treat. As diabetic neuropathy is a many -faceted complication of diabetes, it is often best 
managed symptomatically with an array of drugs and/or treatments. In addition to 
optimal management of blood glucose levels (including a regimen of diet, exercise and 
medication), the following medications and therapies, and combinations therein, are 
used to assist in the management of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy symptoms:  
 
(i) Over -the-counter (OTC) pain relief options:  
• OTC NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs), such as  aspirin, ibuprofen 
(Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) reduce inflammation and relieve pain. A 
downside of NSAIDs is the potential for harmful side effects such as stomach 
irritation and bleeding, or even kidney and liver damage, with prolonged use, which 
may be more likely in people with diabetes.  
• Acetaminophen medications relieve diabetes nerve pain without reducing 
inflammation and do not cause the stomach irritation of NSAIDs, but there is a risk 
of liver damage with excessive use.  
• Capsaicin is found naturally in chili peppers or in drug stores under various brand 
names, including Capzasin-P and Zostrix. Capsaicin is believed to ease pain by 
reducing a chemical called substance P, which is involved in transmitting pain 
signals through the nerves. Effective on a short-term basis, there are concerns 
about long-term consequences such as prevention wound healing, which is most 
serious in patients with diabetes.  
• Lidocaine is an OTC and/or prescription gel or cream anesthetic that numbs the 
area of application. Some product names include Topicaine and Xylocaine. 
• Other topical creams  such as  salicylate, a chemical similar to aspirin found in pain-
relieving creams like Aspercreme and Bengay; cortisone creams containing 
corticosteroids, potent anti -inflammatory drugs that can help relieve pain. However, 
there is no clear evidence that either helps relieve nerve pain from peripheral 
neuropathy.

Study Protocol  
 
Version 1.0    Page 18 April 28th, 2021  
    
 
(ii) Prescription pain relief options:  
• Prescription NSAIDs  such as  Celebrex, Lodine, and Relafen. As with the OTC 
NSAIDs, people with diabetes are at greater risk of kidney damage that can occur 
with prescription NSAIDs, and at greater risk of heart disease which may also be 
elevated with prescription NSAID use. 
• Antidepressants , such as: 
 Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  that primarily affect the levels of the brain 
chemicals norepinephrine and serotonin, such as Elavil, Pamelor and 
Norpramin. Side effects vary between the three, but can include drowsiness, 
weight gain, dry mouth, and dry eyes. For people with peripheral neuropathy, 
there may be additional side effects such as the development of blood 
pressure, heart rate problems and dizziness.  
 Selective se rotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  that work by altering the 
amount of the brain chemical serotonin, but these are the least effective for 
pain management. 
 Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) , such as Effexor and 
Cymbalta, affect the levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and 
norepinephrine. They are quite effective for pain relief with fewer side effects 
than the SSRIs or TCAs. Cymbalta is FDA -approved for painful neuropathy.  
• Antiseizure drugs  that prevent epileptic seizures can also relieve neuropathic pain 
by controlling the abnormal firing of nerve cells. These drugs include:  
 Neurontin is most commonly used for nerve pain from peripheral neuropathy. 
Side effects include causing sedation or dizziness at higher doses.  
 Lyrica  is FDA -approved for painful neuropathy. The most common side effects 
are dizziness and sleepiness.  
• Opioid medicines  such as Ultram and Ultracet, are strong pain killers for when 
pain is very severe and immediate relief is needed. Ultram and Ultracet are FDA -
approved painkillers that contain tramadol, a weak opioid (morphine-like) 
substance. The drug also weakly affects the brain chemicals serotonin and 
norepinephrine, similar to antidepressants, which reduces the perception of pain.  
• Tramadol  is often used as a back-up for "breakthrough pain" - pain that suddenly, 
for no apparent reason, is worse. Tramadol is a good replacement for over -the-
counter medications at those times. However, strong narcotic opioid medications 
can cause severe constipation and have the potential for addiction.  
 
(iii) Additional and Alternative Treatment Options: 
• Injections of local anesthetics such as lidocaine - or patches containing lidocaine 
– can be used to numb the painful area for severe, intractable diabetes nerve 
pain. 
• Surgical destruction of nerves or to relieve a nerve compression that causes pain.  
• Implantation of a device that relieves pain.   
• Transcutaneous electrotherapy and percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are 
alternative therapies that provide electrical nerve stimulation wherein small amounts of electricity are used to block pain signals as they pass through the skin.  
• Hand or foot braces  to compensate for muscle weakness or to help relieve nerve 
compression. 
• Orthopedic shoes  to improve gait (walking) problems to will prevent foot injuries.

THEORY OF MECHANISM OF OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION OF LOW -LEVEL 
LASER THERAPY TO REDUCING PAIN   
 “Low -energy photon irradiation by low level laser light lasers or LED arrays has been 
found to modulate various biological processes in cell culture and animal models. This 
mechanism of photobiomodulation by LLLT lasers or LED arrays at the cellular level has 
been ascribed to the activation of mitochondrial respiratory chain components, resulting in initiation of a signaling cascade that promotes cellular proliferation and cytoprotection.”  
Source: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Mar18; 100(6): 3439 -44. 2003 Mar 07.  
 
When applied to injuries and lesions, low level laser light has been shown to stimulate 
healing and to reduce pain by accelerating the speed, quality and strength of tissue 
repair and the reduction of inflammation. Furthermore, laser therapy has been found to 
be particularly effective over other standard therapies in relieving pain and other 
symptoms associ ated with injuries as it impacts the complete system of targeted 
muscles, tendons, ligaments, connective tissue, bone, nerve, and dermal tissues.     
                       Lasers can strengthen damaged cells. Using photochemical processes, laser light 
inserts bio-photons into damaged cells. The cells begin to produce energy (ATP), which 
improves their function, assists their division, strengthens the body's immune system, 
and causes the secretion of various hormones. The tissues are healed, and pain diminishes . If damaged cells have died, the bio-photons help the division of neighboring 
cells, generating new tissues, and thus bring about healing.  
 
Therefore, LLLT promotes healing, regeneration and pain reduction through the 
following mechanisms:  
 1) increased cell membrane polarization and permeability  
2) increased ATP production and respiratory chain activity  
3) increased enzyme activity  
4) increased collagen and epithelial production  
5) increased capillary formation 6) increased macrophage (immune) activi ty 
7) analgesic effects due to elevated endorphin production, electrolytic nerve blockage, 
and improved blood and lymph flow  
8) anti -inflammatory effect due to improved circulation and accelerated tissue 
regeneration; and 9) increased production of antioxi dants.  
 
Of additional benefit is that light energy from low level lasers will only be absorbed by those cells and tissues that are not functioning normally and that need it. Soft laser light 
has no effect on healthy cells.  
 
The progressive process by which low level laser light aids in the production of ATP, 
consequentl y providing cells with more energy which in turn optimizes the cells’ 
condition to play their part in a natural healing and pain reduction process, is as follows:

Considering the general mechanism of operation of LLLT as explained above, it follows that LLLT provides relief from the foot pain from chronic diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
by:  
• penetrating the skin of the foot and the ligaments and tendons to increase the 
production of 
ATP and activate enzymes in the targeted cells of the tissue to promote healing of the 
tendons and ligaments  
   • cultivating a growth factor response within the cells and tissue of the foot as a result of 
the increased ATP production to promote new, healthier cell and tissue growth to strengthen and support ligaments  and tendons, to restore mechanical and sensory 
function, and to protect against further damage 
• The anti -inflammatory properties of low-level  lasers reduce nerve irritation and 
inflammation in the foot to provide pain relief

ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING LITERATURE  
 
 In vitro and in vivo optimization of infrared laser  treatment for injured peripheral 
nerves. 
Anders JJ, Moges H, Wu X, Erbele ID, Alberico SL, Saidu EK, Smith JT, Pryor BA. 
Lasers  Surg Med. 2014 Jan;46(1):34-45. 
 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Repair of peripheral  nerve injuries remains a major 
challenge in restorative medicine. Effective therapies that can be used in conjunction 
with surgical nerve repair to improve nerve regeneration and functional recovery are 
being actively investigated. It has been demonstrated by numerous  peer reviewed 
publications that photobiomodulation (PBM) supports nerve regeneration, reinnervation 
of the denervated muscle, and functional recovery after  peripheral  nerve injury. 
However, a key issue in the use of PBM as  a treatment for peripheral  nerve injury is the 
lack of parameter optimization for any given wavelength. The objective of this study was 
to demonstrate that for a selected wavelength effective in vitro dosing, parameters could 
be translated to effective in vivo parameters. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparison of infra-red (810 and 980 nm wavelengths) 
laser treatment parameters for injured peripheral nerves was done beginning with a 
series of in vitro experiments using primary human fibroblasts and primary rat cortical 
ERCHONIA® EVRL OTC™ DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY FOOT PAIN PILOT STUDY: 
Study Protocol  
 
Version 1.0    Page 22 April 28th, 2021  
   neurons. The primary rat cortical neurons were used for further optimization of energy 
density for 980 nm wavelength light using measurement of total neurite length as the 
bioassay. For these experiments, the parameters included a 1 W output power, power 
density of 10 mW/cm(2) , and energy densities of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 2, 10, 50, 200, 1,000, 
and 5,000 mJ/cm(2) . For translation of the in vitro data for use in vivo it was necessary 
to determine the transcutaneous penetration of 980 nm wavelength light to the level of 
the peroneal nerve. Two anesthetized, male White New Zealand rabbits were used for 
these experiments. The output power of the laser  was set at 1.0 or 4.0 W. Power density 
measurements were taken at the surface of the skin, sub-dermally, and at the level of 
the nerve. Laser parameters used in the in vivo studies were calculated based on data 
from the in vitro studies and the light penetration measurements. For the in vivo 
experiments, a total of 22 White New Zealand rabbits (2.34- 2.89 kg) were used. 
Translated dosing parameters were refined in a pilot study using a transection model of 
the peroneal nerve in rabbits. Output powers of 2 and 4 W were tested. For the final set 
of in vivo experiments, the same transection nerve injury model was used. An energy 
density of 10 mW/cm(2) at the level of the peroneal nerve was selected and 
the laser parameters were further refined. The dosing parameters used were: 1.5 W 
output power, 43 seconds exposure, 8 cm(2) area and a total energy of 65 J.  
 
RESULT S: In vitro, 980 nm wavelength light at 10 mW/cm(2) significantly improved 
neurite elongation at energy densities between 2 and 200 mJ/cm(2) . In vivo penetration 
of the infrared light measured in anesthetized rabbits showed that on average, 2.45% of 
the light applied to the skin reached the depth of the peroneal nerve. The in vivo pilot 
study data revealed that the 4 W parameters inhibited nerve regeneration while the 2 W 
parameters significantly improved axonal regrowth. For the final set of experiments, the 
irradiated group performed significantly better in the toe spread reflex test compared to 
the control group from week 7 post-injury, and the average length of motor endplates 
returned to uninjured levels.  
 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that treatment parameters can be 
determined initially using in vitro models and then translated to in vivo research and 
clinical practice. Furthermore, this study establishes that infrared light with 
optimized parameters promotes accelerated nerve regeneration and improved 
functional recovery in a surgically repaired peripheral nerve. PMID: 24338500 
 
 Evaluation of low level laser  therapy in reducing diabetic polyneuropathy 
related pain and sensorimotor disorders. 
Bashiri H.  
Acta Med Iran. 2013 Sep 9;51(8):543-7. 
 
Over the past three decades physicians have used light level laser therapy (LLLT) for 
the management and the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  and have obtained 
results that call for further investigations. This study aimed to investigate the 
effectiveness of LLLT in treatment of pain symptoms in patients with diabetic 
polyneuropathy. In this study 60 patients with diabetic  peripheral neuropathy were 
matched based on their sex, age, BMI, type of diabetes, duration of diabetes, and 
duration of pain, and randomized to case and control groups based on their established 
scores on the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Toronto clinical scoring system  (TCSS). 
Cases received laser therapy with wavelength of 78 nm and 2.5 j/cm2 two times a week, 
each time for 5 min, for one month. During the same period, controls received 
sham  laser therapy. Comparing the differences between the two groups' VAS and TCSS

   mean scores before the intervention with that of the 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the 
intervention, we were able to see a statistically significant difference between the two 
groups (P&lt;0.05). Laser therapy resulted in improved neuropathy outcomes in 
diabetic patients who received it relative to the group that received sham therapy, 
evaluating before and after LLLT assessments. Further studies are needed to test 
types of lasers, as well as different dosage and exposure levels required in different 
phase of neuropathic care, so as to obtain reproducible results.

 Effect of low -level laser  therapy (LLLT) on acute neural recovery and 
inflammation-related gene expression after crush injury in rat sciatic nerve. 
Alcântara CC, Gigo -Benato D, Salvini TF, Oliveira AL, Anders JJ, Russo TL. 
Lasers  Surg Med. 2013 Apr;45(4):246-52. 
 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peripheral  nerve function can be debilitated by 
different kinds of injury. Low -level  laser  therapy (LLLT) has been used successfully 
during rehabilitation to stimulate recovery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
effects of LLLT (660 nm, 60 J/cm(2) , 40 mW/cm(2) ) on acute sciatic nerve injury.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty Wistar male rats were divided into three groups: 
(1) Normal, intact nerves; (2) I3d, crushed nerves evaluated on Day -3 post-injury; (3) 
I + L3d, crushed nerves submitted to two sessions of LLLT and investigated at 3 days 
post-injury. Sciatic nerves were removed and processed for gene expression analysis 
(real-time PCR) of the pro-inflammatory factors TWEAK, Fn14 and TNF-α and 
extracellular matrix remodeling and axonal growth markers, such as TIMP -1, MMP -2, 
and MMP -9. Zymography was used to determine levels of MMP -2 and MMP-9 activity 
and Western blotting was used to evaluate TNF -α protein content. Shapiro-Wilk and 
Levene's tests were applied to evaluate data normality and homogeneity, respectively. 
One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test was used for statistical analysis with a 
significance level set at 5%. 
 
RESULTS: An increase in TNF-α protein level was found in I + L3 compared to Normal 
and I3d (P < 0.05). Zymography sho wed an increase in proMMP -9 activity, in both I3d 
and I + L3d groups (P < 0.05). The increase was more evident in I + L3d (P = 0.02 
compared to I3d). Active -MMP -9 isoform activity was increased in I + L3d compared to 
Normal and I3d groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the activity of active-MMP -2 isoform 
was increased in I3d and I + L3 (P < 0.05). An increase in TIMP -1 expression was 
observed in both I3d and I + L3d groups (P < 0.05). 
CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that LLLT increased MMPs activity, 
mainly MMP -9, and TNF-α protein level during the acute phase of nerve injury, 
modulating inflammation. Based on these results, it is recommended that LLLT 
should be started as soon as possible after peripheral nerve injury.

Version 1.0    Page 24 April 28th, 2021  
   The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of low -level  laser therapy (LLLT) on the 
regeneration of the sciatic nerve in rats following a complete nerve resection. Male 
Wistar rats were divided into a control injury group, injury groups irradiated with a 660-
nm laser at 10 or 50 J/cm(2), and injury groups irradiated with an 808-nm  laser at 10 or 
50 J/cm(2). Treatment began 24 h following nerve resection and continued for 15 days. 
Using the sciatic functional index (SFI), we show that the injured animals treated with 
660 nm at 10 and 50 J/cm(2) had better SFI values compared with the control injury and 
the 808-nm groups. Animals irradiated with the 808-nm  laser at 50 J/cm(2) show higher 
values for fiber density than do control animals. In addition, axon and fiber diameters 
were larger in animals irradiated with 660 nm at 50 J/cm(2) compared to the control 
group. These findings indicate that 660-nm LLLT is able to provide functional gait 
recovery and leads to increases in fiber diameter following sciatic nerve resection.

 Effects of 660 and 780 nm low -level laser  therapy on neuromuscular recovery 
after crush injury in rat sciatic nerve.

Lasers  Surg Med. 2010 Nov;42(9):673-82.  
 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic nerve repair is still a challenge for 
rehabilitation. It is particularly important to develop clinical protocols to enhance nerve 
regeneration. The present study investigated the effects of 660 and 780 nm low -level 
laser therapy (LLLT) using different energy densities (10, 60, and 120 J/cm²) on 
neuromuscular and functional recovery as well as on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 
activity after crush injury in rat sciatic nerve.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats received transcutaneous LLLT irradiation at the 
lesion site for 10 consecutive days post-injury and were sacrificed 28 days after injury. 
Both the sciatic nerve and tibialis anterior muscles were analyzed. Nerve analyses 
consisted of histology (light microscopy) and measurements of myelin, axon, and nerve 
fiber cross -sectional area (CSA). S -100 labeling was used to identify myelin sheath and 
Schwann cells. Muscle fiber CSA and zymography were carried out to assess the 
degree of muscle atrophy and MMP activity, respectively. Statistical significance was 
set at 5% (P≤0.05). 
 
RESULTS: Six hundred sixty nanometer LLLT either using 10 or 60 J/cm² restored 
muscle fiber, myelin and nerve fiber CSA compared to the normal group (N). 
Furthermore, it increased MMP -2 activity in nerve and decreased MMP -2 activity in 
muscle and MMP-9 activity in nerve. In contrast, 780 nm LLLT using 10 J/cm² 
decreased MMP -9 activity in nerve compared to the crush group (CR) and N; it also 
restored normal levels of myelin and nerve fiber CSA. Both 60 and 120 J/cm² decreased 
MMP -2 activity in muscle compared to CR and N. 780 nm did not prevent muscle fiber 
atrophy. Functional recovery in the irradiated groups did not differ from the non-
irradiated CR. 
 
CONCLUSION: Data suggest that 660 nm LLLT with low (10 J/cm²) or moderate 
(60 Jcm²) energy densities is able to accelerate neuromuscular recovery after 
nerve crush injury in rats.

    Chapter 25: Phototherapy in peripheral nerve injury: effects on muscle 
preservation and nerve regeneration. 
Rochkind S, Geuna S, Shainberg A. 
Int Rev Neurobiol. 2009;87:445-64.  
 
Post-traumatic nerve repair and prevention of muscle atrophy represent a major 
challenge of restorative medicine. Considerable interest exists in the potential 
therapeutic value of laser  phototherapy for restoring or temporarily preventing 
denervated muscle atrophy as well as enhancing regeneration of severely 
injured peripheral  nerves. Low-power  laser irradiation (laser  phototherapy) was applied 
for treatment of rat denervated muscle in order to estimate biochemical transformation 
on cellular and tissue levels, as well as on rat sciatic nerve model after crush injury, 
direct or side-to-end anastomosis, and neurotube reconstruction. Nerve cells' growth and 
axonal sprouting were investigated in embryonic rat brain cultures. The animal outcome 
allowed clinical double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study that measured the 
effectiveness of 780-nm  laser phototherapy on patients suffering from incomplete 
peripheral nerve injuries for  6 months up to several years. In denervated muscles, 
animal study suggests that the function of denervated muscles can be partially 
preserved by temporary prevention of denervation-induced biochemical changes. The 
function of denervated muscles can be restored, not completely but to a very substantial 
degree, by  laser treatment initiated at the earliest possible stage post injury. 
In peripheral nerve injury, laser  phototherapy has an immediate protective effect. 
It maintains functional activity of the injured nerve for a long period, decreases 
scar tissue formation at the injury site, decreases degeneration in corresponding 
motor neurons of the spinal cord, and significantly increases axonal growth and 
myelinization. In cell cultures, laser  irradiation accelerates migration, nerve cell 
growth, and fiber sprouting. In a pilot, clinical, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
randomized study in patients with incomplete long-term  peripheral  nerve injury, 780-nm 
laser irradiation can progressively improve peripheral  nerve function, which leads to 
significant functional recovery. A 780-nm  laser phototherapy temporarily preserves the 
function of a denervated muscle, and accelerates and enhances axonal growth and 
regeneration after peripheral  nerve injury or reconstructive procedures. Laser activation 
of nerve cells, their growth and axonal sprouting can be considered as potential 
treatment for neural injury. Animal and clinical studies show the promoting action of 
phototherapy on peripheral  nerve regeneration, which makes it possible to suggest that 
the time for broader clinical trials has come.

 Laser  phototherapy (780 nm), a new modality in treatment of long-term 
incomplete peripheral nerve injury: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 
study. 
Rochkind S1, Drory V, Alon M, Nissan M, Ouaknine GE.  
Photomed Laser Surg. 2007 Oct;25(5):436-42. 
 
OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted this pilot study to prospectively investigate the 
effectiveness of low -power  laser irradiation (780 nm) in the treatment of patients 
suffering from incomplete peripheral  nerve and brachial plexus injuries for 6 months up 
to several years. 
 
BACKGROUND DATA: Injury of a major nerve trunk frequently results in considerable

   disability associated with loss of sensory and motor functions. Spontaneous recovery of 
long-term severe incompl ete peripheral  nerve injury is often unsatisfactory. 
 
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on 18 
patients who were randomly assigned placebo (non-active light: diffused LED lamp) or 
low-power laser  irradiation (wavelength, 780 nm; power, 250 mW). Twenty -one 
consecutive daily sessions of laser or placebo irradiation were applied transcutaneously 
for 3 h to the injured peripheral nerve (energy density, 450 J/mm(2)) and for 2 h to the 
corresponding segments of the spinal cord (energy density, 300 J/mm(2)). Clinical and 
electrophysiological assessments were done at baseline, at the end of the 21 days of 
treatment, and 3 and 6 months thereafter. 
 
RESULTS: The laser-irradiated and placebo groups were in clinically similar conditions 
at baseline. The analysis of motor function during the 6-month follow -up period 
compared to baseline showed statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0001) in 
the laser-treated group compared to the placebo group. No statistically significant 
difference was found in sensory function. Electrophysiological analysis also showed 
statistically significant improvement in recruitment of voluntary muscle activity in 
the laser-irradiated group (p = 0.006), compared to the placebo group. 
 
CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that in patients with long-
term  peripheral nerve injury, noninvasive 780-nm  laser  phototherapy can 
progressively improve nerve function, which leads to significant functional 
recovery.

 Promotion of regenerative processes in injured peripheral nerve induced by 
low-level laser  therapy. 
Mohammed IF, Al-Mustawfi N, Kaka LN. 
Photomed Laser Surg. 2007 Apr;25(2):107-11. 
 
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess in vitro the influence of low-level  laser therapy 
(LLLT) on the regenerative processes of a peripheral nerve after trauma. 
 
BACKGROUND DATA: In peripheral  nerve injury initiated after severing due to 
accident or by a surgeon during operation, photomodulation by light in the red to near -
infrared range (530-1000 nm) using low -energy  lasers  has been shown to accelerate 
nerve regeneration.  
 
METHOD: Twenty -four New Zealand adult male rabbits were randomly assigned to two 
equal groups (control and laser-treated). General anesthesia was  administered 
intramuscularly, and exploration of the peroneal nerve was done in the lateral aspect of 
the left leg. Complete section of the nerve was performed, which was followed by 
suturing of the neural sheath (epineurium). Irradiation was carried out directly after the 
operation and for 10 consecutive days. The laser used was diode with wavelength of 
901 nm (impulsive) and power of 10 mW; it was a square-shaped window type (16 
cm(2)), and its energy was applied by direct contact of the instrument's window to the 
site of the operation. Three rabbits from each group were sacrificed at the end of weeks 
2, 4, 6, and 8, and specimens were collected from the site of nerve suturing and sent for 
histopathological examination.

Version 1.0    Page 27 April 28th, 2021  
   RESULTS: Two important factors were examined via histopathology: diameter of the 
nerve fibers and individual internodal length. Compared to the control group, 
significant variations in regeneration were observed, including thicker nerve 
fibers, more regular myelin layers, clearer nodes of Ranvier with absence of short 
nodes in the treated group. Variations between the two groups for diameter were 
significant for the 2(nd) week (p < 0.05), highly significant for the 4(th) and 6(th) weeks, 
respectively (p < 0.01), and very highly significant for the 8(th) week (p < 0.001). 
Variations between the two groups for internodal length were highly significant for the 
2(nd) and 4(th) weeks (p < 0.01), and very highly significant for the 6(th) and 8(th) 
weeks (p < 0.001). 
 
CONCLUSION: This experiment affirms the beneficial effect of LLLT on nerve 
regeneration, since LLLT produced a significant amount of structural and cellular 
change. The results of the present study suggest that laser therapy may be a viable 
approach for nerve regeneration, which may be of clinical relevance in scheduled 
surgery or microsurgery.

 STUDY RATIONALE & JUSTIFICATION 
 
The chronic pain of diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be debilitating, impacting the 
individual’s  day-to-day functionality that further leads to physical , cognitive, 
psychological , sleep and social impairments. Additionally, diabetic neuropathic pain 
patients are typically burdensome to the health care system , frequently seeking relief 
from the persistent pain. Many afflicted also suffer economically, as coping with the 
chronic pain of the condition may render them unemployable or under -employed. 
 
Current therapeutic approaches for managing the chronic pain of diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy  are primarily over-the-counter and prescription medications. However, in 
addition to their general limited effectiveness, many have harmful side effects with 
prolonged use such as stomach irritation and bleeding, kidney and liver damage, 
prevention of wound healing, elevated blood pressure and heart rate problems which 
can be both more likely to occur and more likely to pose serious implications for 
individuals wi th diabetes. Additional potential side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, 
weight gain, dry mouth, and dry eyes, as well as the potential for addiction with certain 
prescription medications. Non-medication alternatives are also of limited effectiveness 
and most, including injections of local anesthetics, surgical destruction of nerves, device 
implantation and transcutaneous electrotherapy and percutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation are costly, invasive and carry their owns set of potentially harmful and lasing 
side effects.    
 
Low level laser light therapy, such as that provided through application of the Erchonia® 
EVRL OTC ™ Laser as proposed in this study protocol, offers a simple, quick, non-
invasive, safe, effective and side-effect free option to reduce diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy pain. Prior trials with Erchonia low level lasers have demonstrated their 
efficacy in reducing chronic pain in various  clinically diagnosed chronic pain conditions, 
and in post- surgical pain, in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant manner, as 
is the treatment goal  being evaluated in the current clinical study .

   Specific Justification for the use of the Erchonia® EVRL OTC ™ device for  Over -the-
Counter  application to reduc e chronic  pain arising from diabetic peripheral neuropathy is 
found through the following FDA clearances for Erchonia® l ow level laser devices for 
chronic  pain reduction indications . Each device of which was considered a non-
significant risk ( NSR), and there were no reported side effects related to the device 
treatment(s). 
 1. K180197: Erchonia® FX -635: is indicated for the following two indications: 
a. as an adjunct to provide relief of minor chronic low back pain of musculoskeletal 
origin.  
b. as an adjunct to reducing chronic heel pain arising from plantar fasciitis. 
2. K132940: Erchonia® Allay™: is indicated as an adjunct to reducing chronic heel pain 
arising from plantar fasciitis.  
3. K072206: Erchonia® EML Laser: is indicated for the temporary reduction in post-
surgery pain at 24 hours after surgery following bilateral breast augmentation surgery.  
4. K041139: Erchonia® EML Laser : is indicated as an adjunct to liposuction procedures 
of the thighs, hips and stomach for reduction of pain associated with the recovery process.  
5. K012580:  Erchonia PL2000: is indicated for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief 
of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskel etal origin.  
6. K191257:  Erchonia® EVRL: is indicated while using the red and violet diode 
simultaneously, for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin. 
 
 
 
LLLT is as safe as it is effective, there are no known side effects of this form of light 
therapy. The only known potential adverse event associated with the use of laser 
devices is that long-term exposure to laser light could cause damage to eyesight. As a precaution, during all laser treatment administrations with the Erchonia® EVRL OTC the 
subject will wear safety glasses  that filter out the laser light spectrum. There are no other 
known potential adverse events from application of the study lasers. There have been no 
observed or reported adverse events or reactions to the application of the family of 
Erchonia® laser devices in several other studies using these laser devices.   Previous, Over the Counter (OTC) use of the Erchonia laser has been proven in a lay 
person (non -doctor) usability and efficacy clinical trial which received FDA OTC 
clearance under 510(k) # K162578 and K143007. In this clinical study the lay person 
was provided a device operational manual  for guidance on the treatment protocol and 
administration, no training was provided by the study sponsor.  
 
Results showed device operation by the lay persons achieved equal or greater 
circumference reduction (6.2”) compared to the device administration from a licensed 
physician (3.54”), in the previous prescription-based FDA study using the identical 
device. Thus, proving the l ay person’s  ability to safely and correctly administer the 
Erchonia laser treatment.

Following 3 weeks of study procedure administrations with the Erchonia® EVRL OTC™, 
the following will be recorded over phone call or videoconference with the investigator and subject as outlined in the STUDY TEST BATTERY section above. These recordings will form the study endpoint data set from which change from baseline will be evaluated with respect to assessing study outcome.  
 Numerical rating scale: Foot pain  
 Subject Satisfaction with  Study Outcome  
 Adverse Events Evaluation  
 
 
POST- TREATMENT EVLAUATION PHASE  
 
 WEEK 7: POST TREATMENT FOLLOWUP  
Four weeks following completion of the 3-week Treatment Phase (7 weeks after study 
onset), the following will be recorded over  phone call or  videoconference with the 
investigator and subject:  
 
 Numerical rating scale: Foot pain  
 Subject Satisfaction with Study Outcome  
 Adverse Events Evaluation  
  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 At any time throughout the duration of the clinical trial that is necessary, any and all 
potential adverse events reported by a subject will be reported to the investigator and will 
be recorded on the case report form, and subsequently evaluated by a suitably qualified independent reviewer for determination of relationship to the study treatment and whether

   or not any corrective action needs to be taken. All potential adverse events recorded will 
be appropriately reported to the governing IRB, as applicable.  
 It is unlikely and not expected that any adverse events will result from implementation of this clinical study protocol. Prior clinical trials using low level laser light have not typically yielded any adverse events or reactions. However, potential adverse events that may feasibly occur from application of the Erchonia® EVRL OTC ™ inc lude, but are not 
necessarily limited to: skin irritation, discoloring, rash, indentations and infection.  
 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 Records for each subject in this clinical study will be maintained in separate files in a locked filing cabinet at the Investigators  site. The investigator will be responsible for 
ensuring that all records for a subject pertaining to his or her participation in the clinical study are maintained in the subject’s file at all times other than when information is being recorded on them.   
 
Copies of all subject case report forms will be made and supplied to Regulatory Insight, Inc. Regulatory Insight, Inc. will  maintain these copies in a separate clinical study file that 
is kept in a locked filing cabinet on their respective premises. The original records will be maintained at the respective test site.  
 
Subjects’ identities will be kept confidential by assigning each subject a subject ID upon acceptance into the study. The subject ID will comprise the investigator’s two initials (first and last name initials) and a three-digit number that will be based upon the subject’s order 
of entry into the
 clinical study. For example, with Investigator John Black would have a 
subject ID of JB101-JB110. Regulatory Insight, Inc. will receive no additional identifying 
information about a subject and will therefore have no way of linking a subject ID to a 
particular subject and his or her results.   
 
MONITORING OF THE CLINICAL STUDY  
 
Prior to commencement of the study, the trained study Monitor(s) will provide formalized 
and documented training to the conduct of clinical studies in general, to the specifics of the current clinical study protocol, to the identification and reporting of adverse events and 
protocol deviations and to the correct set-up, operation and treatment application of the 
Erchonia® EVRL OTC  to the study population for all involved parties. A formalized Clinical 
Trial Monitoring Plan will be in place that will be strictly followed to ensure on-going 
compliance and accuracy of procedures . 
  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
No Statistical Analysis . As this is an observational pilot study  only, there are no pre-
established primary or secondary  outcome measures and no pre-established individual 
subject or study success criteria; rather it is the goal of this study to explore the potential 
benefits of low level laser therapy administration with the Erchonia EVRL OTC™ in 
reducing chronic pain associated with peripheral neuropathy, the results of which may be 
used to assist in developing a controlled clinical study to formally evaluate the study goal in the future.

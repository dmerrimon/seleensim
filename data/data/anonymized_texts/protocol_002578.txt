 1  Introduction 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is a decellularized, predegener ated and sterilized extracellular matrix (ECM) 
processed from donated human peripheral nerve tissue (see Figure 1-1). The structure is the ECM of 
native peripheral nerve and is comprised of bundl es of small diameter endoneurial tubes (as shown in 
Figure 1-2).  The tissue is processed to remove cellu lar and non-cellular factors such as Schwann cells, 
fat, blood, axonal debris and c hondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), while preserving the three-
dimensional scaffold, vascular structure, basal lami na laminin, fibronectin, and glycosmainoglycans.

® Nerve Graft showing the general overall tubular 
structure (scale bar=429um) and a close up view of the multiple empty tubes within the structure (scale 
bar=20um). 
 
 Avance
® Nerve Graft is intended to reconstruct and re pair peripheral nerve discontinues; and support 
axonal regeneration of peri pheral nerves following transection injury .  Processing results in a flexible, 
pliable, open multi-tubular ECM structure that can be  sutured in place and allows for a tension free 
approximation of the proximal and distal nerve stum ps (see Figure 1-2).  The graft revascularizes and 
remodels into the patients’ own tissue while supporting axonal growth across the nerve discontinuity.  The resulting axonal growth can lead to functional rec overy of the target organ.  Furthermore, because 
Avance
® Nerve Graft is decellularized, it does not require immunosuppressive therapy, which had 
previously limited the clinical use of cellular nerve allografts [1-4].

 Currently, repair options for peripheral nerve disconti nuities, when direct tension-free gap closure is not 
possible, include the nerve autograft and nerve cuff.  While the use of the nerve autograft is considered 
the historical standard for gap repair, it in itself pr esents challenges to the surgeon and patient including: 
additional surgery and the risks associated with it, don or site morbidity and limited tissue availability (e.g. 
during a large traumatic nerve injury), as well as, in creased operative time and cost associated with tissue 
harvest.  The nerve cuff (Medical Device Product Code JXI) was made available in the 1990’s as an 
alternative to sacrificing healthy nerve.  While the ne rve cuff has been used as an  alternative nerve repair 
option, its mono-tubular structure and rigidity limit its use for repairs with branching nerves or across 
joints in the digits where early mobilization was prescribed due to concomita nt tendon repairs.  The 
flexible, pliable, multi-tubu lar structure of the Avance® Nerve Graft overcomes these limitations to 
provide the surgeon with an additional treatment option. 
 This study will evaluate the difference in functiona l recovery outcomes between the study groups to 
assess the non-inferiority and superiority of the Avance
® Nerve Graft to nerve cuffs  
 a Type I Bovine Collagen nerve cuff). 
 
1.1 Background 
 
Peripheral Nerve Discontinuities 
 
In normal nerve anatomy, nerve cell bodies are locat ed in or near the spinal cord.  The nerve 
processes or fibers (called axons) extend from the cell bodies and travel down little tubes (endoneurial tubes or basal lamina) in the nerve trunks and in the peripheral nerves, until they make contact with 
the appropriate end organ, such as muscle or skin.  A signal generated in the brain travels down the 
spinal cord, into the axons, then to the muscle where it is converted  into a muscle contraction, which 
results in arm motion.  After a nerve is transect ed, many of the nerve cell bodies in and around the 
spinal column die just from the devastating shock of  the injury.  All nerve fibers in the distal (or 
downstream) nerve stump, that are now separated fro m their cell bodies, die and are quickly broken 
down by the body in a process called Wallerian Dege neration.  Almost immediately after a nerve 
transection, all sensory and motor function directed by that injured nerve is lost.  These types of 
injuries can severely impact patients in many different  ways.  For example, a nerve laceration in the 
hand may result in loss of movement or sensation in  the fingers.  In prostate cancer, the necessary 
removal of the prostate and associated cavernous nerves can result in erectile dysfunction and/or 
incontinence and injuries to the facial nerve can result in the patient losing the ability to smile. 
  Transected axons almost immediately start the regeneration process by se nding out exploratory 
branches, however, these branches can only find their wa y into the distal nerve stump if an adequate 
surgical repair has been performed.  Many nerve lacerations can be primarily repaired by suturing the 
cut ends together.  Other times, either due to ne rve tissue loss or nerve end retraction, a bridging 
material is required to connect the two ends 
[1].  This bridging material must be able to support 
regenerating axons.  Recovery is not possible if the nerve is left unrepaired or if the method or 
material used to reconstruct the nerve discontinu ities fails to support axonal regeneration across the 
nerve discontinuity [1,5,6].  
 Adequate repair of the nerve discontinuity is not th e sole factor in ensuring the return of function.  
Patient demographics, general health  of the patient, age of injury, location of injury, mechanism of 
injury, extent of trauma to surrounding and targ et tissue, patient compliance with rehabilitation 
regimen, and brain plasticity, all play  a role in the clinical outcome.

Current Treatment Options 
 As stated previously, when possible, a direct tension free nerve repair is the ideal repair method.  When an insurmountable gap exists, the separated ne rve ends must be bridged using a biological or 
artificial material 
[1, 2, 7].  Currently, there are several “bridging”  options including autograft nerve, 
Avance® Nerve Graft, and nerve cuffs (tubes).  Unfort unately, use of autograft nerve tissue requires a 
secondary surgical procedure, which increases anesthesia time and facility cost, and sacrifices a 
healthy functioning nerve.  This not only leads to functional (usually sensory) loss and scarring, but 
can also result in painful neuroma formati on or other complications such as infection [1, 2, 5, 8-10].  The 
paucity of “expendable” nerves within the human bo dy results in a limited supply of autograft and 
may necessitate size mismatching between donor and native nerve.  
Spurred by many of the disadvantages of nerve autogr aft, nerve cuffs, first introduced in the 1990’s, 
have seen a steady increase in popularity and, currently, multiple nerve cuffs are available for 
commercial use. Hollow tubes made from collagen or  synthetic materials are designed to entubulate 
the proximal and distal ends of the transected nerve.   A fibrin clot forms between the two nerve ends 
and is contained within the nerve tube.  Axons can re generate within this fibrin clot and cross the gap 
to the distal nerve stump.  Single lumen nerve cuffs, however, have a lim ited effective length and 
undesirable handling characteristics, which limits  their clinical application and acceptance. 
 Modern usage of viable, cellular nerve allograft was developed by Susan Mackinnon, M.D., in the 
1990s.  The results of her work were published in  2001 and detailed the outcomes of seven patients 
[4].  While the results of this study showed promise,  cellular nerve allografting as a strategy for nerve 
reconstruction is hampered by the need for donor  matched tissue and prolonged immunosuppression.  
Cellular nerve allograft remain s commercially unavailable. 
 A more recent addition to the armamentarium of the nerve surgeon, processed acellular nerve 
allograft, does not require the immunosuppressive therap ies associated with cellular nerve allografts.  
Avance
® Nerve Graft was introduced as a 361 Tissue for Transplantation in 2007 and was the first 
commercially available decellularized nerve allogr aft product.  Since that release date, Axogen has 
distributed over 7,000 grafts.  Avance® Nerve Graft has been utilized in the reconstruction of 
traumatic and iatrogenic peripheral nerve transection injuries in the upper and lower extremities, head 
and neck, chest and pelvis.  Mechanisms of injury have included, but are not limited to, laceration, blunt trauma, amputation, avulsion, gunshot wound,  shrapnel, improvised explosive product (IED) 
blast trauma, neuroma resection, ch emical burns, and oncologic resection. 
 Clinical Outcomes with Nerve Cuffs 
 Currently, there are very few controlled outcomes studies that compare the different peripheral nerve 
repair options 
[11].  Inherent challenges associated with th is type of data collection include the 
heterogeneous nature of traumatic injuries, of which include varying degrees of nerve damage and 
concomitant injuries [12].  Conclusive comparative clinical effi cacy evaluations require standardized, 
homogeneous samples [13].  
 Nerve cuffs, are regulated as class II medical devi ces under 510(k) exemption and are defined in the 
code of federal regulations (C FR) at 21 §CFR 882.5275 as “a tubular  silicone rubber sheath used to 
encase a nerve for aid in repairing the nerve (e.g., to prevent in growth of scar tissue) and for capping the end of the nerve to prevent the formation of neuroma (tumors)”.  Since they are regulated as

 segmental defects, in that in order for function rec overy to occur, the repair treatment must allow for 
regenerating axons to cross the discontinuity and enter the distal nerve sheath.  The endpoint 
measures are well defined and can consistently be measured from subject to subject. Also, the 
endpoints allow for treatment efficacy to be reviewed  within 12 months from repair, given that nerves 
regenerate at a rate of 1-2 mm pe r day. Additionally, the frequency of digital nerve injuries is such 
that it allows for enrollment of comparable injuries within a reasonable time period. Other repair 
models may report varying degrees of function recovery while utilizing different outcome 
assessments, as not all nerve types have homogenous outcomes, for instance, the repair of a mixed 
nerve will yield both sensory and motor outcomes. 
 
1.2 Product Description 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is a decellularized, cleansed, and sterilized extracellular matrix from donated 
human peripheral nerve.  The cleansing process pr eserves the inherent and relevant structural 
characteristics of the tissue. 
 Avance
® Nerve Graft is intended to be used to repair  nerve discontinuities anywhere in the body at 
lengths of up to 70mm.  It has a flexible, pliable, multi-tubular ECM structure (See Figures 1-1, and 
1-2) and handles similarly to nerve autograft allowing for versatile utilization including repairs across 
joints and shallow would beds; a limita tion seen with the use of nerve cuffs[14, 15, 18].  These 
advantages provide the surgeon with a clinically beneficial off-the-shelf nerve graft option that avoids the disadvantages of autograft harvest or nerve cuff limitations.  
 
Avance
® Nerve Graft is provided frozen and sterile.  Af ter thawing the graft, implantation should be 
completed using the same tensionless surgical techni que used when implanting a nerve autograft. The 
graft is positioned within the nerve gap and coapted to the proximal and distal stumps of the host 
nerve.  See Figure 1.2-1.

 collagen, are molded or extruded to form a hollow tube structure that encases the proximal and distal 
ends of the injured nerve.  For the purpose of this clinical study,   a Type I 
bovine collagen nerve cuff, will be utilized as the c ontrol treatment.  Implantation is to be done 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Appendix 4.0).  
 
1.4 Risk Analysis 
 
Inherent risks of any surgical procedure include: infection, blood loss, and anesthesia-associated 
complications.  Complications specific to nerve reconstruction include pain, decreased or increased sensitivity, and impaired motor or sensory function.  As with all peripheral nerve surgeries, there is a 
risk that the nerve may fail to regenerate.    Hypersensitivity, allergic reactions, or other adverse immune responses have not been seen in 
preclinical studies or reported clin ically with the use of Avance
® Nerve Graft.  Because Avance® 
Nerve Graft is composed of proteins such as colla gen and laminin; the potential may exist for such 
reactions.  All adverse outcomes potentially attributed to Avance® Nerve Graft are to be promptly 
reported to Axogen, Inc, in accordance with state and federal regulations. 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is processed human nerve tissue.  As with all donated human tissue products the 
risk for transmission of communicable disease does exist.  Robust donor screening and selection is 
completed as required by FDA and is in accordance with American Association of Tissue Banks 
(AATB), state, and federal guidelines. Processing c ontrols and terminal sterilization with gamma 
irradiation greatly reduce but cannot totally elimin ate the risk of disease transmission.  As disease-
screening methods are limited, there is the potential for certain diseases to not be detected.  The 
following complications of tissue transplantation may occur: 
 
– Transmission of diseases of unknown etiology;  
– Transmission of known infectious agents incl uding, but not limited to viruses, bacteria, and 
fungi. 
 
The processing of Avance
® Nerve Graft was developed with a robust safety and efficacy profile to 
include extensive preclinical testing, established manufacturing controls, and documented previous 
human clinical experience.  
Risks associated with the use of   include adverse events related to the 
implantation of a foreign body and reactions associated  with the xenogeneic prot ein that is used to 
construct the nerve cuff.  The implantation of a 
foreign body (such as a nerve cuff) in a non-sterile 
environment may increase the risk of infection.  Inflammation or surgical site reaction has been 
observed with the use of nerve cuffs and can o ccasionally be severe enough to cause extrusion of the 
cuff through the skin.  Additionally, use of  is contraindicated in individuals at risk of 
localized reaction or anaphylaxis due to known or suspected sensitivity to bovine proteins.  
1.4.1 Preclinical Testing for Avance® Nerve Graft 
Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo biocompatib ility evaluations provide support that Avance® Nerve 
Graft is safe for use in humans.  Additionally, in vivo testing utilizing well established and validated 
animal models has demonstrated efficacy in its inte nded use to reconstruct a nd repair peripheral nerve 
discontinues; and support axonal regeneration of peripheral nerves following transection injury.

 Effective regeneration in this model has been well characterized by both Susan Mackinnon, MD at 
Washington University, St. Louis, MO and David Muir, PhD at the University Of Florida Department 
Of Neuroscience, Gainesville, FL.  Both designed and conducted preclinical efficacy studies and are 
recognized as leaders in peripheral nerve research (summarized in Table 1.4.1-1). 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft has been subjected to well establis hed and accepted test panels for preclinical 
product safety evaluation and has been found to be  a non-toxic, non-reactive, non-sensitizing, non-
pyrogenic, non-mutagenic, and non-irritant.

Study Description Results 
Reconstruction of Rat Sciatic 
Nerve Discontinuity with 
Avance® Processed Allografts 
or Nerve Grafts[19] Avance® processed allografts effectiv ely supported regeneration of 
axons across the 10 mm nerve discontinuity and compared favorably 
to isograft.  Functional recovery r esults correlated with histological 
results.  Processed allografts s upported robust axon regeneration 
across the injury that was not statistically different from isograft.  
Nerve regeneration after reconstruction of a 10 mm sciatic nerve injury with Avance
® processed grafts is comparable to that after 
standard nerve graft repair in its intended use and function as a conduit for axon regeneration across a gap.  
Reconstruction of Rat Sciatic 
Nerve Discontinuity by 
Avance® Processed 
Allografts, Collagen Nerve 
Cuffs, or Nerve Grafts[20] Avance® processed allografts effec tively supported regeneration 
across the nerve injury in both 14 and 28 mm long defects.  Based on total fiber counts at midgraft and distal to 14 mm grafts taken 6 weeks after repair, isograft performed better than processed allografts, which performed better than collagen nerve cuffs.  At 12 
weeks after repair, there were no measurable differences in fiber 
count or wet muscle mass ratios between groups.  Fiber counts, fiber 
quality and electrical stimulation da ta following repair with 28 mm 
grafts demonstrated that isograft performed better than processed allografts, which performed better than collagen nerve cuffs.  Wet 
muscle mass, extensor postural thru st testing, and walking track 
analysis demonstrated that nerves repaired with processed allografts functioned as well as and were not st atistically different than those 
repaired with the NeuraGen
® Nerve Guide.  
Evaluation of the Effect of 
Nerve Graft Tissue Source on 
Graft Effectiveness in a Rat 
Tibial Nerve Injury Model[21] Regardless of nerve type source (i.e . motor, sensory or mixed nerve), 
Avance processed allografts effectively supported regeneration of axons across a 5 mm tibial nerve discontinuity in a rat.  Processed allografts support reproducible axon regeneration across the graft 
into the distal nerve based on both total and myelinated axon counts.  
 
 
1.4.2 Manufacturing Controls 
 
Axogen has established procedures for tissue recovery , relevant donor medical record review and 
release to processing criteria that meet FDA re quirements as defined in 21 CFR §1271, state 
regulations, and AATB standards.  Furthermor e, Axogen utilizes validated processes for the 
handling of raw material components, environmental control, decellularization, and terminal

 sterilization of the peripheral nerve allograft.  In addition to ongoing monitoring activities for 
product conformity to specifications and sterility, product storage, shelf life and stability have 
been validated in accordance with applicable industry standards. 
 
1.4.3 Previous Clinical Experience 
 
1.4.3.1   General Use 
 
Avance® Nerve Graft is a commercially available product that has been and continues to be 
marketed as a HCT/P tissue product in accordan ce with 21 CFR §1271 regulations since July 
2007.  Since that release date, Axogen has distri buted over 7,000 grafts.  Utilization of Avance® 
Nerve Graft has allowed for the reconstruction of traumatic and iatrogenic peripheral nerve 
transection injuries in the upper and lower extremitie s, head and neck, chest and pelvis.  Injuries 
have included, but are not limited to, lacerati on, blunt trauma, amputation, avulsion, gunshot 
wound, shrapnel, improvised explosive product (IED)  blast trauma, neuroma resection, chemical 
burns, oncologic resection such as facial nerve r econstruction following r esection of parotid gland 
tumor, reconstruction of neurovascular bundle follow ing radical prostatectomy, and reinnervation 
of breast reconstructions following mastectomy.  
1.4.3.2  Published Clinical Studies 
 
In 2009, Mayo Clinic published their r esults regarding the performance of Avance® Nerve Graft [3]. This 
investigator initiated study repor ted on segmental nerve defects in  the hand and digits. Functional 
recovery was evaluated by blinded hand therapist us ing moving (m2PD) and static (s2PD) two point 
discrimination tests. All subjects recovered near normal two-point discrimination. Avance® Nerve Graft 
was demonstrated to be safe and effective with no reported  signs of infection, rejection, or graft extrusion. 
 
Ducic et al reported on outcomes from 54 discreet nerv e repairs that were treated with various repair 
techniques [22] .The authors found that Avance® Nerve Graft returned functional improvements similar to 
those of other test groups. No safety concerns were discussed. 
   Shanti and Ziccardi reported on a single uncontrolled case of Avance
® Nerve Graft for reconstruction of 
the Inferior Alveolar Nerve in the face [23]. Recovery of function was documented. No safety concerns 
were discussed.  The investigators from the Axogen sponsored RANGER
® registry have independently reported on their 
experiences with the Avance® Nerve Graft in two separate peer-reviewed publications. 
Brooks et al reported on 132 individual nerve injuries [24]. Twelve sites with 25 surgeons contributed data 
to this registry database. Data was analyzed to determine the safety and functional outcomes from the use of Avance
® Nerve Graft. Sufficient data for efficacy anal ysis was reported in 76 injuries (49 sensory, 18 
mixed, and 9 motor nerves). Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistency, with no significant differences 
with regard to recovery outcomes between the groups (P>0.05 Fisher’s  Exact Test). No implant related 
adverse experiences were reported. These outcomes we re found to compare favorably to the established 
historical controls from the literature for nerve aut ograft and nerve cuffs. This  work was expanded by Cho 
et al who reported on their finding from a subgroup analysis on outcomes, specifically for upper extremity nerve repairs with outcomes data from the RANGER
® registry database [25]. In this analysis an upper 
extremity specific population was identified within the RANGER® database presenting with 71 nerves

label.  The transected nerve ends are placed inside the internal diameter of the tube 
(entubulation) and serve as a containment area for the milieu of fluids that seep from the severed ends.  
Regulatory Classification:  Regulated as Class II medical devices via FDA 510(k) clearance.  
Nerve cuffs are manufactured to form a hollow tube construct to entubulate the injured nerve 
stumps.  See Appendix 4 for Instructions for Use. 
 
3.3 Study Population 
 Adult male and female subjects that have sustained an injury to at least one nerve, distal to the 
superficial palmar arch and proximal to the distal interphalangeal joint, which after resection results 
in a nerve gap between 5 mm and 25 mm, inclusive.

3.4 Eligibility Criteria 
3.4.1 Informed Consent 
 
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before any study related procedures are performed.  Investigators may discuss the ava ilability of the study and the possibility for entry 
with a potential subject without first obtaining consent.  However, informed consent must be 
obtained and documented prior to initiation of any procedures that are performed solely for the 
purpose of determining eligibility for research.  The investigator(s) has both ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject under consideration for enrollment is given a full explanation of the study.  This shall be documented on a written Informed Consent Form (ICF), 
which shall be approved by the same Instituti onal Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee

3.4.4   Enrollment in Study 
3.4.4.1 Subject Screening and Numbering 
 
After the subject has signed an IRB-approved informed consent form, they will be assigned a unique screening number.  At each site, the screening numbers will start with S001.  Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study.  Randomization will occur intra-operatively.  A randomizati on number will be assigned to identify the 
enrolled subject. 
3.4.4.2 Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation 
 If a subject discontinues from the study, the reason given must be recorded in source 
documentation and the eCRF.  If the subject is  withdrawn due to an adverse event, the 
adverse event must be indicated as the reason fo r withdrawal.  All subjects have the right to 
withdraw at any point during the treatment without prejudice.  The investigator can also discontinue a subject’s participation at any time if medically necessary.  The sponsor should be notified promptly when a subject is withdrawn or if the trial is stopped at a clinical site. For subjects that withdraw early (Early Termination), all efforts should be 
made to collect End of Study data points prior to final withdraw.

  Decision by the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the study product. 
 
Conditions that may warrant termin ation of the clinical study at a particular investigative site 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 The investigative site fails to comp ly with all applicable regulations; 
 
 Deliberate submission of false information from the site to Axogen, Corporation., 
their designee, or regulatory authorities; 
 
 Inadequate adherence to protocol requirements; or 
 
 Inadequate enrollment. 
 In the event of a discontinuation of the study at an  investigative site, the principal investigator 
will return all study materials including study docu mentation and CRFs to the sponsor, provide a 
written statement explaining the reason for termination, and notify the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee. 
4 Adverse Events  
4.1 Procedures for Eliciting Reports and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
The primary safety endpoint is intended to evaluate a dverse events associated w ith the surgical repair 
of the injured nerve and is not intended to evaluate  the adverse events of the trauma that precipitated 
the injury.  Both the Avance® Nerve Graft and the   are commercially 
available products and are restricted to the implantation at the nerve injury site. The effect of each 
product is localized to the area of the nerve discontinu ity only. Ther
efore, the intent is not to capture 
all adverse events that may occur in a subject thr oughout the follow-up period but only events directly 
relating to the study product and/or surgical interventi on.  Given the nature of traumatic hand injuries, 
in-depth medical management approach will be requi red for a majority of the subjects enrolled in the 
clinical study.  Assessment of adverse events may be  limited, to some degree, to those adverse events 
that are related directly to the injured hand, however, to prevent under reporting of potentially associated adverse events, the following may be collected: 
 
Adverse events associated with the affected  hand, may include but is not limited to: 
 bleeding; 
 infection in the affected hand; 
 painful scar at the nerve reconstruction site; 
 extrusion on nerve repair product; 
 delayed wound healing; 
 allergic reaction; 
 hypersensitivity at or distal to the repair site; 
 anaphylaxis; 
 communicable diseases; 
 any change in medical or overall health condition that results in the withdrawal of the subject from the study;

WITHOUT WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM AXOGENTM Corporation 
- 
 
  any adverse event meeting the criteria for Serious Adverse Event; and/or any 
other event that in the opinion of an investigator warrants collection. 
  
Concurrent illnesses that are present at or before study product implantation, which manifest with 
the same severity, frequency, or duration, subseque nt to study product implantation, need not be 
recorded as AEs.  Similarly, signs or symptoms related to a pre-existing disease need not be recorded as AEs.  However, incidents where there is an increase in severity or duration of the concurrent illness or pre-existing disease that meet the above criteria must be reported.  
 
Adverse events should be reported by the inves tigator or qualified designee in accordance with 
21CRF part 312.32 and Guidance for Industry and Investigators:  Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies.  
 
4.2 Adverse Event Specific Definitions 
 
Associated with the use of the drug.  There is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have 
been caused by the drug.   
Disability.  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
Life-threatening adverse drug experience.  Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth de fect.  Important medical events that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse 
drug experience when, based upon appropriate medica l judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
 
Unexpected adverse drug experience:  Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  For example, under this definition, hepa tic necrosis would be unexpected ( by virtue of greater severity) if 
the investigator brochure only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the 
investigator brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience th at has not been previously observed (e.g., included 
in the investigator brochure) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.  
4.3 Review of safety information 
 
The sponsor shall promptly review  all information relevant to the safety of the drug obtained or 
otherwise received by the sponsor from any sour ce, foreign or domestic, including information 
derived from any clinical or epidemiological i nvestigations, animal investigations, commercial 
marketing experience, reports in the scientific litera ture, and unpublished scien tific papers, as well as 
reports from foreign regulatory authorities that have  not already been previously reported to the 
agency by the sponsor.

 4.4 Adverse Event 
 
 An AE is any untoward event experienced by a subject (whether or not considered product-related by 
the principal investigator or sponsor), or any even t that has changed adversely in nature, severity, or 
frequency.  An untoward AE or any event that has changed adversely in nature, severity, or frequency 
during the course of study product administration is considered to be a treatment-emergent adverse 
event.  An AE can be, but is not limited to, subjective symptoms experienced by a subject, or objective 
findings that may or may not include subjective symptoms.  Examples of objective findings are clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.  All AEs that occur during or after study product implantation/device insertion must be recorded in the subject’s medical record (progress notes) and 
then transcribed onto the CRF.  The investigator’s  assessment of the AE’s relationship to the study 
product is unrelated to its characterization as an AE.  For example, an anomaly that the investigator 
judges to be unrelated to the investigational/control product may nonetheless be identified as an AE.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that cau ses death, is life threatening, is permanently 
disabling, or requires (or prolongs) hospitalization or interventional surgery.   
4.4.1 List of Anticipated Adverse Event 
 
Consistent with the subject’s informed consent form  and the risk analysis section of this protocol, 
the following adverse events are anticipated and may potentially occur during the subject’s 
participation in this investigation: 
 mild incisional redness; 
 tenderness of surgical area; 
 mild edema of surgical area; 
 decreased pain at surgical area; 
 numbness 
These adverse events are considered expected and are not required to be recorded on the Adverse 
Events eCRF unless they increase in severity.  
4.4.2 Severity of Adverse Events 
 
Adverse events will be graded for severity and noted in the description of the event.  The NCI (NIH)-developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI_CTCAE), Version 
4.0, will be used.  In addition, any AE associat ed with subject termination from the study must be 
reported to the sponsor or sponsor-approved designee within 7 days of knowledge.  If the AE is a SAE, then the reporting requirements listed in section 4.5.2 will apply.  
 
4.4.3 Relationship to Study Product 
 
The principal investigator or designee will docum ent his/her opinion on the relationship of the 
adverse event to the study product or control pr oduct for all adverse events, using the criteria 
outlined in Table 4.4.3-1.

  Table 4.4.3-1 Relationship of A dverse Events to Study Product 
 
 
Relationship  Description 
 
 
Unrelated  An AE that is clearly and uncontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
                  and does not meet the criteria for study product relationship listed under possible or   probable. 
 
 
Possible  An AE may be considered as possibly related if: 
    
  1) it cannot be reasonably explained by the subj ect’s clinical state by environmental or toxic  
   factors; or  
  2) it follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration of study product; or, 
   3) it follows a known patter n of response to the study product. 
 
 
Probable  An AE considered, with a high degree of certa inty, to be related to the study product. An AE may  
                  be considered probably related to study product if:  
  1) it cannot be reasonably explained by the known ch aracteristics of the subjec t’s clinical state or  
   by environmental or toxic factors;  
  2) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study product; 
 
  3) it follows a known pattern of response to study product; 
 
  4) it disappears or decreases upon removal. 
 
 
Definitely  An AE that is clearly an d uncontrovertibly due to study product.   
Related  
 
4.4.4 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
 
Subjects who present with unresolved or new adver se events at the final scheduled visit will be 
followed by the principal investigator: 
 
 until the adverse event has resolved; or 
 
 until the subject is lost to follow-up; or 
 
 until the adverse event is stabilized or deemed a permanent disease or condition. 
 

Protocol No. ANG-CP-007

- 
 
 “Resolution” of an AE occurs when  the subject has returned to his/her baseline state of health or 
when the principal investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE.  
On the last clinical study day, the principal investigator will instruct the subject to report any 
subsequent adverse event that the subject or the subject’s physician believes might reasonably be caused by, or probably caused by, the study product.  The principal investigator will continue to report any significant follow-up information to the sponsor or authorized designee.  All SAEs that occur up to 30 days following the subject’s last study assessment must be reported immediately to 
the medical monitor.  
 
4.5 Serious Adverse Event 
 
4.5.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
  Results in death; 
 
 Is life threatening – a “life-threatening” event is  present when the subject is, in the opinion of 
the principal investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs.  Note that this definition does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might 
have caused death; 
 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization – 
hospitalization for elective treatment of pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is not considered an adverse event.  Hospitalization or nursing home 
admission for the purpose of caregiver respite is not considered an adverse event.  
Complications that occur during hospitalizati on are adverse events, and if a complication 
prolongs hospitalization, the event is considered serious; 
 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability /incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or 
 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious events when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  
 
4.5.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
 
This protocol will follow the standard level of SAE reporting.  Thus, it is necessary to report all SAEs following any exposure to study that: 
 
 Result in death, regardless of  relationship to study product; 
 
 Result in persistent or significant disabilities or incapacities, regardless of relationship to study product; 
 

Protocol No. ANG-CP-007 
 Page 34 of 61 Version 3.0 
THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED, PUBLISHED, OR DISTRIBUTED IN ANY FORM, IN WHOLE OR IN  PART,

- 
 
  Are an adverse reaction, definitely, probably, or possibly related to study product, that 
requires or prolongs existing hospitalization, or requires intervention to prevent 
significant/permanent disability or death; or 
 
 Are life threatening, including all Grade 4 adver se reactions that are definitely, probably, or 
possibly related to study product. 
 
All SAEs must be reported immediately to spons or or approved sponsor designee, followed by 
the completion of the SAE CRF.  The sponsor or authorized designee, in turn, will promptly 
notify the medical monitor.  The SAE report and CRF should contain all adverse event information available at time of event onset. As  updates become available, the SAE report and 
CRF should be updated appropriately until event is resolved.  
The sites will relay all SAE information to the sp onsor or authorized designee within 24 hours of 
receipt.  The SAE form will collect data surrounding the event, e.g., the natu re of the symptom(s), 
time of onset in relation to placement of study product, and whether or not treatment with study 
product was interrupted or discontinued.  The principal investigator’s assessment on the probable cause of the event will also be included. 
 
Subjects experiencing a SAE or emergency situa tion should be examined by a physician as soon 
as possible.  The physician in attendance should do  whatever is medically necessary for the safety 
and well-being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation for as long as medically indicated in the opinion of the principal investigat or and/or attending phys ician.  The SAE will be 
followed until resolved or until medically stabilized.  The principal investigator or designee will 
notify the sponsor (and the IRB/Ethics Committee and appropriate regulatory body, if necessary) 
within 24 hours of event onset.   
 
4.5.3   Relationship to Product and Study Procedure 
 The principal investigator will document his/her opinion on the relationship of the adverse event 
to the study product or control product and to the study procedure for all SAEs.  The investigator 
should follow the same criteria outlined above when determining product- or procedure-relatedness.  
4.6 IND Safety Reports 
 
4.6.1   Written reports 
 The sponsor shall notify FDA and all participating investigators in a written IND safety report of: 
 
 Any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and 
unexpected; or 
 
 Any findings from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, te ratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  Each 
notification shall be made as soon as possible a nd in no event later than 15 calendar days 
after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Each written notification may be

- 
 
 submitted either on an FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format (foreign events may be 
submitted either on an FDA Form 3500A or, if  preferred, on a CIOMS I form; reports 
from animal or epidemiological studies shall be  submitted in a narrative format) and shall 
bear prominent identification of its contents , i.e., “IND Safety Report.”  Each written 
notification to FDA shall be transmitted to the FDA product review division in the Center 
for Biologics Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND.  If 
FDA determines that additional data is needed, the agency may require further data to be submitted. 
 
In each written IND safety report, the sponsor sha ll identify all safety reports previously filed 
with the IND concerning a similar adverse experience, and shall analyze the significance of the adverse experience in light of the previous, similar reports. 
 
4.6.2   Telephone and facsimile tr ansmission safety reports 
 The sponsor shall also notify FDA by telephone, by facsimile transmission, or by electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) transmission of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening 
experience associated with the use of the produc t as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 
calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Each telephone call or 
facsimile transmission to FDA shall be transmitte d to the FDA to the product review division in 
the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND. 
 
4.6.3   Follow up 
 Follow up information to a safety report shall be submitted as soon as the relevant information is 
available.  If the results of a sponsor’s investig ation show that an adverse experience was initially 
determined to be not reportable  according to the applicable regulations , but is later deemed 
reportable, the sponsor shall report such experi ence in a written safety report as soon as possible, 
but in no event later than 15 calendar days after th e determination is made.  Results of a sponsor’s 
investigation of other safety information shall be submitted, as appropria te, in an information 
amendment or annual report. 
5 Statistical Considerations 
 Descriptive statistical methods will be used  to summarize the data from this study,  
with hypothesis testing performed for the primary a nd other selected efficacy endpoints.  Unless stated 
otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of events (n), mean, median, standard 
deviation (SD), standard error, minimum, maximum,  and coefficient of variation (CV) for continuous 
data and frequencies and percentages for categorical da ta.  The term “repair type” refers to randomized 
treatment assignment of either 
  or Avance® Nerve Graft.  All data collected 
during the study will be included in data listings.  Un less otherwise noted, the data will be sorted first by 
repair type, subject number, and then by date within each subject number. 
 Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing w ill be two-sided and will be performed using an overall 
significance (alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS
® System, version 9.1.3 or higher.

 6 Study Product Management 
6.1 Packaging and Labeling 
 
Commercially available product will be used for both treatment groups, however each site will be 
provided quality controlled serialized investigational product and control product labeling. Once subject has been randomized the appropriate investigational product labeling will be affixed to product packaging and returned to CRO for docum entation and label accountability.  Refer to the 
Study Operations Manual for labeling procedures.  
6.2 Handling, Storage, and Disposal 
 
Per product specifications as defined in the Instructions for Use. 
7 Records Management 
 
Questions or interpretations of the protocol or  CRFs must be referred to the sponsor or its 
representatives.  
 
7.1 Data Collection 
 
During each subject’s visit, the investigator or d esignee should document all significant observations.  
Information from the source documents will be prom ptly transcribed to into the electronic data 
capture system (EDC) via electronic case report forms.  
 Any changes in information in the study progress notes or other source documents will be initialed 
and dated on the day the change is made, by a site study staff member authorized to make the change.  
Changes will be made by striking a single line throu gh erroneous data, and clearly entering the correct 
data.  If the reason for the change is not apparent , a brief explanation for the change will be written 
adjacent to the change on the source document and updated accordingly in the EDC system.  
7.2 Source Documents 
 
Source documents are defined as the result of orig inal observations and activities of a clinical 
investigation.  Source documents will include, but are not limited to, progress notes, electronic data, 
screening logs, and recorded data from automated in struments.  All source documents pertaining to 
this study will be maintained by the investigat ors and made available for direct inspection by 
authorized persons.   All source documents from this study will be maintained by the study center and made available for inspection by authorized persons.  The original si gned Informed Consent Form for each subject shall 
be filed with a patient’s clinical record at the s ite and a copy shall be given to the subject and/or 
legally authorized representative.

- 
 
 7.3 File Management at the Study Site 
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the site files are ma intained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and FDA regulations.  
7.4 Records Retention at the Study Site 
 Essential documents should be retained until at least  2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product.  However, essential documents may be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulat ory requirements or by agreement with the sponsor.  
It’s the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the principal investigator that the essential documents no longer need to be retained.  
8 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
 
8.1 Data Management Considerations 
 
Data Management will be overseen by an independen t CRO contracted and qualified by the sponsor.  
All data points in the study will be held to a globa l Data Management Plan.  Original study logs will 
remain secured at the clinical site and a copy will be transmitted to the data manager.  Paper copies 
received by the data manager will be scanned a nd electronically saved as a Portable Document 
Format (pdf).  The scanned copy will be compared to the paper copy to assure all pages are accounted for and quality meets expectations.    
Data will be entered in to the EDC by the site coor dinator or other qualified site personnel.  Quality 
control checks will be established for each data mana gement procedure in order to ensure accuracy 
and to preserve the integrity of the data.  Onsite data monitoring visits w ill be conducted by certified 
Clinical Research A ssociates (CRA) employed by the study’ s CRO.  Visits will be conducted 
according to an established procedure and occur acco rding to a predetermined schedule for the entire 
length of the study. 
8.2 Monitoring 
 
The sponsor or their authorized designee will conduct routine monitoring visits to ensure the safe and 
ethical conduct of the study.  This will include rout ine data monitoring of the study’s critical variables 
that are defined in the data management plan and clinical monitoring plan.  As part of a concerted 
effort to fulfill the requirements of the protocol, the sponsor or designee may visit the center during the study in addition to maintaining frequent telephone and written communication.  
8.3 Auditing 
 
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit or authorized designee may conduct audits at the study site(s).  
Audits will include, but are not limited to, pro duct supply, presence of required documents, the 
informed consent process, and comparison of case report forms with source documents.  The 
investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable 
manner.

Regulatory authorities may also audit the investigator during or after the study.  The investigator 
should contact the sponsor immediately if this occurs, and must fully cooperate with the regulatory 
bodies during the conduct of the study audit. 
9 Ethics and Responsibility 
 This study must be conducted in compliance with  the protocol, FDA regulations, the ICH GCP 
Guidelines, and all other applicable regulatory requirements.   
The study protocol and the written informed consent form must be submitted to the IRB/IEC identified 
with the responsibility to approve research for the st udy site.  Written approval must come from the 
IRB/IEC Chairman or Secretary, either as a letter or  as a copy of the appropriate sections of the IRB/IEC 
meeting minutes where the review of the study protoc ol and associated informed consent form were 
discussed and approved.  The investigator will not partic ipate in the decision.  If the investigator is an 
IRB/IEC member, the written approval must indicate such non-participation. 
 The investigator will submit study status reports to the IRB/IEC no less frequently than annually (when 
applicable).  The investigator must notify the IRB/IE C in writing of the interruption and/or completion of 
the study.  The investigator must promptly report to the IRB/IEC all chang es in research (protocol 
amendments), and will not make such changes w ithout IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subj ects.  In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified 
with 5 working days of the change.  The inves tigator will promptly report to the IRB/IEC all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others.  The inves tigator must maintain accurate and 
complete records of all correspondence written to and received from the IRB/IEC and must agree to share 
all such documents and reports with the sponsor.  
10 Clinical Study Report 
 Upon completion of the study, the data management group biostatisticians w ill generate the Tables, 
Forms, and Listings for the Lead Investigators and sponsor to review.  Once verified and approved, the 
Tables, Forms, and Listings will be finalized.  Based  on this study data, a study report will be drafted.  
This report will be provided to the collaborative inve stigators for review and comment.  The sponsor will 
then finalize and distribute the study report to the appropriate parties.  
11 Confidentiality 
 All information generated in this st udy must be considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed 
to any persons not directly concerned with the study without first written permission from Axogen.  
However, authorized regulatory officials and Axoge n personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed 
full access to inspect and copy study records.  All st udy materials collected shall be used solely in 
accordance with this protocol, unless first agreed to in writing by Axogen.   Subjects will be identified only by initials and unique subject numbers in CRFs.  Their full names may, 
however, be made known to a regulatory agency or  other authorized officials if necessary.

 12 Regulatory Considerations  
12.1 Amendments 
 
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from the sponsor and subsequent approval by the IRB/IEC.  Any permanent change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific study center(s ), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  
Any amendment to the protocol identified as necessary and occurring during active study conduct, 
will be fully discussed by the investigator(s) and th e sponsor prior to any protocol updates.  If 
agreement is reached regarding th e need for an amendment, the sponsor will be responsible for 
updating the protocol.  The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB/IEC designated with this responsibility.  Except for ‘adm inistrative amendments’ investigators must await 
IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before  implementing the changes(s).  Administrative 
amendments are defined as having no effect on th e safety of the research subjects, scope of the 
investigation, or quality of the trial.  However, a protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects should be implemente d immediately, and the IRB/IEC notified within 
five working days.  Axogen will submit all offici al protocol amendments to the FDA or other 
regulatory agencies.   
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the I RB/IEC, the investigators and/or the sponsor, the 
amendment to the protocol substa ntially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification.  
In such cases, repeat informed c onsent will be obtained from all subj ects enrolled in the study before 
continued participation.  
12.2 Protocol Deviations 
 
This study is intended to be conducted as described in  this protocol.  In the event of a significant 
deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake, the investigator or designee must contact the sponsor at the earliest possible tim e by telephone.  This will allow for an early, joint 
decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study.  This decision will be documented by the 
investigator and the sponsor, and reviewed by the monitor.  
12.3 Sponsor and Investigator Responsibilities 
 
The sponsor and participating investigators shall be responsible for the conduct of this clinical study 
as specified in 21CRF part 312 Subpart D.  This  clinical investigation will be performed in 
compliance with the protocol, Clinical Study Agr eement, the FDA Good Clinical Practices including 
21CRF part 312, 601, 50, 56, ICH E6, and local applicable regulatory requirements.

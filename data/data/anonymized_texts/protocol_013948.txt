The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the truSculpt radiofrequency  (RF) 
device for wrinkle reduction and  improve ment  of skin quality . 
2  BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
 
Non -invasive treatment options to improve one’s appearance are in high demand by patients wanting to 
avoid surgical intervention. Due to this demand, patients have a variety of options for non- invasive 
wrinkle -reduction treatment, from laser and light -based treatments to devices that utilize ultrasound and 
radiofrequency. By delivering energy into the skin in the form of light, ultrasound or radio waves, thereby causing heat generation in the sub layers, these treatment modalities can be used to improve wrinkles 
and skin laxity [1-24].  
 Ultrasound and radiofrequency (RF) devices are increasingly utilized for non -invasive tissue tightening due 
to the ability of these technologies to penetrate the dermis at greater depths, as compared to light -based 
devices [ 25-27]. When collagen is heated sufficiently, intramolecular bonds sensitive to heat are broken 
and the collagen fibril transforms form a highly -organized structure to a random, gel -like state. Immediate 
collagen contraction occurs as a result of unwinding  of the triple helix structure and the residual tension 
of the heat- resistant intermolecular bonds [30]. The effect of collagen denaturation from tissue heating is 
dependent on a number of factors, including maximum temperature reached, exposure time, concentration and orientation of the collagen fibers, and the hydration level of the tissue [30]. Many studies have examined histology of post- treatment skin biopsy samples, which demonstrated increased 
collagen deposition in the weeks to months following devi ce treatments that cause thermal -induced 
wound healing. In addition, histology samples have demonstrated collagen fibers aligned in a horizontal orientation parallel to the plane of the epidermis. Some studies have demonstrated dermal and epidermal thickening [31]. Uniform volumetric heating of the epidermal, dermal and sub -dermal layers of the skin 
results in a primary effect of immediate collagen contraction and a secondary effect of fibroblast proliferation and the production of new collagen and elastic over time as a result of inflammation and the wound healing response. [22, 27 -29].  
 RF, which is the most studied device in the non -ablative category, uses electrical current rather than light 
energy.  Unlike light energy, radio waves can penetrate deeper depending on the frequency of operation. 
RF can be used with all Fitzpatrick skin types without jeopardizing epidermal integrity [ 33].   
 RF devices generate heat in the form of thermal energy as a result of electrical current delivered to the tissue. The re is a natural resistance to the movement of electrons within the RF field when electrical 
current is applied [ 25]. This resistance will dictate the amount of thermal energy generated within the 
tissue according to Ohm’s Law, which states the amount of energy generated is dependent on the electrical current, the tissue impedance and the time of application.  Ohm’s Law is expressed as an equation, where I  is the amount of current (in Amps), Z  is the tissue impedance (in Ohms) and t  is the time 
current is applied (in seconds) [ 25, 30, 32]:   
Energy (Joules) = I
2x Z x t  
 RF may be delivered in three different ways: 1) Monopolar when energy is applied as current between a single electrode tip and a grounding plate.  2) Bipolar when energy is applied between two points on the

Subjects will be asked after each procedure  (2 total treatments)  to rate the average amount of discomfort 
experienced during RF treatment using the Pain Rating Scale found in Appendix 3. 
4.3.2 Safety Assessments  
4.3.2.1  Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events:   
Following the first RF treatment, adverse device effects (ADEs) will be  assessed post -treatment and at 
each subsequent subject visit using the following scale:  
 
1= mild: requires minimal or no treatment and does not interfere with the Subject’s daily  activities.  
2= moderate: may cause some interference with functioning.  
3= severe: interrupts Subject’s usual daily activity and may require treatment.  
4.4 Photographs  
Standardized digital photographs will be taken of each subject’s face and submental region . Photographs 
will be taken  at baseline,  prior to all RF treatments , and at each follow -up visit. Photographs will be 
obtained from at least  three  angles: 1) with the subject facing forward , 2) 45° to the right , and 3) 45° to 
the left. Photographs  will be taken in the same windowless room equipped with adequate lighting. The 
room lighting, camera positioning and subject positioning should be consistent for all study visit 
photographs.  Digital camera settings should remain the same for all photographs and  the highest 
resolution settings should be utilized.  
4.5 Study Discontinuation  
The study sponsor ha s the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study  
may include, but are not limited to, unsatisfactory subject enrollment or the incidence or severity of 
adverse events in this study, or other studies with the study device, indicates a potential health hazard to 
subjects.  
4.6 Investigator Selection  
Investigat ors will be invited to participate in the study based on their medical specialty, experience 
conducting clinical research studies and experience in the use of energy based devices for aesthetic indications. The site’s access to potential study subjects and ability to cooperate with study require ments 
will also be considered.  
5 STUDY POPULATION  
5.1 Study Subject Recruitment and Selection  
Up to 40  male or female subjects, ages  25 to 65, with Fitzpatrick Skin Type I -VI who desire RF treatment  
for wrinkle reduction. Subjects  will be recruited to participate from those patients who present 
themselves to the site requesting treatment, or from those patients who respond to advertisement. Only subjects who meet all Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria and provide written informed consent will be enrolled into the study.

The subjects may or may not benefit from the treatment. Potential benefits include improved appearance 
of the wrinkles  and sagging skin  treat ed in the face or submental  region . There is no guarantee  of success.  
8.3 Risk Management  
The Investigator  chosen for this study  will have  extensive and safe experience with the use of RF systems 
in dermatology applications. This is the most critical element in managing subject risk. In addition, the Investigator s will be trained on the use of the Cutera RF device and any investigational handpieces . 
9 DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
9.1 Sample Size 
The primary objective is to  
 is statistically  greater than 50%.  
Under the assumption that the true population response rate is 76%, 35 subjects will provide 80% power to reject the primary hypothesis.  To allow for up to a 10% dropout rate, 39 subjects will be enrolled.   The 
planned sample size of up to 35 subjects was determined based on clinical judgment to provide sufficient 
information to evaluate safety and efficacy of RF treatment for wrinkle reduction  in the face and/or 
submentum region.  
9.2 Analysis Sets  
The efficacy analysis set will include all enrolled subjects who complete one RF treatment session using 
the study device . 
 The safety analysis set will include all subjects enrolled in the study who start the RF treatment session 
using the study device.  
 Missing data will not be imputed for efficacy or safety endpoints.  
9.3 Analysis of Efficacy  Endpoint s 
9.3.1  
 
     
 
9.3.2 Endpoi nt Analyses  
 efficacy endpoints will be analyzed descriptively.

9.4 Safety Analyses  
Device -related and procedure -related adverse device effects (A DEs) and subjects who prematurely 
terminate from the study due to an adverse device effect, including the treatment -related pain ratings, 
will be tabulated and analyzed. For a given A DE term, co unting will be done by subject, not by event, i.e. 
for a subject reporting the same A DE more than once, the event will be counted only once, at the most 
severe and longest duration .  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each A DE Term will be 
descriptively summarized. Subject pain ratings during treatment will also be summarized descriptively.

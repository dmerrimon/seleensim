Title: A Phase 2 Multicenter Study Evaluating the Efficacy of KTE -X19 in Subjects with 
Relapsed/Refracto ry Mantle Cell Lymphoma (ZUMA -2)
Indication: The treatment of adult subjects with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma
(r/rMCL ).
Study Design: Study KTE -C19-102 is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label study evaluating the efficacy 
of KTE -X19 in subjects with r/r MCL.
Cohort 1 w ill enroll and treat up to approximately 90 subjects with cyclophosphamide 
and fludarabine conditioning chemotherapy, followed by a target dose of 2 x106anti‑
CD19 CAR T cells per kg body weight. This cohort will include at least 60 butup to 
approximately 80 subjects treated with KTE -X19 (referredto as KTE -X19 subjects in 
this document) and 10 subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleu cel (referredto as 
axicabtagene ciloleu cel subjects in this document) . The KTE -X19 subjects in this 
cohort w ill form the basis for hypothesis testing on the primary endpoint.  
Cohort 2 w ill enroll and treat up to 40 KTE -X19 subjects with cycloph osphamide and 
fludarabine conditioning chemotherapy, followed by a target dose of 0.5 x106anti-
CD19 chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR )T cells per kg body weigh t.
Each subject will proceed through the following study periods:
Screening 
Enrollment /Leukapheresis 
Bridging therapy if applicable
Conditioning chemotherapy 
Investigational product (IP) treatment 
Post-treatment assessment 
Long -term follow -up period
For study requirements assigned to each study period, refer to Section 7 for details.   
Study Objectives : The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of KTE -X19, as measured by 
objective response rate (ORR) , in subjects with r/r MCL. Secondary objectives will 
include assessing the safety and tolerability of KTE -X19,additional efficacy endpoints , 
andchange in the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D)scores from 
baseline to Month 6.
Hypothesis : This study uses an open -label 2-cohort design .
Among the Cohort 1 KTE -X19 subjects ,with a target 50% response rate per 
independent review , analternative hypothesis will be tested against a null hypothesis 
that the response rate is 25% or less. The hypothesis is that the ORR to KTE -X19 per
independent review is significantly greater than 25% in Cohort 1 KTE -X19 subjects .
No hypothesis will be tested in Cohort 1 
axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects and Cohort 2
KTE -X19 subjects . Exploratory analyses w ill be conducted on the data collected from 
these subjects.

Endpoints:
Sample Size : Up to approximately 130 will be enrolled in the study: 
90 subjects in Cohort 1 (10 axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects and approximately 
80KTE -X19 subjects ) at 2 x106anti‑ CD19 CAR T cells per kg body weight 
Up to 40KTE -X19 subjects in Cohort 2 at 0.5 x106anti‑ CD19 CAR T cells 
per kg body weight
Study Eligibility : Refer to Section 5for a detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria .
Treatm ent: Bridging Therapy
At the discretion of the investigator, bridging therapy may be considered for 
subjects particularly with high disease burden at screening (eg , >25% m arrow  
involvement or ≥ 1000 leukemic phase mantle cell s/mm3in the peripheral 
circulation).  
Bridging therapy is allow ed with (1) dexamethasone or other corticosteroid,
(2)ibrutinib ,or (3) acalabrutinib .
If prescribed, bridging therapy must be administered after leukapheresis and 
completed at least 5 days prior to initiating conditioning chemotherapy. 
Refer to Section 6fordosing and further details .
Conditioning Chemotherapy Treatment:
KTE -X19 or axicabtagene ciloleucel isadministered after a conditioning 
chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and 
cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2/day, administered x 3 days. Refer to Section 6for 
chemotherapy treatment details .

Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 5of 92 29 October 2018Investigational Product:
KTE -X19 or axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment consists of a single infusion of 
CAR -transduced autologous Tcells administered intravenously at a target dose of 2 
x 106anti-CD19 CAR Tcells/kg ( Cohort 1) or 0.5 x 106anti-CD19 CAR Tcells/kg 
(Cohort 2).  Under circumstances where subjects in itially respond and subsequently 
relapse, subjects may be eligible for a second course of conditioning chemotherapy 
and KTE -X19 or axicabtagene ciloleucel . Refer to Section 6for treatment details 
and Section 7.12.10 for retreatment details.
Procedures: At specific time points as outlined in the schedule of assessments, subjects will undergo 
the following assessments /procedures: collection of informed consent ; general medical 
history ,including previous treatments for MCL ; physical exam ,including vital signs 
and performance status ; neurological assessments ; blood draws for complete blood 
count (CBC), chemistry panels, cytokines, C -reactive protein, lymphocyte subsets, anti -
CD19 CAR antibodies, replication -competent retrovirus (RCR) ,and anti -CD19 CAR 
Tcellsanalysis. Wom en of childbearing p otential will undergo a urine or serum 
pregnancy test. 
Subjects will also undergo a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram 
(ECHO), brain magnetic resonance image (MRI), a positron emission tomography -
computed tomography ( PET-CT), bone marrow  aspirate/biopsy ,and leukapheresis. 
Routinely throughout the conduct of the study, subjects w ill be asked to complete the 
EQ-5D questionnaire, report concomitant medications and AEs, and will have their 
disease assessed.
Data Safety 
Monitoring Board :An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) w ill review safety and/or 
efficacy data 4 times during this study. The DSMB w ill first meet to review safety data 
when 10 subjects in Cohort 1 have been enrolled and treated w ith anti-CD19 CAR T
cellsandfollowed for 30 days. The DSMB w ill meet for the second time to review 
both safety and efficacy data after 20 s ubjects in Cohort 1have been enrolled , treated ,
and have had the opportunity to complete the 3
-month disease assessment.  The DSMB 
will meet f or the third time to review both safety and efficacy data after 10 subjects in 
Cohort 2 have been enrolled, treated ,and have had the opportunity to be followed for 
30 days. The DSMB w ill meet for the fourth time to review safety data after 44 subjects 
in Cohort 1 have been enrolled, treated, and have had the opportunity to be follow ed for 
at least 30 days, with focus on the safety data from the 6 KTE -X19 subjects treated 
most recently in this cohort. The DSMB will be chartered to make trial conduct 
recommendations based on an analysis of risk vs benefit.  The DSMB may meet more 
often as needed.  Refer to Section 9.10 and Section 9.11.
Statistical 
Considerations :This study uses an open -label, 2 -cohort design . Among the Cohort 1 KTE -X19
subjects , with a target 50% response rate per independent review , an alternative 
hypothesis willbetested against a null hypothesis that the response rate is 25% or less. 
For the test of efficacy in the Cohort 1 KTE -X19 subjects , this study has at least
96% power to distinguish between an active therapy with a 50% true response rate from 
a therapy with a response rate of 25% or less w ith a 1 -sided alpha level of 0.025. No 
hypothesis will be tested on Cohort 1 axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects and on Cohort 2 .
Four interim analyses will be performed in 
Cohort 1,and 1interim analysis will be 
performed in Cohort 2 .  One prim ary analysis will be performed after 6 0 Cohort 1 
KTE -X19 subjects have been enrolled and treated and have had the opportunity to be
assessed for response 6 months after the Week 4 disease assessment .

Mantle cell ly mphoma is an aggressive, generall y incurable, B -cell malignancy , representing 
approximately  6% of non -Hodgkin ly mphomas (NHL s). Approximately 4000  new cases are 
diagnosed yearly in the United States (Leukemia & Lymphoma Societ y 2014 ).  The l ymphoma 
cells are thought to originate from naïve pregerminal center B cellswithin the mantle zone ,and 
they typically express CD5
, CD19, CD20, surface IgM, and surface IgD (Drey ling 2014), but not 
CD11c (Kraus et al, 2010) .  More than 95% of MCL s carry  translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32)
,
which places the cy clin D1 gene in proximity  of the immunoglobulin heavy  chain locus, 
resulting in overexpression of cy clin D1, which can be detected b y cytogenetics or fluorescence 
in situ hy bridization (National Compreh ensive Cancer Network 2017 )
.  Most patients are male, 
and the 
median age of diagnosis is 68 years(Fakhri and Kahl 2017 ).  Patients ty picall y present 
with advanced l ymphadenopathy , and also show extranodal involvement of thespleen, bone 
marrow, and gastrointestinal ( GI)tract (Drey ling et al, 2014 ; Rajabi and Sweetenham 2015 ; 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2017 ; Vose 2017
).  
Prognosis varies based on clinical 
and laboratory  parameters and can be estimated using the mantle cell international prognostic 
index.  This index uses the 4 independent prognostic factors of age, performance status, lactate 
dehy drogenase (LDH), and leukocy te count to classify  patients as low risk (
60% to 83% 5-year 
overall survival [OS] ), intermediate (35 % to 63% 5-year OS), or high risk (20 % to 34% 5-year 
OS) (Hoster et al, 2008; Hoster et al, 2014 ) .  
2.1. First -line T
herapy
Most patients require s ystemic therap y at the time of diagnosis.  F irst-line therapy  for MCL  
typicall y includes chemotherap y in combination with a CD20 targeting antibody (Table 1). 
Combination r egimens include rituximab with cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin vincristine, and 
prednisone (R -CHOP )
;rituximab with cy clophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R- CVP )
;
and bendamustine and rituximab (BR) ( Lenz et al, 2005 ; Kluin -Nelemans  et al, 2012 ; Flinn et 
al, 2014 ).  Treatment intensification for youn ger patients with regimens ,such as rituximab in 
combination with fractionated cy clophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone 
(hyper-CVAD) alternating with high- dose methotrexate and cy tarabine (MA) 
(R-HyperCVAD/MA) ( Romaguera et al, 2005 ; Romaguera et al, 2010 )
,or high-dose 
chemotherap y followed by  autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) in first remission
(Drey ling et al, 2005 ),have led to improved outcomes at the expense of additional toxicity . 
Despite high initial response rates to these therapies, almost all patients eventually  develop 
progressive disease.

2.2. Therapy f or R elapsed/ Refractory MCL
There is no established paradigm for the treatment of r/r MCL.  Treatment options includes 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , proteasome inhibito rs, immunomodulatory  drugs , tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors, and stem cell transplant (SCT) . The ch oice of regimen is influenced b y prior therap y, 
comorbidities, and tumor chemosensitivity . 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy  combination regimens used in r/r MCL include fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide (FC) , although this regimen is less efficacious in the relapsed setting than as a 
first-line treatment, and is associated with substantial toxicities (Cohen et al, 2001 ).  For patients 
with poorer fitness, less intensive therapies are considered based on first -line treatment data ,
including r ituximab alone, chlorambucil, cladribine, or thalidomide, usually in combination with 
rituximab, but these single cy totoxic agent -based regimens have limited efficacy  compared to
multi- agent approaches (Foran et al, 2000 ; Kaufmann et al, 2004 ; Inwards et al, 2008; Sachanas 
et al, 2011).  
Stem cell transplant has a role in r/r MCL , although its use is limited to those patients who are 
younger and have good fitness.  AutoSCT is more commonly  used than allogeneic, and ,in 
eligible patients ,results in approximately  25% to 35% event -free survival after 2 to3 years of 
follow -up ( Ketterer et al, 1997; Vose et al, 2000 ).  Allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) has 
been investigated in multiple single insti tution and registry  studies in relapsed and refractory  
disease, including patients who have previously  undergone autoSCT.  Results from these studies 
are variable, likel y in part due to selection bias in single institution and registry based studies, but 
suggest approximately  25% of patients undergoing alloSCT achieve durable remissions if their 
disease is demonstrated to be chemosensitive prior to transplant (Rajabi and Sw eetenham 2015). 
KTE -C19-102 Kite Pharm a, Inc.
Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 18of 92 29 October 2018However, in these studies ,alloSCT has been associated with high morbidity  and non -relapse 
mortality , mostly  due to graft versus host disease and its complications and affecting 30 % to 
40% of patients.
The agents bortezomib, lenalidomid e,ibrutinib , and acalabrutinib have been approved in the 
United States within the last 10 y ears for the treatment of r/r MCL  (see Table 2), and 
temsirolimus is approved in the EU. Bortezomib is an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome and was 
evaluated in a 
single ‑arm, open -label, multicenter trial of 155 patients with r/r MCL  who h ad 
received at least 1 prior therap y (Fisher et al, 2006) .  Thirty -seven percent had disease refractory  
to the last treatment regimen.  The ORR based on independent radiologic review of computed 
tomograph y (CT)scans was 31% ,including 6% complete responses.  The median durat ion of 
response (DOR) 
was 9.3 months , and the median time to progression was 6.1 months 
(borte zomib USPI ).  The most common Grade 3 or greater toxicities were peripheral neuropathy  
(13%), fatigue (12%), and thrombocy topenia (11%).  
Lenalidomide, a second -generation thalidomide derivative, was studied in a single -arm, open -
label, multicenter, trial of 134 patients with r/r MCL (Goy et al, 2013 ).  Patients were required to 
have received prior treatment with an anthracy cline or mitoxantrone, cy clophosphamide, 
rituxim ab, and bortezomib. Fifty
-three percent had 4 or more prior therapies, 60% had disease 
refractory  to bortezomib, and 29% had a prior autoSCT .  The 
ORR based on independent 
radiologic review of CT scans was 26% ; 1% achieved a complete response (CR) ( lenalidomide 
USPI ).  The median DOR was 16. 6months, and the median progression- free survival (PFS)was 
4 months.  The most co mmon G rade 3 or Grade 4adverse events ( AEs) were neutropenia (43%), 
thrombocytopenia (28%), anemia (11%), pneumonia (8%), and fatigue (7%). 
Ibrutinib is a covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s t yrosine kinase.  The safet y and efficacy  of ibrutinib 
was evaluated in a single -arm, open- label, multicenter, trial of 111 patients with r/r MCL  who 
had received at least 1,but no more than 5 prior therapies (Wang et al, 2013 ). The ORR based 
on investigator review of CT scans was 6 8%,including 21% complete responses.  The median 
DOR was 17. 5months
, and the median PFS was13.9 months.  The most common G rade 3 or 
higher toxicities were neutropenia (16%), thrombocy topenia (11%), and diarrhea (6%).  
Despite available therapies, almost all patients with r/r MCL  die from progressive disease (refer 
to Table 3) .  Martin et al ,conducted a large (n=114) retrospective cohort study  of response and 
survival in patients treated after primary  or acquired ibrutinib resistance ( Martin et al, 2016 ).  Of 
the104patients with data available, 73 patients underwent subsequent treatment after stopping 
ibrutinib , and 61 subjects were evaluable for efficacy .  Outcomes were poor, with an ORR of 
26%, CR ra te of 7% , and median OS of 5.8 months. Cheah et al ,reported similar results ( ORR 
32% and median OS of 8 .4months) in a cohort of 31 patients (Cheah et a l, 2015 ) . There are 
limited other data on the efficacy  of bortezomib ,lenalidomide , or other agents in patients who
have progressed on ibrutinib therap y.  There is an urgent unmet need for new treatment options 
that can induce durable responses in a signi ficant fraction of patients.  
Most recentl y, acalabrutinib, an oral B ruton’s ty rosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), was approved in 
the US for the treatment of relapsed or refractory  MCL  (acalabrutinib USPI ).  This agent was 
studied in an open- label, multicenter, Phase 2 study  of 124 patients with MCL  who had at least 
1prior therap y (median 2prior lines of therap y;range:  1 to 5 prior lines), and those who had

Wang et al, 2017 ).  Thus, this population was less heavily  pretreated compared with patients in 
the trials of bortezomib, len
alidomide, and ibrutinib.  After a median follow
-up of 15.2 months, 
the ORR was 81% and the CR rate was 40% ( acalabrutinib USPI ).  Among all treated patients, 
the medians for DOR, PFS, and OS were not reached, and the 12 -month PFS and OS rates were 
67%, and 87%, respectively .  The most common Grade 3 and higher AEs were neutropenia 
(13patients, 10%), anemia (11 patients, 9%), and pneumonia (6 patients, 5%) (Wang et al, 
2017).

2.3. CD19 and E xpression
CD19 is a 95 kD transmembrane protein expressed only  in the B- cell lineage. It is expressed in 
all normal B cells starting at the pre -
B-cell stage until the final diffe rentiation stage and is not 
expressed in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or most plasma cells.  The pattern of CD19 
expression is maintained in B-cell malignancies, including all subt ypes of B-cell NHL, chronic 
lymphocy tic leukemia (CLL), and non-T- ce ll acut e lymphoblastic leukemia ( Blanc et al, 2011)
with the exception of multiple my eloma.
2.4. Anti -CD19 CAR T-cell Product
Anti- CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are autologous human T cells that have been 
engineered to express an extracellular single -chain variable fragment with specificit y for CD19 
linked to an intracellular signaling part comprised of signaling domains from CD28 and CD3ζ 
(CD3 -zeta) m olecules arranged in tandem.

2.4.1. Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is manufactured for subjects with ly mphoma s that are characterized as
not being associated with circulating tumor cells ( ie, diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, primary  
mediastinal B
-cell lymphoma, and follicular l ymphoma ).  Briefl y, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) are obtained by  leukaph eresis and Ficoll separation.  
PBMCs are activated b y 
culturing with an anti -CD3 antibody  in the presence of recombinant IL -2.  Stimulated cells are 
transduced with a retroviral vector containing an anti- CD19 CAR gene and propagated in culture 
to generate sufficient engineered T cells f or administration.  
Patients with r/r MCL  may  have tumor cells in the peripheral blood , which is associated with a 
poor prognosis (Argatoff et al, 1997
).  When t he first 10 subjects in Cohort 1 were dosed with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel, it was observed that the incidence and amount of circulating leukemic

Cheah et al, 2015 ; Cheah et al, 2016).  Because the axicabtagene ciloleucel manufacturing 
process is not optimized to remove circulating tumor cells from the manufacturing process 
stream, all subsequent patients were dosed using KTE -X19.  
2.4.2. KTE -X19
KTE -X19 is manufactured for subjects with l ymphomas that are characterized by  having high 
numbers of CD19- expressing circulating tumor cells (B -cell acute l ymphoblastic leukemia , CLL,
and MCL ).  Briefl y,from the leukaph eresis product ,the T cells in the harvested leukocy tes are 
enriched b y binding t o magnetic beads coated with anti- CD4 and anti -CD8 antibodies.  T cells
are activated b y culturing with anti -CD3 and anti -CD28 antibodies, andare then transduced with 
a retroviral vector containing an anti-CD19 CAR gene. These engineered T cells are then
propagated in culture to generate a sufficient number of cells for administration.

Kite Pharma , Inc., (hereafter referred to as Kite ) is developing an eACT™ ( KTE -X19) that 
targets CD19 expression on B-cell malignancies. The CAR vector construct is identical to the 
one used in the NCI pro tocol ( 09-C- 0082; IND 13871 ).  Kite ,in conjunction with the NCI  
Surgery  Branch ,has developed a rapid, closed, and bead -less process for the generation of the 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells.  Closing the process retains the characteristics of the T- cell product 
(Better et al, 2014 ).  Refer to the current IB for m ore details.

3.1. General Study Design
Study  KTE -C19-102 is a Phase 2,multicenter, open -label study  evaluating the safet y and 
efficacy  of KTE -X19 in subjects with r/r MCL . 
This study  is designed to examine the safet y and efficacy of KTE -X19 in patients who have r/r 
MCL  that hasprogressed on prior chemotherapy , anti- CD20 antibody , and ibrutinib or 
acalabrutinib .  The study will evaluate the ORR and durability of response after treatment with 
KTE -X19.  An open -label, 2 -cohort design is used, with a target ORR in the alternative 
hypothesis of 50% and a futility  criterion that the ORR is no more than 25%. Up to 
approximately  130 subjects with r/r MCL  in total will be enrolled and treated to evaluate the 
efficacy  of KTE -X19.  Cohort 1 will treat up to approximately  90subjects at a target dose of 
cells/kg, including up to approximately  80 KTE -X19 subjects and 
10axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects. The 
Cohort 1 KTE -X19 subjects will form the basis for 
statistical hy pothesis testing on the primary  endpoint. Cohort 2 will treat up to 40 KTE -X19
subjects at a target dose of anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.
Each subject will proceed through the following study  periods:
Screening 
Enrollment /Leukapheresis 
Bridging 
therap y,if applicable
Conditioning chemotherapy  
Investigational product (IP) treatment 
Post-
treatment assessment 
Long-term follow -up (LTFU)
An independent DSMB will review safety  and/or efficacy  data 4times during this study . The 
DSMB will first meet to review safet y data when 10 Cohort 1 subjects have been enrolled and 
treated with anti -CD19 CAR T cellsand followed for 30days.  The DSMB will meet for the 
second time to review safety  and efficacy  data after 20 Cohort 1 subjects have been enrolled and 
treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cellsand have had the opportunity  to complete the 3- month 
disease assessment.  The DSMB will meet for the
third time to review both safet y and efficacy 
data after 10 subjects in Cohort 2 have been en rolled and treated with KT E
-X19 and have had 
the opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s. The DSMB will meet for the fourth time to r eview 
safet y data after 
44 subjects in Cohort 1 have been enrolled and treated with anti-CD19 CAR 
Tcellsand have had the opportunity  to be followed for at least 30 day s, with focus on the safet y 
data from the 6 KTE -X19 subjects treated most recently in this cohort. The DSMB will be 
chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an anal ysis of risk vs benefit.  The 
DSMB may  meet more often as needed.

3.2. Participating Sites
Approximate ly 40centers located in North America and Europe will parti cipate in this study . 
During the conduct of the study , additional regions, countries, or sites may be added as 
necessary .
Sites that do not enroll a subject within 3 months of their site being activated, will be considered 
for closure.
3.3. Number of Subjects
Participants in this trial will be referred to as “subjects.” It is anticipated that up to 
approxi mately  130 subjects will be enrolled and treatedinthis study .
It should be noted that Kite may  choose to close enrollment at any  time. RefertoSection 10for 
statistical considerations of the protocol ,including sample size estimations.
3.4. Replacement of Subjects
Subjects will continue to be enrolled until the specified numbers of subjects are attained in the 
modified intent

Study Duration
3.5.1. Study Duration for Individual S ubjects 
The duration of the stud y for individual subjects will vary . For a subject who completes the 
entire protocol from the date of informed consent through the completion of the LTFU period,
the duration of the stud y will take approximately  15 y ears to complete. However, individual 
study  duration will vary  depending on a subject’s screening requirements, response to treatment ,
and survival. 
The need for prolonged follow -up is based on the potential persistence of gene transfer vectors in 
treated subjects.
3.5.2. Completion of Study
Complet ion of the study  is defined as the tim e at which the last subject completes the LTFU
period visit, is considered lost to follow -up, withdraws consent, or dies.

All subjects must sign and date the Independent Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC )approved consent form before initiating an y study -specific procedures or activities 
that are not part of a subject’s routine care. Refer to Section 7 for details.
Each subject who enters the screening period , which starts when the subject signs the informed 
consent form, will receive a unique subject identification (ID)number. This numbe r will be used 
to identify  the subject throughout the stud y and must be used on all study documentation related 
to the subject. The subject identification will never be changed even if the subject is rescreened.
Furthermore, the subject IDnumber must rema in constant throughout the entire clinical study ;it 
must not be changed after enrollment or if the subject is rescreened or retreated.

6.2.3.1. Dose Ratio nale 
This study is designed to evaluate safe :efficac of two anti-C . . . 
The r ecommended ti·eatme nt re imen for Coho1 i I 
is based on the favorable safety:efficacy profile seen in the 
ZUMA -I ti·ial- a Phase 1/2 multicenter study investigating the safety and efficacy of 
axicabtage ne ci loleucel in subjects with refracto 1 y aggressive NHL, wh ich met its primaiy 
endpoint with an O RR of 82% and CR rate of 54% (Locke et al, 2017 ). 
At the ti me of the interim analysis 3, 13 subjects (46%) had exper ienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 
nemologic toxicit ies (Sect ion 2.5). A ph aimacokinetic analysis of KTE-X19 in subjects dosed 
with KTE-X19 in ZUMA -2 Coho1i I (data cutoff: 15 June 2017) demo nsu-ated an ap proximate 
3-to 4-fold higher peak expa nsion and cumulative expos me (area under curve (AUC)o- 2s) 
relative to that seen in subjects ti·eated in ZUMA -I ). Give n that CAR T cell peak and AUC0-2s 
are assoc iated with Grade 3 or higher nemologic toxicities in ZUMA -I patients (Neelap u et al, 
2016 ), the spon sor opted to reduce the KTE -X I 9 target dose to - anti-CD 19 CAR 
T cells/kg to evaluate safety:efficacy of a lower dose . Therefore , subjects emolled into ZUMA -2 
Coho1i 2 are administered a target dose of- anti-C D19 CAR T cells/kg, with a 
maxim um dose of- anti-C D19 CAR T cells for subjects~ 100 kg. 
6.2.4. Concomitant Therapy 
Investigators may additiona lly presc ribe any other conc01nitant medicatio ns or ti·eatme nt deemed

serious adverse events ( SAE s) will be recorded.
Specific c oncomitant medication collection requirements and instructions are included in the
case report form (CRF ) completion guidelines.
6.2.5. Excluded Medication s
Corticosteroid therap y at a pharmacologic dose (> 5 mg/day  of prednisone or equivalent doses of 
other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for 7 days prior to 
leukapheresis and 5days prior to anti -CD19 CAR T cells administration unless used for 
bridging therap y (refer to Section 6.3.2).  
Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs should also be avoide d for 3 months after 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells administration unless 
used to manage anti-CD19 CAR T cell related 
toxicities ( refer to Section 6.4).  Other medications that may  interfere with evaluation of the IP, 
such as non

Clinical Protocol Kite Phanna , Inc. 
Final 
Mono nuclear cells will be obtained by leuka pheresis (12 to 15 liter apheresis with a goal to target 
approximately 5 to 10 x 109 mononuclear cells) . The leukap heresed cells are then p ackaged for 
expedited shipment to the C PF as described in the Investigatio nal P roduct Manual. 
Upon ~mival at the CPF, each subject's leukapheresed product will be processed to emich for the 
T cell contai ning PBMC fractio n. T cells are then stimulated to expand and transduced with a 
retroviral vecto r to introduce the CAR gene. The T cells are then expa nded and c1yopreserved to 
generate the IP per C PF standa rd operating proced ures (SOPs). Afte r the p roduct has passe d 
certain release tests , it will be shipped back to the tr eating facility. Following comple tion of each 
subject's conditioning chem otherapy regime n, su bjects will receive their respect ive KTE-X19 or 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
6.3.2. Bridging Therap y (Admini stered after Leukaphere sis and Completed at 
Least 5 Days Prior to Initiating Conditioning Chemotherap y) 
At the discretion of the investigato r and after discussio n with the medical monitor, bridging 
therapy m ay be considered for any subject, pa1 t icu larly those with h igh disease burden at 
scree ning (eg, > 25% maITow involve ment and/or~ 1000 leukemic phase mantle cells/mm3 in 
the peripheral circulation). 
Bridging therapy is to be admini stered after leukap heresis and must be complete d at least 5 days 
prior to initiating conditioning chem otherapy. 
If bridging therapy is adminis tered, the patient must undergo another PET-CT to assess disease 
status prior to receiving cond itioning chemot herapy and subseq uent anti- CD19 CAR T cells 
infusion. 
6.3.3. Cyclopho sphamide and Fludarabine (Days -5 Through -3 Before Infu sion of 
anti-CD19 CART cells) 
Subjects will receive a non-myeloablative conditio ning regimen consisting of cyclophosp hamide 
and fludarab ine to induce lymphocyte depletio n and cr eate an op timal environment for expa nsion 
of anti-CD19 CART cells in vivo . Sub'ects will initiate cond itionin chemot hera with 
cyclo phosphainide and fludarab ine before 
the r eceiving anti- CD19 CART cells. The 3-day cond itioning chemot herapy regimen will be

Administration of conditioning chemotherap y correlates with clinical responses to adoptive cell 
therapy (Dudley  et al, 2008 ).Specificall y, there appears to be a link between adequate 
lymphodepletion and adoptively -transferred T- cell expansion and function.  The depth and 
duration of the l ymphodepletion in pre -clinical models correlate with the anti -tumor activity  of 
the 
adoptively -transferred ,tumor -specific CD8+T cells (Gattinoni et al, 2005 ).  
Lym phodepletion may  function by  eradicating cy tokine sinks for the transferred cells, 
eliminating regulatory  T cells, or enhancing the activation of antigen -presenting cell s (Klebanoff 
et al, 2005).  Combined treatment with c yclophosphamide and fludarabine represents 
a pot ent 
lymphodepleting regimen.  The ZUMA -1 study  of axicabtagene cilouleucel in aggressive large 
B-cell ly mphoma used the same cy clophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning regimen that is 
being u sedin the ZUMA -2 study  (axicabtagene ciloleucel USPI ).  Th isregimen was tolerated 
prior to infusion of the cellular product and resulted in a favorable risk ‑benefit profile.  Similar 
doses of cy clophosphamide and fludarabine have been administered to subjects with B -cell 
malignancies prior to anti
-CD19 CAR T cellinfusion (NCI Protocol 09‑C ‑0082) ( Kochenderfer 
et al, 2016
)and were shown to increase levels of cy tokines known to support T- cell expansion 
and survival (Kochenderfer et al, 2017 ).  This treatment combination was also used as a reduced 
non-myeloablative conditio ning regimen for patients with B -cell malignancies who were 
undergoing alloSCT and resulted in tolerable toxicities
(Khouri e t al,1998).

Research staff should refer to the SOAs (Table 8and Table 9) for an outline of the procedures 
required .The visit schedule is calculated from anti-CD19 CAR T cells infusion on Day  0. 
An overview of study  assessments/procedures is outlined below. A description for each period 
of the study  is provided in Section 7.12. Refer to the CRF completion guidelines for data 
collection requirements and d ocumentation of study procedures.
7.1. Informed Consent
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study , the investigator is responsible for obtaining 
written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study  design, 
anticipated benefits
,and the potential risks . Subjects should sign the most c urrent IRB/IEC 
approved informed consent form ( ICF)prior to any  study -specific activity  or procedure is 
performed.
Theconsent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study  is to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records. If the subject agrees to participate ,the ICF is to be 
signed and personally  dated by  the subject and by  the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion. The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution 
policy  and IRB/IEC requirements with a cop y of the I CF provided to the subject .
All subjects who are enrolled into the study  should be re -consented with any updated version of 
the IRB/IEC approved ICF if re levant to their participation in the study .
7.2. Demographic Data
Demographic data will be collected to include sex , age ,race, ethnicity , and country  of enrollment
to study  their possible association with subject safety
 and treatment effec tiveness.
7.3. Medical and Treatment History
Relevant medical history prior to the start of AEreporting will be collected. Relevant me dical 
history  is defined as data on the subject’s concurrent medical condition that would be typically  
share din a referral let ter. All findin
gs will be recorded in the CRF s.
In addition to the medical history , all history  related to the subject’s disease, treatment, and 
response to treatment will be collected and must date back to the original diagnosis.
For subjects who are being referred from another clinic or institution to the participating research 
center, copies from the subjects chart shoul d be obtained.

Life-5 Dimensions
Physical exam
swill be performed during screen ing and a t times noted in the SOA. Changes 
noted in subsequent exams when compared to the baseline exam will be reported as an AE . 
During IP administration/hospitalization, vital signs
,including blood pressure, heart rate, ox ygen 
saturation, and temperature, will be monitored before and after the anti-CD19 CAR T cells
infusion and then routinely  (every  4to 6 hours) while hospitalized . If the subject has a fever
(temperature 38.3°C or greater ) at an y time during hospitalization , vital signs will be monitored 
more frequently  as clinically  indicated.
Performance status 
as measured b y the ECOG scale and will be performed to qu antify  the 
subject’s general well -being and ability  to perform activities of daily  life.
The EQ-5D will be completed by  the subject, prior to any  other assessment, at the screening visit 
and at other times noted in the SOA.  Subjects who are blind or illiterate may  have the EQ -5D 
questions read to them by  the study  staff.  The study  staff, however, cannot interpret any  of the 
questions for the subject.  A subject may  be exempt from completing the questionnaire if he or 
she is unable to read the questionnaire in one of the country  languages available.
The EQ -5D is a 
2-page generic patient questionnaire for assessing the overall health status of a 
subject.  The EQ -5D consists of a 5- dimension descriptive sy stem ,including questions on 
mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety /depression ,and a visual analogue 
scale (VAS) thatallows the respondent to record health on a vertical scale (eg, best health to 
worst health) , thus allowing a quantitative measure of health outcome.  
7.5. Neurological Assessment 
Neurological assessments will be standardized by  using the Mini -Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) standard version 2.0. The MMSE is a 5 to 10minute, 11 -question measure that 
examines various areas of cognitive function: orientation, attention, immediate recall, short -term 
recall, language, and the abilit y to follow simple verbal and written commands.
The MMSE is divided into 2sections.  The first part requires vocal responses to the examiner's 
questions. In the second part of the exam, the subject is asked to follow verbal and written 
instructions, writ e a sentence spontaneousl y, and copy  a geometric figure. 
A full neurological assessment will be completed during screening to establish a baseline.  For 
subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, s ubsequent post -baseline assessments will be performed before 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells administration on Day  0, Day 1, Day 3, Day 5,Day 7,and every  other 
day while hospitalized, as well as on Day 28 and Month 3.  For subjects enrolled in Cohort 2, a 
subsequent post -baseline assessment will be performed on Day 28. If the asses sment shows 
neurologic function has not returned to baseline (±3point s
) on Day 28, then the MMSE will 
continue to beperform edat 
Month 3 and every  3 months until the results have returned to 
baseline (± 3points) or until Month 24.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 40of 92 29 October 2018Every  attempt should be made to dedicate a single research staff member familiar with or trained 
in the administration of the MMSE to conduct the assessment to minimize inter -rater variability .  
If CNS sy mptoms persist, continue to perform the MMSE every  2days until resolution of 
symptoms or discharged from the hospital.
7.6. Bone Marrow Biopsy
A
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy  will be performed at screening ,if not previously  performed
within 4 weeks of signing consent ,to assess bone marrow involvement.   The bone marrow
aspirate and biops y will be assessed and confirmed forthe presence of MCL.
Subjects with a 
positive bone marrow at screening or those who do not have a baseline bone marrow biops y 
available , must undergo another bone marrow aspirate and biops y upon first determination of a 
complete response 
viaPET. Subjects with a negative bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (ie,no MCL )
at screening , and patients with a partial metabolic response , stable disease ( SD)or progressive 
disease ( PD)at 
any disease response assessment time point do not require a follow -up bone 
marrow aspirate and biopsy  (Figure 3) 
Figure 3. Bone Marrow Assessment Schema
Abbreviations: BM, bone marrow; ICF, informed consent form; PET -CT, positron emission tomography -

To confirm a CR, the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy  must show no evidence of disease by  
morphology  or,if indeterminate by  morphology ,it must be negative by  immunohistochemistry .  
After CR is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy, addition al bone marrow biopsies are only 
required in case of clinical suspicion of disease progression in the bone marrow only. Refer 
to Section 7.8, Appendix 1 (Section 18.1) , and Appendix 2 (Section 18.2) for treatment response

sample collec ted to evaluate HLH or other toxic ities shou ld be submitted to the central 
laborato1y as outlined in the central laborato 1 y ma nual. 
7.7. Lumbar Puncture 
Subjects with symptoms of central nervous system ma lignancy, such as new onset severe 
headac hes, neck stiffness , or any focal ne urolog ic findings on physical exam , will have lumbar 
punct ure perfo1med at the screening visit for examination of cerebral spinal fluid. In addition, 
lumbai· puncture should be perfonned as applicable for subjects with new onset of~ Grade 2 
neurologic toxici ties after anti- CD19 CART cells infusion (r efer to the c mTent IB). Adeq uate 
platelet suppo1i shou ld be provided prior to perfo1ming a lumbar puncture ( eg, platelet 
> 50 000/mm3). 
7.8. Disease Response Assessment 
Subjects will be evaluated for disease respo nse by the site investigato r at times indicated in the 
SOA. For subjects enrolled in Coho1i 1, disease assess ments will be evaluated per the r evise d 
IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma as described in Appendix 1 (Section 18.1) 
(Cheson et al, 2007 ). Flow cytometric, molecular, or cytoge netic studies will not be used to 
dete1 mine respo nse. For subjects enrolled in Coho1 i 2, disease assess ments by the site 
investigator will be evaluate d per the Lugano Classificat ion, as described in Appendix 2 
(Section 18.2) (Cheson et al, 2014). 
Baseline PET-CT scans of the n eck, chest, abdo men, and pelvis, along with the appropriate 
imaging of all other sites of disease , are required. Su bjects will have their first post anti- CD19 
CAR T cells infusion p lanned PET-CT tumo r assessme nt 4 weeks following the anti- CD19 
CART cells infusion and at regu lar interva ls as highlighted in the SOA during the post-
treatme nt and LTFU po1iio n of the study. 
Post anti- CD19 CART cells admin istration disease assess ments will be used to detennine the 
time when progressive disease occurs . Subjects with symptoms suggestive of disease 
progression shou ld be evaluated for progression at the time symptoms occur even if it is off 
sched ule as per the SOA. 
A bone manow aspirate and biopsy will be perfonned in subjects who are being assesse d for CR, 
as described in Appe ndix 1 (Sectio n 18.1) and Append ix 2 (Section 18.2 ). Per the r evise d IWG 
Respo nse Criteria for Malignant Lymp homa ( Cheson et al, 2007 ) and Lu gano Classi ficatio n 
(Cheson et al, 2014 ), a bone manow aspirate and biopsy must be perfo1med when the su bject 
had bone maiTow involveme nt with lymp homa prior to therapy or if new abno1malities in the 
peripheral blood counts or blood smea r cause clinical suspicion of bone maiTow involvement

study  was unknown, a bone marrow evaluation must be conducted to confirm a CR .  The bone 
marrow aspirate and biopsy  must show no evidence of disease by  morphology  or if indeterminate 
by morphology , it must be negative b y immunohistochemistr y to assign a CR to treatment.  
In addition to the investigator ’s assessment, Independent Radiology  Review Committee ( IRRC)
review per Lugano Classification (Cheson et al, 2014) will be performed for both Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2. PET-CT scans of all subj ects evaluated for disease response will be submitted to and 
reviewed b y an independent central reviewer. For subjects who discontinue the study  due to an 
assessment of progressive disease, an y additional imaging data, subsequent to the image in 
question, will be submitted to the central reviewer to confirm disease status. 
If the subject is eligible for retreatment with KTE -X19, the last scan prior to retreatment will be 
considered the baseline for the purpose of evaluating the response to retreatment.
Requirements for acquisition of PET-CT scans and submission requirements will be outlined in 
the study  imaging manual.
7.9. Cardiac Function 
Each subject ’s cardiac function as measured b y ECHO will be assessed during the screening 
period to 
confirm study  eligibility .Both left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF )and pericardial 
effusion will be assessed prior to study  entrance by  ECHO .
An ECHO performed following the 
subject ’s last chemotherapy  treatment and within 28 day s prior to signing the consent m ay be 
used for confirmation of eligibility .
To establish a baseline, an ECG will also be performed during screening .
7.10. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Each subjec t will undergo a screening brain MRI , with contrast whenever possible or without 
contrast in case of contraindication, to rule out CNS metastasis during the screening period of the 
study .Evaluation of any new onset of ≥ Grade 2 neurologic toxicity  should include a brain MRI 
as described in the current IB .
7.11. Laboratory

7.12. Description of Study Periods
Investigative sites will maintain a log of all screened subjects who were reviewed and evaluated 
for study  participat ion. Information collected on the screening log should include limite d 
information ,such as the date of screening, date the subject was enrolled ,or the reason for wh y 
the subject failed screening.
7.12.1. S creening
The screening period begins on the date the subject signs the IRB/IEC approved I CF and 
continues through enrollment .Informed consent must be obtained before completion of any 
study -specific procedures. Procedures that are part of standard of care are not considered study -
specific procedures and may  be performed prior to obtaining consent and used to confirm 
eligibility . Confirmation of this data must occur within the time allowance as outlined below and
in the SOA .
After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to confirm study  
eligibility  and participation. Only  subjects who meet the eligibil ity criteria listed in Section 5
and who commence leukapheresis will be enrolled into the study .If,at any  time prior to 
enrollment ,thesubject fails to meet the eligibility
 criteria , the subject should be designated as a 
screen failure on the subject screening log with the reasons for failing screening.
The following assessments/procedures are to be c ompleted during the screening period at the 
time points outline d in the SOA :
Medical history
EQ-5D questionnaire (prior to any  other assessments/procedures being performed)
Physical examination ,including height and weight
Vital signs, including blood pre ssure, heart rate, oxy gen saturation, and temperature
Subjects with sy mptoms of central nervous s ystem malignancy ,such as new onset severe 
headaches, neck stiffness, or an y focal neurologic findings on ph ysical exam, will have

If prescribed, bridging therap y with either a cor ticosteroid or i brutinib (or acalabrutinib) must be 
administered after leukapheresis and completed at least 5 day s prior to initiating conditioning 
chemotherap y (refer to Section 6.3.2). If bridging therap y is administered, PET-CT scans (and 
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy ,
 if applicable) must be repeated prior to the start of conditioning 
chemotherap y to establish a new baseline.

7.12.5. Conditioning 
Chemotherapy Period
If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between screening and the start of 
conditioning chemotherapy  and results are outside the eligibility  criteria (Section 5), contact the 
Kite 
medical m onitor for approval prior to proceeding with conditioning chemotherapy .
If PET -CT will be older than 28 day s at the initiation of conditioning chemotherap y or if the 
subject receives an y anti-cancer therap y with therapeutic intent (eg ,radiation, supraphy siologic 
doses of steroids, or chemotherapy ) between the last PET -CT and conditioning chemotherap y, 
the diagnostic CT portion of the scan must be repeated to establish a new baseline.
7.12.5.1. Requirements for Initiating Conditioning Chemotherap y 
Administration of anti-CD19 CAR T cells to subjects with ongoing infection or inflammation, 
even if such processes are asymptomatic, increases the risk of high grade and fatal toxicity .  All 
efforts should be made to rule out such conditions prior to cell infusion. Signs, sy mptoms or 
abnormal laboratory  results attributed to the malignancy  (eg “tumor fever,” elevated CRP) are 
diagnoses of exclusion that require a documented workup to establish. Conditioning 
chemotherap y and anti-CD19 CAR T cells infusion should only  be initiated after it is 
reasonabl y assured that cell infusion can safely  proceed.
If any of the following criteria are met prior to the initiation of conditioning chemotherap y, then 
the workup listed in Section 7.12.7 must be performed to determine the potential cause if there is 
no identified source of infection.  
Temperature >38°Celsius within 72hours of conditioning chemotherap y
CRP >100 mg/L  anytime between enrollment to start of conditioning chemotherapy
WBC count or WBC differential , that is suggestive of infectious process, and is observed
between enrollment and the initiation of conditioning chemotherap y (eg, WBC > 20 000/µL , 
rapidly  increasing WBC, or differential with high percentage of segs/bands)

If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between confirmation of eligibility
and the start of conditioning chemotherap y and results are outside the eligibility  criteria listed 
in Section 5, then the condition must resolve prior to proceeding with conditioning 
chemotherap y.
Complete history  and phy sical exam ,including head, ears, ey es, nose, and throat ( HEENT ) 
exam ;cardiac, vascular, respiratory , gastrointestinal, integumentary , and neurological 
systems must not reveal evidence of infection/inflammation.
The subject must not have received s ystemic antimicrobials for the treatment of a known or 
suspected infection within 48 h ours before conditioning chemotherap y (prophy lactic use of 
antimicrobials is allowed).   
Treatment course of an y antimicrobials given for known or suspected antecedent infection 
should be complete as per infectious disease consult (if applicable) recommendation before 
stopping or switching to prophy lactic antimicrobials.   
If a subject is confirmed to have an infectious process for which antimicrobials are not 
available (eg, viral pneumonia), the infection must be clinically  resolved as determined by  
the in vestigator and in consultation with infectious disease service (if applicable).
The m ost recentl y collected blood, urine, or other body fluid cultures must show no growth 
for at least 48 hours, and any  other infectious workup performed (eg, bacterial, vira l 
serologies, poly merase chain reaction ( PCR), stool studies, imaging studies) must be 
negative.  If clinical suspicion is for an infection for which cultures are unlikely  to be 
positive within 48 hours (eg, fungal infection), adequate time must be allowed for cultures to 
become positive.

7.12.6.2. Hospitalization for KTE- X19 Infusion
Subjects will remain in the hospital through Day 7 after treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells
unless otherwise required by country regulatory agencies ( refer to Section 18.3) .  Subjects 
should not be discharged from the hospital until all anti-CD19 CAR T cells -related non -
hema tological toxicities return to G rade 1 or 
return to baseline .Subjects may  be discharge d with 
non-critical and clinically stable or slowly  improving toxicities (eg ,renal insufficiency )even if 
>
Grade 1 if deemed a ppropriate by  the investigator. Subjects should remain hospitalized for 
ongoing anti-CD19 CAR T cells -related fever, hy potensio n, hy poxia, or ongoing central 
neurological toxicity > Grade 1 or if deemed necessary  by the treating investigator. 
Given the possibility  that a subject could develop CRS or a neurologic toxicity in the outpatient 
setting after discharge, subjects and their family  members/caregivers should be educated on 
potential sy mptoms of these s yndromes such as fever, d yspnea, confusion, aphasia, dy sphasia, 
somnolence, enc ephalopathy , ataxia, or tremor. If subjects develop these symptoms, they  should 
be instructed to immediately  contact the principal investigator or seek immediate medical 
attention. 
During this period, t he following proc edures will be completed at the time points outlined in the 
SOA :
Neurolo gical assessment including MMSE
MMSE will be administered before treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells on Day  0, 
then on Day 1,and every other day  while hospitalized for subjects enrolled in Cohort 1. 
MMSE will not be administered during the investigational treatment period for subjects 
enrolled in Cohort 2.

monitored as clinically indicated. 
7.12.7. Requirement s to Work Up Potential Infectious and/or Inflammatory States 
ill the absence of an identified source of infection (eg, line infection , pneumo nia on chest x-day), 
the minimum workup to be perfo1med prior to admini stration of conditi oning chemotherapy 
and/or KTE-X19 consists of: 
• Call Kite medical monitor 
• illfectiou s Disea se se rvice consult (if available) 
• CT imaging of the c hest, abdomen , and pelvi s with IV contr ast. If there is a medical 
contr aindication to contrast, then non-contra st CT is allowed . 
• The following must be perfo1med (prior to the initiatio n of antimicrobial s if clinically 
feasible): 
-Blood cultur es (aerobic and anaerobic x2 bottles each) and UA and urine culture. 
Deep /induced sputum cultur e if clinically indicated. 
- A ll indwelling lines such as central venous catheters should be examined for any signs of 
infectio n and addit ional cultur es should be drawn from the line

Prior to proceeding with conditioning chemotherapy  and/or KTE -X19 infusion, the above 
workup must not suggest the presence of an active infection , and all requirements for 
conditioning chemotherapy  and/or KTE -X19 infusion must be satisfied. If the KTE -X19
infusion is delay ed > 2 weeks following conditioning chemotherap y, protocol guidelines should 
be followed regarding the need for repeat conditioning chemotherap y. 
If the above workup was triggered due to CRP > 100mg/L, CRP should be repeated . If CRP 
continues to increase significantly , anevaluation should be performed for any  other potential 
infectious or inflammatory condition that was not previously  evaluated. 
7.12.8. Post-treatment Assessment Period
After completing anti-CD19 CAR T cells infusion and being discharged from the hospital , all 
subjects will be followed in the post -treatment assessment period. Counting from Day 0 (anti-
CD19 CAR T cells infusion), subjects will return to the clinic at the following intervals.
Week 2 (± 2 day s)
Week 4 (± 3days)
Month 2 (± 1 week)
Month 3 (± 1 week)
Subject swill allow key sponsor contacts to continue to access medical records so that

conversation should also be recorded in the subject’s source document.  
A maximum of 1 retreatment course may  occur per subject.  Subjects who are ret reated must
follow the same treatment schedule and procedural requirements per the initial treatment.
Allowance for retreatment is based on clinical experience reported in the 2 studies conducted at 
the pediatric (Lee et al, 2015) and Surgery  Branch (Kochende rfer et al, 2015) of the NCI where 
6subjects in total have been re -treated upon progression. Three of the re -treated subjects

Subjects have the right to withdraw from the stud yat an y time and for an y reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care b y the ph ysician or at the instituti on.
Subjects can decline to continue 
to receiv estudy  required treatment and/or other protocol -
required procedures at any time during the stud y but continue to participate in the study .This is 
referred to as partial withdrawal of consent.
If partial with drawal of consent occurs, the investigator must discuss with the subject the 
appropriate process for discontinuation from IP, study  treatment ,or other protocol -required 
therapies and must discuss options for continu ed participation, completion of procedures ,and the 
associated data collection as outlined in the SOA .The level of follow -up and method of 
communication 
should also be discussed between the research staff and the subject and
documented in the source documents.
Withdraw of full consent for a stud y means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol -required therapy or undergo procedures, and the subject does not wish to continue 
further stud y follow -up. Subject data collected up to withdraw of consent will be retained and
included in the anal ysis of the study, and ,where permitted by local regulations, publically
available data (death records) can be included after withdraw alof consent. The investigator is to 
discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal f rom the study .
As part of the stud y,sites may  be asked to conduct searches of public records, such as those 
establishing survival status, if available, to obtain survival data for any  subject for whom the 
survival status is not known. Sites may  be also asked to also retrieve autopsy  reports to confirm 
status of disease at the time of death. 
The investigator a nd/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the IP and/or other 
protocol -required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study  as a whole or at any  time prior to 
study  completion.
8.1. Reasons for Removal from Treatment
Reasons for removal from protocol - required investigational products or procedures include an y 
of the following:

9.1. AEs
An AEis defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. The event does 
not necessaril y have a relationship with study  treatment. The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that an y AEs observed by  the investigator or reported by  the subject are recorded in the 
subject’s medical record. 
The definition of AE s includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening 
indica tes that the pre -existing medical condition has increased in severity , frequency , and/or 
duration or has an association with a worse outcome. A pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study or involves an intervention, such as elective cos metic surgery  or a 
medical procedure ,while on study  is not considered an AE.
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before stud y participation are not considered AE s. Hospitalization 
for study  treatment infusions or precautionary measures per institutional policy  are not 
considered AE s.
The term “disease progression” as assessed b y measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs 
or other methods should not be reported a s AEs. Death due to disease progression in the absence 
of signs and s ymptoms should be report ed as the primary  tumor ty pe (eg, MCL ). 
For situations when an AEor SAE is due to the disease under investigation, report the signs and 
symptoms. Worsening of signs and s ymptoms of the malignancy  under study  should also be 
reported as AE s in the appropriate section of the CRF. 
The investigator ’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed 
from treatment due to an AE.If a subject requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies 
or the study  due to an AE, the subject should undergo the procedures outlined in the Month 3 
visit of the SOA. 
9.2. Reporting of AE s
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AE s observed b y the investigator or reported 
by the subject that occur from enrollment (ie , commencement of leukapheresis) through 
3months after treatment with anti-CD19 CAR Tcellinfusion are monitored and reported .
After 3 months, targeted AEs (eg,neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune 
disorders, and secondary malignancies) will be monitored and reported for 24 months after 
treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells or until disease progression, whichever occurs first .
See Section 9.4for repor ting of non- serious CRS events G rade ≥ 3.
KTE -C19-102 Kite Pharma, Inc.
Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 64of 92 29 October 2018For subjects who are enrolled but do not receive anti-CD19 CAR T cells , the AE reporting 
period ends 30 day s after the last study -specific procedure (eg, leukapheresis, conditioning 
chemotherap y). 
The investigator must address the below 
AEs:
AEdiagnosis or syndrome (if not known, signs or sy mptoms)
Dates of onset and resolution
Severity
Assessment of relatedness to IP,conditioning chemotherapy ,or study  procedures
Action taken
AEgrading scale used will be the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.03. A cop y of the grading scale can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page (http://ctep.canc er.gov ).CRSevents will be reported using the Leegrading scale ( Lee et al, 
2014) , as outlined in the current IB. In reviewing AE s, investigators must assess whether the AE
is possibly  related to 1) the IP(axicabtagene ciloleucel or KTE -X19), 2) conditioning 
chemotherap y
,or 3) any  protocol -required study  procedure. The relationship is indicated by  a 
yes or no response and entered into the CRF. A yes response should indicate that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment or procedure and the AE.
Additional relevant data with respect to describing the AEwill be collected in the CRF s.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory  test result s and determining whether an 
abnormal value in an individual study  subject represents a clinicall y significant change from the 
subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory  findings without clinical significance 
(based on the i nvestigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.However, abnormal 
laboratory  findings that result in new or worsening clinical sequelae, require therapy  or 
adjust ment in current therap y are considered AE s.Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the 
laboratory  abnormality ) are to be recorded as the AE.
The investigator is expected to follow reported AEs until stabilization or re solution .If a subject 
begins a new anti -cancer therap y, the AEreporting period for non -serious 
AEends at the time 
the new treatment is started .
9.3. Definition of SAE s
A SAE is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
Fatal
Life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
KTE -C19-102 Kite Pharma, Inc.
Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 65of 92 29 October 2018Congenital anomal y/birth defect
Other medicall y important serious ev ent
AnAEwould meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization” if the event necessitated an 
admission to a healthcare facility  (eg, overnight stay ). 
Events that require an escalation of care when the subject is alread y hospitalized should be 
recorded as anSAE . Examples of such events include movement from routine care in the 
hospital to the intensive care unit ( ICU)or if that event resulted in a prolongation of the existing 
planned hospitalization. 
If an investigator considers an event to be clinica
llyimportant, but it does not meet any  of the 
serious criteria, the event could be classified as a nSAE with the criterion of “other medic ally 
important serious event.” 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event according to NCI CTCAE criteria; the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance and, therefore, may not meet the seriousness criteria.  Severity 
(ie, grade) and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
9.4. Reporting of SAE sand Non -serious CRS Events Grade ≥ 3
The investigator is responsible for reporting all SAE s observed b y the investigator or reported b y 
the subject that occur after signing of the consent through 3 mont hs after the anti-CD19 CAR T
cellinfusion. After 3 months, onl y serious targeted AE s (eg, neurological, hematological, 
infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary  malignancies) observed by  the investigator or 
reported b y the subject will be reported for 24 months after anti-CD19 CAR T cellinfusion or 
until disease progression, whichever occurs first.  For subjects who screen fail or are enrolled but 
do not receive anti -CD19 CAR T cells , the reporting period for SAEs ends 30 day s after the last 
proced ure (eg , screen procedure, leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy). 
Serious events 
that the investigator assesses as related to axicabtagene ciloleucel or KTE -X19
should be reported regardless of the time period.
All SAE sand non- serious CRS events ≥ Grade 3 (Lee et al, 2014 )must be submitted via email 
to within 24hours following the investigator ’s knowledge of the event
using a SAE Report Form. Subsequently , all SAEs will be reported in accordance with EU 
guid elines, or ,
if applicable, as per local reporting guidelines. 
Progression of the malignancy  during the study should not be reported as a nSAE . SAE s 
associated with disease progression may  be reported as an SAE . If the malignancy ha s a fatal 
outcome within 3 months of the last day  of the conditioning therapy  or anti-CD19 CAR T cell-
infusion ,then the event leading to death must be recorded as a nSAE with CTC AEGrade 5.
PPD
KTE -C19-102 Kite Pharma, Inc.
Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66of 92 29 October 2018Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period, irrespective o f any 
intervening treatment.
Any death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy ,for the purpose of pre -conditioning, 
and within 3 months of the anti -CD19 CAR Tcellinfusion, regardless of attribution to 
treatment, requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. Any death occurring greater than 
3months after the anti -CD19 CAR Tcellinfusion requires expedited reporting within 24 hours 
only if it is considered relate d to treatment.
9.5. Reporting Deaths
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period that are 
attributed by the investigator solely to progression of underlying lymphoma should be 
recorded as SAEs with the preferred term “B-cell lymphoma” and must be reported 
immediately to the sponsor.  Death is an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or 
condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded on the AE 
form.  The term “unexplained death” should be captured if the cause of death is not 
known.  However, every effort should be made to capture the established cause of death, 
which may become available later (eg, after autopsy).  Deaths during the post -study 
survival follow -up that are due to underlying can cer should be recorded only on the 
Survival Status CRF.
9.6. Diagnosis V ersus Signs and Symptoms
For adverse events, a diagnosis (if known) rather than individual signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the AE form.  The exception is for CRS where both the dia gnosis 
and signs and symptoms will be captured on the CRF AE form.  For signs and symptoms of 
the underlying cancer, the signs and symptoms should be captured.  However, on the AE 
form, the investigator should state that these signs and symptoms are due to the underlying 
disease.
9.7. Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no relevant clinical experience with KTE -X19 in pregnant or lactating women, and 
animal reproductive studies have not been performed.  Women of childbearing potential must 
have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment because of the potentially dangerous effects of 
the preparative chemotherap y on the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should be 
monitored according to local and country -specific regulations. This experimental therap y should 
not be administered to pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.
Female subjects and female partner s of male subjects are recommended to use highl y effective 
contraception (method must achieve an annual failure rate of < 1%) for at least 6 months after 
conditioning chemotherapy  dosing. Male subjects are recommended to not father a child for 
6months after completion of conditioning chemotherap y dosing .

Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 67of 92 29 October 2018If a pregnancy  occurs in either a female subject enrolled into the study  or a female partner of a 
male subject within 6 months of completing conditioning chemotherapy , the pregnancy  must be 
reported to thekey sponsor contact.   Information regarding the pregnancy  and/or the outcome 
may be requested by  the key  sponsor. 
In addition to reporting any  pregnancies occurring during the study , investigators should monitor 
for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of anti-CD19 CAR Tcell infusion through 
6months for female subjects and for 6months for the female partner o f the male subjects.
The pregnancy  should be reported to the key  sponsor contact within 24 hours of the 
investigator ’s knowledge of the pregnancy  event. 
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies, report 
the lactation case to the key  sponsor contact .
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies through 6months.
Any lactatio n case should be reported to the key  sponsor contact within 24 hours of the 
investi gator’s knowledge of the event.
9.8. Hospitalization and Prolonged Hospitalization
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
docume nted and reported as a serious adverse event as described in Section 9.4.  
The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events:
Hospitalization for palliative care or hospice care
Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (eg, for monitoring of the subject or to 
perform an efficacy measurement for the study)
Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition
Hospitalizati on due to progression of the underlying cancer
9.9. Abnormal Vital Signs Values
Not all vital sign abnormalities qualify as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be 
reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the followin g 
criteria:
Accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment
KTE -C19-102 Kite Pharma, Inc.
Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 68of 92 29 October 2018It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should 
be classified as an adverse event.  However, if a clinically signi ficant vital sign abnormality 
is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, high blood pressure), only the diagnosis 
(ie,hypertension) should be recorded on the CRF.
9.10. Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent DSMB will review safety  and/or efficacy  data 4times during this study . The 
DSMB will first meet to review safet y data when 10 subjects in Cohort 1 have been enrolled and 
treated with 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells and followed for 30 day s. The DSMB will meet for the 
second time to review both safet y and effi cacy data after 20 subjects in Cohort 1 have been 
treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells and have had the opportunity  to complete the 3- month 
disease assessment.  The DSMB will meet for the third time to review both safet y and efficacy 
data after 10 subjects in 
Cohort 2 have been treated with KTE -X19 and have had the opportunity  
to be followed for 30 days. The DSMB will meet for the fourth time after 44 subjects in 
Cohort 1 have been treated with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells and have had opportunity  to be 
followed for 30 day s after the IPinfusion . The DSMB will be chartered to make trial conduct 
recommendations based on an anal ysis of risk vs benefit.  The DSMB may meet more often as 
needed. 
At the time of expedited reportin
g of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) 
to health authorities ,Kite (or designee) will concurrentl y submit these reports to the DSMB 
chair . The DSMB chair will also review SAE narrative reports monthly .  Finally , the DSMB or 
Kite may  request additional anal yses of safet y data if a safet y concern arises during the course of 
the trial.
9.11. Criteria to Pause Enrollment
As part of its oversight of the study , the DSMB also will assess criteria to pause enrollment after 
10, 20, 30, and 50 subjects in Cohort 1have been treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel or
KTE -X19 and have had the opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s.  Enrollment will be paused if 
any of the following criteria is met:
Subject incidence of G rade 5 axicabtagene ciloleuce l orKTE -X19 related AE s within 
30days is > 10%
or
Subject incidence of the following G rade 4 axicabtagene ciloleucel or KTE -X19-related 
AEs lasting more than 7 days is > 33%:

This study  uses 
an open- label , 2-cohort design to test for an improvement in ORR . Up to 
approximately  130 subjects with r/r MCL  will be enrolled and treated with anti‑CD19 CAR 
Tcells, including 10 axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects and 
up to approximately  80KTE -X19
subjects in Cohort 1 and up to 40 KTE -X19 subjects in Cohort 2 . The p rimary  anal ysis will be 
conducted after 60 Cohort 1 KTE -X19 subjects have been enrolled and treated and have had the 
opportunity  to be evaluated for response 
6month safter the Week 4 disease assessment . For the 
test of efficacy ,
60 KTE -X19 subjects in Cohort 1 will provide at least 96% power to distinguish 
betwee n an active therapy  with a 50% true response rate from a therap y with a response rate of 
25% or less (undesirable response rate, for purposes of futility  assessment) with a 1 -sided alpha 
level of 0.025.  No h ypothesis will be tested in Cohort 1 axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects or
Cohort 2 subjects. Exploratory  anal yses will be conducted on the data collected from these 
subjects. 
In Cohort

KTE -X19 subjects only, using a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025. This procedure preserves the 
designated overall alpha level (1 -sided) of 0.025 and has 
at least 96% power when 6 0 KTE -X19
subjects are included .  EAST version 6.4were used for power calculation and evaluation of the 
operating characteristics of this design.
For Cohort 1,a rho (parameter = 0.30) beta spending function will be used to allocate the beta 
level between the futility  anal ysis and the primary  efficacy  anal ysis.  
10.4. Statistical Assumptions
As described in Section 3, an open- label , 2-cohort design is used . A target response rate of 50% 
and a historical control rate of 25% are assumed for statistical inference. The responses from 
subjects in the study  population are assumed to be independent and follow binomial distribution ,
and,thus
, the exact binomial test will be used t o test the statistical hy pothesis.
10.5. Analysis Subsets 
mITT set:  will consist of all subjects enrolled and treated with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells at 
anydose.   This anal ysis set will be used for anal yses of the efficacy  endpoints (objective 
response rate, best objective response, DOR , PFS, OS) for the stud y.
Inferential analysis set: will consist of the first 60 treated KTE -
X19 subjects in 
Cohort 1. This analysis set will be used for the hypothesis testing of the primary 
endpoint ORR at the time of the primary analysis, as well as the analyses on the key 
secondary endpoints ( best objective response [ BOR ], DOR, PFS, and OS).
Safety  analysis set:  defined as all subjects treated with any  dose of anti ‑CD19 CAR T cells.
This analy sis set will be used for all analy sis of safety .
Full 
analysis set (FAS):  will consist of all enrolled subjects and will be used for the 
summary  of subject disposition , sensitivity  anal yses of ORR and key secondary endpoints ,
and subject listings of deaths.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 72of 92 29 October 201810.6. Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments
This is an open -label , 2-cohort study ,and subjects and investigators will be aware of treatment 
received. Data h andling procedures for the study  will be devised to reduce potential sources of 
bias and maintain the validit y and credibility  of the study . These procedures will be outlined in 
the study  Statistical Analysis Plan, DSMB charter, and Trial Integrity  Docume nt.

Interim Analysis
10.7.1. Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Rules
An independent DSMB will be formed to review accumulating safet y data after 10 subjects in 
Cohort 1 have been en rolled and treated with anti ‑CD19 CAR T cel lsand have had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 30daysfor safety . The DSMB willreview accumulating safet y 
and efficacy  data after 20
subjects in Cohort 1 have been treated with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells
and have had the 
opportunity  to complete the 3-month disease assessment after the treatment 
with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells . The DSMB will 
alsoreview safet y and efficacy after 10subjects 
in Cohort 2 have been treated with KTE -X19 and have had opportunity  to be followed for 
30daysafter the KTE -X19 infusion. The DSMB will review safety again after 44 subjects in 
Cohort 1 have been enrolled and treated with anti ‑CD19 CAR T cells and have had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the treatment with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells , with 
focus on the safet y data from the 6 KTE -X19 subjects treated most recentl ywithin this cohort .
The DSMB will also monitor safet y criteria to pause enrollment (see Section 9.11).
10.7.2. Safety Interim Analysis   
The DSMB will review the safet y data only twice, after 10 and 44 subjects in Cohort 1 have been 
enrolled and treated with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells and have had the opportunity  to be followed 
for 30 day sfor safety , respectivel y. The DSMB will also review SAE information and SUSARs 
on a regular basis throughout subject treatment in the study . The DSMB may  request additional 
safet y data or modify ing the study  conduct. The sponsor may  request additional reviews by  the 
DSMB if safety  concerns are identified. Data submitted to the DSMB may be monitored or 
unmonitored to facilitate and ensure timel y DSMB review.  
10.7.3. Efficacy Interim Analysis
In Cohort 1, two e fficacy interim analy ses will be performed.  
Interim anal ysis2(Efficacy  anal ysis 1) will be conducted after 20 subjects have been treated 
with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells and have had the opportunity  to be followed for 3 month safter the 
treatment with anti‑CD19 CAR T cells .  This interim anal ysis will be for futility only.  If more 
than 5responses are observed in the first 20subjects, accrual in Cohort 1will continue. 
KTE -C19-102 Kite Pharma, Inc.
Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 73of 92 29 October 2018Interim anal ysis 3 (Efficacy  anal ysis 2) will be conducted after 38 subjects in Cohort 1 have been 
treated with anti ‑CD19 CAR T cells and have had the opportunity  to be assessed for response 
6months after the treatment with anti ‑CD19 CAR T cells . This int erim anal ysis will be 
performed for a Kite internal review of the accumulating data of safety  and efficacy .
A rho (parameter =
0.30) beta spending function will be used to allocate the beta level between 
this futility  analy sis and the primary  efficacy  anal ysisin Cohort 1.    
In Cohort 2, one interim anal ysis will be conducted after 10 KTE -X19 subjects have been 
enrolled and have had the opportunity  to be followed for 30 days after treatment with 
KTE -X19. 
This interim analy sis will be for safet y and efficacy .  
10.7.4. Other Interim Analysis
The sponsor reserves the right to conduct additional anal yses of safet y and efficacy during the 
time between the planned interim analy ses and primary  anal ysis for regulatory  interaction 
purposes. If conducted, no formal h ypothesis testing will be performed in such anal yses.
10.8. Planned Method sof Analysis
Theprimary  anal ysis will be performed after 60 KTE -X19 subjects in Cohort 1 have been 
treated and have had the opportunity  to be evaluated for response 6 months after the Week 4 
disease assessment .In this primary anal ysis, inferential testing of efficacy  will be performed 
with data from Cohort 1 KTE -X19 subjects only, and the analysis with the data from Cohort 1 
axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects and Cohort 2 will be descriptive .Additional anal yses may  
occur after the primary  analy sis has been completed.  These additional analy ses will be 
descriptive and will occur after inferential testing in Cohort 1 has been performed.  The final 
analysis will occur when all subjects in both cohorts have completed the study .  
The primary  endpoint of ORR will be based on IRRC review of disease assessments in the mI TT 
set.  
Analyses of ORR based on investigator review of disease assessments will also be 
performed.
10.8.1. ORR
Theincidence of objective response and exact 2- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
generated for Cohort 1 KTE- X19 subjects, Cohort 1 axicabtagene ciloleucel subjects, and 
Cohort 2 subjects.  An exact binomial test will be used to compare the observed ORR per IRRC 
review in Cohort 
1 KTE -X19 subjects to a response rate of 25%.
10.8.2.
Best Objective Response
The incidence of subjects with CR, PR, SD, progressive disease, and unevaluable as best 
response to treatment and exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals about the incidence will be

18.1. Appendix 1:  Revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
Information in this section has been taken from (Cheson et al, 2007).
18.1.1. C omplete R esponse
Complete respo nse (CR) requires all of the following: 
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -related 
symptoms if present before therapy . 
Typically  fluorodeox yglucose ( FDG )-avid l ymphoma (large cell, mantle cell ,and follicular 
lymphomas are all t ypically FDG -avid):  In subjects with no pre -treatment positron emission 
tomograph y (PET)scan or when the PET scan was positive before therap y, a post -treatment 
residual mass of an y size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
Variabl y FDG -avid l ymphomas/FDG avidit
y unknown:  In subjects without a pre -treatment 
PET scan or if a pre -treatment PET scan was negative, all ly mph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed to normal size ( ≤ 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if > 1.5 cm before 
therap y).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more than 
1
cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis 
after treatment.  
The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy  on basis of phy sical exam 
or CT scan, must should be normal size on CT scan and not be palpable on phy sical 
examination ,and nodules thought to represent l ymphoma must no longer be present.  
A bone marrow aspirate and bi opsy  is performed only  when the patient had bone marrow 
involvement with ly
mphoma prior to therapy  or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood 
counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with ly mphoma 
after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy  must show no evidence of disease by  
morphology , or,if indeterminate by  morphology ,it must be negative b y 
immunohistochemistry .  The biopsy  core sa mple must be a minimum of 20 mm in length. 
18.1.2. P artial Response
A partial response ( PR)requires all of the following:
≥50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest 
dominant nodes or nodal masses.  Dominant nodes or nodal masses should be clearly  
measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions, should be from different regions of the 
body  if possible ,and should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes if possible.  
No increase in size of nodes, liver ,or spleen and no new sites of disease.

Clinical Protocol Final
CONFIDENTIAL Page 87of 92 29 October 2018If multiple splenic and hepatic nodules are present, they  must regress by  ≥ 50% in the SPD.  
There must be a > 50% decrease in the greatest transverse diameter for single nodules.   
Bone marrow is irrelevant for determination of a PR.  I f subject has pers istent bone marrow 
involvement and otherwise meets criteria for CR , then the 
subject will be considered a PR.
Typically  FDG -avid l ymphoma:  for subjects with no pre -treatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before therap y, the post -treatment PET scan should be positive in at least 
1previously  involved site.  Note: in subjects with follicular ly mphoma or mantle cell 
lymphoma, a PET scan is only  indicated in subjects with 1 or at most 2 residual masses that 
have regressed b y 50% on CT scan.
18.1.3. Stable 
Disease
Stable disease (SD) requires:
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify  for 
progressive disease .  PET should be positive in ty pically  FDG -avid ly mphomas.
18.1.4. P rogressive Disease
Progressive disease (PD) is defined by at least one of the following:  
≥ 50% increase from nad ir in the sum of the products of at least 2lymph nodes, or ,if a single 
node is involved, at least a 50% increase in the product of the diameters of this 1 node  
Appearance of a new lesion > 1.5 cm in an y axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size
≥50% increase in size of splenic or hepatic nodules 
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more 
than 1 cm in its short axis
Lesions should be PET positive in ty pically  FDG -avid ly mphomas unless the lesion is too 
small to be detected b y PET (< 1.5cm in its long axis by  CT).

From (Barrington et al, 2014 )
18.2.1. C omplete R esponse
18.2.1.1. C omplete Metabolic Response
The designation of complete metabolic response ( CMR )for PET-CT-based response requires all 
of the following:
A 5-point scale (5PS ) score of 1, 2 ,or 3, with or without a residual mass
In Waldey er’s ring or extranodal sites with high phy siologic uptake or with activation 
within spleen or marrow, uptake may be greater than normal mediastinum and/or liver.
In this circumstance, CMR may  be inferred if uptake at sites of initial involvement is no 
greater than surrounding n ormal tissue even if the tissue has high ph ysiologic uptake.
No n ew sites of disease should be observed.
18.2.2. Complete Radiologic Response 
The designation of complete radiologic response ( CRR) for CT -based response requires all of the 
following:
Target nodes/n odal masses must regress to ≤ 1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter of a lesion 
(LDi) .
No extraly mphatic sites of disease
Absent non
-measured lesion
Organ enlargement regress to normal (eg, an enlarged spleen at baseline must be ≤ 13 cmat 
assessment)

Bone marrow normal by  morphology ; if indeterminate, immunohistochemistry negative 
18.2.3. P artial Response
18.2.3.1. Partial Metabolic Response
The designation of partial metabolic response ( PMR )forPET-CT-based response requires a ll of 
the following:
A 5PS score of 4 or 5, with reduced uptake compared to baseline (screening), and residual 
mass(es) of an y size
Note:
At interim, these findings suggest responding disease.
At end of treatment, these findings suggest residual disease.
No new sites of disease should be observed.
If there are persistent focal changes in the marrow in the context of a nodal response, 
consideration should be given to further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging or biops y 
or an interval scan.
18.2.3.2. Partial Ra diologic Response
The designation of partial radiologic response (PRR )for CT -based response requires all of the 
following:
≥50% decrease in the SPD of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extra- nodal sites
When a lesion is too small to measure b y CT, assign 5 mm x 5 mm as the default value .
For a node > 5mm x 5 mm, but smaller than normal, use actual measurements for 
calculation .
Absent/ normal, regressed, but no increase of non -measured lesions
Spleen m ust have regressed by  >50% in length bey ond normal (ie, ≤ 13 cm).  For example, 
if the spleen is 15 cm at baseline, it must be ≤
14cm at assessment to classify  as a PRR.

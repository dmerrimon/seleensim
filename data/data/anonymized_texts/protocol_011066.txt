17 Schedule of 
Assessments  Changed timing of Form 14 “Termination” from Visit 49 to As 
Needed.

Infarction  by Clinical Events Committee ”.   
 
Renumbered Form 20 “Cause of Death” to Form 21.  
19 Monitoring Serious 
Adverse Events  Under section d, removed SharePoint and replaced with DataFax 
system.  
20 Subject 
Management  Made clarification regarding the post -op ECG results by adding the 
following:   Per standard clinical care and most recent guidelines 
[Thyegesen 2012], cardiac biomarkers (preferably cardiac Troponin I 
or T) will be obtained if the 12 -lead EKG demonstrates  evidence of 
type 5 [Thyegesen 2012] myocardial infarction, including new pathologic Q waves or new Left Bundle Branch Block.  The cardiac biomarker will be obtained every eight hours until a downward trend 
is seen in the level.  
A-5 Informed Consent  Modified the collection of troponin levels (48 hours post -op) to be 
performed only if clinically indicated as follows::  
“On the first and second day after your surgery, you will have an 
electrocardiogram - also known as an EKG.   This test is routinely 
performed on CABG patients but the results will also be used for 
research purposes.   If the EKG indicates there is new damage to your 
heart, known as a myocardial infarction (MI), then approximately two tablespoons of your blood will be drawn to check cardiac biomarkers. 
This is because cardiac biomarker levels will become increased in the 
blood when there is new heart damage. This test will be repeated 
every eight hours only if the level is increasing.   Once it is determined 
the level is decreasing or remains in a normal range no further levels 
will be drawn.   This blood test will help determine if you have had any 
new damage to your heart.    Cardiac biomarker tests are  frequently 
performed on CABG patients but the results will also be used for 
research purpos es.” 
A-8 Informed Consent  Modified section under “Information about you is protected in the 
following way” to read as follows:  
Your research records  will be kept indefinitely or until the law allows

future IRB approved research .     
C-1 Definition of MI  New Appendix C to include the guidance for the definition of Type 5 
Myocardial Infarction (MI related to CABG).  Previous Appendix C, 
“Curricula Vitae” has been removed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common major surgical procedure  in the  
United States with over 300,000 cases performed each year. To restore blood flow to the heart, vascular 
conduits from another part of the body are procured to create a bypass around critically blocked coronary 
arteries. The  left internal thoracic arter y is the conduit of choice for CABG due to its superior long- term patency . 
However, almost all patients referred for CABG require additional grafts to provide complete revascularization. 
This necessitates the harvest of other vessels, most commonly the saphenous vein which is used almost 
ubiquitously in contemporary CABG with an average of two vein grafts per CABG procedure . In the last 10 years , 
Endoscopic Vein Harvesting  (EVH) has been recommended as the preferred method over the traditional open 
harvesting technique  (OVH) because it provide s a minimally invasive approach. However , more recent 
investigations indicate potential for reduced long- term bypass graft patency  and worse clinical outcomes with 
EVH.  The  long term impact of EVH on clinical outcomes has never been investigated on a large scale using a 
definitive,  adequ ately power ed, prospective Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) with long -term follow -up.  
 
Objectives : The primary efficacy end point  is the composite rate of death from any cause, myocardial infarction 
or repeat revascularization (Major A dverse Cardiac Event s – MACE) throughout the multi -year  Study period.  
Each randomized subject  (either in the Endoscopic or in the Open vein harvesting group) will be followed after 
the index CABG to capture the time- to-MACE event, where an ‘EVENT’ will be defined as either death (all cause) 
or a myocardial infarction  or a revascularization procedure during the follow -up period.  The primary hypothesis  
is that a significantly smaller proportion of CABG subject s with vein grafts  harve sted by the open technique will 
experience a MACE event  compared to CABG subject s with vein grafts  harvested by the endoscopic technique  
during the follow -up period . The secondary efficacy end point  is the MACE rate at one and three -year s post -
CABG . We believe that the proposed CSP#  588 REGROUP Trial  will be uniquely positioned to fill a significant gap 
in existing knowledge regarding the long term MACE rates  of EVH in CABG and improve the quality of the care 
we provide to our Veterans and more broadl y to all patients undergoing coronary revascularization . In addition, 
we believe that CSP#  588 findings will significantly impact the VA and national cardiac surgery coronary 
revascularization guidelines.  
 
Design : CSP #588 -  REGROUP  is a randomized, intent -to-treat, two-arm, parallel design, m ulticenter study. 
Cardiac Surgery Programs at V eterans Affairs  Medical C enters  (VAMC)  with expertise in performing both EVH 
and OVH will be invited to participate in the study . Subject s requiring elective or urgent CABG using 
cardiopulmonary bypass with use of at least one SVG will be screened for enrollment using established 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects  will be randomized to one of the two arms (EVH or OVH) after  an 
experienced vein harvester is identified and assigned . Assessments will be collected at multiple time points 
including: baseline, intraoperative ly, postoperatively, at discharge or 30 days after surgery if still hospitalized.  
Assessment of leg wound complications  will be completed at the time of discharge and at six-week  post -surgery . 
Telep hone follow -ups will occur at three -month intervals post -surgery  until the participating sites are 
decommissioned at the end of the trial period (which would be app roximately 4.5 years after the site 
initiations).  For long -term MACE outcomes, passive follow up for MACE  using VA clinical and administrative 
databases  (CPRS, VASQIP , etc ) will be performed centrally by the Study C hair’s office for another two years.

Sample Size and Study Duration:  This study will enroll approximately 1150  subject s requiring CABG at 16 VA 
Medical Centers with expertise in both techniques of vein  harvesting . Assuming a n enrollment rate of  two 
subject s/medical center/month, total enrollment will take  approximately three  years to complete .  With a t least  
one-year follow -up period  for the last subject  randomized and two additional years of passive follow -up by the 
chair’s office, the total duration of the study will be approximately six and half years .   
 
Subject  Population:  Any subject  requi ring a non -emergent CABG will be considered for entry into the study. 
Subject s who are hemodynamically unstable, have moderate to severe valvular disease or are unwilling or 
unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.  
 
Treatments : Open Vein Harves ting is the traditional method of saphenectomy for CABG. It is performed under 
direct vision using a single long incision or, more commonly,  multiple smaller incisions (referred to as “bridging” 
technique ) along the course of the vein. This approach minimi zes manipulation and direct trauma to the conduit 
but is associated  with potential for discomfort and leg wound healing complications . Endoscopic Vein H arvesting 
is a minimally invasive  procedure that was developed to eliminate the need for long incisions associated with 
OVH. EVH reduces the risk of wound infections and other leg wound complications but may be more traumatic 
to the conduit than OVH.

I.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
 
In recent years, a  consensus has emerged in the literature and in the Cardiac Surgical 
community that a definitive , adequately powered,  prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) is 
necessary to de finitively assess  the long -term clinical outcome s of CABG patients  whose veins were 
harvested endoscopically.  The need for a RCT was  discussed  first by the Duke Clinical Research Institute 
group in their seminal 2009 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine  (Lopes 2009) . Based 
on the results of  a CSP #517 ROOBY sub -analysis , our group in Boston also recommended a RCT of EVH 
vs. OVH (Zenati 2011) . Furthermore, an Editorial authored by the Committee that drafted the original 
2005 ISMICS guidelines recommending EVH, has now expressed significant concern s on the long- term 
patency and adverse effects of EVH and recommends a RCT (Cheng 2010 ). Professor Angelini’s group in 
Bristol, UK in an Editorial i n Nature Medicine  supports a large RCT on EVH vs . OVH  (Patel 2009). 
Kempfert  in an Expert Review of EVH discusses the need for a RCT with long -term outcomes to 
definitively assess EVH’s safety profile (Kempfert 2011) ; in addition, Mariani from The Netherlands also 
advocates a RCT  (Mariani 2011). All three external reviewers of our  original L etter of Intent for CSP#  588 
strongly supported our proposal for a RCT. We believe that a large multicenter prospective randomized 
trial taking into consideration important confounding factors will be indispens able before clearer 
guidelines can be formulated in favor or to the disadvantage of EVH.   
 Coronary artery bypass grafting is the most common major surgical procedure  in the U.S. with 
over 300,000 cases performed each year. To restore blood flow to the heart , vascular conduit s from 
another part of the body are  procured to create  a bypass around critically blocked  coronary arteries . The  
internal thoracic arter y (ITA) remains the conduit of first choice due to its superior long- term patency  
leading to superior clinical outcomes , which is the result of near- perfect integrity of its intima layer 
(Loop 1986) . The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery is the most important coronary artery, 
supplying up to 70% of the left ventricle . Therefore, the left ITA-LAD bypass graft is currently the gold 
standard for surgical revascularization, with patency rates of 96% at one year, 90% at three years and 
86% at 10 years ( Loop 1989 ). However, almost all patients referred for CABG require additional grafts to 
provide complete revascula rization. This necessitates the harvest of other vessels, most co mmonly the 
saphenous vein which is used ubiquitously in contemporary CABG with an average of two vein grafts per 
CABG procedure  (Class IIa, Level B) (Brown 2010 ; Barner 2008 ).  
 The traditional method of vein harvesting with  an open longitudinal incision along the course of 
the greater saphenous vein has been associated with complications including dehiscence, cellulitis, lymphangitis, drainage, edema, pain, hematomas, skin necrosis, and infection (Bitondo 2002). These in 
turn lead to delayed wound healing, increased length of hospital stay, higher cost of postop care, and 
greater patient discomfort. Bitondo and colleagues showed that OVH is associated with a 25% risk of leg 
wound complications , creating an important clinical and economic burden (Bitondo 2002; Goldsborough 
1999).  As an alternative, EVH was first introduced clinically in 1996 (Lumsden 1996)  and has since been 
reported to reduce leg wound complications and improve pat ient satisfaction while decreasing resource 
utilization  (Bonde 2005).   Encouraging short -term (≤ six months)  clinical (less wound morbidity, less pain, 
better cosmetic results, and improved patient satisfaction ) and graft patency outcomes have been 
described (Andreasen 2008; Kiaii 2002; Perrault 2004; Puskas 1999; Yun 2004 , Markar 2010). In a recent 
“Best Evidence Topic” study (Tennyson 2010), a review of the literature showed EVH reduced  the level

of postop pain (pain score for EVH=0.52±0. 95; OVH =1.02±1.51; p=0.03) and wound complications (range  
from 3% to 7.4% for EVH and 13% to 19.4% for OVH ). These clinical benefits were associated with high 
levels of patient satisfaction.  
 
Since  its clinical introduction in 1996, EVH has increased in popularity to become the preferred 
method of SVG harvesting in the United States.  According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National 
Database ( www.sts.org ), EVH was utilized in ~80 % of CABG procedures performed in the United States 
in 2008.  A recent Editorial published in The New England Journal of Medicine  predicted the  “demise of 
open vein harvesting” in the near future in f avor of EVH (Aranki 2009). In the U.S., EVH is almost 
universally performed by mid -level practitioners (P hysician Assistants  or Nurse Practitioners ), rather 
than attending surgeons, residents, or fellows, and generally takes longer to learn than OVH. No universally accepted metrics for proficiency are available and training is usually provided by vendors. 
Cadwallader and associates undertook a systematic review and meta -analy sis of the use of EVH vs. OVH 
in the United Kingdom. They concluded that EVH has a role in vein harvesting but is clearly oper ator 
dependent.  EVH is therefore only preferable to OVH when performed by an experienced practitioner  
(Cadwallader 2009).  EVH requires  video equ ipment and a video tower for the endoscope . Before 
initiating EVH, some centers administer an intravenous bolus of 5,000 international units ( IU) of 
unfractionated  heparin to prevent vein  thrombosis: this practice is based on limited evidence from a 
small, single -center study that showed a decrease in fibrin clots in vein s harvested with EVH when a 
bolus of intravenous heparin was administered prior to the initiation of EVH (Brown 2007).  
 EVH can be performed with one of the commercially available systems that follow similar 
technical steps (VasoView®, available since 1996 and first marketed by Origin Med Systems, then by Boston Scientific/Guidant Cardiac Surgery, and currently by MAQUET Cardiovascular, Wayne, NJ www.maquet.com
 [estimated EVH U.S. market share 90%]; Virtuosaph™, introduced in 2005, Terumo 
Cardiovascular Systems Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI www.terumo -cvs.com/virtuosaph  [approximate 
estimated EVH U.S. market share 8%]; all using CO 2 insufflation for visualization and dissection. Briefly, a 
1.5 to 2.0 cm incision is made medially above or below the knee, depending o n the length of the vein 
required. Harvesting is performed under video guidance with a rigid endoscope and is directed to wards 
the groin region as far proximally as possible. If a longer  segment of  a vein is required, the endoscope 
may also be directed distally through the same incision. Side branches are divided by using bipolar cauterizing scissors or a bisector. EVH requires CO
2 to insufflate the subcutaneous cavity in the lower 
extremity and frequent use of bipolar cautery in the vicinity of the saphenous vein in order to divide the 
side branches; neither insufflation n or bipolar energy is required for OVH. The use of cau tery has been 
proposed to cause thermal injury to the vessel wall, which may impair the graft quality by compromising 
the viability of endothelial cells and resulting in plat elet aggregation and thrombosis.  Encouraging short -
term (≤six  months) clinical and graft patency outcomes have been described (Andreasen 2008; Kiaii 
2002; Perrault 2004; Puskas 1999; Yun 2004).   
There is concern that relatively longer manipulation times and the use of rigid devices in  EVH 
may cause direct mechanical injury to vein grafts.   Traditional surgical principles for handling vascular 
tissue emphasize a “no-touch ” approach during dissection to minimize the risk of intimal endamage  
(Gundry 19 80). EVH inherently requires forces to be applied to the vein that are usually avoided in open 
harvest, including traction, adventitial stripping and venous compression.  There is a lack of unanimity on

the role of  EVH on premature graft loss (Ouzunian 2010) which  may be explained by variability of 
techniques and level of experience among centers. Desai and associates , in a prospective pilot study 
using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging, noted that veins procured by novice harvesters 
had nearly 50% more discrete injuries than veins procured by ex perienced harvesters (Brown 2007 ). 
Rousou and colleagues recently reported that, co mpared to OVH , EVH adversely affects vein endothelial 
function  (Rousou 2009 ). They used epifluorescence multiphoton microscopy (a technique that measures 
endothelial viability and fun ctionality in real time with greater sensitivity than other methods) and 
demonstrated endothelial and smooth muscle cell damage in vein grafts with reduced endothelial cell viability, attenuated calcium mobilization, and nitric oxide production in the EVH group.  Endothelial 
dysfunction enhances thrombogenicity and may lead to early thrombosis and accelerated SVG failure.  
Compromised endothelial integrity is the primary determinant in the interrelated pathogenesis of thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis within the SVG (Thatte 2001). Considering all the basic science and clinical arguments , together with increased risk of adverse events that inevitably 
follows graft failure , the goal of harvesting SVG with as near -perfect integrity of its intima layer as 
possible  seems prudent until available evidence demonstrates  otherwise .  
Because the enthusiastic adoption of EVH preceded any professional consensus on this topic, in 
2005 an ad hoc Committee of the International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery 
(ISMICS www.ISMICS.org
) published a consensus statement on the use of EVH vs. OVH in CABG  (Allen 
2005). Based on rep orts of short -term comparable rates of MACE , angiographic SVG patency, and 
quality of the harvested conduit with the two techniques in both randomized and non -randomized trials, 
the Members of the ISMICS Consensus Committee suggested that either EVH or OVH can be used to procure SVG co nduits for CABG. In addition, t he Consensus Committee also recommended that EVH be 
the “standard of care” (Class I, Level A)  in order to reduce wound -related complications, improve patient 
satisfaction, and to decrease postop  pain, length of hospital stay,  and use of outpatient wound -
management resources.  EVH is listed in a respected reference textbook entitled: “Evidence Based 
Cardiology –Third Edition”  edited by Yusuf as a Class IIa (Class of Recommendation IIa: conflicting 
evidence and/or divergence of opinion about the efficacy with weight of evidence in favor of efficacy) recommendation based on level B evidence (Brown 2010).   
Based on widespread concerns for excessive trauma to the SVG during EVH , in July of 2009, 
Lopes and associates from the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) reported in  The New England 
Journal of Medicine  on the long -term follow -up results of the Project of Ex- vivo Vein Graft Engineering 
via Tran sfection IV trial (PREVENT -IV) (Lopes 2009). The rate of  vein -graft failure was significantly higher 
in those subjects who underwent EVH (46.7% vs. 38.0 %; odds ratio 1.45 , 95% CI 1.20- 1.76). EVH was 
also associated with a significantly higher combined rate of mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization three years after surgery (20.2% vs. 17.4%; adjusted hazard ratio 1.22 , 95% CI 1.01-
1.47). The Authors’ findings constituted  the first published report of EVH resulting in poorer clinical 
outcomes than the OVH  technique . For the first time, EVH was found to be independently associated 
with vein graft failure and adverse clinical outcomes. This paper also provided important long- term 
follow -up data that contradict ed accepted clinical practice and called into question the wisdom of the 
ISMICS recommendations (Allen 2005). The DCRI Group recently reported an additional sub -analysis of 
the PREVENT -IV study  and reported no difference in angiographic or 5 -year clinical outcomes in patients 
who underwent open versus closed tunnel endoscopic harvesting  (47.1% vs. 43.8% p=0.72; 24.5% vs.

26.8% p=0.26) (Van Diepen 2013). These findings suggest that the in creased risk associated with EVH 
reported in the previous PREVENT -IV analysis does not seem to be associated with a specific endoscopic 
harvesting device.  
A meta -analysis of 102 studies  (including Lopes’) , published in 2010, compared EVH to OVH in 
CABG  (Markar 2010) . Results of this meta -analysis showed that long- term graft patency in SVG 
harvested by OVH was better than those harvested by EVH (pooled odds ratio = 1.25, p=0.0039 ).  
More recently, the Task Force on Myocardial Revascularization of the European Society of 
Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) published their 
updated Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularization (Wjins 2010). According to this consensus 
statement, incorporating new evidence accumula ted since 2009, “ endoscopic vein graft harvesting 
cannot be recommended at present as it has been associated with vein graft failure and adverse clinical 
outcomes ”. This statement contradicts the 2005 ISMICS guideline  and accepted clinical practice . Given 
the potential implications of the long -term impact of SVG graft failure on CABG outcomes, the role of 
EVH is currently the subject of substantial controversy in the literature (Aranki 2009; Cheng 2010; 
Connolly 2009; Patel 2009; Tennyson 2010).  
It is well  established that vein graft failure  (i.e. severe graft stenosis or occlusion)  adversely 
affects long -term clinical outcomes after CABG (Lopes 2012; Buxton 2009 ; Halabi 2005 ). In CSP #517 
ROOBY, ineffective revascularization (defined as presence of non -FitzGibbon “A” graft to one of the 
main coronary territory) was associated with worse composite clinical outcomes at one-year (Table  1) 
(Hattler 2012).  
Table 1.  ROOBY 1 Year Graft Patency Results  
FitzG ibbon described clinical outcomes and vein graft failure rates among 1,388 patients who 
underwent a first CA BG surgery from 1969 -1994 (FitzG ibbon 1996). This study showed that both 
mortality and vein graft failure rates increased over time , particularly seven years after CABG. At five 
years, survival rates were around 94% and vein graft failure rate was 25%. Halabi and associates found 
that early vein graft failure was associated with worse long -term outcomes of death, myocardial 
infarction and revascularization and that these results w ere driven by early revascularization  (Halabi 
2005) . In their study, vein graft failure was the strongest predictor of the composite clinical outcome at 
10 years.  In the PREVENT -IV Trial, vein graft failure occurred in 787 of 1,829 patients (43%)  [Alexande r

2005].  Using the same PREVENT -IV Trial database, Lopes and associates studied data from 1,829 
patients who underwent CABG surgery and had an angiogram performed up to 18 months following 
surgery (Lopes 2012) . They demonstrated that vein graft failure was associated with an increased risk 
for the composite of death, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization with an adjusted HR of 
5.23.  The composite outcome was driven by high rates of repeat revascularization in the patients with 
vein graft failure.  It should be noted that in all of these studies, ITA -LAD was used in the vast majority of 
patients (>93%) according to the predominant prac tice and recommendations (Class I, Level C) (Brown 
2010).  
 
II. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH   
 
Results of the VA CSP #517 ROOBY trial were recently published  (Shroyer 2009). We have 
previously published the results of two preplanned sub -analyses of the ROOBY trial (Zenati 2006; Zenati 
2007).  More recently, we published the results of a pre-planned sub -analysis examining clinical and SVG 
patency outcomes in ROOBY trial patients who underwent either EVH or OVH  (Zenati 2011). From 
February 2002 through April 2007, the  ROOBY trial enrolled 2,203 patients. Beginning in April 2003, 
prospective collection of data regarding SVG harvesting technique was begun. A total of 1,471 patients  
(564 EVH, 907 OVH) had the harvesting technique recorded and had a SVG used as a bypass co nduit. The 
30-day composite end point was known for all these patients. One -year composite follow -up was 
determined for 96% (555 EVH, 859 OVH) of these patients.  Follow- up angiography was obtained in 894 
subjects (341 EVH, 553 OVH). For both the populatio n of patients with their SVG harvest approach 
recorded (n = 1,471) and the sub -set with one-year cardiac catheterization (n = 894), the  pre-operative 
patient characteristics were generally balanced between the EVH and the OVH groups. Almost all 
patients were male (99%), a reflection of the VA cardiac surgical patient population. Sixty -eight percent 
of patients had three vessel coronary artery disease and approximately 83% of patients had preserved 
left ventricular function. Less than 1 5% of study patients required urgent surgery. The quality of the 
harvested SVG was assessed as “good” in 81.6% of EVH and 85.6% of OVH patients, “intermediate” in 
15.7% of EVH and 12.7% of OVH, and “poor” in 2.8% of EVH and 1.7% of OVH (p = NS). For the sh ort-
term composite end point there was no significant difference between EVH vs.  OVH. More OVH than 
EVH patients (1.3%) suffered renal failure (1.3% vs. 0.0%; p=0.01) and more OVH patients needed new 
mechanical support (1.7% vs. 0.4%; p=0.02).  There were no differences between EVH and OVH groups 
with respect to one-year composite outcome. For the subgroup of patients with one-year cardiac 
catheterization  results , the rate of repeat revascularization was significantly higher in the EVH group 
than in the OVH  group (6.7% vs.  3.4%, p<0.05),  while the rates of non -fatal MI or death were similar. A 
mean of 2.02 SVGs were placed per patient, and a total of 1,807 SVGs were assessed for patency. The 
incidence of a patient having one or more occluded SVGs on follow -up angiography was 41.3% in the 
EVH group compared with 28.0% in the OVH group (p<0.0001). Overall SVG patency was 74.5% in the 
EVH group, significantly worse than the 85.2% rate in the OVH group (p<0.0001).  Using multi -variable 
regression analysis, EVH was not identified as an independe nt and statistically significant predictor of 
the one-year composite outcome after holding other factors constant. Further, no interaction was 
identified between the SVG harvesting technique (EVH vs.  OVH) and the use of an on -pump vs. off-pump 
approach (p = NS). Additionally, sensitivity analysis found no differential EVH vs. OVH impact for high 
volume vs. low volume EVH centers.

In conclusion, our sub -analysis of the CSP #517 dataset demonstrated that the one-year SVG 
occlusion rate was 25.5% in the EVH group and 14.8% in the OVH group (p<0.001). The MACE rate was 
8.2% in the EVH group vs. 4.8% in the OVH group (p=0.061), and the rate of repeat revascularization by 
PCI or redo -CABG was 6.7% in the EVH group vs. 3.4% in the OVH group (p<0.001).  There was no 
interaction between EVH and on - or off -pump CABG by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Both the 
PREVENT -IV and ROOBY sub -analyses suffer from the same limitation: the basis for randomization was 
not t he SVG harvest modality (EVH vs.  OVH).  In addition, neither study account ed for other potentially 
important variables, such as device -related and experience- related EVH variables.  
 
Furthermore, w e recently published a  meta -analysis of long -term EVH vs . OVH graft patency 
including the results of our  recent publication (Zenati 2012 ); in the five  long -term observational studies 
from 1996 to 2011 included in our analysis,  SVG failure was expressed as the combination of 
angiographic occlusion and severe  stenosis (Fitz Gibbon grades B+O ). There were a total of 6,866 SVGs 
assessed by angiography  in the five pooled studies. Both random and fixed effects models showed 
significantly lower graft patency with EVH. The random effect pooled OR was 1.62  (95% CI = 1.22 –  2.15; 
p = 0.0009) and the fixed effect pooled OR was 1.49 (95% CI = 1.33 –  1.68; p<0.0001)  favoring OVH . We 
concluded that available evidence consistently identifies compromised SVG patency when the conduit 
was harvested with the EVH technique.   
 
 Because of safety concerns regarding endoscopic vein -graft harvesting, the US Food and Drug 
Administration issued a request to analyze the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery 
Database for endoscopic and open vein -graft harvesting –related out comes. The resulting study wa s 
published in JAMA  in 2012 (Williams 2012).  In this study 235, 394 Medicare patients undergoing isolated 
CABG surgery in 934 surgical centers between 2003 and 2008 were examined with a median 3 -year 
follow -up. Fifty -two percent  of patients received endoscopic vein -graft harvesting. In a propensity 
score –adjusted analysis that minimized the influence of confounding between groups, there were no 
significant differences between endoscopic vein -graft harvesting and open vein -graft h arvesting in 3 -
year mortality (13.2% vs 13.4%, respectively) or a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and 
revascularization (19.5% vs 19.7%, respectively). Compared with open vein -graft harvesting, endoscopic 
vein -graft harvesting was associated wit h a 13% lower harvest wound infection rate. Multiple 
sophisticated statistical techniques including sensitivity and subpopulation analyses confirm the 
robustness of the central findings. The study by Williams et a l is important  for several reasons. First is its 
sheer size and statistical power. Second, this investigation represents a snapshot  picture of 
contemporary CABG surgery in the United States because it includes so many diverse sites with widely 
varying practice styles. The basic finding is  that endo scopic vein -graft harvesting shows no difference in 
long- term mortality or need for revascu larization .  
 
 Taken together, the major subanalysis studies cited above (PREVENT -IV, ROOBY and STS) only 
establish uncertainty (or equipoise ) over the safest and mo st effective vein harvesting technique for 
CABG over a long -term follow up and lay the foundations for our proposed randomized study.

III. Study Objective s 
 
A. Primary Endp oint: 
 To investigate the impact of SVG  harvesting techniques –  OVH  vs. EVH on  MACE , a 
composite end  point of all- cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and repeat 
revascularization , over the active follow -up period of the study  postoperatively .  
 
B. Primary Hypothesis : 
A significant ly smaller proportion of CABG subject s with SVGs harvested by open 
technique will experience MACE post -surgery compared to CABG subject s with SVGs  harvested 
by endoscopic technique  during the active follow -up period.  
 C. Secondary Objective : 
i. To investigate the impact of SVG  harvesting techniques –  OVH  vs. EVH on  MACE , a 
composite endpoint of all -cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and repeat 
revascularization , at one and three -year postoperatively .  
ii. To investigate the impact of SVG  harvesting techniques –  OVH  vs. EVH on  MACE , a 
composite endpoint of all -cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and repeat 
revascularization , over the entire follow- up period (active and passive) of the study 
postoperatively . 
 
D.  Secondary Hypothesis :  
i. One-year composit e MACE rate will be 6 percentage points lower in the open 
harvesting group and three -year composite MACE rates will be at least 8 -10 percentage points 
lower in  the open vein harvesting group compared to the endoscopic vein harvesting group.  
ii. A significant smaller proportion of CABG subject s with SVGs harvested by open 
technique will experience MACE post -surgery compared to CABG subject s with SVGs  harvested 
by endoscopic technique  during the entire follow -up period  
 
Other  objectives are : 
 
1. Investigate  the impact of the two harvesting techniques  - open vs . endoscopic - on clinical 
indicators of leg wound complications  and subject  satisfaction at six-weeks post -surgery ; 
The hypothesis is the leg wound complication s will be lower and satisfaction will be higher 
in the EVH group compared to OVH group.  
2. Compare subject  quality of life  scores  according to the SVG harvest technique  at six-week  
post -surgery ; the hypothesis is the subject s’ quality of life scores will be higher in the EVH 
group compared to the OVH group . 
3. Determine the role of vein harvester experience on clinical outcomes   
 
 IV. Importance of the Study Topic to the VA and Its Patients  
 
CABG is the most common major surgical procedure in the U.S.  and the VAMC Health System, 
and EVH is now the preferred modality of SVG harvesting in both the private sector and the VAMC  (72%

EVH adoption rate in the VHA based on a 2009 survey commissioned by Dr . Gunner at VACO). Decisions 
regarding the choice of coronary revascularization  (CABG vs. percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) 
rest primarily on the anticipated failure rate of CABG  versus PCI.  The recent ARTS II trial (Serruys 2010) 
showed comparable freedom from MACE in selected patients undergoing multi- vesse l PCI versus CABG.  
 
In order to offer the safest and most durable revascularization strategy for v eterans requiring 
CABG surgery, it is imperative to provide definitive evidence on the long- term clinical outcomes of EVH 
in order to m inimize harvest site m orbidity   (e.g. leg wound infection, hospital readmission, pain, 
mobilization, and  appealing cosmetic results) while preserving long- term clinical outcomes . The qu ality 
of the harvested conduit is an important aspect to consider when comparing harvesting techniques. 
These features ultimately determine long -term patient morbidity and mortality rates following CABG 
surgery  (Buxton 2009) .  
 
V. Summary of the Study Design  
 
This study  is a r andomized, intent -to-treat, two-arm,  parallel design, m ulticenter study  to 
compare  clinical outcomes of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of CABG subject s treated with SVG 
harvested with EVH and OVH  during the trial period . Cardiac Surgery Programs at Veterans Affairs 
Medical C enters  (VAMC s) with expertise in performing both EVH and OVH will be invited to participate 
in the study  (EVH P rogram established for more than two years and at least 100 successful EVH cases  
performed by each mid -level provider or other designated individual involved with  the study)  (Desai 
2011) . Subject s requiring elective or urgent CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass with use of at least one 
SVG will be screened using established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subject s will be randomized to  one 
of the two  arms (EVH or OVH) after an ex perienced vein harvester is identified and assigned  to the case. 
Assessments will be collected at multiple time points including: baseline, intraoperatively, 
postoperatively, at discharge or 30 days after surgery if still hospitalized. A ssessment of leg wound 
complications  will be completed at the time of discharge and at six- week post- surgery. Quality of life 
self-  assessments will be completed at baseline, six weeks, and one year (by mail or telephone).  
Telep hone follow -ups will occur at three -month intervals post -surgery  until the participating sites are 
decommissioned at the end of the trial period (which would be approximately 4.5 years after the site 
initiations). For long -term MACE outcomes, passive follow up for MACE  using VA  clinical and  
administ rative databases (CPRS, VASQIP , etc. ) will be performed centrally by the Study Chair’s office for 
another 2 years.  
 The other secondary outcome measures  are MACE at one  and three- year post surgery, leg 
wound healing complications and Quality of Life.  
 Two leading vendors (Maquet  and Terumo) are currently marketing EVH device technologies for 
CABG.  Device -related and procedural information will be collected during the study.  
 Subject s will receive concomitant optimal medical therapies (OMT) in both groups as 
recommended by the current 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
guidelines  [Smith 2011) . OMT will include formal smoking cessation counseling and the administration 
of aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid -lowering medications.

VI. Subject  Population  
 
All subject s who are candidates for CABG and who will undergo surgery at a VAMC  with 
demonstrated expertise for both OVH and  EVH and qualify  to participate in CSP -sponsored research will 
be invited to participate in the REGROUP study.  
 
A. Inclusion Criteria:  
• Age 18 years or older  
• Elective or Urgent CABG -only  
• Median sternotomy approach  
• At least one coronary bypass planned using saphenous vein graft for conduit  
• Experienced EVH/OVH harvester and participating surgeon available for 
procedure  
  
B. Exclusion Criteria:  
• Combined valve procedure planned  
• Moderate or severe valve disease (see definition of moderate/severe valve)  
• Hemodynamically unstable or in cardiogenic shock  
• Enrolled in another therapeutic or interventional study  
• Off-pump CABG procedure planned  
• Limited life expectancy < 1 year  
• History of lower extremities venous stripping or ligation  
• Inability to provide informed consent  
 
C. Recruitment and Screening  
 
We propose a  prospective, multicenter, two -arm, randomized clinical trial (RCT) . A block 
randomization technique will ensure equal distribution of subject s, within each harvester, within each 
site, in both arms of the trial. The randomization sche ma will be generated using SAS (SAS, Cary, NC).  
 Participating sites will be chosen based on availability of EVH/OVH harvesters  (see Appendix F ), 
but also based on CABG volume as well as  ability  and willingness  of the local site surgeon investigator to 
meet enrollment goals. The local site surgeon investigators and research coordinators will be trained on 
study specific recruitment at the Investigator Meeting. Subsequently, each  local sit e surgeon 
investigator will present the study protocol to the appropriate local clinical care providers for subject s 
undergoing CABG surgery at their  site so those involved i n the care of the subject s are familiar with the 
protocol requirements. Each site will have one full time  dedicated research coordinator to facilitate 
enrollment.  Each site will obtain a waiver of informed consent /HIPAA  for screening purposes from the 
local IRB and following this, will work with the clinical care team to identify subje cts refe rred for CABG 
surgery who  meet study  criteria. Every CABG -only subject  the site surgeon investigator deems as

meeting study criteria will be approached. After preliminary consultation and screening with a potential 
participant’s clinical team, the participating site’s research coordinator will approach each non -
emergent subject  scheduled for a CABG- only procedure to discuss enrollment in the REGROUP study. 
After providing the potential subject  adequate time to read the documents and to ask any questions, 
the research coordinator will obtain informed consent and collect all the baseline assessments. 
Randomization to either the EVH or OVH technique , stratified by harvester within site,  will occur at the 
time of surgery  after a qualified harvester is assigned to the case .  
 
We recognize the VA policy to include women and minorities in clinical research. Although we 
do not anticipate a large number of women or minorities to be recruited for this stu dy due to the 
demographics of subject s receiving care at the VA, efforts will be made to recruit both women and 
minorities for the REGROUP trial. At present, there are no ongoing or submitted research studies that directly relate to the REGROUP trial.  
 VII. Saphenous Vein Harvesting Techniques  
 
The greater saphenous vein lies in the subcutaneous fat on the medial aspect of the leg from the 
sapheno -femoral junction to the medial malleolus. Below the knee, the vein is accompanied by the 
saphenous nerve which should be preserved during harvest. The vein is usually larger proximally with  a 
thicker, more fibrotic wall, while distally the vein is healthier but may be small. The vein wall is thicker than that of an arterial conduit and the media is nourished by the vasa vasorum  so that smooth muscle 
necrosis is usual after harvesting and it is replaced by fibrous tissue that converts the vein into a rather rigid tube. This obviously restricts vasomotion after grafting. The endothelium of the vein is frequently 
damaged or lost even with meticulous harvesting  and preservation (Barner 1990) but regenerates over 
weeks (Busch 1986). Immediately prior to harvest , the lower extremities are circumferentially prepped 
with antiseptic solution (povidone -iodine or Hibiclens®) and the feet are placed in sterile stockinettes. 
Vein mapping is not used routinely and the selection of extremity is determined by presence of 
varicosities, any previous surgery, and the quality of skin and tissue.   
 
A. Technique of Open Vein Harvesting  
 
The conventional open harvesting technique requires an incision the length of the vein to be 
harvested or alternatively can be achieved by multiple small incisions (“bridging”). Dissection should be 
as atraumatic as possible, forceps should handle only the adventitia of the vein and stretch trauma minimized. Branches are controlled with clips or ligature. Cautery is rarely  used during OVH to divide 
vein branches , but only to provide wound hemostasis before the incision is closed.  Following harvest, 
the vein is marked by placing a soft vascular bulldog clamp on the new distal end or by cannulating the new proximal end. The vein is gently distended with a physiologic solution at low pressure (no more than 150mmHg, ideally using specially designed pressure -limiting syringes). Closure of the incision is 
performed in layers with absorbable sutures followed by subcuticular closur e. At the end of the 
operation, the leg wound is typically covered with a cotton gauze dressing and an elastic ace wrap is applied to the entire leg. The “bridging” OVH technique variant was shown to be associated with similar rates of leg wound complications versus open OVH (Carpino 2000) and requires more technical expertise 
and a longer training period.

Version 1.2 Protocol

The OVH technique is highly reproducible  and can be performed by surgical trainees, including 
medical students, and mid -level providers like Physician A ssistants (PA) or Certified Registered Nurse 
Practitioners (CRNP). OVH is associated with variable (2 -18%) degrees of morbidity, such as wound 
infection, especially in high -risk patient subsets (obese, diabetics, females), non -infective wound healing 
distu rbances, postoperative pain, and poor mobility. Such morbidity prolongs the length of hospital stay, 
increases health care costs, and reduces patient satisfaction (Carpino 2000; Markar 2010).  
 
B. Technique of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting  
 
The preparation for EVH is similar to OVH but there is an additional requirement for video 
equipment and a video tower for the endoscope. Before initiating EVH, some centers administer 5,000 
IU of intravenous heparin to prevent SVG thrombosis: this practice is based on limited evidence from a 
small, single center study that showed a decrease in fibrin clots in SVG harvested with EVH  when low -
dose heparin was used  (Brown 2007). EVH can be performed with one of the  commercially available 
systems that follow similar technic al steps (VasoView®, available since 1996 and first marketed by Origin 
Med Systems, then by Boston Scientific/Guidant Cardiac Surgery, and currently by MAQUET 
Cardiovascular, Wayne, NJ www.maquet.com  [estimated EVH U.S . market share 90%]; Virtuosaph™, 
introduced in 2005, Terumo Cardiovascular Systems Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI www.terumo -
cvs.com/virtuosaph  [approximate estimated EVH U.S. market share 8%]; all using CO 2 insufflation for 
visualization and dissection (the system is “open” for the Terumo device). Briefly, a 1.5 to 2.0 cm incision is made medially above or below the knee, depending o n the length of the vein required. Harvesting is 
performed under video guid ance with a rigid endoscope and is directed towards the groin region as far 
proximally as possible. If three segments of vein are required, the endoscope may also be directed distally through the same incision. Side branches are divided by using bipolar ca uterizing scissors or a 
bisector. EVH requires CO
2 to insufflate the subcutaneous cavity in the lower extremity and frequent use 
of bipolar cautery in the vicinity of saphenous vein in order to divide the side branches; neither insufflation n or bipolar ene rgy is required for OVH. The use of cautery has been proposed to cause 
thermal injury to the vessel wall, which may impair the graft quality by compromising the viability of endothelial cells and resulting in plat elet aggregation and thrombosis (Rousou 200 9). After the vein has 
been freed circumferentially from surrounding tissue and all branches have been divided, a small 
puncture is made under endoscopic guidance proximally over the SVG. The proximal end is clamped,  
divided, and then ligated.  After remov ing the vein from the leg, SVG is gently distended manually with a 
distending solution and the side branches are ligated with 4 -0 silk ties. Any avulsed branches are either 
repaired by carefully approximating the adventitial layer with 7 -0 Prolene sutures or excluded if 
fortuitously located between vein graft segments.  The incision is closed with absorbable subcutaneous 
and subcuticular sutures and then wrapped with an elastic ace bandage. The SVG is then placed in a storage solution (i.e. heparinized bloo d, physiological pH balanced salt solution or GALA solution) until it 
is ready for use. Incisions are closed after harvest with or without drains.  
 Best practice EVH  technique will be recommended at all sites and will include:  
Optimal preoperative preparation , including vein mapping whenever possible, plan the EVH procedure 
as having 3 separate stages: (a) choosing the incision site and making the incision, (b) dissecting the 
vessel and vessel tributaries, and (c) dividing the vessel branches.

Incis ion: decide on the best place to make the incision and mark the site, keep the length of the skin 
incision to a minimum, consider making the incision to correspond with tension lines of the skin.  
Heparin : an intravenous heparin bolus of a minimum of 1,000I U to a maximum of 5,000IU will be used at 
the beginning of the harvest.  
CO 2 insufflation : use the lowest tunnel pressure possible to reduce the risk of CO 2 embolism, monitor 
central venous pressure, use appropriate monitoring to be alerted to CO 2 –related events .  The trocar 
cuff should be kept delated or minimally inflated to avoid interruption of blood flow inside the SVG.  
Dissection of the vessel : establish a regular sequence of dissection; use short, gentle motions, ensure 
that side branches a re thoroughly dissected to allow adequate length during branch division, apply 
appropriate pressure with the opposing hand to promote ease of dissection along the vessel  
Division of branches : establish a regular sequence for dividing the branches,  conside r making a 
fasciotomy  along the tunnel if the space is very tight, before dividing the branch consider whether it is 
of adequate length to clip or tie, keep energy settings as low as possible during branch division  
Vessel removal and preparation : make sur e all branches and connective tissue are free from the vein 
before removing it, use appropriate technique for distal ligation of the vessel, take care not to stretch  
the vessel when removing it from the tunnel, once the vessel is extracted and prepared, pl ace it in the 
specified solution until ready for use in the surgery.  
 VIII. Human Rights Issues and Informed Consent  
 
After a subject  has been deemed eligible for the trial through screening, the research 
coordinator or site investigator will obtain informed consent from the subject .  After the clinical care 
team meets with the subject  to discuss the CABG procedure t he research coordinator at each site will 
introduce him/herself and explain the study to the subject  and present the detailed consent form  if the 
subject  gives permission to discuss  the research study .  The consenting process for the research study 
will occur at a separate time point, after the informed consent for clinical care has been completed.  Subsequently, the site investigator or a designee will review and discuss the study with the subject  and 
answer any questions that the subject  might have.  The general purpose of the study, along with 
detailed information about the treatment comparisons, the randomization process, the study timeline, including what is expected of the subject , and the rights of study subject s will be clearly desc ribed.  The 
harvesting techniques (both EVH and OVH) and the associated risks with the techniques  will also be 
addressed.  The importance of subject  confidentiality will be stressed, and the process for maintaining 
confidentiality will be described. This d iscussion will be held in an area that provides the subject  time to 
focus on reading information about the study and asking questions without feeling rushed or 
uninformed.  Any family member the subject  requests to be present will be included.  At this time, the 
surgeon (s) participating in the study will also meet with the subject  to discuss the study and answer any 
questions about the two different types of procedures for vein harvesting that might be performed.  
 
The site investigator or rese arch coordinator will ensure that the subject  understands every 
aspect of the trial, including its risks and benefits, prior to signing the informed consent.  
 
If the subject  agrees, his/her consent to participate in the study will be recorded on the CSP#  
588 Informed Cons ent Form (VA form 10 -1086, See Appendix A –  Informed Consent Form).  The original 
will be kept in the site investigator’s study file for that subject  and a copy will be placed in the subject ’s

medical record.  Copies of the signed consent form will be prov ided to the subject , the Research Office 
at the participating site (if required by the IRB), and faxed or mailed via UPS/FedEx  to the Perry Point 
CSPCC at the time of enrollment in the study.   
 
Informed consent requires that the subject  understand the de tails of the study and agrees, 
without coercion, to participation in the study. To obtain informed consent, the following information 
shall be provided to each subject:  
 
• Name of the study  
• Name(s) of the Site Investigators  
• Explanation that the study involves research  
• Explanation of the purpose of the study  
• Explanation of the treatment procedures  
• Description of randomization 
• Description of the risks and benefits of participation in the study  
• New findings that may affect willingness to maintain particip ation in the study  
• A description of alternatives to participation in the study  
• Explanation that all records will be kept confidential, but that records may be examined by representatives of the VA  
• Who to contact for questions about the research and about s ubjects’ rights  
• Who to contact in the event of research -related injury  
• A statement that participation in the study is voluntary and that a decision not to participate or to withdraw from the study after initially agreeing involves no penalty, loss of benef its or reduction 
in access to medical care  
• The consequences of a subject ’s decision to withdraw from the study, and a description of the 
procedure for orderly termination of participation  
 
In conjunction with the informed consent procedure, subject s will review and be asked to sign 
the Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information Form as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act ( HIPAA ). 
 
IX. Evaluation Procedur es 
 
A. Screening  
 
The research study coordinator will be primarily responsible for identifying  each non -emergent 
subject  scheduled for a CABG- only procedure with planned SVG harvesting. A diagnostic catheterization 
must be performed within six months  prior to the scheduled operation  to be used as part of the 
baseline assessments . The participating surgeon (s) must agree that the subject  is eligible for either study 
arm before randomization  based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria defined by the protocol . This 
includes a review of the  medical history for any lower extremity issues that would prevent the harvest of 
an effective SVG such as varicose veins, etc. Following subject  informed consent, the baseline risk 
assessment , clinical data and subject  self-reported symptom status and hea lth related quality of life data 
will be obtained  by the study team .

14 
 
 
B. Randomization  
 
All participating vein harvesters must meet the minimum EVH /OVH volume criteria [ at least 100 
EVH cases with low conversion rates (<5%) as part of an  EVH program established for more than two 
years] to be eligible to enroll subject s in this study. Unless an urgent medical condition exists , the 
subject ’s surgery will be scheduled  to occur at the earliest possible date  based on expert harvester 
availability and other center circumstances . The randomization procedure will occur after the 
participating expert harvester is assigned to the subject . Subject s will be randomized within the assigned 
participating harvesters to one of the two study harvesting tec hnique  arms  (EVH or OVH).  
 
Recognizing that the subject ’s assignment to a participating vein harvester will have already 
occurred, the study randomization to either EVH or OVH will be d one by a telephone call to the P erry 
Point Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSPCC) .   A block randomization scheme will be 
used to randomize subject s in two treatment groups. A random sequence of block sizes will be used to 
reduce the chances of guessing future allocations.  
 
C. Subject  Assessment s 
 
Baseline assessments will be collected prior to surgery and randomization  including Body Mass Index, 
Ankle -Brachial Index and Venous Clinical Severity Scale . Intraoperative assessments will be collected 
during the CABG procedure , 24 and 48 hours postoperatively  as well as  assessments at the time of 
hospital discharge or 30 days post -surgery , whichever occurs first. Subject s will return for a six -week 
clinic visit to assess the condition of their leg incision and healing status.  Any necessary medical care 
required w ill be administered per the Institution’s standard practice.  
 
Subject s will receive a phone call every three months for follow -up for events until subject 
termination .   Subjects will complete QoL surveys again at one year either by telephone or mail.  If the 
subject  reports a major adverse cardiac event (e.g. MI, repeat revascularization) after discharge from 
the hospital, then records will be obtained for final adjudication. Ascertainment for death will include review of VA central databases.    
 Follow ing is a list of assessments/study details that we plan on collecting:  
 
  Screening Record:   To compare subject s screened (but not enrolled) to subject s enrolled in 
this study, a comprehensive screening assessment will be completed for all potentially eligible subject s 
scheduled to receive a n on-pump CABG -only procedure at a participating center by the study research 
coordinator.  
 
 Initial Assessment of Coronary Arteries:   A cardiac catheterization will need to be  performed 
within six months prior to randomization into the REGROUP trial.  A local catheterization laboratory 
reading and a local clinical team assessment (of target vessels denoting those vessels planned to be bypassed) will be required.  SYNTAX score will be calculated for each catheterization.   In addition, the 
surgeon will be asked to describe a surgical plan indicating which bypass grafts are planned after 
reviewing the cardiac catheterization  results .

  Subject  Risk Characteristics:   To evaluate the impact of EVH vs.  OVH procedures upon 
subject  subgroups for a possible different ial benefit,  clinical data elements  (i.e. height, weight, co -
morbidity data, functional status, previous hear t problems), cardiac catheterization and angiographic 
data, operative risk summary data (including operative death data), operative data, resourc e data (i.e. 
date and times of hospitalization, operation began and operation ended), socioeconomic data, and 
laboratory information will be collected .  STS and VASQIP scores will be calculated by the site research 
coordinator with the oversight of the local site surgeon investigator.  
 
 Intraoperative Assessment:    Details about vessels bypassed, including size and quality of 
conduits used, quality of target arteries and suture technique will be collected.   Intraoperative 
complications will be recorded  during the first 24 and 48 hours post -surgery and will include  
intraoperative bleeding complications,  use of  new intra -aortic balloon pump or assist device, unplanned 
cardiac arrest , blood product usage , as well as other variables .  
 
 Post -operative Lab and Diagnostic Test Evaluation:   Twelve -lead EKGs will be obtained on 
the first two post -op days as noted in the detailed data forms.  This isa routine test , commonly 
performed as part of usual postoperative clinical care for CABG patients.   In the event the 12 -lead  EKG 
indicates either new pathologic Q waves or a new Left Bundle Branch Block, cardiac biomarker  levels 
(preferably cardiac Troponin) will be collected from the subject every eight hours until a downward 
trend is seen. The peak cardiac biomarke r  value and reference range (including the 99th percentile of 
the Upper Reference Limit-  URL) will be collected on the postoperative data collection Form 6.  
 
 30-Day Operative Mortality Assessment:   Subject s will be noted to have died in -hospital or 
discharged alive.  For subject s discharged alive, their vital status will be reassessed at 30 days post -
CABG . 
 
 30-Day Morbidity Assessment :  The presence/absence of major post- operative 
complications that occu rred prior to discharge or within 30 days of CABG  will be recorded.   Leg wound 
healing assessments and infection data will also be collected  at discharge .   
 
 In-hospital Resource Use :  Several in -hospital indicators including operating room time, 
extubation time (with reintubation times noted), SICU len gth of stay, pre -operative and postoperative 
length of stay, and total blood product use (both intraoperatively and post -operatively) will be 
measured.

X. Post -Discharge Follow -up Assessments  
 
A. Six Week  Visit  
 
 Subject s will be assessed for leg wound complications approximately 6 weeks post- surgery  
during a clinic visit  (this visit will take place between 4 weeks to 8 weeks post- surgery) . Problems and/or 
procedures related to their cardiac health ( i.e., acute myocardial infarctions , revascularization  
procedures , or a clinically indicated cardiac catheterization ) will be obtained, S elf-assessment 
satisfaction survey will be repeated at this time  as well as Quality of Life questionnaires .  Any necessary 
medical care required will be administered per the Institution’s standard practice.  
 
B. Interim Follow -Up 
 
   Every three  months  during the active follow -up period  post -surgery , the site study 
coordinator  will contact the study subject s by telephone to determine whether they  have experienced 
any problems and/or procedures related to their cardiac health ( i.e., acute myocardial infarctions , 
revascularization procedures , or a clinically indicated cardiac cath eterization ).  These interim calls will 
collect MACE data, maintain rapport with subject s and let them know that the study team at the sites  is 
interested in their progress .  At one year the subject will complete QoL surveys by telephone or mail.  
 
C. Monitoring Serious Adverse Events  
 
a.  Role of the Local Site Investigator in Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE)   
  The local site investigator is responsible for following CSP reporting requirements:  
• Complying with the study procedure for reporting seri ous adverse events;  
• Reviewing the accuracy and completeness of all SAEs reported;  and 
• Closely monitoring research subjects for any new SAEs.  
 
b. Study Intervention  
For the purpose of this study, the intervention for this study is defined as the vein harvesti ng procedure for a saphenous vein graft  in coronary artery bypass . 
 
c. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)   
A serious adverse event is an adverse event that results in one of the following 
outcomes:  
• Result in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions ;  
• Important medical events that may not result in d eath, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this de finition ;

Version 1.2 Protocol  
October 1, 2013

• SAEs will be reported regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.  
 
d. SAE Monitoring and Reporting 
Research s ubjects will be monitored at each study contact (i.e., phone call and follow -up 
clinic visits).  Serious adverse events will be collected and recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form.  Active monitoring of SAEs will begin as soon as a research subject signs the Informed Consent and will continue through end -of-study for each 
subject.   
 
Serious adverse events  require expedited reporting .  Expedited reporting is defined as 
the completion and submission of the appropriate electronic case report form to  the 
study’s DataFax system  within three (3) business days  of the Local Site Investigator 
being aware of the SAE .  The Study Pharmacist (or designee) is responsible for 
evaluating all SAEs for subject  safety concerns by the close of business the next day after 
receipt of the SAE .   
 
e. Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)    
The Perry  Point CSP Center and CSP Clinical Research Ph armacy Coordinating Center will 
prepare aggregated SAE reports for the DMC annually or on a schedule set by the Committee.   
 
D. Missed Visits  
 
 If the subject  fails to come to the clinic for the six-week  follow -up visit, the research 
coordinator at the site will call the subject  on the same day or, at the latest, the next working day to 
inqu ire about the reason for the missed visit and to reschedule the subject ’s appointment as soon as 
possible.  The research coordinator will continue trying to contact the subject  until the subject  receives 
an appointment  or formally withdraws from the study .  If the subject  still refuses, the research 
coordinator will try to co mplete as much of the six -week  assessments as possible on the phone by 
interview and/or by mail (e.g., the V R-12, Seattle Angina Questionnaire).  
 
E. Termination  
 
 All subject s will be followed up actively until the sites are decommissioned.  After the six -
week clinic visit, each subject will be contacted by phone, every three months, to collect information on any MACE event, leg wound status, etc.  If the subject cannot be contacted, his/her CPRS records will be assessed to check for any MACE event.  If  the subject dies or refuses to continue participation, he/she 
will be terminated.  A termination form will be used to record the termination information for these subjects.  At the end of the active follow- up phase (approximately 4.5 years from study start -up) each  
 continuing subject’s status will be recorded in a termination form to indicate official termination of the 
active follow -up phase of the study.   
  All subjects terminated from the active follow -up phase of the study will be continually 
followe d by the study’s national nurse coordinator where existing VA  administrative databases will be 
mined for MACE  for another two years (passive follow -up phase).

XI. Quality Control Procedures  
 
A. Standardization/Validation of Measurements  
 
 Prior to the start of the study  enrollment , all of the site investigators, harvesters and 
research coordinators will be provided with in -depth trainings on different aspects of the conduct of the 
study during a “kick -off” meeting to ensure proper  understand ing of  the technic al aspects of the 
protocol, to ensure uniformity in the completion  and submission  of the case report  forms and to ensure 
uniformity in implementing and perform ing the study procedures.  
 
 During this meeting, the site investigators and harvesters will receive a half- day of Good 
Clinical Practices (GCP) training and the research coordinators will receive one day of GCP training.  If 
any of the research coordinator s from the participating sites is unable to attend the kick -off meeting, a 
repeat GCP training will be arrange d. The GCP trainings will be provide by the SMART team from the 
Pharmacy Coordinating Center, Albuquerque , New Mexico . In any event, until this training is  completed, 
the sites will not be allowed to  begin randomization for the study.  
 
 Site investigators and research coordinators will also receive informed consent and study 
procedures training by the Perry Point Cooperative Studies Program staff during the kick -off meeting.  
The Perry Point Nurse Coordinator will provide a more detailed training on the study specific informed 
consent procedures.  Other Perry Point Coordinating Center Staff will provide training on study procedures including the use of the study S hare Point portal, data collection  on the DataFax  platform , 
randomization and assessment schedules.  Specific training sessions will be as follows:  
• Study Procedures  and Definitions  
• EVH/OVH Best Practices  
• Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
• Strategies for subject  contact and follow -up visits  
• Data capture  using DataFax  
 
B. Subject  Management  
 This research study will be conducted in full accordance with ethical principles of human 
research, including the provisions of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.  
All CABG subject s will be screened for study eligibility using the same  inclusion/exclusion criteria as 
defined in this protocol.  Those subject s who qualify will be engaged in the study consent process by the 
clinical care team in collaboration with the research coordinator and led by the surgeon investigator.  For those who  agree to participate, local sites will adhere to their institution’s established best clinical 
practices in the care of the CABG subject s with exception to allowing for randomization of the 
harvesting technique at the time of surgery.  Quality of life que stionnaires will be completed at baseline , 
at six -week  and at one - year  post CABG .  Subjects will be followed throughout their surgery and at 
discharge for research data collection including any serious adverse events (e.g. major adverse cardiac events).   The subject s will be monitored the first and the second day post -operatively with 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram s .  Per standard clinical care  and most recent guidelines [ Thyegesen 2012] , cardiac 
biomarkers (preferably cardiac Troponin I or T) will be obtained if the 12 -lead  EKG demonstrates

evidence of type 5 [Thyegesen 2012] myocardial infarction, including new pathologic Q waves or new 
Left Bundle Branch Block.  The cardiac biomarker will be obtained every eight hours until a downward 
trend i s seen in the level.  Usual inpatient post -operative care will follow institutional standards.  
Information on subject  satisfaction and leg wound complications will be obtained at discharge and six 
weeks post -CABG.  Local site coordinators will contact the  subjects every  three months to collect 
information by phone regarding the subject’s health status  throughout the active follow -up . 
 
Subject s will be encouraged to seek medical attention as instructed upon discharge  from the  
hospital .  All efforts will be made to obtain follow -up information on subjects who have visited a 
hospital, underwent procedures or have been treated for serious adverse events in a non -study -related 
hospital(s).  Non -study hospital related materials  will be collected and reviewed at the study 
coordinating centers.   
 
Throughout the duration of  the study participation , the subject  will be encouraged to 
maintain a point of contact with the local site investigator and the study coordinator for research 
related activities a nd questions. The study team at each site will maintain a dedicated point of contact 
for all subjects seeking information during their study participation. The study coordinator at each site will communicate any necessary medical information to the surgeon  investigator and the clinical care 
team.   
  Long- term secondary MACE outcomes will be collected by passive follow -up using VA databases 
for an additional two  years after the completion of the active follow -up phase . 
 
C. Protocol Non -compliance  
 
 Any protocol non -compliance will be reported immediately to the Chairman’s office and the 
Perry Point CSPCC.  Each of these groups then reserves the right to forward notification, as required by local policy and regulation.  Examples of protocol non -compliance  include failure to obtain informed 
consent, failure to adhere to exclusion criteria, failure to report a serious adverse event , or no surgery is 
performed after randomization  etc.   
 
D. Site Performance Monitoring  
 
In order to assure the successful conduct and completion of this study, all sites must adhere to 
certain performance standard s.  The Perry Point CSPCC and the Chairman’s Office will jointly set 
performance standards and monitor site activities to assure that these standards are met.  
 All cooperati ve studies are on probation during the first year of enrollment.  Studies that do not 
recruit at least 90% of the target enrollment during the first year  are in danger of having monetary 
support stopped.  
 
In order to meet th e target  enrollment , recruitment  activit ies at the participating sites will be 
monitored aggressively.  The Perry Point CSPCC will issue month ly recruitment reports to the Executive 
Committee and the Chairman’s Office.   The study Chair will contact the underperforming sites to 
identify problems and to recommend solutions.

XII.   DATA MANAGEMENT AND CASE REPORT FORMS 
 
A.  Assessments, Case Report Forms (CRFs) and their Frequency of Administration and Collection   
 
Please refer to Table 2 for a list of assessments and their frequencies of administration and 
collection.  
 
B. Data Collection and Data Entry  
 
Data management will be performed by the VA CSPCC Perry Point, MD using DataFax, a data  
management software.    The CSPCC will have overall responsibility for the data at the end of the study.  
 
All data will be collected at the study sites on source documents, which will be entered at the 
site into paper CRFs.   The blank CRFs will be supplied  by the VA CSPCC Perry Point, MD.   CRFs are to be 
completed on an ongoing basis during the study.   The medical chart and the source documents are the 
source of verification of data.   CRFs should be completed according to the instructions in the study 
opera tions manual.   The local site investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete and up -
to-date records for each subject.   The local site investigator is also responsible for maintaining any 
source documentation related to the study, including any films, ECG tracings, computer discs or tapes.  
 Completed CRFs will be faxed by center personnel on a regular basis to the DataFax system at 
the VA CSPCC Perry Point, MD.   DataFax allows the clinical centers to retain the original CRF and source 
documen ts while providing a faxed image to the VA CSPCC.   Data within the faxed image are then 
checked for accuracy/completeness and entered into the study’s database using DataFax software.   Data 
received at the VA Perry Point CSPCC will be reviewed, verified an d edited before being entered into the 
main study database.   If incomplete or inaccurate data are found, a data clarification request will be 
forwarded to the clinical site for a response.   Sites will resolve data errors before refaxing the corrected 
CRFs to the VA CSPCC .  All corrections and changes to the data will be reviewed before being entered 
into the main study database.   The VA CSP , Study Chair  and the participating sites will receive reports at 
least monthly regarding the quality and quantity of data submitted to the VA Perry Point CSPCC.  
 
Site investigators agree to routine data audits by the staff of the VA CSP monitoring unit, as well 
as by the CSPCC staff.   The VA CSP monitors will routinely visit each site to assure that data submitted on 
the appropriate forms are in agreement with source documents at the sites.   They will also verify that 
subject informed consent for study participation ha s been obtained and documented in the subject’s 
progress notes, all essential documents required by GCP regulations are on file, and sites are conducting the study according to the research protocol.   Any inconsistencies will be resolved, and any changes t o 
the data forms will be made using established VA CSPCC Perry Point procedures.  
 When the study is completed and all data have been entered into the clinical database and the 
database has been checked for quality assurance and is locked, the CSPCC statist icians will perform 
statistical analyses of the data in accordance with the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Periodically, during the study, CSPCC will prepare various summary reports of the data so that progress of the study can be 
monitored.  These repo rts will be prepared for the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and other 
committees, as appropriate.

C. Study Documentation and Records Retention  
  Study documentation includes all paper CRFs, data clarification forms , source documents, 
monitoring logs and app ointment schedules, investigator correspondence and regulatory documents 
(e.g., signed protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approved consent form and signed informed consent forms, Statement of Investigator form, etc.).  
  Source documents inclu de all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities 
and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the study.  Thus, source documents include, but are not limited to laboratory reports, subject  completed as sessments,  progress 
notes, hospital charts or pharmacy records and any other reports or records of any procedure performed in accordance with the protocol.  
  Whenever possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the 
source docum ent; however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and exact 
duplication of the original document.  
  Research records for all study subject s including medical history and physical findings, 
laboratory data, and results of consult ations with the primary care physician are to be maintained by the 
investigator in accordance with the VA record control schedule  until notified by CSPCC.  These records 
are to be maintained in compliance with IRB, State and Federal requirements, whichever is longest. It is 
the investigator’s responsibility to retain copies of the completed CRFs until notified in writing by CSPCC that they can be destroyed.  In all instances, the site must get permission from CSPCC prior to 
disposition of any study documentation and materials.   
  All records with identifiers will be stored indefinitely in accordance with the VA Records 
Control Schedule.  
 D. Data Security Plan 
 To maintain subject confidentiality, all data submitted to CSPCC for the current study will be 
coded using alpha -numeric identifiers only.   Only on -site research staff and the sponsor’s delegated 
program officials will have access to records that may identify subjects.   Paper research and clinical 
records will be stored on site in a locked cabinet in a secure location.   Electronic records will be 
accessible only by data management staff, clinical monitors and active site perso nnel who have 
furnished the required training and credentials.   Permissions will be maintained by the CSPCC data 
management staff and can be revoked at any time.     Subject information will not be released without 
written permission, except as necessary fo r monitoring by the FDA, the VA CSP monitoring unit or the 
Sponsor.  
 By participating in this protocol, the local site investigator agrees that within local regulatory restrictions 
and ethical considerations, the Sponsor or any regulatory agency may consu lt and/or copy study 
documents in order to verify data.

All data collected for this study will be handled and used in compliance with both the VA  and the 
CSP data security plans.  All subject  level data will be treated as protected health information.  Study 
personnel at CSPCC and at participating sites will be required to complete annual training courses.  
These courses will cover good clinical practices, human subjects’ protection, cyber sec urity, and privacy 
policy.  Any data security breaches will be immediately reported.    Subject  level data will never be 
stored on portable storage devices unless it is encrypted, explicitly authorized, and use specific.  
 
All private information will be ke pt on an encrypted, password protected server to which a small 
number of people will have access. Access to the cross -walk file linking the subject ’s identifiers and their 
study data will be restricted to the clinical site and to the approved personnel at the Chair’s Office and 
Coordinating Center. This file will be destroyed according to CSP policy.  
 
All data will be stored within the VA firewall and will be password protected at all times. Hard 
copy data will be sent via a traceable mail system (i.e., UPS ), via a courier, or via secure fax.   Access to 
these secure fax servers is restricted to the VA Perry Point coordinating center personnel with approved 
access to the system. All secure fax servers are compliant with VA directive 1605.1 and 6500. All data 
security incidents will be reported in accordance with VA policy within one hour of discovering the incident to:  
• The District (local) Information Security Officer (ISO)  
• The VA Perry Point CSPCC Data Security Officer  
• The local IRB.  
 
Administrative and healthcare utilization data on consenting participants will be extracted from the VA national database resources. The VA national data resources include, but are not limited to: the National Patient Care Database (OPC, PTF), VA -Medicare/ Medicaid merge, national Laboratory and Pharmacy 
extracts (DSS, PBM), Corporate Data Warehouse (Health Data Repository), Medical Domain Web Services (MDWS), Patient Care Services Clinical Data Warehouse, Surgical Care Improvement Project 
(SQIP), Surgical Q uality Workflow Manager (SQWM), VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), 
Veteran Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), VHA Support Service Center (VSSC), VA 
Surgery Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP), and the VA Vital Status File. Additionally, IT and Informatics initiatives to build the tools that will allow electronic medical record data extraction are 
being developed and will be used to obtain VISTA -level data to enhance the breadth of information and 
disease characterization that is lacking in the current national databases. This data will be 
downloaded/transferred with the appropriate permissions for use of these VA national databases, or 
individual VA Medical Centers, to the VA Central Research Database.  
 
E. Data Sharing Plan 
 
 After the main results of this study have been published, de -identified data from this 
study may be shared with other VA investigators, other Federal health agencies, or academic institutions for the purpose of additional analyses provided this use has been appr oved by the appropriate VA 
oversight committee and there is an agreement in place that defines the limits of this use.

XIII. Feasibility of the study within the VA System  
 
As seen in the sample size section, approximately 1, 150 subject s will be required for this study. 
It is believed by the Planning Committee that 16 participating centers recruiting over a 3 year period 
could enroll this number of subject s. Each center would be required to recruit a minimum of 72 subject s 
over the three  year recruitme nt period. This amounts to  24 subject s per year or two  per month. This 
level of two  subject s per month is what the Planning Committee decided was reasonable to expect for 
the sites. We have successfully identified 16 high CABG volume (>100 C ABG/year) cardiac surgery 
centers in the VHA with prior experience in CSP studies and experience in EVH /OVH procedures who are  
willing to join our study. In addition, at least five  centers can be available to replace any center that 
would not be able to participate.  
 
 From October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009 (Fiscal Year 2009) 3,952 CABG -only procedures 
were performed in 40 cardiac surgery centers in the VHA. The average number of  CABG -only procedures 
per site was 99/year or 8/month. Based on the REGROUP Trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, a screening 
log was maintained for a six month period (June to December 2011) at the Cardiac Surgery Program at 
the West Roxbury, Massachusetts VAMC: an average of 4 CABG subject s/month were found to be 
eligible for inclusion in the study or 50% of CABG procedures. Recent CSP CABG studies, such as CSP 
#474 (Radial) and CSP #517 (ROOBY), successfully randomized an average of 2 subject s per center p er 
month while enrolling only isolated CABG subject s and excluding subject s with unsuitable coronary 
targets.  We conclude that it is reasonable to assume that each of the 16 sites participating in CSP 588 will enroll two  subject s/month. All 16 selected si tes have performed at least 100 CABG/year for two 
consecutive years, contributing to an average of 1600 CABG/ year in the 16 sites. To recruit the 3 84 
subject s per year required for our study, 23% of this average number of CABG procedures will need to 
be en tered into the study. Assuming conservatively that for the individual centers, the percentage of 
eligible subject s to recruit will be approximately 30 -35% of all CABG procedures. Based on the limited 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the sample size goal is pe rceived by the Planning Committee to be 
achievable.  
 XIV. Requirements for Participating Centers  
 
All participating centers must be able and willing to adhere to  the study protocol. The minimum 
requirements for participating medical centers include:  
 
• Site Principal Investigator: Each center must identify their site ’s principal surgeon investigator 
who enthusiastically supports the study and is willing to devote sufficient time and energy to ensure that the study ’s goals are met. For VA medical centers, the site surgeon investigator 
must  have at least  a 5/8
ths VA appointment for receiving VA research funds.  
 
• EVH/OVH Harvester :  Each center /study surgeon investigator  must identify their site’s 
harvester(s).  The harvester(s) must have performed  a minimum of 100 EVH procedures with a 
conversion rate to OVH < 5% to qualify for participation in the REGROUP trial.  Each harvester 
must also demonstrate competency in OVH or the study surgeon investigator directly attending the case must perform the OVH  in the same manner as provided during the course of usual care

absent a clinical trial.   A subcommittee of the Executive Committee will convene and review 
each site’s harvester qualifications and issue guidance/recommendations for sites as needed.  
 
• Enrollment  Volume : Each center must provide documentation that it will be able to recruit 2 4 
subject s receiving a CABG- only procedure per year into the study who  meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. This total will be 7 2 subject s receiving CABG- only proc edures over 
the three -year recruitment period.  
 
• Administrative  Support : Each center must provide assurance by the Chief of Surgery Service 
and/or the Chief of Staff that their site investigator will receive full administrative support.  
 
• Multiple  Participating  Surgeons : At each center, there should be at least one (and preferably 
two or more) cardio thoracic surgery attending faculty team members participating that agree to 
randomize and operate on all consenting, eligible subject s with a planned CA BG-only on-pump 
procedure using a median sternotomy incision.  Although participating surgeons may 
enter/leave the study (after approval by the Chairman ’s office and Perry Point CSP Coordinating 
Center), the center must make every effort to recruit and to retain at least one qualified 
participating surgeon to enroll subject s in this study.  
 
• Local  Approvals  and Reporting Required : Acceptance and approval of the protocol and the 
informed consent document with only minor changes by the site investigator, the local VA medical center ’s R&D Committee, and the local IRB. Copies of the meeting minutes indicating 
approval by the local R&D Committee must be submitted to the Perry Point CSP Coordinating 
Center prior to enrolling subject s at the local center.  
 
• Global Monitoring  and Reporting Responsibilities  Delegated : By agreeing to participate in the 
study, centers delegate responsibility for global monitoring of the ongoing study to the Data Monitoring Committee, the Cooperative Studies  Scientific Evaluation Committe e (CS SEC), the 
Institutional Review Board, and the Perry Point CSP Coordinating Center. However, the local 
Research and Development Committee and the local I RB of the center will require the site 
investigator to submit annual reports concerning the status of the study for local monitoring 
purposes.  
 
• Research  Study  Coordinator:  The site investigator must make every effort to recruit and retain 
an enthusiastic research study coordinator, preferably one experienced in clinical trials, who will work diligently  with the site investigator to meet the study ’s goals.  Moreover, this local study 
coordinator  must work collaboratively with the Chair man’s  office staff, including the National 
Nurse Coordinator.

XV. Study Organization Administration and Monitoring  
 
A. Monitoring Bodies  
 
 The groups charged with monitoring the various aspects of the study will be the Executive 
Committee, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), and the local site IRBs.  These committees will meet 
at regular intervals according to the current  Cooperative Studies Program guidelines:  prior to the 
beginning of subject  enrollment  and at least every twelve months thereafter.  In addition, the CSP Site 
Monitoring, Auditing and Review Team (SMART), located at the CSP Clinical Research Pharmacy Coord inating Center (CSPCRP CC), will monitor the trial for GCP compliance.  
  
 The Executive Committee is the management and decision -making body for the operational 
aspects of the study and will monitor the performance of participating medical centers and the quality 
of data collected.  The Executive Committee will formulate publication plans and will ove rsee the 
publication and presentation of all data from the study.  The Committee must grant permission before 
any study data may be used for presentation or publication.  
 
 The Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC) will review the progress of the study and will 
monitor subject  intake, outcomes, serious adverse events, and other issues related to subject  safety.  
The DMC makes recommendations to the Director of the Clinical Science Research and Development 
(CSRD) Service about whether the study should continue or b e stopped.  The DMC will consist of experts 
in the fields of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting, Cardio thoracic Surgery, Cardiology, clinical trials, 
biostatistics, and ethics.  These experts will not be participants in the trial and will not have participated 
in the planning of the protocol.  The DMC will consider safety or other circumstances as grounds for 
early termination, including either compelling internal or external evidence of treatment differences or 
the unfeasibility of addressing the study hypothesis (e.g., poor subject  enrollment , poor adherence to 
protocol).  
 
 At each of its meetings during the study period, the DMC will review the randomization 
rates and assess the difference between the actual and the projected rates, as well as the impact of 
these assessments on overall trial size.  An assessment of whether the trial should be continued will be 
made followed by recommendations, as appropriate.  All serious adverse events will be reported on a regular basis to the DMC for their review.  Unexpected s erious adverse events may be reported to the 
DMC in an expedited manner based upon the consensus of the Study Chairman, the Study Biostatistician, and the Perry Point CSPCC Director.  The Study Biostatistician will provide the 
appropriate data to the DMC at specified intervals for this purpose.  
 
 The Clinical Events  Committee (CEC) will consist of one cardiologist and two cardiac 
surgeons who will meet semi -annually (either in person or via conference calls).  This committee will 
systematically evaluate all study deaths for cardiac versus non -cardiac causes.  The national nurse 
coordinator will prepare a Clinical Events  packet for each subject  death which will consist of notes, labs, 
tests from the subject ’s medical record and death certificates or autopsy reports when available.   In 
addition, this committee will evaluate and confirm all reported myocardial infarctions (MI) using the 
published AHA/ACC/ECS Universal criteria  (Thygesen 2007) .  This may be accomplished using notes, labs 
and diagnostic tests from the subject ’s medical record.  To assure compliance with data security

procedures, all necessary documentation will be “scrubbed” to remov e subject  identifiers and any 
reference to treatment arm received.  
 
 The local site s IRB will be the study’s primary IRB and the IRB of record for the study.  It will 
be responsible for the initial and continuing IRB reviews of the study.  The local site I RB must review and 
approve amendments (changes to inclusion/exclusion criteria, protocols, informed consents, etc .), 
deviations, and review reports about serious  adverse events and problems, complaints, terminations, 
etc. and that the investigators must p rovide the local site IRB  all supporting documentation.  The CSPCC 
will be responsible for providing the local site IRB with all materials that are required for each review 
and to respond to local IRB ’s queries and requests for additional materials.  The l ocal site IRB approves 
the original informed consent template and any requested changes to the informed consent forms.  
 
 The Human Rights Committee (HRC) at the Coordinating Center will review the study prior 
to its initiation to the local site IRB  to ensure proper protection of the subject s’ rights and safety.  The 
CSPCC HRC will also conduct at least one site visit during the study to interview study subject s to assess 
whether subject  rights are being fully protected.  
 
 CSP SMART  will provide GCP training at the kick -off meeting and will conduct initiation visits 
at all sites.  It also will conduct a GCP site review and a for cause audit of a participating site if requested 
by any of the monitoring bodies.  At a minimum, each site will be visited at least once during the study by SMART.  The local site IRB will receive a copy of all SMART monitoring reports.  
 
 The Quality Assurance Section  at the Perry Point CSPCC will provide central monitoring of 
study sites to ensure compliance with Good Clinical  Practice.  Monitoring may include but is not limited 
to the informed consent process, data validation, source verification, and safety reporting.  Additional 
site-specific monitoring may be conducted if triggered by poor study performance.  Site performan ce 
findings may result in on -site visits by the CSPCC QA Nurse Specialist or other CSPCC central monitoring 
personnel to evaluate the need for additional site training to remedy compliance concerns.  
 
 The Study Group , which consists of all site investigato rs, participating harvesters,  and 
research coordinators, will meet annually to discuss the progress of the study and any problems 
encountered during the conduct of the trial.  
 
B. Monitoring Subject  Safety  
 
 The Perry Point CSPCC and CSPCRPCC will provide summ aries of all serious adverse events 
reported to the Study Chairman and DMC at least twice a year.  
 C. Monitoring Subject  Intake and Probation or Termination of Participating Sites  
 
 The Study Chairman and the Study Biostatistician will monitor the intake rate and 
operational aspects of the study.  Participating medical centers will continue in the study only if adequate subject  intake is maintained.  The Executive Committee may take a ction leading to the 
discontinuation of subject  enrollment at a center with the concurrence of the CSPCC Director.  If 
recruitment is not proceeding at an appropriate rate, the Study Chairman and Study Biostatistician will 
 
CSP #588  
RANDOMIZED ENDO -VEIN GRAFT PROSPECTIVE – REGROUP TRIAL   
Version 1.2 Protocol  
October 1, 2013             
28 
 
 
scrutinize the reasons for inadeq uate subject  participation.  Based on this information, the Executive 
Committee may choose to drop centers or add additional centers.  The DMC and Director of CSRD will 
be notified regarding the dropping or adding of centers.  Participating sites that do n ot enroll at least 24  
subject s during the first 12 months of the study will be placed on probation and given an opportunity to 
improve within a reasonable period.  After the first 12 months, participating sites that do not reach 75% 
of enrollment target du ring any six -month evaluation time will be placed on probation and given an 
opportunity to improve within a reasonable period.  If a medical center is placed on probation, the Study Chairman will confer with the site personnel and visit the site, if necess ary, to help improve the rate of 
recruitment.  If there is no improvement in accrual during the probation period, the site may be subject to reduced funding or possible termination as a study site.  To plan for the possible termination of a site(s) and the  addition of a new site(s), back up sites with IRB approval will be identified prior to study 
initiation to minimize the delay in adding a new site.  The Executive Committee will only take actions leading to discontinuation of a center with the concurrence  of the CSPCC Director.  If a center is 
terminated from the trial, resources will be reallocated to other centers or used to start up a backup site.  
 D. Alternate Plan if Recruitment Goals are not Met  
 
 After the study has been in the recruitment phase for three months, the Study Chairman  
and the National Nurse Coordinator will contact the local site investigators and research coordinators to identify any common obstacles to subject  recruitment and identify steps that might be taken to reduce 
those obstacles .  If recruitment has fallen short of anticipated goals by month six due to low CABG 
volume at the participating centers, the Study Chairman  will make a proposal to the Executive 
Committee to alter the inclusion criteria from  CABG only on -pump procedures to additionally include 
on-pump CABG plus valve procedures.  
 
 E. Monitoring Medical Center Performance  
 
 Each participating site will be monitored for data quality, completeness of follow -up and 
adherence to the protocol.  Regula rly scheduled conference calls (at least monthly) with the sites, CSPCC 
and Chairman’s office will be held to address data collection, protocol procedures and other issues.  Strict adherence to the protocol will be expected of every participating center an d will be monitored by 
the DMC, the Executive Committee, and the CSPCC.  Documentation of protocol noncompliance will be 
required and any medical center with repeated protocol noncompliance  issues will be recommended to 
the Executive Committee for termination.  If a participating site investigator feels that adherence to the protocol will in any way be detrimental to a particular subject’s health or well- being, the interest of the 
subject  will take precedence over continued study participation .  In addition, CSPCC, the Executive 
Committee and the DMC will monitor protocol adherence centrally.  The Executive Committee will consider recommending a full GCP audit to be conducted by SMART for any site with repeated protocol noncompliance  issues and will consider terminating the site from the trial.  
 
 Data quality and completeness of data retrieval will be closely monitored on an ongoing 
basis by the Coordinating center.  The study biostatistician will present interim monitoring reports to the Execut ive Committee and the DMC that will include the following types of information:  
 
CSP #588

• Subject  intake  
• Randomization  
• Breaches of protocol  
• Adherence and compliance of study protocol  
• Missed study visits  
• Completeness of follow -up 
• Audit and site visit results  
 
 If a site is identified as an outlier in terms of data quality, a site conference call or site visit 
will be initiated to assess the reasons why problems are occurring and how they can be corrected.  If the 
problems continue, the site may be placed on probation  or terminated from the study.  
 
F. Monitoring of safety, efficacy and futility  
 
 As previously noted, the DMC will review the accumulating data and be responsible for 
determining whether or not to recommend that the trial be stopped for efficacy, futility or safety.  Data 
summaries will be prepared for the DMC for these purposes.  Frequent summaries of serious adverse 
events will be prepared for the DMC for monitoring of safety, i.e., at least twice a year.  To aid the DMC in their deliberations, other relevan t information specific to CSP# 588  will be made available.  Complete 
details of the interim monitoring plans for the study are given in Section X VII Biostatistical 
Considerations below.  
 
XVI. Good Clinical Practices  
 
A. Role of GCP  
  
 This trial will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  The 
intent of these regulations is to safeguard subjects’ welfare and assure the validity of data resulting from the clinical research. The VA Cooperative Studies Program will assist Local Site Investigators (LSIs) in 
complying with GCP requirements through its Site Monitoring, Auditing and Resource Team (SMART) 
based in Albuquerque, NM.  SMART serves as the Quality Assurance arm of CSP for GCP compliance.  Study site  personnel will receive GCP training at the study organizational meeting.  SMART will provide 
training, manuals and materials to assist study personnel in organizing study files and will be available throughout the trial to advise and assist LSIs regarding  GCP issues.  
 
B. Summary of Monitoring and Auditing Plans  
 a. Monitoring Visits  
(1)  Initiation visits at each site soon after study start -up 
(2) Additional monitoring visits may be conducted as deemed necessary by study leadership or SMART.  
 
b. Audits   
(1) Routine audits – independent site visits to one or more sites per year as determined 
by SMART.

(2) For-Cause audits – independent audit of a site as requested by study leadership or 
CSP Central Office.   
(3) Audits may be scheduled or unannounced.  
 
XVII. Biostatis tical Considerations  
 
A. Expected Treatment Effects  
 
 In the ROOBY study (CSP # 517) (Shroyer 2009), o ne year MACE rates were 9.9% in the OVH 
group and 15.3% in the EVH group  (p=0.0025). The executive committee for the REGROUP study 
assumes that during the REGROUP study, 15.5% of the subject s in the EVH group will experience MACE  
in the first  year post surgery. The committee also  expects a 6 percentage point improvement in the  one-
year MACE rate  in the OVH  group .  
 B. Sample size calcul ation for the REGROUP study  
  To detect the expected 6  percentage point difference in   one -year MACE rates between 
EVH (15.5%) and OVH (9.5%) , a sample size of 545  in each group will be required at 85 % power, 5% 
type -I error rate and with a two -sided test. A sensitivity analysis was also done with various scenarios 
which are shown in the Table 3. Since, it would be possible to capture the majority of the MACE  from 
the VA databases even  if the subject s drop out before the one -year clinic visit, a relatively small inflation 
factor of 5% is used to inflate the sample size to account for the drop -outs. Approximately, 1150 
subject s need to be randomized  in the study to achieve the said power.

Table 3: Various sample size scenarios for the REGROUP study  
 
Based on the one -year MACE rate difference between EVH and OVH groups as obtained from CSP 517, if 
we assume at the end of the active follow- up period (approximately 4.5 years from the beginning of the 
recruitment process) difference in survival rates (i.e ., the proportion of subject s who will not experience

MACE) between the two harvesting groups will be approximately 8 percentage point (i.e., 83 .5% in the 
EVH and 91.5% in OVH), a sample size of 532 per group will be required to achieve a power of 97.5%. S o, 
the sample size of 1150 (with approximately 7 % attrition  rate accounted for) will provide adequate 
power to the time- to-MACE event primary outcome.   
 
C. Duration of Study/Number of Participating Sites  
 
 Based on the experience of previous CSP studies on CABG performed in the last decade 
(2000- 2010) (e.g. CSP #517 ROOBY and CSP #474 RADIAL) , a two subject /month/site enrollment rate 
was assumed to be a reasonable enrollment rate  for this study. With this assumption, various scenarios 
were created to find an  optimum balance between the number of sites, the study duration (which 
includes enrollment period and follow -up period) and the estimated budget. The chosen scenario was 
with 16 sites around the country where both EVH and OVH are currently practiced. With  16 sites and 
two subjects/month/site rate of enrollment, the enrollment period was found to be approximately, 
three years which would be followed by a minimum of one-year follow -up for the last subject  
randomized  into the study . This will allow approximat ely 4 – 4.5 years of active follow -up of all 
randomized subject s followed by additional 2 years of passive follow -up using the VA databases.  The 
total duration for the 16 participating sites will be approximately 6.5 years.  
 
D.  Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
1. Intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis  
 
  Intent -to-treat population is defined as the population of subject s who will be 
randomized to either of the harvesting technique group s – EVH or OVH. The subject s will be categorized 
(in terms of their harvesting technique  group assignment) based on their initial randomized group 
irrespective of conversion before surgery and will be included in analyses irrespective of their status –  
completer or drop out of the study before completion. Analyses of all outcome measures –  primary and 
secondary – will use ITT population.  
 
  All statistical tests will be 2 -sided and the primary MACE outcome will be tested at  5% 
level of significance. SAS will be used to conduct all the statistical analyses.  
     
2. Primary Outcome Measure  
 
 MACE, the composite endpoint that includes Death (all cause), Myocardial Infarction 
(MI) and Revascularization for myocardial ischemia, will be the primary outcome measure after randomization and the index CABG. Each randomized subject  (either in Endoscopic or in Open 
harvesting group) will be followed after the index CABG to capture the time -to-MACE event where an 
‘EVENT’ will be defined as either death (all cause) or an MI or a revascularization procedure during the 
follow -up period. Total fol low-up period will be 6.5 years of which the first 4.5 years will be active 
follow -up (using in -clinic visit or by telephone) period and will be carried out by the site personnel. The 
remaining 2 years will be passive follow -up which will be carried out ce ntrally by the chair’s office staff 
using the VA patient database. A minimum of 1 year of active follow -up will be used for subject s who 
will be randomized  at the tail end of the 3 -year projected enrollment period of the study. The subject s

32 
 
 
who will either be lost to follow -up or will not experience an ‘EVENT’ before the end of the follow -up 
period will be considered as right censored.  
The primary analysis of such time -to-Mace event data will include the events  only from the 
active follow -up period (which is 4.5 years). The secondary analysis will include events  from the entire 
6.5 years of follow -up period.  
Survival analysis techniques will be used to analyze the time -to-MACE event data for both 
primary and secondary analyses.  
Kaplan -Meier  analysis, a nonparametric method, will be used to estimate the survival (not 
experiencing MACE) over time in the two harvesting groups and a log -rank statistic will be used to test 
the equality of the survival function estimates in the two groups (the nul l hypothesis).   
Cox’s Proportional Hazards models will be used to investigate the effect of harvesting technique on the 
time until MACE adjusted for other potential influential variables, such as, age, gender, harvester’s experience etc.    
 
3. Secondary O utcomes  Measures  
 One and Three -year MACE : This composite endpoint consist s of  
i. Death (all cause) ; 
ii. Myocardial Infarction and  
iii. Revascularization  for myocardial ischemia.  
Subject s who suffer any one of these three outcomes within the first  year or in the first three 
years after the index CABG  will be counted towards calculating the proportions of subject s with MACE 
(yes/no) in each harvesting technique group –  subject s with endoscopic vein grafting or subject s with 
open vein grafting. Only the first event will be considered as the MACE event. These two proportions will 
be compared using a chi -square test.   
 
Post-operative Leg Wound Complication s: All subject s in both  harvesting technique group s – EVH or 
OVH – will be examined for complications of the leg wound  from harvesting at discharge and at six  
weeks post -surgery. Po st-operative leg wound complication  status (yes/no) will be recorded a t discharge 
and at six  weeks post -surgery. Proportion of subject s with leg wound complications  will be compute d for 
each treatment group and these proportions at each time point will be compared using chi -square tests. 
The impact of confounding variables, such as, BMI, diabetes status, smoking status, on the post -
operative leg wound infection will be analyzed usin g a logistic regression.   
 
Severity of Incisional Leg Pain : Severe leg pain , due to incisions made during vein grafting , data will be 
collected  at discharge and a t six-week post  CABG . Proportion of subject s with severe pain (pain score 3 
and above  = yes) at each time point will be compared using chi- square statistics.  
 
Quality of Life : QoL scores using VR-12 and Seattle Angina Questionnaire will be computed at baseline,  
six week, and 12 months  post -surgery  for the subject s in the two harvesting technique groups (EVH a nd 
OVH). Subject s in both groups will be categorized as “improved”, “no change” and “worse” based on 
their baseline scores. The proportion  of subject s in these three categories will be compared between the 
two groups using chi -square  statistics. The actual scores from these measures will also be used to 
compare subject s in the two harvesting technique groups using analyses of covariance techniques, 
where the baseline (pre- surgery) scores will be used as a covariate.

E.  Interim Monitor ing 
 
  An independent oversight committee, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) , will be 
monitoring study progress at predetermined time points over the entire duration of the study. The committee will receive analyses of the primary outcome measures and the important secondary outcome measures on a routine basis. In general, this committee meets at six to nine  months after the 
start of subject  recruitment and yearly thereafter. So, in total, this committee will meet maximum four  
times during the four  years of the study duration. The committee will receive reports about three  weeks 
prior to their annual meetings and at six monthly intervals in between the annual meetings. Since the primary outcome measure ( MACE ) are times -to-MACE event, sufficient data for DMC’s first review will 
not be available until the study has been ongoing for at least 2 years . So there will be approximately 8  
interim analyses of the primary outcome measure based on which the DMC will decide on study’s 
continuation.   
 
F. Criteria for Study Termination 
  When repeated significance tests are performed on accumulating data as part of a routine 
monitoring function, the overall type -I error rate is inflated and the probability of a false positive finding 
is also increased. A number of methods have been develop ed to provide guidance on study termination 
rules based on multiple looks on the primary outcome measures for the review committees while 
keeping the overall type- I error rate maintained at 5%. For example, Haybittle -Peto or Lan -DeMets 
group sequential bou ndaries will provide study stopping guidance/criteria for the DMCs to implement. 
An example of typical Lan -DeMetes boundary for six looks is illustrated in Figure 2. The DMC will make 
the final decision on the type of stopping rule that will be used for th e REGROUP trial.

G. Handling of Mis sing Data  
  Every effort will be made  to minimize the occurrence of missing data, particularly for the 
primary and main secondary outcome measures. For the primary outcome ( MACE ), every effort will be 
made to contact the subject s over the phone every three months until subject termination.  In the event 
of a potential drop out, every effort will be made to capture the MACE data from the VA databases.  
       
H. Reporting of Any Deviations from the Original Statistical Plan  
  A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be generated which will include the details 
of each statistical analysis plan for each outcome measure along with the suggested table shells for any reports that will be produced during the study and at the end of the study. Any deviations in the 
statistical plan from the protocol will be specified in the SAP. Any deviations from the SAP will be specified in the main manuscript which will be prepared and published at the end of the study.   
 
XVIII. PUBLICA TIONS  
 
A. Publication Policy  
 
 It is the policy of the Cooperative Studies Program not to reveal outcome data to site 
investigators until the data collection phase of the study is complete.  This policy is meant to prevent 
possible biases that might affect data collection.  Members of the DMC will be reviewing outcome 
results to ensure that the study will be terminated early if a treatment is identified as prohibitively 
dangerous or if a definitive answer is reached prior to the scheduled study termination d ate. 
 
 All presentations and publications resulting from this study will follow CSP policy as specified 
by the CSP guidelines.  The presentation or publication of any or all data collected by site investigators 
on subject s entered into a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study is under the direct control 
of the study’s Executive Committee.  No individual site investigator has the right to use the study’s data to perform analyses or interpretations, or to make public presentations or seek publicatio n of any or all 
of the data without specific approval of the Executive Committee.  
 
 The Executive Committee has the authority to establish any number of publication 
committees, which usually will comprise of subgroups of site investigators and some members  of the 
Executive Committee, for the purpose of producing manuscripts for presentation and publication.  Any 
presentation or publication related to this study should be circulated to the Executive Committee for 
review, comments and suggestions at least fou r weeks prior to submission of the manuscript to the 
presenting or publishing body.

 All publications must give proper recognition to the funding source and should list all study 
participating site personnel  (not necessarily as authors of the manuscript) .  If an investigator’s major 
salary support and/or commitment is from the VA, it is obligatory that the investigator lists the VA as 
his/her primary institutional affiliation.  Submission of manuscripts or abstracts must follow the usual VA 
policy; ideall y, a subtitle states, “A Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study.”  The CSP also 
requires that every manuscript be reviewed and approved by the CSPCC Director prior to submission as a final quality control step.  Mechanisms for appeal by an  invest igator will follow procedures defined by 
the VA Office of Research and Development.  
 
 Participation in a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies  Program clinical trial is 
voluntary.  Any investigator who cannot accept these operational guidelines regarding publication policy should not volunteer to participate in the study.  
 
B. Planned Publications  
 
 Primary publication:   Upon completion of the study, a manuscript will be prepared that 
focuses on the primary outcome, i.e. endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting vs. open saphenous vein harvesting MACE rates during the follow -up period . 
 
 Other publications:   Other planned pub lications will include at least the following:   Quality of 
Life with EVH and OVH , leg wound complications , 1 and 3 year MACE .

INTRODUCTION 
You are being invited to take part in a research study that is being funded by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA).  Before you decide to take part, you should know why the research is being done and how it will be performed .  There may be potential risks and benefits if you decide to 
participate.      
 Please read this  information closely .  If you wish, discuss this study  with family and friends.   If there 
is anything that if you would like  to understand better, ask to speak to someone from the study.  Take 
your time in deciding if you want to participate .  If you do decide to take part, we will ask you to sign 
the last page of this consent form .  This means tha t you received all of the information below, were 
able to ask questions and discuss concerns with a member of the study team , and would like to take 
part in the study .   
 
1. Purpose of study:   
You are being invited to take part in this research study because it has you need to have coronary 
artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery .  As part of this procedure , you will have a piece of vein removed 
from one of your legs.  This is called vein harvesting.  This research study will compare  two methods 
of vein harvesting.  Both methods are commonly used and considered safe but it is not known if one method is better than the other.  We hope this study will allow us to learn if one method of vein harvesting improves the results of CABG surgery mor e than the other method.    
 One method is called “open vein harvesting” (OVH) .  In this technique, one or more incisions are 
made along the thigh and calf  to remove a  vein called the saphenous vein.  The incisions may vary in 
length.  With the OVH techniq ue, the surgical team can avoid handling the  vein  more than necessary in 
removing it from the leg .  After the vein is removed, the incision are  sutured closed.  The leg is 
wrapped in a large bandage that will be removed one or two days after the operation.  A scar will be visible after the leg heals.

The other  method of  removing the vein is called “endoscopic vein harvesting”  (EVH).  This method of 
removing the vein is newer but has been used for over 10 years.  In this technique, a small incision is 
made either above or below the knee.  A small  video camera, called an endoscope, is inserted into the 
incision.  S pecial instruments are then used to remove the vein through this  small incision .  One or two  
smaller incisions are made either in  groin or calf t o help remove the vein.  The leg is also wrapped in a 
large bandage that will be removed one or two days after surgery.  Th e scar that is left by this surgery 
is smaller.  In some cases, the incision heals more quickly and is less painful.  Some studies ha ve 
suggested that there are fewer wound problems when this method is used to harvest the vein.  
 
Because the EVH technique appears to allow the leg to heal faster and causes fewer scars, this is now 
the more common method of harvesting the vein.  However, surgeons have recently questioned if the EVH technique may injure the vein and cause it not to work as well over  time.  E xample s of how this 
might happen include the heat from the endoscope or pressure from the instruments  used during the 
procedure.   
 At the present time, it is not known if the EVH technique causes injury to the vein.  If EVH actually does injure  the vein, it is possible injury  that OVH  will be a better method of vein harvest.  If OVH is a 
more gentle  meth od of harvesting the vein, it may allow the vein to deliver more blood and oxygen to 
the heart  which may be better for the long -term results of the CABG surgery.  
 If you agree to participate in this research study you will allow the method of vein harvesting for your 
surgery to be randomly chosen – such as deciding by using  the flip of a coin. You will have a 50/50, or 
an equal chance of receiving either the open or  endoscopic method of vein harvesting.  To participate  
in this study , both you and your surgeon must agree that the method of vein harvest  will be randomly 
picked on the day of surgery.  This is the only part of your surgery that will be randomly chosen.  
However, if you or your surgeon prefers  one technique  over the other  and would like to choose which 
technique you will have, you can not participate in the study.

There are n o experimental devices or drugs  that will be used in this research study.  The e ndoscopic 
devices used in vein harvesting are approved  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and have been 
in use for several years.  The ins truments will not be used in any experimental manner.   
 
This study will recruit approximately 1,150 research subjects from approximately 16 VA centers across the country.  This VA site is one of 16 VA centers selected .  Approximately 72 patients  will be 
enrolled over three years at this site . 
 
The study is funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs .  The Chief of  Cardiac Surgery at the VA 
Boston Healthcare System  is in charge of the overall study (Study Chair).  The VA sites will work with 
the VA Cooperative Studies Program at Perry Point, Maryland to collect and analyze data from this 
study .  The surgeon performing your CABG procedure  will oversee the vein harvest.  This surgeon is 
one of the surgeon i nvestigator s of this research study for  the hospital where you are having surgery.  
 2. Description of the study, procedures to be used, and how long it will last:  
This re search study is expected last approximately six years .  Your active participation in the project 
may be as long as three years or may be as short as one year depending on when you enter the study. The study team may also collect information a bout you through electronic medical records and 
national public databases for the duration of the study.  
 If you decide to take part in this study, this is what will happen:  
 
After signing this consent form , the surgeon investigator and study coordinator w ill review y our 
records to confirm you are eligible to take part in the study.  This is called screening.  As part of the screening, the coordinator will look at your medical record .  This includes , but is not limited to , your 
past medical history, the res ults of exams and tests including your heart  catheterization and the 
evaluation by your surgeons.

Before going to surgery you will be asked to complete two baseline quest ionnaires for research 
purposes.  This will take approximately 20  to 30 minutes.  These questionnaires will ask you about  
your activity level s and how you feel  both physically and emotionally.  You will be asked to report 
about your personal feelings.  You may skip any  of the  questions that you do not wish to answer.  
 
You wil l also have blood pressure measurements of both arms and legs while lying on a table .  This is 
called an  Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI) test . This test checks the general condition of your arteries by 
measuring the difference in blood pressure from your arms  compared to your  legs. This test will show  
if there is decreased blood flow to your legs that may cause your leg incisions  to heal more slowly or 
have problems  after surgery. The quality of your leg veins  will also be measured with a scoring system 
called v enous clinical severity score in which we look at the quality of your veins.  These two  
assessment s will be performed at the same time and will take approximately 20 minutes to complete .  
These tests may be  routinely performed for patients  going to surgery  but we will also collect and report 
this data for research purposes .   
 On the day of your surgery in the operating room, and under the supervision of the surgeon investigator, you will be randomized (like  flipping a coin ) to have the vein removed using either the 
EVH or OVH procedure .  A member of the study team will call a phone number  to obtain the 
randomization assignment .  This will take  about 10 minutes  and will happen j ust before your surgery  
begins .  You may or may not already be asleep with anesthesia.   After you wake up, you will be able 
to see what type of vein harvest you received .  It is possible that both methods may have been used in 
harvesting your vein.  
 
Once the randomization assignment is k nown, your CABG surgery will proceed as usual.  You will 
continue to receive the same care that you would receive even if you were not participating in this 
research study  throughout your hospital stay.   
 
 The study team will collect information about you  from your medical records during and after surgery 
until you are discharged from the hospital.  On the first and second day after your surgery, you will

have an electrocardiogram -  also known as an EKG.  This test is routinely performed on CABG 
patients b ut the results will also be used for research purposes.  If the EKG indicates there is new 
damage to your heart, known as a myocardial infarction (MI), then approximately two tablespoons of 
your blood will be drawn to check cardiac biomarkers. This is beca use cardiac biomarker levels will 
become increased in the blood when there is new heart damage. This test will be repeated every eight hours only if the level is increasing.  Once it is determined the level is decreasing or remains in a normal range no fur ther levels will be drawn.   This blood test will help determine if you have had any 
new damage to your heart.   Cardiac biomarker tests are  frequently performed on CABG patients but 
the results will also be used for research purposes.     
 
When you are dis charge d from the hospital, you will be asked to complete a survey  that asks you about 
your leg incision s. When y ou return in 4- 6 weeks for a follow -up visit to the cardiac surgery clinic , you 
will be asked to complete  this survey again.  I f you had a problem with your leg incisions or any 
unex pected illnesses you will be asked to provide further information to the study team .  If you were 
treated at a non -VA facility, you may be asked to sign an authorization for release of information from 
the treating facility.  You will also be asked to complete the same two questionnaires that you completed before your operation.  Overall, your follow up visit should take approximately one hour.    
After  your CABG follow -up visit, the study coordinator will conta ct you by phone every three months  
and ask you questions about your health.  This call may be as short as five minutes or longer depending 
on how much has cha nged with your health status.  You m ay also be contacted at other time points to 
clarify any quest ions about your health status.  This  will continue for at least one year and possibly  
longer  depending on when you enter ed the study  and your overall health .  The study team will also 
collect information about your health from existing  medical records  and several different databases.  
These databases are listed on the following page, in the C onfidentiality section  of this consent form .   
 
3. Reasonably foreseeable discomforts or inconveniences of the study:

leg is commonly uncomfortable.  To minimize this mild discomfort, a  properly sized blood 
pressure cuff will be used. 
• You will have an electrocardiogram, or EKG, on the first and second day after your surgery.  
The pads used for the EKG may cause skin irritation  and be uncomfortable when they are 
pulled off the skin.  The technician is trained to remove the pads carefully . 
• You will have blood drawn for the study.  The amount taken will be about 1- 2 tablespoons .  
This blood work will be drawn  at the same time as your regular postoperative labs  from a 
catheter already in place from your CABG surgery so no additional needle stick is required.    
• You will be asked to complete questionnaires as a part of the study.  You may feel 
uncomfortable answering some of the questions asked on the survey.  Y ou may refuse to 
answer any quest ion that you do not want to answer.  
• You will be asked to return to this facility's cardiac surgery clinic for follow -up so your 
incisions can be examined.  This  is standard for CABG patients but  may be inconvenient if you 
live a far distance away from this  VA facility.  
 
 
4.  Reasonably foreseeable r isks of the study:  
This consent form only discusses the risks of the research  study .  The risks associated with the CABG 
surgery, vein harvesting and anesthesia are not discussed  in this consent form.  You should talk with 
your health care providers about risks of the operation.  Prior to surgery, the surgical  team will discuss 
the risks of CABG surgery with you in detail.  This will include a review of risks associated with  the 
two methods of vein graft harvesting.  An anesthesiologist will meet with you before surgery to discuss 
the risks of anesthesia, blood loss and blood transfusions.  If you are a female who could become 
pregnant, you wil l have a pregnancy test prior to recei ving surgery and anesthesia .  This is standard 
care.   If you are found to be pregnant, you will not be able to take part in this study.                                                                                                                                                   
 
Both vein harvesting techniques that are being studied are used commonly for CABG surgery .  For this 
reason, randomizing to one technique over the other does not increase the risk of the CABG surgery.

Guidance for the  Definition of Type 5 Myocardial Infarction  (MI related to CABG)  
 
 The CSP#588 Executive Committee has recognized the need to clarify a working definition  to be 
used in the REGROUP Trial for Myocardial Infarction (MI) .  
 The updated Third Universal Definition of MI published in 2012 was cited as a reference for the 
Executi ve Committee discussion  [Thygesen 2012] . 
 The purpose of this  clarification for the definition of MI is to capture every and all MI events 
during the conduct of the study while minimizing the volume of site reports that do not meet 
the definition of MI.  
 As a modification to the currently approved protocol, no  cardiac biomarkers (including troponin) 
will be routinely required as a study procedure at any time point (including baseline or postop).  
The case report forms will have indicators for these tests and corresponding reference ranges to 
be captured only if performed for clinical purposes and are available in the medical record of a 
consented subject for CSP#588.  
 Electrocardiograms ( 12 lead ECG) will continue to be required on post -op day#1 and #2 as state d 
in the currently approved protocol, however these are performed for clinical purposes at every 
site at these same time points (POD#1 and POD#2) regardless of the study protocol.  
 ECG abnormalities that indicate the need for cardiac biomarker workup inclu de new pathologic 
Q waves or new left bundle branch block . 
 In the event an ECG  abnormality as described above,  or clinical suspicion , causes concern for MI, 
cardiac biomarkers will be obtained. This is standard clinical practice. Cardiac Troponin I (cTn I) , 
cardiac Troponin T (cTn T) or CPK -MB will be obtained every 8 hours until a downward trend is 
seen in the level. The preferred cardiac biomarker is cTn I.  
 The troponin will be considered indicative of MI if the peak level > 10 x 99th percentile of the 
upper reference limit  (URL)  in the first 48 hours after CABG . The existing principles [Thygesen 
Circulation 2012] for the universal definion of MI should be applied for the definion of MI > 48 
hours after surgery.  
 The cardiac biomarker level does not stand alone in the diagnosis of MI for post -op CABG 
patients, it must be accompanied in the same setting with at least one of the following : 
o  12 lead ECG with new pathologic Q waves or new left bundle branch block, or  
o angiographic documented  new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or  
o imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion 
abnormalities.

Version 1.2 Protocol  
October 1, 2013            C-1 
 In the event cardiac biomarker work -up and ECG interpretations do not provide a complete 
diagnostic profile to the satisfaction of the surgeon investigator, a transthoracic echocardiogram 
would be the next clinical step to ascertain if a true MI occurred as evidenced by a new regional 
wall motion abnormality , with the exception of the  septal wall.  
 For the purp oses of this study, septal wall motion abnormalities (which are prevalent in the 
postoperative phase) are excluded from the Definition of MI.

Introduction: 
CSP #588 -  REGROUP is a randomized, intent -to-treat, two -arm, parallel design, multicenter study. 
Cardiac Surgery Programs at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) with expertise in performing both 
EVH and OVH will be invited to participate  in the study. Subjects requiring elective or urgent CABG using 
cardiopulmonary bypass with use of at least one SVG will be screened for enrollment using established 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of the two arms (EVH or OVH) 
after an experienced vein harvester is identified and assigned. Assessments will be collected at multiple 
time points including: intraoperatively, postoperatively, at discharge or 30 days after surgery if still 
hospitalized. Assessment of leg wound complications will be completed at the time of discharge and at 
six-week post- surgery. Telephone follow -ups will occur at three -month intervals post -surgery until the 
participating sites are decommissioned at the end of the trial period (which would be approximately 4.5 
years after the site initiations). For long -term MACE outcomes, passive follow up for MACE events using 
VA databases (CPRS, VASQIP) will be performed centrally by the Study Chair’s office for another 2 years.  
This study will enroll app roximately 1150 subjects requiring CABG at 16 VA Medical Centers with 
expertise in both techniques of vein harvesting. Assuming an enrollment rate of two subjects/medical center/month, total enrollment will take approximately three years to complete.  With  at least one- year 
follow -up period for the last subject randomized and two additional years of passive follow -up by the 
chair’s office, the total duration of the study will be approximately six and half years.   
 
Study Management at the CSPCC:  
A Cooperati ve Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSPCC) study team has been assigned to 
CSP 588, the REGROUP trial, for providing data management, statistical, and administrative supports to 
the study executive committee for a smooth conduct and timely completion o f the study. The study 
team is comprised of:

The Biostatistician  is the study team leader and has the overall respon sibility for the conduct of 
the study at the CSPCC. He is the CSPCC ’s spokes person  to the Study Group; he represents the CSPCC on 
the study ’s Executive Committee and  along with the Study Chairperson, he is responsible for 
representing the study at the Data  Monitoring Committee  meetings. When un-blinded data are 
presented to the DMC , he is the only study representative allowed at those portions of the DMC  
meeting. The Biostatistician is also responsible for providing the Study Group with statistical and clin ical 
trial advice, for working with other CSPCC team members in the preparation of routine interim reports, 
and for conducting the final analyses at the end of the study.  
The Project Manager  is responsible for the administrative coordination of the study b y the 
CSPCC. Sh e serves as the Biostatistician’s  Administrative Assistant and works with the CSPCC study team 
to ensure that all reports, study materials, and meeting arrangement notices are sent to the proper individuals in a timely fashion. She will work  closely with the Project Director in the Chairman ’s office to 
ensure that the study runs smoothly and will be in contact with both the National Study  Coordinator and 
the Local Research  Coordinators  at the participating centers at least monthly to discuss any problems 
that they may be having, including those with the CSPCC. She will also work with the local VA R&D 
Offices at the participating centers to obtain R&D and IRB approvals at the beginning of the study and 
annually as well as the preparation of stu dy budgets yearly during the ongoing phases of the study.  
The Statistical Programmer  is responsible for the preparation of the tables and analyses for all of 
the routine study reports. These include Study Group, Executive Committee, Data Monitoring 
Committ ee, and the mid -study report to C SSEC. S/he also prepares the tables and reports for the final 
analyses. S/he works closely with the Biostatistician on these analyses.  
The Data base Management System (DBMS) Programmer  is the lead of the data management 
support group and works closely with the assigned computer assistant(s) to address the data 
management need for the assigned study. S/he i s responsible for establishing, updating and maintaining 
the study ’s database. In addition, s /he will write edit  program based on an agreed upon edit plan  that 
will thoroughly check the data for errors and missing information. S /he is also responsible for 
program ming and maintaining  the r andomization system  for the study . 
The Computer Assistant (s) are responsible for setting  up the data definition table for the study, 
laying out the electronic case report forms  in the form design software , and validating all incoming data. 
They are also responsible for training the study staff at each site on how to properly manage the data 
collection process and how to appropriately respond to data edits. The computer assistant (s) are also 
responsible for work ing with the sites to resolve the  data  queries  generated based on the incomplete 
and/ or inaccurate data submitted to the study database .

Randomization and Data Management : 
  
Randomization and Data management will be performed by the VA CSPCC Perry Point, MD . An 
Interactive Touchtone Telephone Randomization System (ITTRS) will be used to set up the 
randomization system. Clinical DataFax  System , a data management software  will be used for data 
management .  The CSPCC will have overall responsibility for the data at the end of the study.  
Randomization  
 After a patient at any of the participating centers is consented , successfully screened  and has 
provided baseline information , s/he will be assigned to a harvester. Once a harvester is assigned and 
available for the harvesting of the required vein, the patient will be randomized. The research  
coordinator will place a call to the ITTRS (a dedic ated 1 -800 phone number will be provided)  to 
randomize the patient in one of the two harvesting techniques –  endoscopic and open vein harvesting 
techniques. Once the required information is entered in the system, the system will return the assignment for t he patient. This study will use a “ permuted  block” randomization scheme  where 
random block sizes of two and four  will be used . The research coordinator will need the following 
information in order to complete a successful randomization call:  
a. Study number a nd study password (will be provided by CSPCC))  
b. 3-digit site number and password (will be provided by CSPCC)  
c. The subject’s ID Number & ALPHA Code  
d. The subject’s signed Informed Consent Form

The draft versions  of the CRFs can be found in Appendix E . The paper CRFs will be mailed to the 
sites. The research personnel will be filling up these CRFs during CABG, the 6 -week clinic visit, and the 3 -
month phone calls. The completed CRFs will then be scanned in pdf and sent to Perry Point CSPCC via 
secure electronic server  or posted o n an ftp server. At CSPCC , the data management section staff will 
validate the CRFs once received by the DataFax system and will generate QC reports with listing of data 
discrepancies and other irregularities at regular intervals.  These QC reports will be sent to the respective 
sites for clarifications and the site personnel will then submit “Re faxes” with clarification which will be 
validated and committed to the study master database (A “Refax” is a page of a CRF with corrections

which is sent back to the CSPCC by agreed upon mode of CRF transmission). The final responsibility for 
the completen ess and accuracy of all study data collected at a participating sit e resides with the SI who 
will review  all data before submission.  The study database will be continuously updated with new data 
and changes to previously submitted data.  To notify the par ticipating sites about missing or late forms , 
reports with pertinent information will be generated at a regular interval and will be posted on site -
accessible sub -Share Point site .   
 In addition, a summary report of all data submitted and problems identifi ed will be generated 
for each participating site.  This report will provide each site with a summary of their progress.  The 
National Study Coordinator in the Chairman’s Office will also be reviewing each site’s progress to ensure 
that there are no unfores een problems with the forms or with a particular patient . 
 
Another mechanism used to monitor the data and the progress of the study will be the 
preparation of periodic reports for various groups who  are responsible for overseeing the conduct of the 
study.  These groups include the Study Group, the Executive Committee, the Data Monitoring 
Committee, and the CSPCC Human Rights Committee , if applicable .  These groups will receive study 
progress reports prior to their annual meetings and at least once in betwee n their annual meetings.  
Thus, on average, these groups will receive a report every six months.  The contents of these reports are discussed in the remainder of this appendix.  
 
Monitoring Of Study By Study Group and Executive Committee:  
 
 The Study Group (all of the S is, harvesters and research coordinators ) and Executive Committee 
will meet six to nine  months after patient recruitment begins and at annual intervals thereafter until the 
end of the study.  Three weeks prior to these meetings and at six -mont h intervals between the 
meetings, these groups will be provided a report that will allow them to assess study progress.  Since 
both groups are composed of study team members , no outcome data with harvesting group assignment 
(data that would potentially bre ak the study blind) will be provided in these reports.  The se reports will 
contain information on: 
 
a. Screening, Enrollment and Retention  
 
 The study team at each site will identify patients who might be candidates for the study.   After 
the study has been e xplained to the patient and the patient signs the informed consent form, the 
screening process will be initiated.  The research  coordinator will complete the screening form s using 
the paper CRF s provided by the CSPCC Perry Point .  If the patient meets all eligibility criteria, the 
baseline form s will be completed.  The patient can then be randomized by completing  the 
randomization form  and placing a call to the ITTRS system (as described before)  which will return  the 
patient ’s harvesting group assignment – EVH or OVH .

The progress of patient accrual will be presented to the monitoring groups in three formats:  
 
1. The study progress will be  presented  by site and for each site the following information will 
be provided : 
• actual number of patients entered into the study  
• expected number of patients to be entered at the time o f the report , and   
• the percent of expected that were entered  
 
This format, as demonstrated in Table 1 , will allow the Executive Committee to 
determine which sites are not recruiting as expected and the SIs to see how their site is 
doing in comparison with the others.   
2. The study progress will be  presented by the number of patients entered into the study by 
month  (Table 2) .  These data will be organized by site.  The data will indicate if recru itment 
is improving or worsening over time at the various sites.  Sites wh ose intake is worsening 
can be detected and the SI s can be contacted to identify the reason for the recruitment 
deficit.  
3. Recruitment  data will be plotted over time as shown in Figur e 1.  The graph will be 
overlayed with  the number of expected to be enrolled at the same time period .

b. Background Characteristics at Entry  
 
 Background characteristics of the screened/ enrolled study patients are collected on the 
Screening Record  Form.  Tables summarizing the important background characteristics by site will be 
prepared and submitted to the Study Group to provide  an idea of the population being studied  and 
based on this information, comparisons of the patient characteristics among the sites will be possible .  
This information will be presented as means and medians for continuous variables  (e.g., age)  and as 
frequency tables for discrete variables  (e.g., Gender) .  Table 5  shows how this data will be presented.  
Analysis of variance and chi- square techniques w ill be used to identify any statistically significant 
differences that may exist between the sites.

c. Data Quality and Protocol Adherence  
 
 The final type of information that will be provided to  the Study Group  is data that will allow the  
group  to assess the quality of the data being submitted and how well the sites, in general,  are adhering 
to the protocol.  These data will also be presented  by site, so sites performing substantially below 
average can be identified and remedial action can be taken to improve performance.  
 One piece of information that will be routinely provided is the number of forms that are missing 
according to the patient’s assessment schedule.  Table 6  indicates how this info rmation will be 
displayed.

Study Monitoring By Data Monitoring Committee:  
 
 An independent oversight committee called the Data  Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor 
study progress.  This committee meets on the same basic schedule as the Study Group and Executive 
Committee, i.e., at 6 to 9 months after the start of patient recruitment and yearly thereafter.  Initially, 
the DMC will meet once prior to the study start -up to acquaint themselves  with the study and to 
establish monitoring guidelines.  This committee does not usually meet during the last six months of a 
study.   
 
 The ma in responsibility for the DMC members is to make a recommendation to the Director of 
the Cooperative Studies Program on whether the study should continue or not  based on the reviews of 
the progress reports submitted to them .  The study could be recommended for termination due to poor 
recruitment, differe nce so large that it would be  possible to reach a final decision  about the main 
question of the study , difference so small that continuation would be irresponsible , and due to safety 
concerns of the procedures that are being investigated .  The DMC also rev iews the participating sites’ 
performance in terms of recruitment, adherence to the protocol etc., and makes recommendations on 
them.  Their final responsibility is to review all proposed protocol changes and suggested sub-protocols 
and to make recommendat ions in regards to their acceptability.  
  In order for the DMC to carry out its responsibilities, the CSPCC Study Team will provide the 
committee with a report approximately three weeks prior to their meetings.  The report will consist of 
the tables descri bed previously for the Study Group and Executive Committee reports as well as those 
presenting outcome analyses.  It is the responsibility of the CSPCC Study Team to provide the DMC with 
whatever information the Board feels that it needs to successfully mo nitor the study.  Thus, additional 
tables will be added as required  by the DMC .  In addition to the reports for the yearly meetings, the 
DMC will also be provided with reports between meetings at 6 -month intervals.  
 
 In order for the DMC to make its recomm endation for continuation of the study, it will be 
necessary for them to see the analyses for the primary outcome measure every time that the report is 
run and it is possible to calculate the primary outcome measure. Periodic monitoring of interim results 
can significantly affect the probability of making an incorrect decision.  A number of formal techniques 
have been developed for interpreting interim results. At the organizational meeting, the D MC will select 
the technique that it wants to use to monitor the study. Suggested techniques are the Haybittle- Peto 
and Lan -DeMets group sequential boundaries. For the Haybittle -Peto method, a constant z -statistic is 
used as the monitoring boundary. The Lan -DeMets procedure produces decision boundaries that are  
quite conservative over the first several looks and then gradually converges to the nominal alpha levels 
as the final look is approached.  Figure 2  gives an example  of the Lan -DeMets boundaries for six looks at 
an alpha level of 0.05.

 The patient characteristics would be presented by site and by harvesting technique group for 
the DMC.  Significant imbalances  of these patient characteristics between the harvesting technique  
groups may indicate a need to use these  characteristics as covariates during the analysis of the outcome 
measures.  Formal testing of the differences between groups will be done at the study’s conclusion  
using appropriate statistical tests -  analys is of variance technique will be used to test chara cteristics that 
are continuous in nature, while chi -square technique will be used for the test characteristics that are 
discrete in nature .   
 
 As with any clinical trial, the safety of the patient will be of utmost concern.  Safety will be 
monitored close ly during the course of the study . The DMC Report will include data on incidence of 
adverse events by treatment group.  It will also include data on early terminations and treatment 
dropouts. T he adverse event data will also be reported in the primary stud y manuscript.  Data will be 
collected on adverse events throughout the study  starting immediately after the patient signs the 
informed consent form .   
 
Outcome Measures:  
  The DMC reports and the final statistical report will include the statistical analys es of the 
primary and the secondary outcome measures for the study. The following paragraphs describe the

outcome measures, the statistical techniques for the analyses and the table shells in which the results of 
the analyses  will be presented in the repor ts.  
 
Primary Outcome Measure:  
 
 Time -to-MACE event: MACE, the composite endpoint that includes Death (all cause), 
Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Revascularization for myocardial ischemia, will be the primary outcome 
measure after randomization and the ind ex CABG. Each randomized subject (either in Endoscopic or in 
Open harvesting group) will be followed after the index CABG to capture the time -to-MACE event where 
an ‘EVENT’ will be defined as either death (all cause) or an MI or a revascularization procedu re during 
the follow -up period. Total follow -up period will be 6.5 years of which the first 4.5 years will be active 
follow -up (using in -clinic visit or by telephone) period and will be carried out by the site personnel. The 
remaining 2 years will be passive follow -up which will be carried out centrally by the chair’s office staff 
using the VA patient database. A minimum of 1 year of active follow -up will be used for subjects who 
will be enrolled almost at the tail end of the 3 -year projected enrollment per iod of the study. The 
subjects who will either be lost to follow -up or will not experience an ‘EVENT’ before the end of the 
follow -up period will be considered as right censored.  
The primary analysis of such time -to-Mace event data will include the events  only from the 
active follow -up period (which is 4.5 years). The secondary analysis will include events from the entire 
6.5 years of follow -up period.  
Survival analysis techniques will be used to analyze the time -to-MACE event data for both 
primary and se condary analyses.  
Kaplan -Meier analysis, a nonparametric method, will be used to estimate the survival (not 
experiencing MACE) over time in the two harvesting groups and a log -rank statistic will be used to test 
the equality of the survival function estim ates in the two groups (the null hypothesis).   
Kaplan -Meier curves for all other predictors, e.g., age, gender etc., will also be plotted to 
provide insight into the shape of survival function for each group. These curves will also provide 
information abo ut the proportionality among the groups (i.e., whether the curves are parallel or not).

A typical Kaplan -Meier curve showing survival probabilities in two treatment groups is shown in 
Figure 3.  
A test of equality across strata will also be performed to decide which predictor variables to 
include in the final model. For categorical variables log -rank tests, a non -parametric test, will be used 
and for continuous variables univariate Cox proportional hazard regression, a semi- parametric mode l, 
will be used.  The results from the log -rank tests and univariate Cox proportional hazard regressions will 
be presented in the formats as shown in Tables 7 and 8 .

experience etc.  The predictors that are identified in the previous step  will be included in the model.  
The results from the modeling will be presented in the format as shown in Table 8.

Secondary Outcome Measures:  
 
1. One -year MACE :  
Patients who will suffer any one of these three outcomes within the first year after index CABG will be counted towards calculating the proportions of patients with MACE 
(yes/no) in each harvesting technique group –  patients with endoscopic vein grafting or 
patients with open vein grafting. Only the first event will be considered as a MACE event. These two proportions will be compared using a chi -square test.  MACE data at 
one-year post surgery will be presented as s hown in Table 9 .  Tables 10, 11 and 12 
provide the format for the components of MACE –  for example, death (all cause), MI , 
and repeat revascularization.

3. Post -operative Leg Wound Healing Complications: Each patient in either harvesting 
technique group – EVH or OVH – will be examined for healing complications for their leg 
wounds from harvesting at discharge and at 6 weeks post -surgery. Post -operative leg 
wound healing complication status (yes/no) will be recorded at the discharge and also at 
6 weeks post- surgery. Proportion of patients with leg wound healing complications will 
be computed for each treatment group and these proportions at each time point will be 
compared using chi -square tests. The impact of confounding variables, such as, BMI, 
diabetes status, smoking status, and harvester experience  on the post -operative leg 
wound healing complications will be analyzed using a logistic regression. The results from the chi -square analysis will be presented with counts of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in regards to 
leg wound healing complications in the two harvesting techniques as shown in Table 1 7.

grafting, data will be collected at discharge and at six -week post CABG. Proportion of 
patients with severe pain (pain score 3 and above = yes) at each time point will be 
compared using chi -square statistics.  
The results from the chi -square analysis will be presented with counts o f ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in 
regards to severity of incisional leg pain in the two harvesting techniques as shown in

5. Quality of Life:  QoL scores, from VR -12 and Seattle Angina Questionnaire, will be 
computed at baseline , six-week s, and 12 months  post -surgery for the patients in both 
harvesting technique groups ( EVH and OVH). Patients in the two groups will be 
categorized as “improved”, “no change” and “worse” based on their baseline scores. 
The proportions of patients in these three categories will be compared between the two 
groups using chi -square statistics. T he actual scores from these measures will also be 
used to compare patients in the two harvesting technique groups using analyses of 
covariance techniques, where the baseline (pre -surgery) scores will be used as a 
covariate.  The results from the chi -square analysis will be presented with counts of ‘yes’ 
and ‘no’ in regards to QoL scores categorized as “improved”, “no change” and “worse”  
in the two harvesting techniques as shown in Table 20.  Table 21 provides the format in 
which the results from ANCOVA analy sis will be presented.

VA COOPERATIVE STUDY #5 88 
 
RANDOMIZED ENDO -VEIN GRAFT PROSPECTIVE –  REGROUP TRIAL  
 
Site Selection Process: Vein Harvester Qualification Policy  
 
1. VA sites with active Cardiac Surgery Programs are contacted with introductory letter 
including executive summary and relevant manuscripts via email.  
 
2. Interested sites provide high -level overview of the sites Cardiac Surgery Service eligibility 
criteria:  
• established EVH program >2y ears,  
• sufficient isolated CABG volume to enroll 2-3 subjects/month  x3 years ,  
• willing ness  to randomize to EVH vs. OVH ,  
• at least one harvester experience includes > 100 EVH with conversion rate < 5%,  
• ability to competently provide care for OVH procedure . 
 
3. All potential sites complete CSP #588 F orm 15 for each individual harvester who  is expected 
to perform the vein harvesting procedure  as part of normal daily job duties  during the 
course of study participation at the site . The forms are  signed by the site Principle 
Investigator ( site surgeon investigator)  as verification . 
 
4. Each completed form is submitted to and reviewed by the Study Chair’s office .  
 
5. A Subcommittee of the Executive Committee will review each site case by case to  determine 
eligibility status  and designate each site as one of the following:  
 
A. Site with  at least one harvester experienced in BOTH EVH and OVH confirmed  by the 
site surgeon investigator => site confirmed as qualified for study participation and 
harvester assigned a code by CSPCC.  
 
B. Site with at least one harvester experienced in  EVH but NOT O VH confirmed by the 
site surgeon investigator => site confirmed as qualified for study participation  only  
IF a designated harvester for OVH is  identified , assigned a code by CSPCC, and MUST  
be immediately available , in addition to the EVH harvester , at tim e of randomization 
and harvesting (i.e.  the site surgeon investigator).  
 
I. Site with NO harvester experienced in EVH and/or incapable of providing OVH 
procedure => site is INELIGIBLE  for study participation  at this time regardless of 
interest level or CABG volume.

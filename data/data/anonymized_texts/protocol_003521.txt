1. INTRODUCTION 
Natalizumab (NTZ) is an extremely effective medication in reducing relapses and 
delaying or reducing sustained disability worseningi.  Therefore, NTZ is frequently 
prescribed in relapsing multiple sclerosis ( MS) patients with highly active disease who 
have failed previous disease modifying therapy (DMT). However, there is increased risk 
of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients infected 
with John Cunningham virus (JCV) who are being treated with NTZii.  Unfortunately, the 
prevalence of antibodies to the JCV is relatively high, greater than 50 percent of the 
populationiii. The risk of developing PML reduces NTZ use, particularly after 2 years of 
NTZ exposure when the risk of PML increasesiv.  Currently, the risk of developing PML 
is 4.22 per 1000v. Therefore, NTZ is frequently stopped once a patient demonstrates 
evidence of JCV exposure by the presence of anti-JCV antibodies.  However, the risk of 
disease progression has been reported to be higher when switching to another disease 
modifying therapy.  In a study of 88 patients who had been treated on NTZ for 2 years 
were either maintained on NTZ, switched to another DMT, or remained off DMT. The 
relapse rate was 3.7% in the NTZ group verses 17.8% in the group on another DMTvi.  
In another trial evaluating transitioning patients to dimethyl fumarate, the risk of relapse 
was 19.6% at one year.vii Most recently, a multi-center trial was conducted in Sweden 
evaluating patients switching to rituximab or fingolimod after treatment with NTZ for 
greater than 6 months. Within 18 months of stopping NTZ, the relapse rate was 17.6% 
for fingolimod and only 1.8% for rituximabviii. 
In addition, there is no consensus on when to restart another disease modifying therapy 
although evidence suggests beginning treatment within 3 months of the last dose of 
NTZix.  Unfortunately, several studies have indicated that approximately a third of 
patients, within 3-6 months after withdrawal from NTZ, experienced a clinical and/or 
radiographic relapsex. 
Ocrelizumab (OCR), a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to, and 
destroys CD20-expressing lymphocytes (B-cell lymphocytes), has demonstrated robust 
efficacy in reducing relapse rate with a relative reduction of 46% and 47% respectively 
in OPERA I and IIxi. In addition, OCR treatment compared to interferon-β1a therapy led 
to a significant reduction in contrast enhancing lesions on MRI especially at 24 weeks, 
48 weeks, and 96 weeks of treatment with a relative reduction of 94% and 95% 
respectively. Disability progression at 12 and 24 weeks were also significant ly different 
between both groups with a relative reduction of 40% at 96 weeks.  No evidence of 
disease activity (NEDA) was present in 48% of patients at 96 weeks. The percentage of 
patients meeting NEDA in the AFFIRM trial was only 37%xii. Also, the number was more 
impressive for OCR with 72% of patients meeting NEDA when assessed after 24 
weeksxiii.   
In OPERA I and II, adverse events were the same between the two groups.  Not 
surprisingly, infusion related reactions were more common with 11 patients stopping 
OCR. Also, in patients receiving OCR, upper respiratory infections and nasopharyngitis 
were more common.  However, unlike NTZ , OCR use has not been associated with the 
risk of developing PML in patients with MS. Also, to date, there a re no reported cases of 
PML in patients who have received rituximab for the treatment of MS.  
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 4 of 34  ML39655  The robust therapeutic efficacy of OCR in the phase III pivotal trials, the absence of 
evidence of PML risk, and the convenience of fewer infusions, makes it an attractive 
alternative therapy for patients with MS being treated with NTZ, particularly those with 
the presence of anti-JCV antibodies.  However, patients who are JCV negative will 
likely also be interested in OCR given the potential risk of a false negative to the JCV 
virus with the reported rate of sero-conversion at 2 to 3 percent per yearxiv. 
Given the efficacy and safety data demonstrated in these trials, OPERA I and II, we 
anticipate that physicians and patients with relapsing MS being treated with NTZ 
independent of the JCV status would be interested in transitioning to OCR. 
However, breakthrough disease is well documented in patients electively coming off 
NTZ to reduce PML risk. Therefore, conducting a study to determine if patients on N TZ 
regardless of their JCV status can be transitioned to OCR safely without disease 
progression is vital. 
On March 28, 2017, Roche/Genentech announced FDA approval of OCREVUS ® 
(Ocrelizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing or primary progressive 
forms of multiple sclerosis. 
 
2. OBJECTIVES 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of OCR in RMS patients 
who have been previously treated with NTZ by evaluating relapse rate, progression on 
MRI and disability progression. 
 2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 
The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the effect of OCR on quality of life 
at months 6 and 12 using Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS- 29) and to assess 
safety and tolerability of OCR in patients previously treated with NTZ by evaluating 
adverse events and discontinuation. 
 
3.      STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label Phase IV clinical trial. Patients with 
relapsing forms of MS, ages 18 to 65, who have received a stable dose of NTZ for 12 or 
more consecutive months, and have been free of relapses, disability worsening or MRI 
progression 6 months prior to the transition screening visit will be eligible for the study.  
After informed consent to participate has been obtained, the patient will have a 
neurological exam, EDSS, 3T or 1.5T MRI, MSIS-29 and labs done for the screening 
visit to determine eligibility. 3T or 1.5T brain MRI with and without contrast will be 
performed with the standard MS protocol. It is preferred that the MRIs are done on a 3T 
scanner for this trial, but not required. MRIs will be performed with 3mm slice thickness 
with no gaps between slices. Patients will receive their first dose of OCR 4 to 6 weeks 
after the last dose of NTZ. Other baseline measures, including EDSS, MSIS-29, and 
labs will be performed within 4 weeks of screening.  A neurological exam, EDSS, and 
labs will be performed at month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12. MSIS-29 will be 
performed at months 6 and 12.  MRIs will be performed at screening to determine 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 5 of 34  ML39655  eligibility and at months 3, 6, and 12. All adverse events will be reported to the study 
sponsor. OCR will not be provided by the study; the medication will be supplied through 
the patient’s commercial pharmacy and billed to the patient or the patient’s insurance.  
Patients will receive OCR 4-6 weeks after their last infusion of NTZ.  O CR 300mg IV will 
be given on Day 0 and repeated with the same dose on Day 14±2.  Patients will then 
receive OCR 600mg IV every 24 weeks.  
If discontinuation of study drug occurs, the subject may continue in the trial for 
observational purposes. If willing to continue, they will complete all visit items moving 
forward, with the exception of study drug dosing and pregnancy testing (if applicable) . If 
study drug is discontinued and the subject is unwilling to continue in the trial, a 
premature termination visit will be completed as soon as possible .  
The target enrollment is 50 patients from 5 centers. Serious adverse events recorded 
during the trial will be reported to the study sponsor via Medwatch form .  
 
3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The clinical data from OPERA I and II demonstrated a highly efficacious medication 
with a significant reduction in relapses, MRI progression, and disability progression.  In 
addition, the data suggest that OCR is well tolerated as only 3.2% of patients withdrew 
secondary to side effects in OPERA I and 3.8% of patients withdrew in OPERA II. From 
a safety perspective, no opportunistic infections were seen in the clinical trials, and this 
includes PML. 
NTZ is a highly effective medication for treating patients with relapsing MS.  However, 
despite adequate disease control and JCV status, patients will eventually discontinue 
secondary to the potential risk of P MLxv. Unfortunately, multiple studies have 
demonstrated an increase in risk of disease progression after switching to another 
agent after discontinuing NTZxvi,xvii,xviii. So, given the robust clinical data and safety 
profile from the pivotal OCR trials, this medication is an attractive option for patients and 
clinicians.   
In this clinical trial, patients will receive the FDA approved dose and frequency of OCR.  
In the RESTORE trial, NTZ concentrations reached undetectable levels 8 weeks after 
the last infusion.  Also, data from several clinical trials including STRATEGY and 
SWITCH suggest that a shorter washout period will reduce the risk of disease 
recurrencexix.  Therefore, OCR will be infused at a minimum of 4 weeks after the last 
dose of NTZ and up until 6 weeks.   
Measuring breakthrough disease to date is best evaluated by measuring clinical and 
radiographic changes. A patient outcome measure, MSIS-29, will help evaluate 
changes in quality of life after transitioning to OCR .  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
 
3.3.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of relapse-free patients at month 12 after 
switching from NTZ to OCR. 
Relapse is defined as:  
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 6 of 34  ML39655   Occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to MS 
 Symptoms persisting for > 24 hours 
 Symptoms not attributable to confounding clinical factors (e.g., fever, infection, 
injury, adverse reaction to medication) 
 Symptoms immediately preceded by a stable or improving neurological state for at 
least 30 days   
 Symptoms accompanied by objective neurological worsening consistent with an 
increase of at least half a step on the EDSS scale, or 2 points on one of the 
appropriate FSS, or 1 point on 2 or more of the appropriate FSS; the change has to 
affect the selected FSS (i.e . pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, 
or visual) 
 
 
3.3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
 Proportion of relapse free patients at months 3, 6, and 9 
 
 Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)  
 
 Mean time to first relapse on OCR 
 
 Proportion of patients free from MRI evidence of MS disease activity at months 
3, 6, and 12 
 
 Proportion of patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions at 3, 6, and 12 months.  
For patients with new or enlarging lesions, the number of new and enlarging 
lesions 
 
 Proportion of patients with new Gd+ lesions at months 3, 6, and 12.  For 
patients with new Gd+ lesions, number of new Gd+ lesions detected at months 
3, 6, and 12. 
 
 Change in the EDSS score from baseline to month 12.   
 
 Change in MSIS-29 from baseline to months 6 and 12 
 
 Number and type of AEs and SAEs 
 
 Proportion of patients that discontinued OCR 
 
  
3.3.3 Ancillary Safety Outcome Measures 
 Number and type of infusion related reactions based on dose including the 
severity of the reactions 
 
 Number of and type of infections during the trial.  
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN 
Patients will be evaluated at each study visit for the duration of their participation in the 
study (see Section 4.5 and Appendix A, Study Flowchart). 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 7 of 34  ML39655  A full neurologic examination will be conducted at every visit (may be historical at 
screening if an exam was completed within 28 days prior to consent, and may be 
waived at baseline if screening and baseline are 7 or less days apart).  Any worsening 
or new abnormality (including laboratory results) that is determined by the investigator 
as clinically significant will be recorded as an AE and will be monitored until resolution 
or stabilization.  MS related symptoms are not to be reported as AEs unless, in the 
opinion of the investigator, the symptoms are unusually serious and relevant. 
 
The recommendation from the OCR prescribing information dated 11/2018 is to pre-
medicate with 100mg of methylprednisolone (or an equivalent corticosteroid) 
administered intravenously approximately 30 minutes prior to each OCR infusion to 
reduce the frequency and severity of infusion related reactions (IRRs) [see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.1) in prescribing information]. Also, it is recommended to p re-
medicate with an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine ) approximately 30-60 minutes 
prior to each OCR infusion to further reduce the frequency and severity of infusion 
reactions .  
 
Recommended medications to be available if there is an infusion reaction (per treating 
investigator discretion): 
A. Epinephrine – anaphylaxis 
B. Albuterol – bronchospasm or hypoxia 
C. Famotidine 20mg IV – hives, itching, or anaphylax is 
D. Oxygen therapy – shortness of breath, chest pain, or hypoxia 
E. Acetaminophen – pain, fever, and headaches 
F. Methylprednisolone – hives, itching, shortness of breath, or anaphylaxis 
 
Patients administered a sedating antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of IRRs 
should be given appropriate warnings concerning drowsiness and potential impairment 
of ability to drive or operate machinery. 
 
Pre-medications, infusion reaction management, and infusion reaction medications are 
to be left to treating investigator discretion.  
 
Suggested Management of IRRs 
 
Severe IRRs 
If a patient experiences a severe IRR or a complex of flushing, fever, and throat pain 
symptoms, the infusion should be interrupted immediately and the patient should 
receive symptomatic treatment. The infusion should be re-started only after all 
symptoms have resolved. The initial infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion 
rate at the time of onset of the reaction. 
 
Mild-Moderate IRRs 
If the event that a patient experiences is a mild to moderate IRR (e.g. headache), the 
infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate at the time of the event. This reduced 
rate should be maintained for at least 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion rate may 
then be increased according to the patient’s initial infusion schedule. 
 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  
This is an observational study in patients who will receive OCR as part of their standard 
care.  
 
4.3. STUDY TREATMENT   
Patients will be initiated on OCR after inform ed consent and screening assessment 
have been completed.  The first dose of OCR will be administered between 4 and 6 
weeks after the last dose of NTZ.  OCR will be prescribed by patient’s neurologist as 
standard of care and paid for by the patient/patient’s insurance.    
 
4.3.1 Dosage, Preparation, Administration and Storage  
Ocrelizumab Formulation Packaging, and Handling  
The following requirements are listed in the OCR prescribi ng information dated 11/2018  
and are to be followed as part of the standard of care preparation of OCR for infusion. 
The study team is not responsible for collecting or reviewing data on how the drug was 
packaged, prepared, handled, or stored for the purpo ses of this trial.  
 
Ocrelizumab will be supplied by the commercial  pharmacy in a liquid formulation 
containing 30 -mg/mL ocrelizumab in 20mM sodium acetate at pH 5.3, with 4% 
trehalose dihydrate and 0.02% polysorbate 20. The drug product is provided as a 
single-use liquid formulation in a 15 -cc, type I USP, glass vial fitted with a 20 -mm, 
fluoro -resin, laminated stopper and an aluminum seal with a flip -off plastic cap and 
contains a nominal 300 mg ocrelizumab. No preservative is used as each vial is 
designed  for single use.  
 
The ocrelizumab drug product must be diluted before administration. Solutions of 
ocrelizumab for IV administration are prepared by dilution of the drug product into an 
infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride to a final drug concentra tion of 1 to 2 
mg/mL.  
 
Ocrelizumab may contain fine translucent and/or reflective particles associated with 
enhanced opalescence. Do not use the solution if discolored or if the solution contains 
discrete foreign particulate matter.  
 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 10 of 34 ML39655  The infusion solution must be administered using an infusion set with an in -line, sterile, 
non-pyrogenic, low -protein- binding filter (pore size of up to 0.2 micrometer).  
 
The prepared infusion solution of ocrelizumab is physically and chemically stable for 24 
hours at 2−8°C and subsequently 8 hours at room temperature. The prepared infusion 
solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, it can be stored up to 24 
hours at 2−8°C. Infusion solution must be completely administered to the patient  within 
32 hours  of preparation (not exceeding 24 hours at 2−8°C and 8 hours at room 
temperature). In the event an IV infusion cannot be completed the same day, the 
remaining solution should be discarded.  
 
Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Ocrelizumab 300mg IV will be given on Day 0 and repeated with the same dose on Day 
14±2.  Patients will then receive ocrelizumab 600mg IV every 24 weeks. Medication will 
not be provided by the study.  
 
Although ocrelizumab may be administered on an outpatient basis, patie nts may be 
hospitalized for observation at the discretion of the investigator. Ocrelizumab infusions 
should always be administered in a hospital or clinic environment under close 
supervision of the investigator or a medically qualified staff member.  
 
See section 3.4 for recommended pre- medications and recommended medications t o 
treat IRRs . For the 300 -mg dose, e ach ocrelizumab infusion should be given as a n IV 
infusion over approximately 150 minutes (2.5 hours). For the  600-mg dose, each 
ocrelizumab infusio n should be given as a n IV infusion over approximately 215 minutes 
(3.5 hours). Since transient hypotension may occur during ocrelizumab infusion, the 
investigator may wish to withhold anti -hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to 
ocrelizumab infusion.  
 
Ocrelizumab must not be administered as an IV push or bolus. Well -adjusted infusion 
pumps should be used to control the infusion rate, and ocrelizumab should be infused 
through a dedicated line. It is important not to use evacuated glass containers (to 
prepare the infusion), which require vented administration sets, because this causes 
foaming as air bubbles pass through the solution.  
 
After completion of the infusion, the IV cannula should remain in situ for at least 1 hour 
to allow for administration of dr ugs intravenously, if necessary, in the event of a delayed 
reaction. If no adverse events occur during this period of time, the IV cannula may be 
removed and the patient may be discharged.  
 
See the OCR prescribing information dated 11/2018  for detailed ins tructions on drug 
preparation, storage, and administration.  
 
4.3.2 Dosage Modification 
Dose modification of OCR is not permitted.   
4.3.3 Overdose 
There have been no observed overdoses in human clinical trials.   
 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 11 of 34 ML39655  4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPY 
All concomitant medications are allowed except immunosuppressants, lymphocyte-
depleting agents, or lymphocyte-trafficking blockers while patients are receiving OCR . 
All medications including over-the-counter medication and supplements will be recorded 
at each clinical visit. At screening, all medications taken 4 weeks prior to screening will 
be reviewed and recorded, as well as all prior lifetime MS disease modifying therapies 
taken by the patient.  
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The investigator or designated research staff will obtain informed consent from each 
patient after explaining the purpose of the study and the potential risks and benefits 
known or can be reasonably expected. The IRB approved informed consent will be 
signed by the patient before any screening assessments or procedures are performed. 
 
4.5.1 Assessments during Treatment 
Visit 1/Screening Visit (- 28 to -1 days prior to Baseline Day 0) 
The following clinical and laboratory evaluations will occur within 28 days prior to 
Baseline (Day 0 OCR dose), unless otherwise noted. The investigator or designee must 
perform all screening evaluations to determine patient eligibility.  
 Informed consent 
 Eligibility review 
 Demographic information 
 Review of disease and medical history

4.9 STATISTICAL METHODS 
4.9.1 Analysis of the Conduct of the Study 
The following documentation will be collected and analyzed for all enrolled patients in 
order to maintain the integrity of the study: 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 15 of 34 ML39655  A. Enrollment date and time 
B. Demographic information 
C. Baseline disease status 
D. If applicable, protocol violation date and cause  
E. If applicable, discontinuation date and cause  
Demographic information and baseline disease for all enrolled patients, those who 
violated protocol, and those who discontinued will be summarized and reported 
separately. The reasons for discontinuing or violating protocol and the patient’s time on 
drug at occurrence will be reported and any influence on the trial results will be 
discussed. To assess the comparability between centers, summaries will be reported 
for all patients overall and by study center.  Any other irregularities that result in missing 
data will be fully identified and discussed.   
All patients that followed protocol will be used to evaluate efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability. This includes patients that discontinued but followed protocol up to 
discontinuation.   
 
4.9.2 Analysis of Treatment Group Comparability 
Not applicable  
 
4.9.3 Efficacy Analysis 
a. Primary Endpoint 
Proportion of patients relapse free at 12 months after switching from NTZ to OCR  
 
b. Secondary Endpoints 
 Proportion of patients relapse-free at 3, 6, and 9 months after switching to OCR 
 
 Mean time to first relapse 
 
 MRI evidence of MS disease activity 
 
 Proportion of patients with New or Enlarging T2 lesions at 3, 6, and 12 months.  
For patients with New or Enlarging T2 lesions, number of New and Enlarging T2 
lesions. 
 
 Proportion of patients with New Gd+ lesions detected at months 3, 6, and 12. 
For patients with New Gd+ lesions, number of New Gd+ lesions 
 
 Annualized relapse rate (ARR)  
 
 Change in EDSS from baseline to 12 months 
 
 Change in MSIS-29 from baseline to 6 and 12 months 
 
All patients that followed protocol will be used to evaluate the proportion of patients 
relapse-free at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, mean time to first relapse, and A RR. This 
includes those that discontinued early but followed protocol up to discontinuation. All 
patients that followed protocol and did not discontinue will be used to evaluate MRI 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 16 of 34 ML39655  evidence of MS disease activity at 3, 6, and 12 months, the change in MSIS-29 from 
baseline to 6 and 12 months, and the change in EDSS from baseline to 12 months. 
 
A full analysis set consistent with the intent- to-treat (ITT) principle will also be used to 
analyze the proportion of patients relapse-free at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, mean time to 
first relapse, and ARR using all subjects.  Subjects who entered the trial and did not 
meet inclusion criteria may be excluded. 
Summary statistics will be presented for continuous variables (mean, standard 
deviation, median, range) and categorical variables (counts and percentages). All 
analyses will use two-sided confidence intervals and p-values at the 0.05 significance 
level. 
Primary Analysis 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methodology will be used to determine the proportion of 
patients relapse-free at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Median and mean time to first relapse 
with confidence intervals will be reported.  Log rank tests and graphical presentations of 
Kaplan Meier curves with confidence intervals will be used to examine effects of center, 
gender, categorized age, categorized EDSS and duration of disease on survival 
distribution.  
Secondary Analysis 
ARR will be analyzed with a Poisson or negative binomial analysis with the total number 
of relapses as a dependent variable and the logarithm of time followed as an offset. The 
number of new or enlarging T2 and Gd+ lesions at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months will be 
summarized and reported.  The mean and median change in EDSS from baseline will 
be determined at 12 months and tested by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The mean and 
median change in MSIS-29 from baseline will be determined at 6 and 12 months and 
tested by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. 
 
4.9.4 Safety Analysis 
Information on the timing, severity, relationship to drug, relationship to therapy, effect on 
therapy, and degree of seriousness of adverse events will be collected from and 
summarized for all patients.   
 
4.9.5 Missing Data 
Demographic information and baseline disease for patients who followed protocol and 
completed the study, violated protocol, and discontinued the study will be reported 
separately and compared. The reasons for discontinuing or violating protocol and the 
patient’s time on drug at occurrence will be reported and any influence on the trial 
results will be discussed. To assess the comparability between centers, summaries will 
be reported for all patients overall and by study center.  Any other irregularities that 
result in missing data will be fully identified and discussed.  
For the per protocol and full analysis sets , missing data due to discontinuation will be 
incorporated as censored time points in the survival analysis of relapse-free patients 
and ARR will be calculated using the range of time that the individual was in the study. 
If interim time points at 3, 6, or 9 months are missing, only the time points available will 
be used in the survival analysis. No relapse data will be missing at baseline, since only 
patients relapse free for six months are included. For the Kaplan Meier analyses and 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 17 of 34 ML39655  log rank tests stratified by age, gender, EDSS, and center, we expect these patient 
characteristics to be non-missing. However, if they are missing, a complete case 
analysis per variable will be used and the number of missing will be reported .  
 
For the analysis of the change in EDSS and MSIS-29, a complete case analysis with 
per protocol patients will be used. 
 
 
4.9.6 Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size was based on a Kaplan Meier analysis with proportion of patients 
relapse free at 12 months as the primary endpoint. Assuming a relapse-free proportion 
of 0.80 at 12 months, 45 patients are required to say that the relapse free proportion is 
no lower than 0.68, with 95% confidence. To account for 10% attrition, a total of 50 
patients are needed. 
 
4.10 DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
Accurate, consistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use of standard 
practices and procedures.    
 
5. REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE is an unfavorable unintended sign, symptom, or disease that is experienced by 
the patient, whether or not there is a causal relationship with OCR.  At the time of 
consenting, each patient will be given the names and telephone numbers of the study 
personnel for reporting AE’s.  The investigator must conduct thorough assessment to 
determine the severity of the AE and the relationship to the study drug. Any clinically 
significant AE of severity moderate or higher, requires follow up until resolution or 
stabilization by the treating investigator beyond the end of study contact.  
 
All AEs should be recorded in the patient’s AE case report form regardless of severity 
or relationship to the study drug.  The investigator must review the laboratory findings 
for significance (all out of range values must be assessed as clinically significant or not 
clinically significant) and sign and date the laboratory report.  All clinically significant 
laboratory findings must be reported as adverse events.  
 
Any severe laboratory abnormalities that are considered serious should be reported to 
the coordinating center as outlined below.   
 
All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to Genentech by email usds_aereporting-
d@gene.com or fax (650) 238-6067 and Providence Regional Research Regulatory 
Office by email suzanne.balleisen@providence.org (Regulatory) and CC 
tiffany.gervasi@providence.org (Study Manager) or fax to 503- 215-6547 (Regulatory) 
and (503) 216- 1039 (Study Manager) within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of 
the event.    
 
Severity 
The intensity of severity of an AE will be graded as follows: 
 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 18 of 34 ML39655  Mild Symptoms(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; 
prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms(s) but may 
be given because of personality of subject 
 
Moderate Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; subject is able to continue in 
study; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed. 
 
Severe Symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on subject’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with investigational drug; treatment for symptom(s) may be 
given and/or subject hospitalized. 
Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug will be characterized as 
follows: 
 
Not related Any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational drug AND  that is likely to have been 
produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject. 
 
Unlikely Any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational drug OR that is likely to have been 
produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject. 
 
Possibly Any reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational drug OR that follows a known response 
pattern to the suspected drug AND  that could not be reasonably 
explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
 
Related Any reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational drug AND  that follows a known response 
pattern to the suspected drug AND  that recurs with re-challenge, 
AND/OR is improved by stopping the drug or reducing the dose. 
 
 
5.1   ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Specification of Safety Variables  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to OCR per protocol.  This 
includes all events of death, and any study specific issue of concern. 
Adverse Events 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-
imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. Site Investigator 
or Designee:  
Record event in 
subject's CRF as 
per CRF 
instructions  
 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 19 of 34 ML39655   
This includes the following: 
 AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol-
specified AE reporting period.  
 
 Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., 
invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations). 
 
 If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other protocol-mandated intervention. 
 
 Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by 
the investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character 
during the protocol-specified AE reporting period. 
Serious Adverse Events 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if any of the following criteria are met: 
 It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death). 
 It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places t he 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.). 
 It requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization. 
 It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
 It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother exposed to the IMP. 
 It is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical 
judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). 
 
5.2   METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY VARIABLES 
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study are collected and reported to the appropriate IRB(s) and Genentech, 
Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports). 
Adverse Event Reporting Period 
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and ends 30 days following the last administration of 
study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this 
period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment. 
Assessment of Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by study personnel 
during questioning, or detected through examination, laboratory test, or other means 
will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by its 
duration (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, 
suspected relationship to ocrelizumab (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 20 of 34 ML39655  To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should 
apply the following general guideline: 
 
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of ocrelizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the subject’s 
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the AE follows a 
known pattern of response to ocrelizumab; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon 
discontinuation of ocrelizumab or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-
challenge. 
 
No  
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than ocrelizumab (e.g., preexisting 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 
and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to ocrelizumab administration 
(e.g., event diagnosed 2 days after first dose of ocrelizumab). 
 
 
Expected versus unexpected is to be evaluated for SAEs.  
 
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in 
the prescribing information .  
 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the prescribing information or not 
identified. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not 
consistent with the description in the prescribing information. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the prescribing information only 
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
 
 
5.3   PROCEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
Eliciting Adverse Events 
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points should 
be adopted. Examples of non-directive questions include:  
 “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?” 
 “Have you had any new/changed health problems since you were last here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or 
SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms 
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or 
symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the 
time of reporting, it is ok to report the information that is currently available. If a 
diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up informati on. 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 21 of 34 ML39655  b. Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 
5.1.2), regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When 
recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”. 
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical 
condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only 
if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting 
condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent 
headaches”). 
d. Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as an SAE. If a subject is hospitalized to undergo a medical 
or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not 
the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is 
hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record the heart condition that 
necessitated the bypass as the SAE. 
 
Hospitalizations for the following reasons do not require reporting: 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for preexisting conditions 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study or 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the target 
disease of the study. 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 22 of 34 ML39655  e. Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events     
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity. The below table should be used for assessing 
severity for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE. 
Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically Listed in NCI 
CTCAE 
Grade  Severity  
1 Mild; asymptomatic o r mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; or intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; or 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically signi ficant, but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting  self-care activities of daily living b,c 
4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated d 
5 Death related  to adverse event d 
NCI CTCAE   National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events.  
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v5.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
a. Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for 
groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of  self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as 
performed by patients who are not bedridden.  
c. If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a 
serious adverse event  
d. Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events  
 
f. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving ocrelizumab or within 6 months 
after the last dose of study drug, a report should be completed and expeditiously 
submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 23 of 34 ML39655  should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should 
always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any 
congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the 
ocrelizumab should be reported as an SAE. 
 
Additional information on any ocrelizumab-exposed pregnancy and infant will be 
requested by Genentech Drug Safety at specific time points (i.e. after having received 
the initial report, at the end of the second trimester, 2 weeks after the expected date of 
delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of the infant’s life). 
 
g. Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior ocrelizumab 
exposure. If the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who 
participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE adequately to Genentech 
drug Safety and the Sponsor. 
.  
h.  Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports 
 
The Sponsor agrees to complete the Case Transmission verification to ensure that all 
single case reports have been adequately received by Genentech via the Sponsor 
emailing Genentech a Quarterly line-listing documenting single case reports sent by the 
Sponsor to Genentech in the preceding time period.  
The periodic line-listing will be exchanged within seven (7) calendar days of the end of 
the agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be received within the time 
period mutually agreed upon. 
                    
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving 
the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on 
a case- by-case basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive 
reconciliation guidance documents within the ‘Activation Package’. 
 
Following Case Transmission Verification, single case reports which have not been 
received by Genentech shall be forwarded by Providence Brain and Spine Institute  to 
Genentech within five (5)  calendar days from request by Genentech.  
 
At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification report will be 
sent to Genentech. 
 
i.   AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)  
 
AESIs are a subset of Events to Monitor (EtMs) of scientific and medical concern 
specific to OCR, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such an event might require further 
investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature of the 
event, rapid communication by the trial Sponsor to other parties (e.g., Regulatory 
Authorities) may also be warranted. 
 
There are no ocrelizumab Events of Special Interest. 
 
Protocol:  Ocrelizumab Providence Health & Services  
Page 24 of 34 ML39655  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
 Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or 
AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as 
defined by Hy’s law: 
o Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN 
o Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with 
clinical jaundice 
 Data related to a suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study 
drug (STIAMP), as defined below: 
 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only 
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected 
 
j. Exchange OF Single C ase Reports  
 
Providence Brain and Spine Institute  will be responsible for collecting all protocol -

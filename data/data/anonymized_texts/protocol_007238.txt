Version Date:  March 26, 2020 1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Multiple Myeloma:  Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of the differentiated plasma cells, that 
affect the older patient with a median age at onset of 65-70 years and a slight male 
predominance. It is characterized by clonal expansion of plasma cells leading to increased 
production of monoclonal protein in the majority of patients accompanied by end organ damage in the form of lytic bone disease, hype rcalcemia, anemia and renal insufficiency. 
Nearly 24,000 patients with myeloma are dia gnosed in the United States each year, and 
despite considerable improvements in therap y, myeloma remains incurable and uniformly 
fatal with a median overall survival of around  8 years. Recent improvements in therapies 
have significantly improved the survival outcom es, but given the inevitable relapses seen in 
these patients, new approaches to therapy are cl early needed. As the efficacy of therapies 
have increased and newer classes of drugs have  been approved for treatment of myeloma, 
there is increasing interest on improving the depth of response with the initial therapy of 
myeloma.  
1.2 Initial therapy of multiple myeloma : The treatment paradigms for multiple myeloma have 
undergone a significant cha nge in the past decade.
1,2 A decade ago, patients who were 
considered eligible for transplant underwent th e procedure after a brief duration of therapy 
with a steroid based regimen with or without doxorubicin. Patients ineligible for transplant 
went on to receive melphalan and prednisone. With these trea tment approaches patients had a 
median survival of 3-4 years, with nearly 10-20% of patients dying in the first year after diagnosis. During the last decade several new dr ugs were introduced such as thalidomide and 
its analogue lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and these along with continued use of transplant has led to improved survival in myeloma.
3 In fact, in the recent 
clinical trials 3-year survival has approached  90% and 1-year mortality has dropped to under 
2%.4 This progress has come through a series of i nvestigations examining the efficacy of the 
new drugs used in various combinations and se quences. Initial trials in the relapsed setting 
confirmed significant clinical activity for all these new drugs. This was followed by several 
clinical trials that examined the combinati on of novel agents with dexamethasone in the 
setting of newly diagnosed disease. The studies c onsistently demonstrated superior response 
rates, deeper responses, and improved progression-free survival for patients undergoing initial therapy with novel agents.
4-7 The trials examined the role of the new drugs in the 
context of transplant eligible and ineligible patients. This has been followed by three drug 
regimens that either combined the new drugs toge ther or incorporated an alkylator drug to the 
novel agent-dexamethasone combination. These have included combinations of bortezomib 
and dexamethasone with thalidomide (VTD), lenalidomide (VRd) or cyclophosphamide 
(VCD).5,6,8,9 
 Of particular interest is the VRd regimen,  which has shown high efficacy rates and is 
increasingly used for initial therapy in the community.
5,9  VRd regimen has been associated 
with high response rates approaching 100% a nd deep responses with very good partial 
response rates and complete response rates of over 70 and 40% respectively. It has proven to 
be a highly effective initial therapy for patient s planning stem cell transplantation with no 
significant effect on the ability to  successfully mobilize stem cells.  
 In the initial phase 1/2 trial of the VRD regimen, 66 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma  
received 3-week cycles of bortezomib (days 1, 4, 8, 11), lenalidomide (days 1-14), and 
dexamethasone (days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12). Phase 2 dosing was determined to be 
bortezomib 1.3 mg/m
2, lenalidomide 25 mg, and dexamethasone 20 mg. Most common 
MC1686 7  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 toxicities included sensory neuropathy, fatigue, lymphopenia, neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia. All patients had a partia l response 74% achieving very good partial 
response or better. In the EVOLUTION trial, patients were randomized to receive bortezomib 
1.3 mg/m2 d 1, 4, 8, 11 and dexamethasone 40 mg d 1, 8, 15, with either cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 d 1, 8 and lenalidomide 15 mg d 1–14 (VDCR), lenalidomide 25 mg d1-14 
(VRd), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 d 1, 8 (VCD) or cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 d 1, 8, 
15 (VCD-mod) in a 21 day cycle (maximum 8 cycles).9,10 This was followed by bortezomib 
1.3 mg/m2 (d 1, 8, 15, 22) for four 42-day maintenance cycles in all arms. VGPR or better 
was seen in 58, 51, 41 and 53% (CR rate of 25, 24, 22 and 47%) of patients (VDCR, VRd, VCD and VCD-mod arms, respectively); the co rresponding progression-free survival (PFS) 
at 1 year was 86, 83, 93 and 100%, respectively. In a recently presented phase 3 trial, the 
combination of VRd was associated with increased response rates,  deeper responses, 
increased PFS and improved overall survival compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. In the SWOG0777 trial, 525 patie nts with newly diagnosed myeloma were 
randomized to lenalidomide with or without bortezomib. Median PFS was 43 months (VRd) 
versus 30 months (Rd); log-rank P value = 0.001 8. Median OS was 75 months (VRd) versus 
64 months (Rd); HR = 0.71; two-sided log-rank P value = 0.0250.   
1.3 Ixazomib : MLN9708, which has been formulated for both intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) 
administration, is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor.  It is the citrate ester of the biologically active boronic acid form, MLN2238.  In water or aqueous systems, Ixazomib citrate rapidly hydrolyzes to MLN2238, therefore all doses and concentrations are expressed as MLN2238.  Nonclinical studies were conducte d with a solution of either MLN2238 or 
MLN2238 in equilibrium with MLN9708.  Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 potently, 
reversibly, and selectively inhib its the 20S proteasome.  However, in contrast to bortezomib, 
it has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) that may contribute to increased tissue distribution.  
Bortezomib has a slowly reversible dissociation rate from the red blood cell proteasome, while MLN2238 demonstrates a more rapidly reve rsible dissociation rate from the blood but 
sustained effects on bone marrow and tumo r proteasomes suggesting better tissue 
distribution.  The pharmacologic implications of  this difference in binding kinetics and tissue 
distribution may in turn result in differences in safety and efficacy profiles in a broader range of tumors.  In xenograft-bearing mice, the more  rapid dissociation rate correlates with an 
increased ratio of tumor proteasome inhibition to blood proteasome inhibition, and ixazomib 
shows greater antitumor activity in several  xenograft models, both solid tumor and 
bortezomib-resistant xenografts, than bortezomib.    
Nonclinical Pharmacology : MLN2238 refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of 
the drug substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN9708).  Ixazomib citrate refers to the citrate ester 
of MLN2238.  In water or aqueous systems, th e equilibrium shifts from ixazomib citrate to 
the biologically active boronic acid form MLN2238.  All doses and concentrations are 
expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
 
In Vitro Pharmacology : MLN2238 preferentially binds the β5 site of the 20S proteasome; at 
higher concentrations, it also inhibits the activity of the β1 and β2 sites.  MLN2238 inhibits 
ß5 site 20S proteasome activity in  vitro, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
of 3.4 nM.  Potency is reduced roughly 10-fold versus ß1 (IC50  31 nM) and 1,000-fold versus ß2 (IC50 =3500 nM).  MLN2238 was also t ested for inhibition against a panel of 103 
kinases, 18 receptors (neurotransmitter, ion cha nnel, brain and gut receptors), and 9 serine 
proteases.  In all cases, the IC50 values were > 10 μM.  MLN2238 and bortezomib have 
different β5 proteasome dissociation half-lives (t1/2), reflecting differences in their on-off 
binding kinetics (the β5 proteasome dissociation t1/2 for MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 
MC1686 8  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 and 110 minutes, respectively).  Based on these favorable characteristics, ixazomib is 
anticipated to be effective against multiple my eloma. (ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
Proteasome inhibition results in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated substrates within the 
cell and leads to cell cycle disruption, with c oncomitant activation of apoptotic pathways and 
cell death.  Consistent with inhibition of  ß5 20S activity, MLN2238 demonstrated potent 
activity against cultured MDA-MB 231 human br east cancer cells in the WST cell viability 
assay.  In nonclinical models MLN2238 has activity against both solid tumor and 
bortezomib-resistant xenografts.  
In Vivo Pharmacology : To determine the activity of MLN2238 in vivo, pharmacodynamic 
studies were performed in immunocompromised mice bearing either CWR22 human prostate 
or WSU-DLCL2 (human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) tumors.  Pharmacodynamic responses in xenograft tumors  were analyzed by assessing 20S proteasome 
inhibition and by evaluating leve ls of accumulated protein markers such as deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3) as well as measuring growth arrest.  Increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3 is 
indicative of a downstream biological response to proteasome inhibition.  After a single dose of MLN2238, a clear dose response was observe d in CWR22 xenografts as seen in both 
tumor 20S proteasome inhibition and in changes in GADD34 and ATF-3 expression.  In 
WSU-DLCL2 xenografts, greater tumor proteasome inhibition was observed with MLN2238 
compared to bortezomib and resulted in increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3. MLN2238 efficacy experiments demonstrated strong antitumor activity in 4 xenograft models: CWR22 (a human prostate cancer cell line) and 3 human lymphoma cell lines 
(WSU-DLCL2, OCI-Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX-22L).  In the case of the CWR22 xenograft model, significant antitumor activity was seen w ith both IV and PO dos ing, demonstrating 
that this molecule has antitumor activity when administered via different dosing routes.  In all 
3 lymphoma lines, MLN2238 demonstrated stronge r antitumor activity than did bortezomib. 
In summary, MLN2238, similar to bortezomib, is a dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor that potently, reversibly, and selectiv ely inhibits the proteasome.  There are several 
features, such as sustained pharmacodynamic effects and activity in a bortezomib-refractory 
lymphoma xenograft model, that suggest that it may have activity that extends beyond that 
seen with bortezomib. 
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics : Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics: The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MLN2238 were studied in severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley 
rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys.  B ecause of the extensive red blood cell (RBC) 
partitioning of MLN2238, both blood and plasma PK parameters were determined in these 
studies.  MLN2238 had a very low blood clearance (CLb) and a moderate blood volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss,b) after IV administration.  The concentration-versus-time curve of MLN2238 displayed a distinct bi-exponen tial profile with a steep initial distribution 
phase and a long terminal t
1/2 (> 24 hr) in all species tested.  MLN2238 had higher plasma 
clearance (CLp) and a larger plasma volume of  distribution at steady-state (Vss,p) than in 
blood, largely because of the extensive RBC partitioning. The PK properties of MLN2238 after oral administration were studied in rats  and dogs.  The plasma oral bioavailability (F) 
was 41% in rats and nearly 100% in dogs.  A clinical prototype formulation of the ixazomib 
capsule demonstrated that MLN2238 had excellent oral F and an excellent absorption profile 
in dogs.  In addition, interindividual variability, as measured by %CV, in Cmax and AUC
0-24hr 
after oral administration was low to moderate, similar to that after IV administration.  The 
terminal t 1/2 after oral administration was also similar to that after IV administration.  
Comparison of the PK profiles after IV or PO administration in the dog is reported in further 
MC1686 9  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 detail in the IB. MLN2238 is predicted to have very low CLb (0.0045 L/hr/kg) and a 
moderate Vss,b (0.79 L/kg) with a long terminal t 1/2 (> 24 hours) in humans.  The human 
efficacious IV dose of MLN2238 is predicted to be 2.0 mg/m2 (0.054 mg/kg) twice weekly. 
The human efficacious oral dose is predicted to be between 2 and 5 mg/m2 twice weekly, 
based on a predicted oral F of between 41% (as seen  in rats) and 100% (as seen in dogs).  The 
efficacious dose projection for once weekly oral wo uld be higher than twice weekly oral (data 
not provided). 
 Metabolism appears to be a major route of elim ination for MLN2238 and urinary excretion of 
the parent drug was negligible (< 5% of dose) .  In vitro in liver microsomes, the metabolism 
of MLN2238 was high in mice and low to modera te in all other species studied.  MLN2238 is 
metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes and non-CYP enzymes and 
proteins.    
In a Caco-2 cell assay, MLN2238 showed medium permeability with a B-to-A/A-to-B 
permeability ratio of 2.9.  MLN2238 may be a low- affinity substrate of para-glycoprotein (P-
gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) efflux pump transporters.  MLN2238 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 (IC50 > 
100 μM).  Consequently, the potential for MLN2238 to cause DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is low.    See the IB for further details.  Safety Pharmacology : In exploratory safety pharmacology studies, MLN2238 was a weak 
inhibitor of the cloned cardiac potassium (K+) human ether à-go-g o related gene (hERG) 
channel, with an IC50 of 59.6 μM, which exceeds, by approximately 200-fold, the plasma 
Cmax (111 ng/mL [0.3 μM]) predicted to occur in humans  at the optimally efficacious dose 
after IV administration.  In the GLP-compliant, 1-cycle, repeat-dose, PO  toxicology study in beagle dogs, an increase 
in QTc was seen in male dogs at non-tolerated doses, and a potential increase in QTc was seen in male dogs at tolerated doses.  However,  increased QTc was not seen in female dogs at 
any dose, despite the fact that female dogs ha d plasma Cmax values similar to those of male 
dogs.  Additionally, in a GLP-compliant, 2-cycle, repeat-dose, IV toxicology study in beagle 
dogs, no increase in QTc was seen in either male or female dogs at any dose, even though dogs in the IV study had higher MLN2238 plasma Cmax values than did the male dogs in the 
PO study.  These data suggest that MLN2238  has a low potential for prolonging the QT 
interval in vivo. 
 Toxicology : All studies discussed in this section were  conducted with a solution of either 
MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with ixazomib citrate.  Because ixazomib citrate was 
shown to dissociate immediately to MLN2238 upon  exposure to plasma in vitro and therefore 
could not be detected in plasma samples in vitro all doses, concentrations, and PK parameters 
noted, here and in the IB, are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238 (ixazomib).  The toxicology studies of MLN2238 were studied in SCID mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs,  and cynomolgus m onkeys.  Details of 
these studies are included in the IB.  In Vitro Toxicology: MLN2238 was not mutagenic in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay).  
MC1686 10  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020  
In Vivo Toxicology: Details of the in vivo toxicology IV dosing and oral dosing studies are provided in the IB.  To summarize, the toxicologic effects seen in the IV and PO studies are 
qualitatively similar to what was previously observed in rodents dosed with bortezomib.  
MLN2238 did not cause significant toxicities that have not been previously observed after dosing with bortezomib.  Therefore, on the basis of the similarity in the toxicity profile in rats 
between MLN22338 and bortezomib, MLN2238 is  not known to present any additional 
safety risks beyond those that occur after treatment  with bortezomib.  In addition, there were 
no significant findings at tolerated exposures in dogs observed after PO administration that 
were not seen after IV administration, and similar exposures were tolerated regardless of the 
route of administration.  The potential risks identified from nonclinical studies in dogs and rats include: 
• GI toxicity that could result in nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte 
imbalance, bleeding, bowel obstruction including ileus and intussusception, and 
sepsis. 
• Reduced blood counts manifest as thromboc ytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia.  
Reticulocytopenia was described in animals and may be associated with anemia.  Reductions in blood counts may predispose to an increased susceptibility to infection, 
bleeding, and anemia. 
• Peripheral nerve ganglia effects that may be associated with peripheral neuropathy that includes pain, burning sensation, and numbness.  Autonomic and motor 
neuropathy may be observed, as both have been reported for bortezomib. 
• Lymphoid cell depletion that may be associa ted with increased risk of infection, 
including re-activation of herpes zoster. 
• Acute phase response that may result in fever and metabolic changes. 
 
All of the effects seen in the GLP-compliant PO  toxicology studies in both dogs and rats at 
tolerated doses were reversible/reversing and can  be monitored in the clinic with routine 
clinical observations (GI disturbances and in fections secondary to lymphoid compromise), 
clinical pathology assessments (inhibition of  erythropoiesis, th rombocytopenia, and 
inflammatory leukogram), and neurologic assessment, as are commonly done for patients 
treated with bortezomib.  The neurologic lesions  in these studies are similar to what has been 
described after treatment with bortezomib and are believed to be the cause of the peripheral 
neuropathy observed in patients treated with bortezomib.

Clinical Experience with ixazomib 
Ixazomib has been studied in several phase 1 and phase 1/2 studies evaluating both twice-
weekly and weekly dosing schedules.  Ixazomib as an intravenous and oral formulation. 
Regardless of the route of administration in the twice-weekly dosing schedule, ixazomib is 
given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle; in the weekly dosing schedule, the drug is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. To date, the development of oral ixazomib has focused on multiple myeloma [relapsed and/ or refractory and newly diagnosed] and a 
different yet related plasma cell dyscrasia, systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. A clinical 
pharmacology study looking at drug-drug interac tions, the effect of food, and bioavailability 
also uses the oral formulation. Details of these trials can be found in ClinicalTrials.gov and 
the ixazomib IB
.   
MC1686 11  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism: After or al dosing, absorption of ixazomib is rapid 
with a median first time to maximum ob served plasma concentration (Tmax) of 
approximately 1 hour postdose. The plasma exposure (AUC) of ixazomib increases in a dose-
proportional manner over a dose range of 0.2 to  10.6 mg based on population PK analysis. 
The absolute oral bioavailability (F) of ixazomi b is estimated to be 58% based on population 
PK analysis.  A high-fat meal reduced ixazomib Cmax by 69% and AUC0-216 by 28%.  This 
indicates that a high-fat meal decreases both the rate and extent of absorption of ixazomib. 
Therefore, ixazomib should be dosed at least  2 hours after food or 1 hour before food. 
The steady-state volume of distribution of ixazomib is large and is estimated to be 543 L based on a population PK model. Based on in vitro plasma protein binding measurements on 
samples from clinical studies (Studies C16015 and C16018), ixazomib is highly bound to 
plasma proteins (99%). Ixazomib concentrations are higher in whole blood than in plasma, indicating extensive partitioning of ixazomib into red blood cells, which are known to contain 
high concentrations of the 20S proteasome. 
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for ixazomib. In vitro studies 
indicate that ixazomib is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) and non-CYP proteins. At concentrations exceeding those observed clinically (10 µM), ixazomib was metabolized by multiple CYP isoforms with estim ated relative contributio ns of 3A4 (42.3%), 
1A2 (26.1%), 2B6 (16.0%), 2C8 (6.0%), 2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 (4.8%), and 2C9 (<1%). At 0.1 
and 0.5 µM substrate concentrations, which are cl oser to clinical concentrations of ixazomib 
following oral administration of 4 mg ixazo mib, non-CYP mediated clearance was observed 
and seemed to play a major role in ixazomib clearan ce in vitro.  These data indicate that at 
clinically relevant concentrations of ixazomi b, non-CYP proteins contribute to the clearance 
of ixazomib and no specific CYP isozyme pred ominantly contributes to the clearance of 
ixazomib. Therefore, at clinically relevant concentrations of ixazomib, minimal CYP-
mediated DDIs with a selective CYP inhibitor would be expected. 
Ixazomib is neither a time-dependent inhibitor nor  a reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5.  Ixazomib did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5 
activity or corresponding immunoreactive protein levels. Thus, the potential for ixazomib to 
produce DDIs via CYP isozyme induction or inhibition is low. 
Ixazomib is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2 and OATPs. Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, 
BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
Ixazomib is unlikely to cause or be susceptible to clinical DDIs with substrates or inhibitors of 
clinically relevant drug transporters. 
The geometric mean terminal half-life (t1/2) of  ixazomib is 9.5 days based on population PK 
analysis. For both IV and oral dosing, there is an approximately average 3-fold accumulation 
(based on AUC) following the Day 11 dose for the twice-weekly schedule and a 2-fold 
accumulation (based on AUC) following the Day 15 dose for the once-weekly schedule. 
Mean plasma clearance (CL) of ixazomib is 1. 86 L/hr based on the results of a population PK 
analysis. Taken together with the blood-to-pla sma AUC ratio of approximately 10, it can be 
inferred that ixazomib is a low clearance drug. Using the absolute oral bioavailability (F) 
estimate of 58% (also from a population PK model), this translates to an apparent oral plasma 
clearance (CL/F) of 3.21 L/hr. The geometric mean renal clearance for ixazomib is 
0.119 L/hr, which is 3.7% of CL/F and 6.4% of CL estimated in a population PK analysis. 
MC1686 12  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 Therefore, renal clearance does not meaningfully  contribute to ixazomib clearance in humans. 
Approximately 62% of the administered radioactivity in the ADME study (Study C16016) 
was recovered in the urine and 22% of the tota l radioactivity was recovered in the feces after 
oral administration. Only 3.2% of the admini stered ixazomib dose was recovered in the urine 
as unchanged ixazomib up to 168 hours after oral dosing, suggesting that most of the total 
radioactivity in urine was attributable to metabolites.  
The PK of ixazomib was similar with and with out co-administration of clarithromycin, a 
strong CYP3A inhibitor, and hence no dose adjustment is necessary when ixazomib is 
administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Consistently, in a population PK analysis, 
co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors  did not affect ixazomib clearance. Therefore, 
no dose adjustment is required for patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP1A2.  Based on information from the clinical rifampin DDI study, ixazomib Cmax and AUC0-last were 
reduced in the presence of rifampin by approxima tely 54% and 74%, respectively. Therefore, 
the co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib is not recommended.  
Mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 30 mL/min) did not alter the PK of ixazomib 
based on the results from a population PK analysis. As a result, no dose adjustment is required 
for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  In a dedicated renal impairment study (C16015), unbound AUC0-last was 38% higher in pa tients with severe renal impairment or 
ESRD patients requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal function.  Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is appropriate in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis.  Pre- and post-dialyzer concentrations of ixazomib 
measured during the hemodialysis session were similar, suggesting that ixazomib is not 
readily dialyzable, consistent with its high plasma protein binding (99%). 
The PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with  normal hepatic function and in patients with 
mild hepatic impairment, as defined by the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction 
Working Group (total bilirubin <1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), based on the 
results from a population PK analysis. Conse quently, no dose adjustment is required for 
patients with mild hepatic impairment. In a de dicated PK study in patients with moderate 
(total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times the ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3 times the ULN) hepatic impairment (Study C16018), unbound dose-normalized AUC0-last was 27% higher in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as comp ared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. Therefore, a reduced starting do se of ixazomib is appropriate in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
There was no statistically significant effect of age (23-91 years), sex, body surface area 
(1.2-2.7 m2), or race on the clearance of ix azomib based on the results from a population PK 
analysis.
   
Overview of the Oral Formulation of ixazomib 
The safety profile indicates that oral ixazomib is generally well tolerated with predominant 
toxicities largely reversible, able to be mon itored by routine clinical examinations and 
manageable by dose reductions, discontinuati on, or standard supportive care. From 
experience from phase 1 through 2 studies the major toxicities can be managed to allow 
repeat treatment cycles over periods extending beyond 24 months.  
Relapsed MM: Single-agent, Weekly ixazomib (Study C16004):13  
MC1686 13  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 Study C16004 is an open-label, dose-escalati on, phase 1 study of ixazomib administered 
weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle in adult patients with RRMM. Patients with 
MM enrolled in the dose-escalation component of the study have relapsed following at least 2 
lines of therapy, which must have included bortezomib, thalidomide (or lenalidomide), and 
corticosteroids. In this study, 2 of 3 patient s experienced protocol-defined DLTs (Grade 3 
rash and Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea)  at a dose of 3.95 mg/m2. As per protocol, 
subsequent patients were treated at 1 dose le vel below (2.97mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients 
experienced a DLT (Grade 3 nausea, vomiting,  and diarrhea). The MTD of weekly oral 
ixazomib was determined to be 2.97 mg/m2.  
Once the MTD was established, cohorts of pa tients representing the he terogeneous patient 
population currently seen in clinical practice were enrolled in order to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of oral ixazomib and included:  
1. Relapsed and Refractory expansion cohor t [refractory is defined as disease progression 
while on therapy or within 60 days after the last dose of therapy]; 
2. Carfilzomib expansion cohort 3. Proteasome Inhibitor-Naïve expansion cohort 4. VELCADE-Relapsed expansion cohort 
 
Sixty patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled. The MTD was determined to be 2.97 mg/m
2. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea in 2 patients, and grade 3 skin rash in 1 patient. Common drug-related adverse 
events were thrombocytopenia (43%), diarrh ea (38%), nausea (38%), fatigue (37%), and 
vomiting (35%). The observed rate of peripheral neuropathy was 20%, with only 1 grade 3 
event reported. Nine (18%) patients achieved a partial response or better, including 8 of 30 
(27%) evaluable patients treated at the MTD.  Pharmacokinetic studies suggested a long 
terminal half-life of 3.6 to 11.3 days, supporting once-weekly dosing.  
 Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma  (C16005):  
14 
In Study C16005, ixazomib is given weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), in combination with lenalidomide (Days 1-21), and dexamethasone (D ays 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28-day cycle.
15 
Patients with newly diagnosed MM were enrolled and treated with oral ixazomib (days 1, 8, and 15) plus lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1-21) and dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to twelve 28-day cycles, then mainte nance therapy with ixazomib (same schedule) 
every 28 days until progression. Patients were a llowed to undergo stem cell collection after 3 
cycles and discontinue for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) after 6 cycles. Overall, 65 
patients were enrolled, 15 in Phase 1 and 50 in Phase 2. Patients received a median of 6 
cycles (range 1-19) with 27 (42%) remaining on treatment as of November 2012. Of those who have undergone stem cell mobilization, a median yield was 11.3 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/Kg 
(range 5-28). ixazomib MTD was established as 2.97 mg/m2 and RP2D was selected as 2.23 
mg/m2; RP2D translates to a 4.0 mg fixed dose based on population PK results. Among the 
64 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 92%, including 55% VGPR and 23% CR (Figure 3 below).  Median time to first r esponse was 0.92 months (range 0.89-6.44).

1.4 Lenalidomide in myeloma  
 Lenalidomide has significant activity in the setting of multiple myeloma; both in relapsed and in 
newly diagnosed disease. Initial phase I/II study of lenalidomide in relapsed myeloma determined 
the ideal dose to be 25 mg once daily given for 3 of 4 weeks.16 The initial trial in the relapsed 
disease also demonstrated increased activity in co mbination with pulsed doses of dexamethasone. 
These findings led to the initial trials of the co mbination in newly diagnosed disease as well as 
randomized trials of the combination in relapsed myeloma.17 In the phase III trials of 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone, the combinati on was demonstrated to be superior to 
dexamethasone in terms of response rate s and progression free and overall survival.18 The initial 
phase II study of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed myeloma, conducted at 
the Mayo Clinic, also employed the combination of lenalidomide and pulsed dose dexamethasone 
(40 mg daily on four days on four days off schedule) for the first four cycles followed by 40 mg 
weekly for the subsequent cycles. The phase II st udy demonstrated significant response rates and 
long term follow up demonstrated sustained respon ses and 1-year survival rates of over 90%. The 
subsequent phase III trial in the ECOG (E4A03) compared the same dosing strategy to one that 
employed a lower dose of dexamethasone (40 mg  weekly) right from the start of therapy.18 The 
results of the trial demonstrated a superior overall survival for the lower dose dexamethasone 
arm. 
 
 1.5 Daratumumab in myeloma 
Daratumumab is a human IgG1 ĸ monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to a 
unique epitope on CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein. It is a targeted immunotherapy directed 
towards tumor cells that express high levels of CD38, such as plasma cells from patients with 
multiple myeloma. This target is distinct from those of other approved agents for multiple myeloma therapy. Daratumumab is currently appr oved for treatment of relapsed myeloma, that 
are refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD. It is not approved for initial therapy of myeloma, and hence considered investigational for the current trial.

cytotoxicity (CDC) occurs rapidly and demonstrates maximal myeloma cell killing by 
daratumumab within 1 hour of antibody-mediate d activation of the complement proteins. 
Daratumumab-induced antibody-dependent cell-mediat ed cytotoxicity (ADCC) is slower in its 
action, with maximal ADCC by daratumumab observed at 4 hours in vitro. Daratumumab has also been shown to induce antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) in the presence of 
macrophages within 4 hours in vitro. The precise role  of some or all of these effector functions in 
reducing tumor burden in patients is unknown. In toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys and 
chimpanzees, the major observed toxic ities were cytokine release syndrome and 
thrombocytopenia. A minor decrease in red blood pa rameters was also observed. Cytokine release 
was seen only following the first dose and was markedly reduced following implementation of a 
10-mg predose of daratumumab. The effect on platelets and red blood cells was reversible. 
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clin ical information as well as Reference Safety 
Information regarding daratumumab, refer to the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure 
(Daratumumab IB).  
Clinical studies with daratumumab 
 
Single agent studies: Two large single agent studies have been reported to date; GEN501 and 
MMY2002. In the GEN501 study, daratumumab was administered at doses of 0.005 to 24 mg per kilogram of body weight during the dose escalation phase.
19 No maximum tolerated dose was 
identified. In the dose-expansion phase, 30 patient s received 8 mg per kilogram of daratumumab 
and 42 received 16 mg per kilogram, administered once weekly (8 doses), twice monthly (8 doses), and monthly for up to 24 months. In the e xpansion phase, the median time since diagnosis 
was 5.7 years. Patients had received a median of four prior treatments; 79% of the patients had 
disease that was refractory to the last therapy received (64% had disease refractory to proteasome 
inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs and 64% had disease refractory to bortezomib and 
lenalidomide), and 76% had received autologous st em-cell transplants. Infusion-related reactions 
were mild (71% of patients had an event of any gr ade, and 1% had an event of grade 3), with no 
dose-dependent adverse events. The most co mmon adverse events of grade 3 or 4 (in ≥5% of 
patients) were pneumonia and thrombocytopenia.  The overall response rate was 36% in the 
cohort that received 16 mg per kilogram (15 patient s had a partial response or better, including 2 
with a complete response and 2 with a very goo d partial response) and 10% in the cohort that 
received 8 mg per kilogram (3 had a partial r esponse). In the cohort that received 16 mg per 
kilogram, the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 
4.2 to 8.1), and 65% (95% CI, 28 to 86) of the patients who had a response did not have 
progression at 12 months. 
 In the MMY2002 study, patients with multiple myeloma who were previously treated with at least three lines of therapy (including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs), or were refractory to both proteasome inhibitors  and immunomodulatory drugs, were randomized to 
receive intravenous daratumumab 8 mg/kg or 16 mg/kg in in the initial part of the study.
20 
Patients received 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, or 16 mg/kg per week for 8 weeks (cycles 1 and 2), then every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (cycles 3–6), and then every 4 weeks thereafter (cycle 7 and higher). In the second part of the study, the dose of 16 mg/kg was taken forward. One-hundred-six patients with a median of five previous lines of therapy (range 2–14) were treated at the 16-mg/kg dose. 85 (80%) patients had previously r eceived autologous stem cell transplantation, 101 
(95%) were refractory to the most recent proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs used, and 103 (97%) were refractory to the last lin e of therapy. Overall, responses were seen in 31 
patients (29·2%,)—three (2·8%) with a stringent CR, ten (9·4%) with a VGPR, and 18 (17·0) with a PR. Median duration of response was 7·4 months (95% CI 5·5–not estimable) and 
MC1686 16  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 progression-free survival was 3·7 months and the 12-month overall survival was 64·8%. 
Daratumumab was well tolerated; fatigue (40% ) and anemia (33%) were the most common 
adverse events.  
 
Daratumumab-lenalidomide combinations: Preclin ically, using bone marrow mononuclear cells 
from patients with multiple myeloma, increased killing of tumor cells was demonstrated when daratumumab was combined with lenalidomide as compared with that of either agent alone.  In an open-label phase 1/2 study DARA 2-16 mg/kg was combined with standard dose of 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone, leading to a recommended phase 2 dose of daratumumab 16 
mg/kg along with lenalidomide 25 mg days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly. 
Daratumumab 16 mg/kg was administered weekly during the first two 28-day cycles, every other 
week during Cycles 3 through 6, and monthly in Cycle 7 and beyond until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. LEN 25 mg was administered orally on Days 1 through 21 of each cycle, 
and DEX 40 mg was given weekly. Thirty two patie nts with median of 2 prior lines of therapy 
were enrolled. 
The most common (>25%) TEAEs included neutropenia (81%), muscle spasms (44%), cough (38%), diarrhea (34%), fatigue and hypertension (28% each). Eighteen (56%) patients had IRRs 
and these were generally mild to moderate and occurred mostly during the first cycle. IRRs 
included cough (25%), allergic rhinitis, nau sea, and vomiting (9% each), as well as dyspnea, 
nasal congestion, and hypertension (6% each). Th e overall response rate was 88%, with 11 (34%) 
partial responses and 17 (53%) ≥very good partial responses (VGPRs) that included 7 (22%) 
stringent complete responses, 1 (3%) complete  response, and 9 (28%) VGPRs. The median time 
to first and best response was 1 month and 4.5 mont hs, respectively. Results of this study confirm 
the efficacy of combining daratumumab with le nalidomide and dexamethasone. A large phase 3 
trial of Daratumumab and Rd versus Rd has completed accrual.  
1.6 Rationale for the current trial: Ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
results in high response rates and deep responses in  patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. It is 
well tolerated and patients are able to stay on it long term as a maintenance therapy. More 
recently, addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone has resulted in significant 
activity in relapsed myeloma. The combination of the ixazomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab and 
dexamethasone presents the potential to further enhance the response to therapy with four 
different drug classes with no significant overlapping toxicities. We hypothesize that this 
combination will lead to deep response includi ng a higher proportion of MRD negative disease 
that will translate into longe r survival in these patients. 
 
Rationale for Arm B:  Long term therapy with dexamethasone  is associated with various side 
effects including osteoporosis, adrenal suppr ession, muscle weakness, and increased risk of 
opportunistic infections. Given the efficacy of th e daratumumab, ixazomib and lenalidomide, it is 
likely we will be able to decrease the dexameth asone doses and potentially eliminate it after the 
initial cycles. We will add a similar cohort of pa tients and treat them with dexamethasone only 
for the first two cycles of treatment and then discontinue. The endpoints of the trial will not be altered.

7.2 Ixazomib  
• Patients should be instructed to swallow ixazomib capsules whole, with water, and not to break, chew, or open the capsules. Ixazomib should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after food. Each capsule should be swallowed separately with a sip of wate r. A total of approximately 8 ounces (240 
mL) of water should be taken with the capsules.  
• Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers if the next scheduled dose is 72 hours or more away. A double do se should not be taken to make up for a 
missed dose. If the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose 
• Procedures for ixazomib dose reductions and delays are summarized in Section 8.2, along with the criteria that must be met for retreatment with study drug. If a dose is missed due to toxicity, the dose will not be made up. 
• Oral ixazomib is supplied by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. See Section 15.1 for details on ixazomib description, formulation, storage, and accountability.

crush or chew capsules. Missed doses will not be made up. 
• Procedures for dose reductions and delays are summarized in Section 8.3. 
• Lenalidomide is commercially obtained.  
7.4 Daratumumab 
• Subjects will receive daratumumab intravenously weekly for 8 weeks, then every 
other week for 16 weeks and then every 4 weeks. 
• Each subject’s dose will be calculated based on the subject’s weight rounded to the 
nearest kilogram. There is no cap on the absolute dose allowed, as long as the dose does not exceed 16 mg/kg. If a subject’s weight changes by more than 10% from baseline, the dose of daratumumab will be re-calculated. 
• Vital signs should be monitored extensively on Cycle 1 Day 1 before, during, and after the first infusion of daratumumab. For all other infusions, vital signs should be measured immediately before the start of infusion and at the end of the infusion. 
• Missed doses will not be made up. Pro cedures for dose reductions and delays are 
summarized in Section 8.5. 
• There are no planned dose reductions. • Daratumumab is provided by Janssen. See Section 15.4 for details on daratumumab 
description, formulation, storage, and accountability. 
 
As of amendment 12: In the event patient is unable to come to  the enrolling site for daratumumab infusion 
due to extenuating circumstances, commercial drug can be used for administration at a facility accessible to the patient. In that event, the treating investigator will work 
closely with the external provider to ensu re safe and appropriate delivery of the 
planned dose. This instance will have to be reported to the IRB as a deviation. 
 • Daratumumab administration: See table below for general infusion guidelines. If 
patients tolerate the first 3 infusions, co nsideration can be given for a 90 minute 
infusion as per institutional guidelines. Refer to section 9 for prophylaxis  and

7.5 Dexamethasone (Cycles 1-12 for Arm A / Cycles 1 and 2 only for Arm B) 
• Dexamethasone may be self-administered by  the subject on an outpatient basis. 
• Arm A : 
Dexamethasone may be permanently discontinued after 12 cycles at the treating 
physician’s discretion or sooner if needed to manage toxicity related to dexamethasone. 
 
Arm B: Dexamethasone will be discontinued after 2 cycles or sooner if needed to manage 
toxicity related to dexamethasone. Dexamethasone as part of infusion reaction prophylaxis may continue. 
• Missed doses of dexamethasone will not be  made up. Procedures for dose reductions 
and delays are summarized in Section 8.2. 
• Dexamethasone is commercially available.  Accurate records will be kept in the 
source documents of all drug administra tion (including dispensing and dosing).  
7.6 Treatment at enrolling institution:  
For this protocol, the patient must return to the consenting institution for daratumumab 
infusions as per treatment schedule and for evaluation prior to each cycle. Treatment by a local medical doctor (LMD) is not allowed As of amendment 12 : Exception noted 
above in 7.4.  As of amendment 12:  The patient must return to the consenting institution for ixazomib evaluation at least 
every third cycle, provided the drug can be sent to the patient and necessary interval 
evaluations as required by the protocol can be completed remotely or through local 
healthcare facilities.   
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events   
Strictly follow the modifications in this table for the first two cycles, until individual treatment 
tolerance can be ascertained. Individual drugs can be dose reduced as per the table below 
depending on the adverse event attribution. If the toxicity is attributable to one drug, only that needs to be dose reduced. If overlapping toxicities are observed, the dose reductions can be alternated between the suspected drugs, starting w ith the drug most likely related to the adverse 
event. Thereafter, these modifications should be  regarded as guidelines to limit to mild-to-
moderate, but not debilitating, side effects. If mu ltiple adverse events are seen, administer dose 
based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed.  Reductions apply to 
treatment given in the preceding cycle and are based on adverse events observed since the prior dose.  
 NOTE: If ixazomib, lenalidomide or daratumuma b is discontinued, the patient can continue 
on the other drugs, unless specified otherwis e in the dose modification tables. If all 
three are discontinued, the patient will go to event monitoring (Section 4.2).

   8.11  Instruction for initiation of a new cycle of therapy or restarting therapy after 
interruption during a cycle for toxicities 
       A new cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: 
• The ANC is ≥1000/μL 
• The platelet count is ≥ 75,000/μL  
• Any other non-hematologic treatment -re lated adverse event that may have 
occurred has resolved to ≤Grade 1 or baseline severity. 
 
   If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated 
weekly and a new cycle of therapy will be held until the toxicity has resolved as described above. 
       If any drug dosing was halted during the pr evious cycle and was restarted with a one-
level dose reduction without requiring an inte rruption for the remainder of the cycle, 
then that reduced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 of the new cycle. 
       If any drug dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle or if the new 
cycle is held due to known hematologic toxicity newly encountered on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one-level dose reduction. If a new cycle of therapy cannot be restarted within 4 weeks of the scheduled Day 1 due to non-resolution of drug related toxicities, the patient will be removed from protocol therapy and will go to event monitoring.

8.5  Daratumumab Dose Modification 
Dose modification of daratumumab is not permitted, but dose delay is the primary 
method for managing daratumumab-related toxicities. The attribution of the toxicity to individual drug (s) will be performed by the treating physician. 
 
8.51 Daratumumab-Related Toxicity Management 
Refer to Section 9.9i for details on ma nagement of infusion-related reactions. 
ONLY if any of the following criteria are met and the event cannot be ascribed to 
the other drugs, the daratumumab infusion must be omitted to allow for recovery from toxicity. The criteria for a dose omit are: • Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
• Grade 4 neutropenia, if this is the second occurrence despite growth factor support 
• Febrile neutropenia of any grade 
• Neutropenia with infection, of any grade 
• Grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicities with the following exceptions: o Grade 3 nausea that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days 
o Grade 3 vomiting that responds to an tiemetic treatment within 7 days 
o Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to anti diarrheal treatment within 7 days 
o Grade 3 fatigue that was present at basel ine or that lasts for <7 days after 
the last administration of daratumumab 
o Grade 3 asthenia that was present at baseline or that lasts for <7 days after the last administration of daratumumab 
If a daratumumab administration does no t commence within the prespecified 
window (Table) of the scheduled administration date, then the dose will be considered a missed dose. Administration may resume at the next planned dosing date.

MC1686 36  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 A missed dose will not be made up. Doses of daratu mumab may be delayed up to 4 weeks. If a dose is 
delayed, then the dates of the subsequent doses must be adjusted. Any adverse event deemed to be related 
to daratumumab and unrelated to lenalidomide, ixazo mib or dexamethasone that requires a dose hold of 
more than 4 weeks will result in permanent discontinuation of daratumumab.  
9.0 Ancillary Treatm ent/Supportive Care 
9.1 Oral hydration 
  Patients are encouraged to drink at least 6 to 8 cups of liquid per day. 
 
9.2 Disallowed concurrent treatment 
  The following treatments are not permitted during the trial: 
  •  Any other investigational treatment  
  •  Any other systemic anti-neoplastic th erapy including, but not limited to, 
immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or  monoclonal antibody therapy. 
  •  Any external beam radiotherapy 
Platelet transfusions to help patients meet elig ibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days  
prior to study drug dosing for any dosing day 
 
9.3 Nausea and/or vomiting 
  Standard anti-emetics including 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 serotonin receptor antagonists are 
recommended for emesis if it occurs once treat ment is initiated; prophylactic anti-emetics 
may also be considered at the physician’ s discretion. Dexamethasone should not be 
administered as an anti-emetic. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study 
drug and during treatment. 
 
9.4 Blood products and growth factors 
  Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and 
following institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth factors should follow published guidelines of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 24, No 18 (June 20), 2006: pp. 2932-2947. 
     Interference with Serological Testing:  Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells 
(RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh 
blood type are not impacted. Notify blood tran sfusion centers of this interference with 
serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received Daratumumab. Type and screen patients prior to starting Daratumumab. 
  
9.5 Diarrhea 
  Diarrhea should be managed according to clinical practice, including the administration 
of antidiarrheals such as loperamide once in fectious causes are excluded. Fluid intake 
should be maintained to avoid dehydration.  Fluid deficit should be corrected before 
MC1686 37  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 initiation of treatment and during treatment. Additional doses of loperamide at 2 mg 
every 2-4 hours until diarrhea free (maximum 16 mg/day). 
  In the event of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed: 
hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals. 
  If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous re hydration) and/or associated with fever or 
severe neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4), broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed. Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospitalized  for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte 
imbalances. 
  Please monitor patients carefully for development of ileus.   
9.6  Renal failure and Ixazomib 
  Two cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients treated at or above the 
MTD for intravenous ixazomib (see Section 1. 4.3). Volume depletion should be corrected 
before initiation of study drug. Until further information is available, intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs immediately prior to the administration of ixazomib should be discouraged and requires consultation with the principal investigator. All necessary supportive care consistent with optimal patient care shall be available to patients as necessary. 
 
9.7 Herpes Zoster prophylaxis 
  Patients may be at an increased risk of infection including reactivation of herpes zoster 
and herpes simplex viruses. Prophylaxis with acyclovir 400 mg PO BID is should be used while on study therapy and for 3 months beyond the end of therapy. 
 
9.8 Prohibited medications 
9.81 Prohibited enzyme inducers 
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should be avoided, unless there is no appr opriate alternative medication for the 
patient’s use. (Rationale: If there were to be a drug-drug interaction with an inducer, ixazomib exposure would be decreased)  
Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, and phenobarbital.  
9.82 Excluded foods and dietary supplements include St. John’s wort.  
9.9a Erythematous Rash with or without Pruritus 
Rash with or without pruritus has been re ported with ixazomib, primarily at the higher 
doses tested and when given with agents where rash is an overlapping toxicity. The rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that 
may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, to a more generalized eruption that is predominately on the trunk or extremities. Rash has been most commonly characterized as maculopapular or macular. To  date, when it does occur, rash is most 
commonly reported within the first 3 cycles of therapy. The rash is often transient, self-
MC1686 38  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 limiting, and is typically Grade 1 to 2 in  severity. Rash can also be seen with 
lenalidomide, and usually responds to dose interruption and dose decrease.  
   
  Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topical) have 
been successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylac tically in subsequent 
cycles. The use of a topical, IV, or oral steroid (e.g., prednisone ≤10 mg per day or 
equivalent) is permitted. Ma nagement of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous 
antihistamines or corticosteroids. Admini stration of ixazomib (and/or other causative 
agent if given in combination) should be modified per protocol and re-initiated at a reduced level from where rash w as noted (also, per protocol). 
   In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or 
any SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a patient has previously devel oped a rash (e.g., using a thick, alcohol-free 
emollient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topical antihistamines). A rare risk is 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe and potentially life-threatening rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which should be  managed symptomatically according to 
standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are encouraged 
at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
9.9b Thrombocytopenia 
  Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been manageable with platelet tr ansfusions according to standard clinical 
practice. Ixazomib and lenalidomide administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when thrombocytopenia occurs (see Section 8). Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon recovery of platelet counts. A rare risk is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare blood disorder where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body characterized by thrombocytopenia, petechiae, fever, or po ssibly more serious signs and symptoms. TTP 
should be managed symptomatically accord ing to standard medical practice. 
  
9.9c Neutropenia 
  Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered according to standard clinical practice. Ixazomib administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when neutropenia occurs (see Section 8). Therapy can be reinitiated at  a reduced level upon recovery of ANCs. 
 
9.9d Fluid Deficit 
  Vitals should be assessed prior to start of each cycle as per Table 4.1. Dehydration should 
be avoided since ixazomib may cause vomiting,  diarrhea, and dehydration. Patients 
should be encouraged to maintain adequate fluid intake. Acute renal failure has been 
reported in patients treated with ixazomib, commonly in the setting of the previously 
MC1686 39  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 noted gastrointestinal toxicities and dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corrected before 
initiation of study drug and as needed dur ing treatment to avoid dehydration. 
 
9.9e Hypotension 
  Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic hypot ension with or without syncope have been 
reported with ixazomib. Blood pressure should be  closely monitored while the patient is 
on study treatment and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the 
setting of concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either 
hypo- or hypertension) should be managed according to standard clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustment s of their concomitant medications during 
the course of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study drug and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
 
9.9f Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
  One case of posterior reversible encepha lopathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved, 
has been reported with ixazomib. This cond ition is characterized by headache, seizures 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in  blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed 
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or suspected, 
symptom-directed treatment should be mainta ined until the condition is reversed by 
control of hypertension or other instigating factors. 
 
9.9g Transverse Myelitis 
  Transverse myelitis has also been reported with ixazomib. It is not known if ixazomib 
causes transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib, the possibility that ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be excluded. 
 
9.9h Guidelines for Prevention of Infusion Reactions 
Pre-infusion Medication: On daratumumab infusion days, subjects will receive the 
following medications prior to infusion: 
• Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 650-1000 mg IV  or orally (PO) approximately 1 
hour or less prior to daratumumab infusion 
• An antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg IV or PO, or equivalent) 
approximately 1 hour (or less) prior to infusion 
• Dexamethasone 40 mg IV or PO (only if IV is not available), approximately 1 
hour or less prior to daratumumab infusion. On days when subjects receive this dose of dexamethasone in the clinic, de xamethasone will not be self-administered 
at home. 
 Post-infusion Medication: For subjects with higher risk of respiratory complications (ie, 
subjects who have a FEV1 <80%), the follo wing postinfusion medications should be 
considered: 
• Antihistamine (diphenhydramine or equivalent) 
MC1686 40  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 • Dexamethasone 4 mg day after infusion 
• Short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist such as salbutamol aerosol 
• Control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled corticosteroids ± long-acting β2 
adrenergic receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long-acting 
bronchodilators such as tiotropium or salbumatol ± inhaled corticosteroids for 
subjects with COPD) 
   
In addition, these at-risk subjects may be hos pitalized for monitoring for up to 2 nights 
after an infusion. If subjects are hospitalized , then their FEV1 should be measured before 
discharge. If these subjects are not hospitalized, then a follow up telephone call should be made to monitor their condition within 48 hours after all infusions. If the subject has not experienced a significant medical event but is hospitalized overnight only for observation, then the hospitalization should no t be reported as a serious adverse event. 
Investigators may prescribe bronchodilators, antih istamines, and corticosteroids that are 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care in the event a bronchospasm 
occurs after subjects are released from the hospital/clinic.   
9.9i  Management of In fusion-related Reactions 
Subjects should be carefully observed during daratumumab infusions. Trained study staff 
at the clinic should be prepared to interven e in case of any infusion reactions occurring, 
and resources necessary for resuscitation must be available at the bedside. 
 
If an infusion-related reaction develops, th en the infusion should be temporarily 
interrupted or slowed down. Subjects who experience adverse events during the infusion must be treated according to the investigator ’s judgment and best clinical practice. The 
following guidelines may apply: 
• Subjects should be treated with acetaminophen, antihistamine, or  corticosteroids. 
Intravenous saline may be indicated. For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, subjects may require antihistamines, oxygen,  corticosteroids, or bronchodilators. 
For hypotension, subjects may require vasopressors. 
• In the event of a life-threatening infu sion-related reaction (which may include 
pulmonary or cardiac events), or anaphylactic reaction, daratumumab should be discontinued and no additional daratumu mab should be administered to the 
subject. Aggressive symptomatic treatment should be applied. 
• If an infusion is paused or the infusion rate is decreased, then a longer-than-
anticipated infusion time may occur. Over night stays at the hospital because of 
slow infusion times should not be reported as a serious adverse event. However, if the underlying cause of the delayed infusion time is an adverse event or serious adverse event, then that should be reported as such. 
  
Infusion-Related Events of Grade 1 or Grade 2: If the investigator assesses an 
adverse event to be related to the daratu mumab infusion, then the infusion should be 
paused. When the subject’s condition is stable, the infusion may be restarted at the investigator’s discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of that used before the interruption. Subsequently, th e infusion rate may be increased at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
MC1686 41  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 If the subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher event of laryngeal edema or a Grade 2 
or higher event of bronchospasm that does not respond to systemic therapy and does 
not resolve within 6 hours from the onset, then the subject must be withdrawn from 
treatment. 
 
Infusion-Related Reactions of Grade 3 or Hi gher: For infusion-related adverse events 
that are Grade 4, the infusion should be  stopped and treatment with daratumumab 
will be discontinued for that subject. For infusion-related adverse events that are Grade 3, the daratumumab infusion must be stopped, and the subject must be observed carefully until the resolution of the adverse event or until the intensity of the event decreases to Grade 1, at which point 
the infusion may be restarted at the investigator’s discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of that used before the interruption. Subsequently, the infusion rate may be increased at the investigator’s discretion. 
 
If the intensity of the adverse event returns to Grade 3 after restart of the infusion, 
then the procedure described in this section may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion. Should the intensity of the adve rse event increase to Grade 3 for a third 
time, then treatment with daratumumab will be discontinued for that subject.   
9.9j Thromboprophyaxis:  
All patients should be on 325 mg ASA daily  while receiving lenalidomide. If they are 
unable to take ASA or are at high risk of  VTE per investigator assessment, full dose 
anticoagulation is recommended.   
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropr iate treatment areas should have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of  the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP web site: 
 
10.1
1 Adverse event m onitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. 
First, identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
Next, determine whether the event is e xpected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3). With this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Secti on 10.4). Expedited re ports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 
10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.2 and 
18.0). 
10.12 Each CTCAE term in the current versio n is a unique representation of a specific 
event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT).  

MC1686 42  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020  NOTE: A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT  the same as 
serious AE, which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
• The determination of whether an AE is  expected is based on agent-specific 
information provided in Section 15 of the protocol. 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific information provided in 
Section 15 of the protocol. 
 NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is neither 
identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB 
review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 10.3 Assessment of Attribution 
 When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, 
the following attribution categories are utilized: 
  Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
  Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
  Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
  Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
  Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
  
10.4 Required Reporting 
 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigationa l Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on the 
SAME Arm 
 NOTE:  The combination of an investigati onal agent with a commercial agent is 
considered investigational.  
  
Routine Reporting  
 Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an investigational 
agent /intervention in combination with a comme rcial agent is stated in the protocol. See 
Section 10.6.  
  NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as the 
investigational agent/intervention (also, inves tigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or 
other investigational therapy under an I ND), the entire combination (arm) is then 
considered an investigationa l intervention for reporting. 
  
 Expedited Reporting  An AE that occurs on a combination stud y must be assessed in accordance with the 
guidelines for CTEP investigational agents/in terventions in Section 10.4, and where 
indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
An AE that occurs prior to administration of  the investigational agent/ intervention must 
be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade 4 and 5 AEs that are 
unexpected with at least possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited 
report. Refer to Section 10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions. 
MC1686 43  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 An investigational agent/intervention might ex acerbate the expected AEs associated with 
a commercial agent. Therefore2, if an expect ed AE (for the commercial agent) occurs 
with a higher degree of severity, expedited repor ting is required. The clinical investigator 
must determine severity. 
 
10.41 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting  
Exceptions to Expedited Reporting:  EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events1 
An expedited report may not be required fo r specific Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 Serious 
Adverse Events where the AE is listed in Section 15.0 of the protocol or the 
consent form* as EXPECTED. Any protocol specific reporting procedures 
MUST BE SPECIFIED BELOW and will supersede the standard Expedited 
Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  (Note: These adverse events must still be reported through the routine reporting mechanism [i.e. Nadir/adverse events form]; see Footnote 1):

• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the first 28 days of life. 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the same 
name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease 
(e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical 
deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. 
• Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution 
to the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 
24 hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last does of the 
investigational agent/intervention requ ires expedited reporting within 24 
hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
investigational agent/intervention. 
      10.413 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with invest igational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE must be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myelocytic Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
MC1686 45  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to can cer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
      10.414 Second Malignancy 
   A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial ma lignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting.

10.61 Special reporting requirements for Takeda  
Serious Adverse Event Definition 
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward me dical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe). 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of an existing hospitalization (see 
clarification in the paragraph belo w on planned hospitalizations). 
• Results in persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity. (Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s abili ty to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is a medically important event.  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicina l product of an infectious agent.   
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting 
MC1686 48  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopath y), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.   
 
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered 
severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is ofte n used to describe the intensity (severity) of 
a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe 
AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, a 
white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
AEs may be spontaneously reported by the patie nt and/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures. Any clin ically relevant deteriorati on in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For serious AEs, the investigator must determ ine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study drug administration.   AEs which are serious must be reported to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from 
the first dose of study drug through 30 days after administration of the last dose of ixazomib. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of ixazomib treatment or after the designated follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator 
considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (or designee). In addition, new primary ma lignancies that occur during the follow-up 
periods must be reported, regardless of cau sality to study regimen, for a minimum of 
three years after the last dose of the investig ational product, starting from the first dose of 
study drug. All new cases of primary ma lignancy must be reported to Takeda 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee).     Planned hospital admissions or surgical pr ocedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the tria l are not to be considered AEs unless the 
condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned). All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es).  
  Since this is an investigator-initiated stud y, the principal investigator, Shaji Kumar, MD, 
also referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB. 
   Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs (including serious pretreatment events) 
must also be reported in English to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (or designee): 
 
MC1686 49  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020   Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
 
  All other serious (non-fatal/non-life-threatening) events within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
   See below for contact information for the reporting of SAEs to Takeda 
Pharmacovigilance. 
  The sponsor-investigator must fax or em ail the SAE Form per the timelines above. A 
sample of an SAE Form will be provided. 
     The SAE report must include at minimum: 
• Event term(s) 
• Serious criteria  
• Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub- investigator’s determination. 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab a bnormalities, will be determined by using 
the NCI CTCAE version specified in the protocol, as a guideline, whenever possible. The criteria are available online at  
• Causality of the event(s): Sponsor-in
 vestigator’s or sub- investigator’s determination 
of the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration.  
  Follow-up information on the SAE may be requested by Takeda.   Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by 
using the NCI CTCAE version used at your institution, as a guideline, whenever possible. The criteria are available online at  
  In the event that this is a multisite st udy,
  the sponsor-investigator is responsible 
to ensure that the SAE reports are sent to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all sites participating in the study. Sub- investigators must report all SAEs to the 
sponsor-investigator so that the sponsor-i nvestigator can meet his/her foregoing 
reporting obligations to the required regulatory agencies and to Takeda 
Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator and sub-
investigator(s). 
  Relationship to all study drugs fo r each SAE will be determined by the 
investigator or sub-investigator by responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug(s)? 
  Sponsor-investigator must also provide  Takeda Pharmacovigilance with a copy 
of all communications with applicable re gulatory authorities related to the study 
product(s), as soon as possible but no later than 4 calendar days of such communication.

Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that sh e is pregnant while participating in this 
study or within 90 days after the last dose, she must inform the investigator immediately 
and permanently discontinue study drug.  Th e sponsor-investigator must immediately fax 
a completed Pregnancy Form to the Takeda  Department of Pharmacovigilance or 
designee (see Section 8.2) .  The pregnancy must be followed for the final pregnancy 
outcome. If a female partner of a male patient b ecomes pregnant during the male patient’s 
participation in this study, the sponsor-investigator must also immediately fax a 
completed Pregnancy Form to the Takeda De partment of Pharmacovigilance or designee 
(see Section 8.2).  Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final 
pregnancy outcome.

Overview 
As the sponsor of the Study, PRINCIPAL I NVESTIGATOR shall be solely responsible for 
complying, within the required timelines,  any safety reporting obligation to competent 
Health Authorities, IRB/ECs and any participati ng (co or sub) investigators, as defined in 
applicable laws and regulations.  For the purpo ses of this section, safety data includes adverse 
events, product quality complaints (PQCs), and special situations including pregnancies. 
 
The PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR will provide safety information to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC on adverse events, special situa tions including pregnancies and product quality 
complaints as defined within this section. 
 
1. Management of Safety Data 
This Study has been designated as an interventi onal study.  As such, all adverse events for 
Janssen Medicinal Products regardless of causa lity and special situations excluding those 
from subjects not exposed to a Janssen Medici nal Product and produc t quality complaints 
with or without an adverse event as described in  this Exhibit will be reported from the time a 

MC1686 51  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 subject has signed and dated an Informed Consent Form (ICF) until completion of the 
subject’s last study-related procedure (which may include contact for follow-up safety).  
Serious adverse events will be reported for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
 
For the purposes of this study, the Janssen medicinal product is: DARZALEX™ 
(daratumumab)  
 
2. Definitions 
2.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (includi ng an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medici nal (investigational or non- investigational) 
product, whether or not related to that medi cinal (investigational or non-investigational) 
product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH]) This includes any occurrence that is new in onset  or aggravated in severity or frequency from 
the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. 
 
2.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest are events  that Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC is 
actively monitoring as a result of a previously identified signal (even if non-serious). 
These adverse events are: 
 Infusion reactions 
 Infections 
 Cytopenias 
 HBV Reactivation  
 Other malignancies  
 2.3. Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) 
A valid ICSR must contain the four mini mum criteria required to meet regulatory 
reporting requirements. 
• an identifiable subject (but not disclosing personal information such as the subject’s 
name, initials or address) 
• an identifiable reporter (investigational site) 
• a Janssen medicinal product 
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situations 
 
The minimum information required is: • suspected Janssen medicinal product (doses, indication) 
• date of therapy (start a nd end date, if available) 
• batch or lot number, if available 
• subject details (subject ID and country) 
• gender 
• age at AE onset 
• reporter ID 
• adverse event detail (AE verbatim in En glish), onset date, relatedness, causality, 
action taken, outcome, (if available) 
• Janssen protocol ID 
MC1686 52  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020  
 
2.4. Product Quality Complaint (PQC) 
A product quality compliant is defined as any su spicion of a product defect related to a 
potential quality issue during manufacturing,  packaging, release testing, stability 
monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the product, or delivery system.  
Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and ba tch numbers are of high significance and need 
to be collected whenever available.  Examples of PQC include but not limited to: 
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered deliver y rate in a controlled release product 
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules 
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g.,  autoinjector button not working, 
needle detaching from syringe 
• Suspected Contamination 
• Suspected Counterfeit 
 
2.5. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use is any unto ward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the ti me of the event. It does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product 
• Is medically important* 
 *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is also appropriate in other situa tions, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require interv ention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above. These s hould usually be considered serious. 
 NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
2.5.1.  Hospitalization 
For reports of hospitalization, it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the hospitalization that is the serious even t for which details must be provided. 
 Any event requiring hospitalization or prolonga tion of hospitalization that occurs during 
the study must be reported as a serious adve rse event, except hospitalizations for the 
following: 
• Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (e.g., social reasons such as pending placement in long-term care facility)  
MC1686 53  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 • Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospitalizations 
that were planned before the start of data collection and where the underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened will not be 
considered serious adverse events. An y adverse event that results in a 
prolongation of the originally planned ho spitalization is to be reported as a new 
serious adverse event.] 
• [For convenience the investigator may choose to hospitalize the subject for the duration of the treatment period.]  
  
2.5.2.  Life-Threatening Conditions 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an  adverse event or serious adverse event 
term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event 
definition. 
 3. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/ Reference Safety Information 
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a marketing authorization, the expectedness of  an adverse event will be determined by 
whether or not it is listed in the applicable product information.  
 
 
 For DARZALEX™ (darat um
umab),the expectedness of an adverse event will be 
determined by whether or not it is lis ted in the Investigator's Brochure 
 
4. Special Reporting Situations  
Safety events of interest for a Janssen medi cinal product that require expediting reporting 
and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal) 
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal product 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen 
medicinal product 
• Medication error involving a Janssen medi cinal product (with or without patient 
exposure to the Janssen medicinal pr oduct, e.g., name confusion) 
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via administration of a medicinal product 
•  Unexpected therapeutic or clinical bene fit from use of a Janssen medicinal product 
 These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, from a Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC perspective,  they are treated in the same manner as 
adverse events. Special situations should be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the CRF.  

MC1686 54  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded 
on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
 
Pregnancy  
 
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reporte d to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC by the 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  using the 
Serious Adverse Event Form. Abnormal pregna ncy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, 
fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, ectopi c pregnancy) are considered serious adverse 
events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discontinue further study treatment. 
 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects exposed to a Jan ssen medicinal product will be reported by the 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event  using the 
Serious Adverse Event Form.  Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent 
of the partner.  Follow-up information regarding the outcome of  the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae 
in the infant will be required.  
5. Maintenance of Safety Information 
All safety data should be maintained in a c linical database in a retrievable format. The 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR shall provide all adverse events, both serious and non-
serious, in report format. However, in certain circumstances more frequent provision of safety data may be necessary, e.g. to fulfill a regulatory request, and as such the data shall be made available within a reasonable timeframe at Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC request.  
6. Procedures for Reporting Safety Data a nd Product Quality Complaints (PQCs) for 
Janssen Medicinal Products to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC 
All adverse events and special situations, wh ether serious or non-serious, related or not 
related, following exposure to a Janssen medi cinal product are to be documented by the 
investigator and recorded in the CRF and in th e subject’s source records. Investigators must 
record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to a Janssen 
medicinal product.  
All (serious and non-serious) adverse events  reported for a Janssen medicinal product should 
be followed-up in accordance with clinical practice. 
 
6.1. SAEs and Special Reporting Situations 
All serious adverse events that have not resolved  by the end of the study, or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's pa rticipation in the study, must be followed 
until any of the following occurs: 
• The event resolves 
• The event stabilizes 
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available 
MC1686 55  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 • The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated 
to study conduct 
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care practitioner refusal to provide additiona l information, lost to follow-up after 
demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts) 
 The PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR will transmit all SAEs and special situations following exposure to a Janssen product unde r study in a form provided by Janssen 
Scientific Affairs, LLC in accordance with Section 10,Transmission Methods, in English 
within 24-hours of becoming aware of the event(s).  
 In the event the study is blinded, the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR will submit an unblinded SAE or pregnancy exposure repor t to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. 
 
All follow-up information for serious adverse events that are not resolved at the end of the study or by the time of patient withdrawal must be reported directly by the 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, within 24 hours becoming aware , to Janssen Scientific 
Affairs, LLC using the Janssen Scientific A ffairs, LLC Serious Adverse Event Report  
 
All available clinical information relevant to  the evaluation of a related SAE or special 
situation is required. 
 
• The PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR is respons ible for ensuring that these cases are 
complete and if not are promptly followed-up. A safety report is not considered complete until all clinical details needed to interpret the case are received. Reporting 
of follow-up information should follow the same timeline as initial reports. 
 
• Copies of any and all relevant corresponde nces with regulatory authorities and ethics 
committees regarding any and all serious adverse events, irrespective of association with the Janssen Product under study, are to be  provided to Janssen Scientific Affairs, 
LLC using a transmission method in Section 10 from this Exhibit within  24 hours of 
such report or correspondence being sent to applicable health authorities.  
 
6.2. Non-Serious AEs 
All non-serious adverse events should be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC 
according to the timeframe outlined in the Research Funding Agreement section entitled Reporting of Data. 
 
6.3. PQC Reporting 
A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the 
protection of patients, investigators, a nd Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, and are 
mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide.  Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC has 
established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of PQC information. Lot and/or Batch #s shall be collected or any 
reports failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect). The product should be quarantined immediately and if possible, take a picture.  All initial PQCs involving a Janssen medicina l product under study must be reported to 
Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC by the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR within 24 hours 
MC1686 56  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 after being made aware of the event. The Janssen contact will provide additional 
information/form to be completed. 
 
If the defect for a Janssen medicinal product under study is combined with either a 
serious adverse event or non-serious a dverse event, the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR 
must report the PQC to Janssen Scientific A ffairs, LLC according to the serious adverse 
event reporting timelines.  A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for 
further investigation if requested by  Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. 
 
7. Reporting Procedures for Reporting Safety  Data and Product Quality Complaints 
(PQCs) for Non-Janssen Medicinal Products  
For SAEs, special reporting situations a nd PQCs following exposure to a non-Janssen

Version Date:  March 26, 2020 11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria21 will be used to 
assess response to therapy. 
11.1  Terms and definitions 
 
• M-protein: synonyms include M-spike, monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.   
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins)  
• Cases in which the M-protein is so  large and narrow on agarose (some 
specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level 
(by greater than 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel. 
• Cases in which there are multiple peak s of same M-protein (aggregates or 
dimers) 
 If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accep ted, with the exception that quantitative 
IgG may not be used.  However, this must be explicitly reported at baseline, and only 
nephelometry can be used for that patient to assess response. SPEP derived M-protein values and quantitative nephelometric immunoglobulin values cannot be used 
interchangeably.   
 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random or 24 h urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended.  FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, UK).  Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined 
as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a 
monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal li ght chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type.  
 
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), complete response (CR), ve ry good partial response (VGPR), partial 
response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD).  
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making 
and test ordering. These designations will app lied at the time of the first measurement 
at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been satisfied without 
the confirmation step having been satis fied. The designation “u” will precede the 
standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
 
• Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
MC1686 58  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020  
o Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
         NOTE:  Quantitative IgG may not be used for defining measurable disease 
o Urine M-protein ≥  200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥  10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ratio is 
abnormal 
o Bone marrow plasma cells ≥  30% 
 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be used 
in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not 
“measurable” as above, and the baseline le vel of the involved FLC is “measurable.”  
When using this assay, it is important to note th at the FLC levels vary considerably with 
changes in renal function and in patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the 
kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of 
CR.  Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvol ved difference) should be considered in 
assessing response.  Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no 
measurable serum/urine M-protein) should be the only ones who are evaluated using 
FLC response criteria.  The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results with the exception of defining stringent complete response. 
 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-protein, 
serum free light chain, or urine M-protein. 
 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-protein or urine M-protein, but has had a detectable M-
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
 
• Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable M-protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

1  SPEP, UPEP, Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine, and Bone marrow 
biopsy  are required to document CR regardless of registration values, and in addition 
FLC  measurement and bone marrow immunophenotyping  is required to document 
sCR.  SPEP and UPEP are required to document VGPR regardless of registration 
values. 
2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour ur ine does not need to be confirmed (i.e. 
repeated after documented response) for any response category 
3  At a minimum, a bone marrow biopsy should be repeated every 3 months until 
documented response.  Bone marrow biopsy resu lts do not need to be repeated after 
documented response. 
4    If serum M-protein is being followed by quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived 
from nephelometry or turbidometry, qua ntitative immunoglobulins are required.  SPEP 
is only required to document CR or VGPR.  
 
11.3 Confirmed response  
 
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum M- protein, 
serum immunoglobulin free light chain (whe n primary determinant of response) and 
urine M- protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by verification on two consecutive determinations.   
• Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are only required to document CR or sCR, 
except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required 
to document all response categories including progression. However, a second confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.2 
MC1686 60  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020  
  
11.4 Bone progression  
 
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating progression on the basis of variation of radiologic technique alone.  Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression.  When progr ession is based on skeletal disease alone, it 
should be discussed with the Study Chair befo re removing the patient from the study.  
 
 11.5  Response and Progression 
 
Criteria for response and progression are listed in Table 11.5. Progressive disease for all 
patients as defined in Table 11.5.

Version Date:  March 26, 2020 (≥177mM/L) 
6.  Hyperviscosity 
 
 
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, PD) made at 
any time before the institution of any new therapy.  MRD tests should be initiated only at the time of 
suspected complete response. sCR, CR, VGPR, PR , MR and SD categories and MRD require no known 
evidence of progressive or new bone lesions or ex tramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies 
were performed. However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements 
except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging MRD-negative status is reported. Bone marrow 
assessments need not be confirmed. Each category, except for stable disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designa te first time point at which response category MAY 
have been achieved if confirmed. The date of the initial test is considered as the date of response for 
evaluation of time dependent outcomes such as duration of response.  
b CR patient will need to progress at the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be considered a PD.  A 
positive immunofixation alone is not sufficient.  
c If more than one M protein spike meets the criteria for measurable disease at baseline, then both need to 
be followed for response.  Otherwise, only follow  the measurable M protein spike for response.   
 
d In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: CR in such patients indicates a 
normal FLC ratio of 0.26-1.65 in add ition to the CR criteria listed above. 
 
e Bone marrow criteria for PD are only to be used in  patients without measurable disease by M protein and 
by FLC;   
f A "25% increase" refers to M protein, FLC and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, 
soft tissue plasmacytoma or hypercalcemia.  The low est value does not need to be a confirmed value.  If 
the lowest serum M-protein is ≥ 5 g/dL, an increase in serum M-protein of ≥ 1 g/dL is sufficient to define 
disease progression.  
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a possible 
lab error), that value will not be consider ed when determining the lowest value. 
 
h Progressive disease should be confirmed on two consecutive evaluations, where the timing of 
confirmation is per the treating physician and can be  done immediately within the same cycle or on the 
next cycle.  However, treatment may be discon tinued for progressive disease that is unconfirmed per 
physician discretion.  In this case, an objective stat us of PD should be entered on the measurement form 
and progressive disease should be reporte d on the event monitoring form. 
 
i Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/l ratio. An abnormal k/l ratio by 
immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma  cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is k/l of 4:1 or 1:2.   
j Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or 
dedicated CT scans where applicable. For patients w ith only skin involvement, skin lesions should be 
measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size wi ll be determined by the sum of the products of the 
maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions (SPD).  
MC1686 63  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 k Requires a complete response as defined in the table.   MRD tests should be initiated only at the time of 
suspected complete response. MRD requires no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies were performed. However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these 
response requirements except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging MRD-negative status is 
reported. 
  NOTE: Interference with Determination of Complete Response: Daratumumab is a 
human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum protein 
electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete 
response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

• The Investigator withdraws the patient in the patient’s best interests 
• Patient is lost to follow-up (defined as th e inability to contact the patient on 3 separate 
occasions over 2 years) 
• Administrative reasons (e.g., the patient is transferred to hospice care) 
• An adverse event, which in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes further trial 
participation  
   All attempts should be made to complete the End of Study procedures when the patient 
discontinues treatment. Patients should go to ev ent monitoring per Section 4.2, unless the 
patient refuses further study partic ipation or is lost to follow-up.

regulatory requirements by the Investigator(s) 
• Request to discontinue the trial by a re gulatory or health authority or an IRB 
• Manufacturing difficulties/concerns 
   
  All Investigators and the requisite regulator y authorities will be notified if the study is 
suspended or terminated for safety reasons. In the case of such termination, the Investigator will notify the IRB. 
 
13.8 Ineligible 
  A patient is deemed ineligible  after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each a nd every eligibility criteria for study entry. 
The patient may continue treatment off-protocol at the discretion of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the patient  was properly registered. The patient will 
go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study (or off study, if applicable).  • If the patient received treatment, all data  up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted. Event monitoring will be required per Section 4.2  of 
the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on- study material and the End of Active 
Treatment/Cancel Notification Form must be submitted. No further data submission is necessary. 
13.9a Major violation 
  A patient is deemed a major violation , if protocol requirements regarding treatment in 
Cycle 1 of the initial therapy are severely viol ated that evaluability for primary end point 
is questionable. All data up until the point of  confirmation of a major violation must be 
submitted. The patient will go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study. The 
patient may continue treatment off-protocol at the discretion of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the patien t was properly registered. Event monitoring 
will be required per Section 4.2  of the protocol. 
 
13.9b Cancel

Version Date:  March 26, 2020 15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 Ixazomib (MLN9708, Ninlaro®)  
15.11 Background: Ixazomib (MLN9708) is a second-generation small molecule 
inhibitor of the 20S proteasome that is under development for the treatment of 
non-hematologic malignancies, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.   
  Ixazomib (
MLN2238) refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of the drug 
substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN9708).  The transition to MLN2238 occurs in any 
aqueous system. 
 
15.12 Formulation: The ixazomib (MLN9708) capsule drug product formulation 
consists of drug substance, microcry stalline cellulose, talc, and magnesium 
stearate.  Seven different capsule strengths are manufactured: 0.2, 0.5, 2.0, 2.3, 
3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 mg; each capsule streng th has a unique color. Dosage strength is 
stated as ixazomib (the active boronic  acid). Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules are 
individually packaged in blisters. 
 
 Matching placebo capsules have been manuf actured for the 2.3, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 
mg ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules. The placebo capsules contain 
microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and magnesi um stearate and are identical in color 
and size to the corresponding active dose. 
 
15.13 Preparation and storage : Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules 0.2 mg, 0.5 mg,  
2.0 mg), individually packaged in blisters, can be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC   
or “Do not store above 25°C. Do not freeze." Ixazomib capsules (2.3 mg, 3.0 mg, 
4.0 mg, and 5.5 mg), individually packaged in blisters can be stored at “2°C - 8°C” or “Do not store above 30°C. Do not freeze." 
   Ixazomib that is dispensed to the patie nt for take-home dosing should remain in 
the blister packaging until the point of use.  The investigative site is responsible 
for providing the medication to the patient in units that comprise the correct daily 
dose configurations.  Capsules should remain in the blisters until the point of use.  Ixazomib capsules must be administered as intact capsules and must not be opened or manipulated in any way.  Comprehensive instructions should be 
provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedures.  
Patients will be instructed to store the medication in the refrigerator until the time 
of use. Reconciliation will occur accordingl y when the patient returns for their 
next cycle of therapy. Any extremes in temperature should be reported as an 
excursion and will be managed on a case by case basis.  Returned unused 
capsules should be discarded in a proper biohazard container. 
 
Ixazomib is an anticancer drug. As with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling ixazomib.  It is recommended to wear gloves and protective garments during pr eparation when dispensed in clinic. 
Please refer to published guidelines regardi ng the proper handling and disposal of 
anticancer agents. 
 15.14 Administration:   Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules must be administered as intact 
capsules and are not intended to be opened  or manipulated in any way.  Capsules 
MC1686 69  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 should be taken on an empty stomach with a pproximately 8 oz (1 cup) of water at 
least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after food. 
 
 Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products. 
 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic (PK) information :   
a) Absorption:  After oral dosing, ixazo mib is rapidly absorbed with a median 
Tmax of 1 hour.  The lack of a discernible relationship between BSA and ixazomib 
clearance over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m2) indicates that total 
systemic exposure (AUC) following fixed dosing should be independent of the 
individual patient’s BSA.  A high-fat meal decreased both the rate and extent of 
absorption.  Therefore, ixazomib should be  administered on an empty stomach.   
b) Distribution: The steady state volume of distribution is large and is estimated 
to be 543 L. Ixazomib is 88-94% protein bound. 
c) Metabolism:  Metabolism is the primary route for elimination of ixazomib by both CYP and non-CYP enzymes. CYP3A4 and 1A2 comprise the major CYP isozymes that contribute to ixazomib metabolism. d) Excretion: The mean terminal half-lif e is 9.5 days.  Renal elimination is a 
minor clearance pathway for ixazomib.  Dosing adjustment is not required in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment in studies. However, in a 
dedicated renal impairment study (C1 6015), unbound AUC0-last was 38% higher 
in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal function.  Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD requiring 
dialysis.  Unbound systemic exposures of ixazomib are 27% higher in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairme nt as compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function.  A reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended for 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic  impairment. 
  15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :   
The PK of ixazomib was similar with and without coadministration of clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary when ixazomib is administered with CYP3A inhibitors. In the population PK analysis, coadministration of strong CYP1A2 
inhibitors did not affect ixazomib clearance. Thus, no dose adjustment is required 
for patients receiving strong CYP1A2 inhi bitors. In a clinical rifampin DDI 
study, ixazomib C
max and AUC 0-last were reduced in the presence of rifampin by 
approximately 54% and 74%, respectively. As a result, the coadministration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib should be avoided.  Ixazomib is neither a 
time-dependent nor reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, or 3A4/5, therefore the potential for ixazomib to produce DDIs via CYP 
isozyme inhibition is low.  Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity.  The potential for ixazomib to cause DDIs with substrates or inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MATE-1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, and OATPs is low. 
 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ixazomib coadministered with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LenDe x) are similar to those observed 
when ixazomib is administered as a sing le agent. This suggests that there 
MC1686 70  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 is no readily apparent effect of coad ministration of LenDex on the clinical 
PK of ixazomib. 
 
Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient has had a serious allergic 
reaction to boron or boron containing products.

peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, maculo-
papular rash, papular rash  
Uncommon ( ≥0.1% to <1%): generalized pruritis, generalized rash  
  
Herpes zoster  – antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients 
being treated with ixazomib to d ecrease the risk of herpes zoster 
reactivation. Rare but serious risks – intestinal obstruction, pneumonia, life-
threatening severe skin rash (Steven Johnson syndrome, TEN, DRESS syndrome), , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure,  posterior reversible  encephalopathy syndrome, transverse 
myelitis, progressive multifo cal leukoencephalopathy. 
Overdose –  There is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose.  
In the event of an overdose in blinded studies, study medication assignment should be unblinded immediately.  The clinician should consider admitting the patient to the ho spital for IV hydration, monitoring 
for adverse drug reactions, monitoring of vital signs, and appropriate supportive care.  Gavage may be consid ered, but it should be kept in mind 
that ixazomib absorption is rapid.  Ix azomib is not readily dialyzable.

15.2 Lenalidomide (Revlimid ®, CC-5013, CDC-501)   
Please consult the most current Investigator’s Brochure and package insert for complete drug information. 
 
15.21 Background: Lenalidomide has a wide range of effects, including the inhibition of hematopoietic tumor cell proliferation,  the enhancement of T cells and natural 
killer (NK) cell activity, the modulation of stem cell differentiation, the inhibition 
of angiogenesis, and the inhibition of inflammation . 
 15.22 Formulation: For clinical study, lenalidomide is provided as 1.25-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-mg capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 
MC1686 72  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 lenalidomide as the active ingredient an d the following inactive ingredients: 
anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and 
magnesium stearate. 
 
Placebo capsules for the 1.25-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-mg lenalidomide 
capsules are available for use in blinde d studies. Each placebo capsule visually 
matches the drug product. 
 
The lenalidomide and placebo capsules are supplied in push-through blister foil 
or tamper-evident, child-resistant, opaque, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers with HDPE caps. 
 15.23 Preparation and storage : Lenalidomide should be stored at room 
temperature, between 59 and 86ºF (15-30ºC).  Store drug away from direct 
sunlight.   
 
15.24 Administration:   Capsules are administered by mouth daily  with water. Patients 
should not break, chew or open the capsules.   
  
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a)  Absorption – Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration 
to subjects with multiple myeloma or MDS, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5 and  1.5 hours post-dose. Co-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in healthy subjects reduced the extent of absorption, resulti ng in an approximately 20% decrease in 
AUC and 50% decrease in C
max in plasma.   
 In the pivotal MM and MDS registration trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide, the drug was administered without regard to food intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with or without food. 
 
Multiple dosing (up to 100 mg BID) did not cause marked drug accumulation.   
 
 b)  Distribution – In vitro (
14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is 
approximately 30%. 
 
c)  Metabolism – Lenalidomide undergoes limited metabolism. Unchanged lenalidomide is the predominant circ ulating component in humans. Two 
identified metabolites are hydroxy-lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide; each constitutes less than 5% of pare nt levels in circulation. 
 
d)  Excretion – Elimination is primarily  renal.  Approximately 65% to 85% of 
lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged thr ough urinary excretion in subjects with 
normal renal function. The half-life of el imination is approximately 3 to 4 hours 
(2 to 3 hours in patients 5 to 21 years) at  the clinically relevant doses (5 to 50 
mg/day). Steady-state levels are achieved within 4 days. 
 
15.26 Potential Drug Interactions :  In vitro studies demonstrate that lenalidomide is 
not a substrate of CYP enzymes. In addition, lenalidomide shows little inhibitory or induction potential towards the CYP enzymes in vitro. Hence, 
MC1686 73  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 coadministration of CYP substrates, inhibitors, or inducers with lenalidomide is 
not likely to result in clinically releva nt drug-drug interactions in humans.  
 
In vitro, lenalidomide is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, OCTN1, or OCTN2. Thus, it is unlikely that substrates or inhibitors of these transporters would affect lenalidomide disposition in humans.  Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of BSEP, BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT2. Thus, lena lidomide is not anticipated to cause 
any significant drug-drug interactions due  to inhibition of these transporters. 
 
Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and is not anticipated to cause any significant drug-drug interactions due to UGT1A1 inhibition. 
 
In vitro, lenalidomide is a weak substrate, but not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp).  Erythropoietic agents or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, 
such as hormone replacement therapy a nd oral contraceptives, should be used 
with caution in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone. 
  Periodic monitoring of digoxin plasma levels is recommended due to increased 
C
max and AUC with concomitant lenalidomide therapy.  Close monitoring of PT 
and INR is recommended in multiple myeloma patients taking concomitant 
warfarin. 
 15.27 Known potential toxicities :   
 
Pregnancy Warning: Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb 
abnormalities in a developmental monkey study similar to birth defects caused by 
thalidomide in humans. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of Lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Pregnancy must be 
excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy during treatment by the use of two reliable methods of contraception.

 The following additional adverse reactio ns have been reported in Celgene-
sponsored clinical studies and are considered by the company to be at least possibly related to the administration of lenalidomide: pneumonitis, transient abnormal liver laboratory tests, hyperthyroidism, viral reactivation (such as 
hepatitis B or herpes virus), acute graft- versus-host disease following allogeneic 
hematopoietic transplant, solid organ re jection, TLS, TFR, rhabdomyolysis, and 
allergic conditions, incl uding angioedema,.  These reactions are reported 
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, so it is not possible to reliably 
estimate their frequency. 
  
Lenalidomide may have minor or moderate  influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. Fatigue, dizziness, somnol ence, vertigo and blurred vision have 
been reported with the use of lenalidomide. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines.

15.4 Daratumumab (Darzalex ®) 
Please consult the most current Investigator’s Brochure and package insert for 
complete drug information. 
 
15.41 Background: . Daratumumab is an immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 κ) human 
monoclonal antibody against CD38 antigen , produced in a mammalian cell line 
(Chinese Hamster Ovary [CHO]) using recombinant DNA technology. The molecular weight of daratumumab is approximately 148 kDa. 
 
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein (48 kDa) expressed on the surface of 
hematopoietic cells, including multiple myeloma and other cell types and tissues and has multiple functions, such as recepto r mediated adhesion, signaling, and 
modulation of cyclase and hydrolase activity. Daratumumab is an IgG1 κ human 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD38 and inhibits the growth of CD38 
expressing tumor cells by inducing apoptosi s directly through Fc mediated cross 
linking as well as by immune-mediated tumor cell lysis through complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Myeloid derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) and a subset of regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) expresses CD38 and is susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell lysis.

Version Date:  March 26, 2020 15.42 Formulation:  
IV formulation:Daratumumab IV solutio n is a colorless to yellow liquid and 
sterile concentrate of 20 mg/mL in a vial with a nominal fill of 5 mL or 20mL. It 
will be manufactured and provided under the responsibility of Janssen Biotech. 
Refer to the Product Insert for a list of excipients. 
 
15.43 Preparation and storage :  
IV drug formulation: Daratumumab is  supplied in glass vials containing 
daratumumab at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Study drug labels will 
contain information to meet the applicable regulatory requirements. Each 
vial will contain a study-specific label with a unique identification number.   
 
All study drug vials must be stored in the original carton in a refrigerator ranging from 2°C to 8°C and must not be utilized after the expiry date 
printed on the label. The product must be protected from light and must 
not be frozen. Daratumumab does not contain preservatives; therefore, any unused portion remaining in the vial must be discarded.  Daratumumab will be diluted in a sterile, pyrogen-free physiological saline 
solution (0.9% NaCl) prior to IV administration. Refer to Section 7 of the 
protocol, the Investigational Product Preparation Instructions or Investigational Product Procedures Manual for details regarding dose preparation, storage, and handling of diluted solutions.  
15.44 Administration:    
IV administration:  Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone (PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometer). Polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, PP or PE administration sets must be used. 
 Infusion should be completed within 15 hours. 
 Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any 
unused product or waste material shoul d be disposed of in accordance with 
local requirements. 
 Do not infuse daratumumab concomitantly in the same intravenous line 
with other agents.  
 
15.45 Pharmacokinetic information for IV administration: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of daratumumab following intravenous administration were evaluated in patient s with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma at dose levels from 0.1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg, and included the 
recommended 16 mg/kg dose and regimen. Over the dose range from 1 to 24 
mg/kg, increases in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were more than dose-proportional. Clearance decr eased with increasing dose and repeated 
dosing, indicating target-mediated pharm acokinetics. The mean (SD) predose 
(trough) serum concentration at the end of weekly dosing was 573 (332) µg/mL.  
The half-life of daratumumab is both c oncentration and time dependent. After the 
first dose of 16 mg/kg of daratumumab, the observed half-life was 9±4 days. The 
model-derived half-life associated with  linear elimination was approximately 
18±9 days; this is the half-life that can be expected following repeat dosing of 
MC1686 79  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020 daratumumab. Apparent steady state seems to be reached approximately 5 
months into the every 4 weeks dosing period of the 16 mg/kg with a schedule of weekly for 8 weeks, every 2 weeks fo r 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks 
thereafter (approximately 11 months of treatment in total).  As expected with subcutaneous administration, concentration-time curves following administration in all cohorts indicate a later T
max of approximately 72h 
post-dose, compared with IV administration when T max occurs at or near the end 
of infusion. The range of C3D1 C trough observations for the SC cohort is within 
the range observed following 16 mg/kg IV dosing, and the variability appeared to be similar for the daratumumab SC a nd 16 mg/kg IV cohorts.  The observed C
max 
values from the daratumumab SC cohort is within the range observed for 
daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV.   Special Populations 
Renal Impairment: The population PK analysis included 71 patients with normal 
renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCL] ≥ 90 mL/min), 78 patients with mild 
renal impairment (CrCL <90 and ≥60 mL/min), 68 patients with moderate renal 
impairment (CrCL <60 and ≥30 mL/min), and 6 patients with severe renal 
impairment or end stage renal disease (CrCL <30 mL/min). No clinical 
differences in exposure to daratumumab were observed between patients with 
renal impairment and those with normal renal function. 
 Hepatic Impairment: The population PK an alysis included 189 patients with 
normal hepatic function (TB and AST ≤ULN) and 34 with mild hepatic 
impairment (TB 1.0× to 1.5× ULN or AST>ULN) patients. No clinical differences in the exposure to daratumuma b were observed between patients with 
mild hepatic impairment and those with  normal hepatic function. Daratumumab 
has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB>1.5× to 3× ULN and any AST) or severe (TB>3× ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.

Version Date:  March 26, 2020 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview 
  This study is designed to assess the confir med complete response rate with daratumumab 
added to ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexame thasone, when used as initial therapy in 
patients with previously untreated sympto matic MM using a one-stage binomial phase II 
study design in each arm. This study will include 2 treatment arms:  Arm A 
(Dexamethasone cycles 1-12) and Arm B (Dexamethasone cycles 1-2 only). 
     16.11 Primary Endpoint      The primary endpoint in each arm of this tr ial is the confirmed complete response rate.  A 
confirmed complete response is defined as objective status of CR or sCR that is maintained on two consecutive evaluations at least 2 weeks apart. All patients meeting 
the eligibility criteria, who have signed a con sent form and have begun treatment will be 
evaluable for response, unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
   16.12 Sample Size      The one-stage binomial design to be used
 in each arm is fully described below.  A 
maximum of 36 evaluable patients will be accrued to each arm of this phase II study unless undue toxicity is encountered.  We an ticipate accruing an additional 4 patients in 
each arm  to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons for a maximum of 40 patients accrued
 in each arm, and 80 patients overall. 
   16.13 Accrual Rate and Study Duration      The anticipated accrual rate is 3 evaluable multiple myeloma patients per month, 
translating to a duration of approximately one year for accrual
 in each arm.  Accrual to 
Arm A will be completed before accrual is opened to Arm B.  In each arm, the total duration before any results may be available is expected to be approximately 1.5 years
 
from the date of activation for that arm, or until the last patient accrued to that arm has 
been observed for at least 6 months.  The maximum total study duration is expected to be 
5 years, or until the last patient accrued has been followed for 3 years. 
 
16.2  Statistical Design (to be ev aluated in each arm independently) 
     16.21 Decision Rule      In a prior phase I/II study of previously un treated multiple myeloma patients, the efficacy 
of a combination of ixazomib, lenali domide and dexamethasone was evaluated.
14  A total 
of 53 patients were treated at the recommended phase II dose of 4.0 mg ixazomib, where a complete response rate of 27% was seen.   This study will add daratumumab to the 
combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone.  An increase in complete 
response rate with this four-drug combination would be of interest. 
 
MC1686 83  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020   The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be 
considered ineffective in this population is  25%, and the smallest success proportion that 
would warrant subsequent studies with the propo sed regimen in this patient population is 
45%. The following one-stage binomial design requires 36 evaluable patients to test the 
null hypothesis that the true success proportion in this patient population is at most 25%.   
.  
  16.211 Final Decision Rule: Enter 36 evaluable patients into the study. If 12 or 
fewer successes are observed in the first 36 evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in th is patient population. Otherwise, if 
the number of successes is at least 13, this will be considered evidence of 
promising activity and the treatment  may be recommended for further 
testing in subsequent studies. 
     16.212 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the final decision rule or 
used in any decision making process. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.313. 
   
  16.22 Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .09, i.e. there is a 9% chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not. The probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further st udy (i.e. statistical power) under various 
success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion 
as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 
Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen warrants further study is… 0.09 0.26 0.51 0.74 0.89 
 
  16.23 Other considerations: Adverse events , quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken in to account in any decision to terminate 
the study 
 
16.3 Analysis Plan 
  The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.2) and at the time 
the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. The Statistician and Study 
Chair will make the decision, in accord w ith CCS Standard Operating Procedures, 
availability of data for secondary endpoints (e.g., laboratory correlates), and the level of data maturity. In each arm, it is anticipated th at the earliest date in which the results will 
be made available via manuscript, abstract, or  presentation format is when last patient in 
that arm  has been followed for at least 6 months. 
     16.31 Primary Outcome Analyses (to be evaluated in each arm independently): :    
MC1686 84  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020   16.311 Definition: The primary endpoint in each arm of this trial is the 
proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed complete response. A 
confirmed complete response is defined as an sCR or CR  noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations at least two weeks apart. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent 
form and have begun treatment will be evaluable for response, unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
   16.312 Estimation: The proportion of successes in each arm will be estimated by 
the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. An exact binomial 95% confidence interval for the true success proportion will be calculated. 
   16.313 Over Accrual:  If more than the ta rget number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stopping rule or used 
in any decision making processes; however, they will be included in final point estimates and confidence intervals. 
   16.32 Secondary Outcome Analyses (to be  evaluated in each arm independently) 
 
16.321 The overall response rate will be estimated by the number of patients 
who achieve an sCR, CR, VGPR or PR divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportions will be calculated. 
 16.322 The rate of ≥ VGPR will be estimated by the number of patients with a 
VGPR, CR, or sCR divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportions will be calculated. 
 16.323 Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to 
any cause. The distribution of overall su rvival will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan-Meier.
22  
 16.324 Progression-free survival is defined as the time from registration to the 
earliest date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. The distribution of progression-free survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier 
 
  16.325 Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adve rse event rate(s). The maximum 
grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be revi ewed to determine patterns. 
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration  
     16.33 Correlative Analyses: Due to the small overall sample size, the results of these 
analyses will be considered explorator y and hypothesis-generating in nature. 
MC1686 85  Add 12   
Version Date:  March 26, 2020  
  16.331 Minimal residual disease will be assessed on bone marrow aspirate in all 
patients achieving CR. The proportion of patients who achieve MRD 
negative status will be estimated by the number of patients who are MRD negative divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals fo r the true MRD negative rate will 
be calculated. 
 
 16.332  The FACT/GOG neurotoxicity  questionnaire will be completed by 
patients at baseline, after each cycle for the first 4 cycles, and then every 
three cycles. Patients will be evaluated by overall score for each questionnaire at each time point and changes over time will be calculated. These measures will be correlated with outcome using Fisher’s exact test and Kaplan-Meier methods where appropriate. 
  
16.4 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
   16.41 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC 
Statistical Office. 
   16.42 Adverse Event Stopping Rules (to be  evaluated in each arm independently):  
   The stopping rules specified below ar e based on the knowledge available at study 
development. We note that the Adverse Ev ent Stopping Rule may be adjusted in 
the event of either (1) the study re-ope ning to accrual or (2) at any time during 
the conduct of the trial and in consid eration of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The 
study team may choose to suspend accrua l because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. 
 
  Accrual will be temporarily suspended to  this study if at any time we observe 
events with an attribution of possibly, probably, or definitely related to study 
treatment that satisfy one of the following: 
 
• if 5 or more patients in the first 13 treated patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event  
• if after the first 13 patients have been treated, 40% of all patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event.  
   We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse event.

Version Date:  March 26, 2020 16.5 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov:  
At study activation, this study will have been  registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” 
website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with other required information for 
this study will be reported on For purposes of timing of the 
Results Reporting, the initial estimated comp letion date for the Primary  Endpoint of this 
study is  5 years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint 
Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time all patients registered have 
achieved a confirmed complete response or  have discontinued treatment without 
achieving a confirmed complete response.   
 
16.6 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
  16.61 This study will be available to all elig ible patients, regardless of race, gender, or 
ethnic origin. 
 
  16.62 There is no information currently ava ilable regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender , or ethnicity, and there is no reason to 
expect such differences to exist. Theref ore, although the planned analysis will, as 
always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses. 
   16.63 The geographical region served by MCCC has a population which includes 
approximately 3% minorities. Based on prior MCCC studies involving similar disease sites, we expect about 3-5% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 33% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by gender subsets are shown in the following table:

Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Gu idelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
 
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  The risks to a fetus are not known.  However, because 
lenalidomide is related to thalidomide, and tha lidomide is known to cause severe birth defects, the 
following requirements must be observed. 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)
† must agree to use two reliable forms of contraception 
simultaneously or to practice complete abstinen ce from heterosexual intercourse during the following 
time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating 
in the study; and 3) for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. The two methods of reliable 
contraception must include one highly effective meth od (i.e. intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal [birth 
control pills, injections, or implants], tubal ligati on, partner’s vasectomy) and one additional effective 
(barrier) method (i.e. latex condom, diaphragm, cervic al cap).  FCBP must be referred to a qualified 
provider of contraceptive methods if needed.   
 
Before starting study drug:   
Female Subjects:    
• FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests ( sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
starting lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-14 days prior to the 
start of lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to 
the start of lenalidomide.  The subject may not  receive study drug until the Investigator has 
verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. 
• Will be warned that sharing study drug is pr ohibited and will be counseled about pregnancy 
precautions and potential risks of fetal exposure.. 
• Must agree to abstain from donating blood during study participation and for at least 28 days 
after discontinuation from the study. 
 Male Subjects:   
• Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  
• Will be warned that sharing study drug is pr ohibited and will be counseled about pregnancy 
precautions and potential risks of fetal exposure,  
• Must agree to abstain from donating blood, semen, or sperm during study participation and for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. 
 During study participation and for 28 days following discontinuation from the study: All Subjects: 
                                                 
 † A female of childbearing potential is a  sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive 
months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
   
 
MC1686 97  Add 12   
Version Date:  November 20, 2019 • Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of th erapy may be dispensed with each cycle of 
therapy.  
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject or the partner of a male 
study subject during study participation, lena lidomide must be immediately discontinued. 
 
Female Subjects:    
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the 
first 28 days of study participation and th en every 28 days while on study, at study 
discontinuation, and at day 28 following discontinuation from the study. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following discontinuation from 
the study.   
• In addition to the required pregna ncy testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP that she 
is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit.   
• Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study drug and to not donate blood, . 
 
Pregnancy testing and counseling must  be performed if a subject misses her period or if her pregnancy 
test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Stud y drug treatment must be discontinued during this 
evaluation.  
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 28 
days after discontinuation from the study. 
 Male Subjects: 
• Counseling about the requirement for latex condom  use during sexual contact with females of 
childbearing potential and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study drug and to not donate blood, sperm, or semen, .

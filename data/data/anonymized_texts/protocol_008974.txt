COVID-19 
Due to recent developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Collaborative Neuroscience 
Research (the clinical research unit [CRU]) ha s implemented several procedures in accordance 
with the current CDC, WHO, FDA and other public regulatory guidance in order to ensure the safety of patients and CRU staff.  These new measures include ensuring that trial participants test 
negative (or only IgG positive) for COVID-19 before  they are admitted to the CRU, and practicing 
symptom recognition and monitoring for patients before each CRU visit.  Additional COVID-19 
testing may be conducted during the study at the PI’s discretion.  COVID-19 testing and other 
related assessments are not listed in this protocol as they are not specific to this study.  Additional

Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Switching from Oral Risperidone to Risperidone Implant (DLP-114). 
Study Number: DLP-114-03 
Phase: Phase Ib 
Number of Clinical 
Centers: Up to 3 centers in the US 
Study Objective 
(Primary ): To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DLP-114: 
1) Determine the number and percent of patients experiencing a 
treatment-emergent adverse event; 
2) Evaluate the incidence of local site reactions; 
3) Assess the tolerability of im plantation and explantation 
procedures. 
Study Objectives 
(Secondary ): 1) Measure the plasma concentration of risperidone and 9-OH risperidone and active moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone) 
following repeated oral administrations. 
2) Measure the plasma concentration of risperidone and 9-OH 
risperidone and active moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone) 
following switch from oral risperidone to subcutaneous 
implantation of two DLP-114 devices. 
3) Measure exploratory treatment outcomes using 2 psychiatric 
rating scales: the Clinical Gl obal Impression (CGI-I) rating 
scale and the PANSS. 
4) Measure the amount of risperidone  drug substance remaining in 
the DLP-114 reservoir following its removal, in order to 
estimate average daily output and duration. 
5) Determine average depth of devi ce placement a nd any potential 
migration. 
Study Population: Adult male and female patients between 18 and 70 years of age with a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia and st able for at least 2 weeks on 2-3 
mg/day of oral risperidone will be enrolled. 
Patient Number: Two groups of 12-15 schizophrenia patients who are currently on oral 
risperidone therapy (2-3 mg/day), or who are stable on an antipsychotic 
other than oral risperidone (2-3 mg/day) but complete the conversion 
phase, will receive two DLP-114 implants, either the 6-month version 
(Gr 1) or the 12-month version (Gr 2). Therefore, the total number of patients enrolled in the study is estimated to be approximately 24-30.

Study Design/Methods: 
This study is a Phase 1b clinical study of DLP- 114, a Risperidone Implant product. The study is 
an open-label, parallel group design aimed at assessing the safety, tolerability and PK profile of 
two versions of the DLP-114 drug product, alpha 4,  designed to operate for at least 6 months, 
and alpha 7 designed to operate for 12 months.  El igible patients will be assigned to one of two 
groups following completion of th e conversion phase, if applicable, and supervised oral 
risperidone dosing (3mg for 4 days).  Both groups will be switched to 2 DLP-114 devices on 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 9 of 101 
 
Day 1 and safety and PK assessed in parallel for 6 months (G roup 1, alpha 4) or 12 months 
(Group 2, alpha 7).  The study also aims to ev aluate the utility of DL P-114 in achieving a PK 
profile that is comparable to the marketed oral form of risperidone for either 6 months (DLP-
114-α4) or 12 months (DLP-114- α7). 
Subjects receiving an antipsychotic  other than oral risperidone (2 -3 mg/day) will be required to 
enter the conversion phase. During the weekly visits in the conversion phase, subjects will cross-titrate, at the PI’s discretion,  from other antipsychotic(s) to oral risperidone therapy over a 
minimum of 2 weeks. The objective of the oral co nversion phase is for all subjects to achieve an 
oral risperidone dose of 3 mg by Day -14. 
The study will be conducted in four sequential periods for both groups (subjects will either enter 
the conversion phase or the uns upervised oral risperidone [3  mg/day] period) following 
Screening: 
1. Conversion phase (Cross-titration, at the PI’s  discretion, from other antipsychotic(s) to 
oral risperidone therapy over a minimum of 2 weeks to achieve an oral risperidone dose 
of 3 mg by Day -14) 
2. Unsupervised oral risperidone (3 mg/day) 
3. Supervised oral risperidone (3 mg/day)  
4. DLP-114 implant treatment with oral supplement 
5. DLP-114 implant treatment; 
6. Follow-up. 
Each patient enrolled in this study will commence unsupervised dosing with 3 mg/day oral 
risperidone for 3-6 consecutive days, followed  by supervised dosing with 3 mg/day oral 
risperidone for 4 consecutive days. Patients who are stable on an antipsychotic other than oral 
risperidone (2-3 mg/day) will enter the conversion pha se and cross-titrate, at the PI’s discretion, 
from the other antipsychotic(s) to oral risperidone  therapy over a minimum of 2 weeks prior to 
commencing the supervised 3 mg/day oral risp eridone for 4 consecutive days. Following the 
conversion, patients will need to be stable on oral risperidone 2-3 mg/day for at least 2 weeks 
prior to being implanted. PK analysis will be conducted following the fourth dose of supervised 
oral risperidone. Two additional oral doses will  be administered, one on the day immediately 
prior to implant administration, and anothe r one 24 hours after implant administration. 
Following the completion of the oral phase of the study, each patient in Group 1 will be 
implanted with two DLP-114 alpha  4 devices for 183 (± 7) days and each Group 2 patients will 
receive 2 DLP-114 alpha 7 devices for 364 (± 7) days.  24 ho urs after implant administration an 
additional oral dose will  be administered.  PK analysis will be conducted during the first 72 
hours after implant administration and then dail y during the confinement period.  During the 
implant treatment period, patients will return to the clinical facility for outpatient visits for safety 
assessments and sampling for PK. Assessments will  include vital signs, physical examination, 
inspection of the site of DLP-114  implantation, ECG, safety la boratory tests, CGI-I, PANSS, C-
SSRS, BARS, SAS, AIMS, assessment of AEs a nd implant/device events (IDEs), including 
migrations, spontaneous expulsi ons, and other device-related events, and measurement of body 
weight.  
Pregnancy tests will be conducted (female patients only) to m onitor and confirm absence of 
pregnancies. Compliance to study restrictions rela ting to d rug
 s of abuse will also be monitored 
throughout the dosing and implant periods.  If a serious adverse event is observed the active 
moiety concentration will be measured to evaluate the possibility of dose-dumping.

Dose Administration Stopping Ru les for an Individual Subject: 
The Investigator and/or Sponsor may suspend or  terminate dose administration upon any of the 
following events: 
 One occurrence of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) assessed to be probably or possibly 
related to dosing with the investigational product; 
 Two or more severe Adverse Events (AEs) of the same character that are determined to 
be clinically significant by the investigator or sponsor and are asse ssed as probably or 
possibly related to dosing with  the investigational product; 
 Signs of impending relapse 
 
Study Procedures and Assessments:  
Informed Consent.  The Patient Information and Consent Form (PICF) will be provided to the 
study participants at screening, prior to any study procedures being performed.  
Medical History.  Medical history and demographic data , including name, gender, age, race, 
Body Mass Index (BMI) will be recorded at screening. 
Safety Assessments.  This study will assess the safety a nd tolerability of DLP-114. Safety will 
be determined by evaluating physical examinatio ns, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory 
parameters, clinical ratings (e.g. C-SSRS) and adverse events. Local tolerance at the 
implantation site will be examined and sc ored for severity of visible signs of 
irritation/inflammation. If deemed necessary, additional safety measurements will be performed at the discretion of the investig ator (or delegate).  If a serious  adverse event is observed the 
active moiety concentration will be measured to evaluate the possibility of dose-dumping.  The 
following assessments wi ll be completed at selected time points (see Section 14 and Appendix 1  
for details)

include, at a minimum, assessment of the fo llowing systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose 
and throat, respiratory system, cardiovasc ular system, gastrointestinal system, 
neurological condition, blood and lymphatic systems, and the musculoskeletal system.  
 Implantation site inspection will be by visual and physical examination at each 
assessment visit. The physic ian will palpate the device to determine whether it has 
migrated by noting a change in distance from th e incision site to the proximal end of the 
device. Healing of the incision will be monito red. Dermal reactions will be scored on a 
Skin Irritation Scoring System ( Appendix  3) [1] recommended for transdermal dosage 
forms that describes the amount of erythema, edema, and other features indicative of 
irritation. 
 Electrocardiogram. Single 12-le ad ECG will be performed at selected time points. The 
following variables will be provided automatically: RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTcF 
intervals and pulse rate. In case of evident bad quality (muscle tremor) of the tracing, the 
ECG will be repeated. All ECGs should be obtained prio r to vital signs and blood

Statistics and Data Analyses: 
Sample Size Considerations.  The maximum sample size is 24-30. The primary objective of this 
study is to determine safety a nd tolerability of two versions of the DLP-114 implant (one 
designed for 6 months and the othe r designed to operate for 1 year) and as such the sample size 
for this study was based upon qualitative considerations. No formal sample size calculations 
were performed.  
Demographic Data.  For all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) will be performed for age, 
gender, body mass index, weight, and height.  
Safety/Tolerability Data. All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment will be 
included in the safety and tolerability analys is. Baseline for all vi tal signs, 12-lead ECG 
measurements, and clinical labora tory assessments will be defined as the last evaluation done 
before the start of study treatmen t administration on Day -5. Safety evaluations  will be based on 
the incidence, intensity and type of AE and cl inically significant ch anges in the patient’s 
physical examination findings, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical  laboratory results. Safety

variables will be tabulated and presented fo r all patients who receive study treatment. 
Abnormalities in clinical laborat ory, vital signs, and ECG will be based on pre-defined normal 
ranges and will be tabulated by study treatmen t showing patient counts and percentages. The 
original terms used in the CRF by investigators to identify AEs will be coded using the current 
version of the Medical Dictionary of Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA). The percentage of 
patients with treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized for each treatment. Laboratory data 
will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. Normal reference ranges and markedly abnormal results will be used in the summary of laboratory data. Raw data and change from 
baseline in clinical laboratory parameters wi ll be summarized using descriptive statistics. A 
listing of patients with any laboratory results  outside the reference ranges that are deemed 
clinically significant will be provided. 
Pharmacokinetic Data.  Plasma concentrations of risperid one, 9-OH risperidone and active 
moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone) determined  at specified time points will be used to 
calculate PK parameters. Data will be listed for all patients with available plasma concentrations 
of risperidone, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ri speridone, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety (risperidone + 
9 OH risperidone) will be calculated using non-c ompartmental analysis. Listing of individual 
patient plasma concentrations, ac tual blood sampling times, and PK parameters and graphs of 
concentration vs. time will be prepared by st udy treatment. Plasma concentrations and PK 
parameters will be summarize d by and compared between stu dy treatments using descriptive 
statistics. Statistical analysis will be perfo rmed on the pharmacokinetic parameters using 
validated statistical software. If a serious adverse event is observed the active moiety 
concentration will be measured to evaluate the possibility of dose-dumping.

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Background Information 
Risperidone is an antipsychotic whose primary therapeutic activity is postulated to be mediated 
through a combination of dopamine Type 2 (D 2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT 2) antagonism.  
Risperidone is currently marketed as immediate-rele ase tablets, orally disi ntegrating tablets, an 
oral solution and as a long-acting intramuscular injection.  
DLP-114 is a Risperidone Implant that is a combination drug-device product designed to 
continuously elute the equivale nt of a daily 1-2 mg oral dose of risperidone following 
subcutaneous implantation. The device is implanted in a quadrant of the abdomen at least 5cm 
from midline and 5 cm below the ribs, using a sterile disposable impl anter tool and local 
anesthesia in a minimally invasive procedure. 
Each DLP-114 device consists of a hollow cylindrical titanium reservoir (similar in materials, size 
and shape, to other approved implants) that is  fitted on each end with a cap containing a 0.1 
micron membrane and filled with tablets of a homogenous powder form of risperidone plus a two-
time molar excess of para-ami nobenzoic acid (PABA). To aid with tableting the formulation, 
PVP40 and stearic acid are added. Drug rele ase is achieved by a novel passive diffusion 
mechanism initiated by the introduction of sterile  saline.  Two versions of the DLP-114 device 
will be tested in the IND study.  The devices ar e loaded with the same risperidone formulation 
(RISP/PABA 1:2), are the same diameter, have the same membrane diffusive surface area, but 
differ in the length of the reservoir and in vivo operating period.  DLP-114- α4 is 44 mm in length 
and designed to operate for 6 months. DLP-114- α7 is 50 mm long and designed to operate for 12 
months. 
7.2 Proposed Clinical Application  
Risperidone, is currently approved for acute and maintenance therapy of schizophrenia and, as 
monotherapy or adjunctively, in the acute treatment of Bipolar Disorder I. It is also approved for 
the management of irritability in pediatric a nd adolescent patients with autistic disorder. The 
DLP-114 drug-device is appropriate  for maintenance therapy rather than acute therapy and thus it 
is being developed as a maintenance tr eatment for schizophrenia in adults. 
7.3 Non-clinical Safety, Toxicology and Pharmacokinetics 
The PK and local tolerance of DLP-114 has been tested preclinically in two species, rat and 
rabbit.  A total of 7 non-clinical studies have  been completed testing the Pharmacokinetics, 
Toxicity and Tissue Comp atibility of DLP-114.  Table 1  below provides a summary of the 
studies conducted.

DLP-ASR-0012:  This study was proposed to compare different formulations, 
mechanisms, and devices in order to optimize risp eridone output. It compared 3 types of devices 
(α1, α2, and α3), as well as the pre-clinical prototype device for comparison. Formulations 
included risperidone hexanoate sa lts mixed with PLGA copolyme rs, and risperidone free based 
mixed with molar excesses of 2 or 3 time pa ra-aminobenzoic acid (PAB A). The devices were 
implanted for 119 or 183 days, and evaluated by plasma concentration over time, clinal 
observations, and post-explant tissue necropsy an d histopathology. From the PK it can be 
concluded that the output from single ended devices is not optimal, and that a double-ended device is likely needed to achieve sufficient outp ut for a clinical device. The risperidone PABA 
output from the double-ended devices had a burst e ffect in groups 8-10, but the output achieved 
steady state by week 2, at about 3 times below the C
max. The plasma concentration remained fairly 
flat for the remainder of the implant period. The average plasma concentrations of groups 8 and 9 
were, and both were higher than that of group 10. Taken together, these results indicate the best 
clinical product for risperidone using this technology would be risperidone with a 2-fold molar excess of PABA. It was also noted that the device was well tolerated in rats, with one self 
explantation (Group 10, α1 device), but otherwise no advers e treatment-related clinical 
observations and no (score of 1 out of 5) to mild (score of 2 out of 5) local tissue reactivity at 
necropsy.  
 
DLP-ASR-0013: This study was proposed to study the viability of a risperidone PABA 2 
times molar excess formulation over a 9 month pe riod in rats, as well as to compare that 
formulation with a previously us ed formulation, “Mix C”, and to a formulation that involved a 
diprotic acid, sebacic acid. This study also in cluded the use of an ALZET pump configured to 
released risperidone acetate at a rate equivalent to 1mg of risper idone base/day for 30 days. The 
ALZET group was mainly used to correlate plasma concentrations of risperidone active moiety to 
a known control. The devices were implanted fo r 124, 180, or 278 days, and evaluated by plasma 
concentration over time, clinal observations, and post-explant tiss ue necropsy and histopathology. 
Based on the PK profile, it was estimate that the lifespan of the risperidone PABA device ( α2 
device loaded with 480mg of risperidone PABA 1: 2) was 8 months before it dipped below the 50 
ng/ml threshold. This study again reiterated th at the device is well tolerated with minimal 
discomfort and no test-article related clinical observations or  adverse body weight effects. One 
animal self-explanted on Day 231. Necropsy findings found no to mild inflammation in the tissue 
surrounding the implant site.

DLP-ASR-0014: This study was proposed to study wh ether implanting additional devices 
resulted in a linear increase in plasma concentration in vivo.  This study also compared devices 
made by Delpor, and those made by a CMO, Hantel , to determine if manufacturing transfer was 
successful. The devices were implanted for 92 da ys, and evaluated by plasma concentration over 
time, clinal observations, and post-explant ti ssue necropsy and histopathology. Based off the 
results of this study comparing devices prepared by Delpor and those prepared by the CMO, the 
transfer of the production process to the CMO wa s successful. This study demonstrated that the 
doses of DLP-114 can be additive; by comparing the plasma concentrations of this study against 
those of group 9 from DLP-ASR-0012, we can see that animals implanted with two devices had 
approximately double the plasma concentration of those implanted with one device. It was also 
noted that rats may not be an appropriate speci es for studying the implantation of two devices, 
given the one complete and two partial expl antations during the study in the double implant 
groups. Local tissue reactivity ranged from no reactiv ity to moderate reactivity (score of 3 out of 
5). One animal (2005) was discovered moribund and subject to euthanasia per veterinary 
guidelines; it is unclear whether this adverse ev ent was related to the implant device. Otherwise, 
there were no adverse treatment-related clinical observations.  
 
DLP-ASR-0015: This GLP study was proposed in or der to study the pharmacokinetics, 
safety, and tissue compatibilit y of DLP-114 in female New Z ealand White (NZW) rabbits. Two 
rabbits were implanted with an empty placebo de vice, while eight were im planted with a single 
DLP-114 device. The devices were implanted for 30 days, and evaluated by plasma concentration 
over time, clinal observations, and post-explant tissue necropsy and hist opathology. Based on the 
results of this study, surgical subcutaneous implantation of a single α2 device containing the 
placebo (1X PBS) or the test arti cle (RISP/PABA 1:2, ~250 mg of active drug/device) in the inter 
scapular region of the New Zealand White rabbits  was well tolerated and did not result in 
evidence of overt toxicity (animal observation or body weight changes) or evidence that the 
device caused physical irritation or discomfort (control or test device). In fact, there were no 
visible indications that the animals were aware of the presence of the device. Gross necropsies 
conducted 30 days post-implantation revealed ei ther no visual inflammatory response in the 
tissues surrounding the device (both control animals and 2 of 7 risperidone treated animals), or a 
slight to moderate tissue res ponse (remaining 5 of 7 risperi done treated animals). Capsule 
formation surrounding the implant in each anim al was clear and thin. Histopathology was 
conducted on the tissues taken directly adjacent to the test or placebo device. The pathologist 
concluded that the slow-release risperidone implants (RISP/PABA  1:2, 250 mg of active drug) 
produced significantly more inflammation in the subc utis of the test rabbits than was evident in 
the control rabbits. The lesions were  consistent with persistent irritation resulting in necrosis of 
the adipocytes, pyogranulomatous inflammation and he aling by fibrosis. However, it is important 
to note that the microscopic findings are for tissue taken directly adjacent to the test or control 
device. As is evidenced in the photos, the ar eas of inflammation were visibly very small and 
sometimes not visible at all (control and test animal s).  In addition, the clinical observations did 
not reveal any evidence that the devices caused physical irritation or discomfort to any animals 
(control or test device). One animal broke its back on day 1 dur ing a restrained blood draw, was 
euthanized and therefore excluded from PK analysis.  
 
DLP-ASR-0016: This non-GLP study was proposed in order to investigate whether a 
change in hydration medium from 1X PBS to 0.9% saline affected device performance. This 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 28 of 101 
 
study also utilized the same lot of DLP-114 that wa s used in the first-in-man study of DLP-114 in 
Australia. The devices were impl anted for 273 days, and evaluated by plasma concentration over 
time, clinal observations, and pos t-explant tissue necropsy and hist opathology. The results of this 
study indicate that there is no difference in PK prof ile between devices hydrated with PBS or with 
saline, and that all devices were  well tolerated. These devices were the same devices used in a 
clinical trial, allowing for an important compar ison between output in rats and output in humans. 
The average tissue reactivity score was between  no inflammation and mild inflammation (1.6), 
and output was 0.5-0.6 mg/device/day. No adverse treatment-related clini cal observations were 
reported, again demonstrating tolerance of exte nded implantation with the DLP-114 device.  
 
DLP-ASR-0019: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether lowering the 
percentage of PVP used in the formulation as a binder influenced device performance. A lower 
amount of PVP would leave more room for risperi done to be loaded in the final product, allowing 
for a longer effective life of th e product. The wt% of PVP was investigated at 12% in one group 
and 5% in another. The devices were implanted for 183 (group 1) or 364 (group 2) days, and 
evaluated by plasma concentration over time , clinal observations, and post-explant tissue 
necropsy and histopathology. The results of this study indicate there was no difference between 
devices filled with a drug formulation compos ed of 12% PVP and one composed of 5% PVP. 
This allows for a longer life of  the device, reflecting the longer implant lengths of group 2. The 
devices were again well tolerated (average necrop sy score 1.5), with implantation lasting up to 
364 days. There was one spontaneous explantation in group 2. There were no adverse treatment-
related clinical obser vations otherwise.  
 
DLP-ASR-0020: This GLP study compared the device used in Delpor’s first-in-man 
clinical trial, α2, with the same formulation in a longer  device with a larger exposed membrane 
area, α4, and a formulation with a 3 fold molar exce ss of PABA (RISP/PABA 1:3) in the larger 
α4 device. This study also included a placebo α4 group. The purpose of this study was to 
determine whether the larger α4 device is well tolerated, and whether an increase in the ratio of 
risperidone to PABA influenced device performanc e. It had been previously noted from clinical 
data that PABA was leaving the device faster than risperidone, so by increasing PABA the 
longevity of the device might be increased. The devices were implanted for 182 days, and 
evaluated by plasma concentration over time , clinal observations, and post-explant tissue 
necropsy and histopathology. The release rate s based on mass balance between the two 
RISP/PABA 1:2 groups was similar, 0.64mg/day and 0.72mg/day respectively for α2 and α 4. The 
release rate was lower for the RISP/PABA 1:3 formulation in the α4 device, at 0.57mg/day. It can 
be concluded that drug release rate  is approximately 10% higher for α4 devices compared with 
α2, and that RISP/PABA 1:2 in an α4 device is the best option for developing a long-acting, 
effective clinical product. RISP/PABA 1:3 resulted  in a depressed output of risperidone, making it 
a suboptimal formulation.

ISO Subcutaneous Implan tation Study in Rabbits, 13 Week and 26 Week Implantation Report 
– Implant Device 
Testing was completed with seven New Zealand White Rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ), 
3-3.3kg at selection. Each animal was implante d with four DLP-114 devices using the Delpor 
implanter tool and four negative  control articles. At 13 week, three rabbits were euthanized and 
the tissue surrounding the implant and control devi ces was examined. At 26 weeks, the remaining 
animals were euthanized and the tissue surr ounding the implant and control devices was 
examined. Clinical observations were recorded throughout the duration of the study. The negative 
control article was USP high density polyethylene (HDPE). Tissues were ma croscopically studied 
and scored from 0 (lowest) to 4 (h ighest) on encapsulation and irritation.  
No major clinical observations were reported. Two animals had small amounts of 
alopecia, two had reduced feces, and one had a dry,  red, scaly lesion on the left rear foot for two 
days. Macroscopic observations showed no visible reaction at any test or control site in either the 
13-week group or the 26-week group. Microscopic observation caused a minimal or no reaction 
as compared to the negative control article in  both the 13-week group and the 26-week group. See 
the NAMSA GLP report TI249_826/S  for detailed results.

Cytotoxicity Study Using the ISO Elution Method – Implant Device 
Testing was completed on the DLP-114 devi ce prepared in single strength Minimum 
Essential Medium (IX MEM) at 37°C for 72 hours.  The negative control, reagent control, and 
positive control were similarly extracted (see Del por internal report RPT-1151 for more detail on 
extraction). Triplicate monolayers of L-929 mouse fibroblast cells were dosed with each extract 
and incubated at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 48 hours. Following incubation, the 
monolayers were examined microscopically for abnormal cell morphology and cellular 
degeneration.  
The test article extract showed no evidence of causing cell lysis or toxicity. The test article 
extract met the requirements of the test since the grade was less than a grade 2 (mild reactivity).

Extractables and Leachabl es Chemical Characterization – Implant Device 
The test article, Delpor Device, was extracted (exhaustively) in Purified Water, Acidified 
Water, Isopropanol, and Hexane. The resulting ex tracts were analyzed by Gas Chromatography – 
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOC), Headspace – Gas 
Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (HS-GC-MS)  for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and 
Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - Ultraviolet Spectrometry - Mass Spectrometry 
(UPLC-UV-MS) for Non-Volatile Organic Com pounds (NVOC). The Purified Water (PW) test 
article extract was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectr ometry (ICP-MS) for 
ions and metals/elements. A breakdown of the ex traction method can be seen in RPT-1151 and in 
NAMSA report C0839_002/s.   
Eleven characterized substances  or groups of substances we re identified as extractables 
from the DLP-114 implantable device at levels above the detection limit. An independent 
consultant (Gad Consulting Servi ces) reviewed the results of the chemical characterization, and 
came to the determination that th e substances listed should not pres ent a potential risk to patients 
for any duration of implantation to include lifetime exposure.  Please see Appendix A of RPT-
1151 for the full report on the safety of the results from extractables and leachables testing.

7.4 Clinical Experience 
Delpor has completed a first-in-m an ex-US PK/safety study of the DLP-114 device in Australia.  
This was a pilot 4-month trial of the 2 RISP/PABA 1:2 device in healthy subjects implanted in 
the arm with a single device using the clinical im planter tool.  After twelve subjects completed the 
study, an extension of the study (n=5) was a dded to bridge the alpha-2 RISP/PABA 1:2 and 
alpha-4 RISP/PABA 1:3.  
A total of seventeen subjects were dosed with the DLP-114 (12 with the α2 RISP/PABA 1:2 and 
5 with α4 RISP/PABA 1:3). PK analysis shows the averag e plasma levels are more variable in the 
first few weeks but settle into a steady state of about 6-7 ng/mL after Day 40 until the end of the 
dosing period at Day 123. 
The DLP-114 plasma values are in line with the exposure seen following a single 1 mg oral dose; 
the observed average C max is lower for the DLP-114- 2 device relative to the 1.0 mg oral dose. 
Conversely, the C min is higher for the DLP-114- 2 than for the oral dose. Mass balance analysis 
on devices removed from first 12 subjects who ha ve completed the implan t period indicate the 
average output is 1.01  0.10 mg/day. Plasma levels fall below the LLOQ within 12-24 hours 
after device removal.  
The insertion procedure was well-tolerated and in cisions healed within a week or two.  No 
device-related serious AEs were repor ted.  Mild to moderate AEs at  the implantation site included 
bruising, itching and pain in some subjects.  Risperidone effects in cluded weight gain and 
prolactinemia. Punch biopsies of the implantation site in the first two subjects after device 
removal revealed no clinically significant infl ammation.  One subject developed cellulitis two 
months into the implant phase of the study. Al though the reaction was not rated as serious and 
responded to antibiotics, the PI felt the reaction was related to the device and to observe maximum caution in a volunteer study, the device was removed on Day 70.  It was noted for this 
participant, who had a relatively low BMI, that  the implanted device fo rmed a prominent bulge 
under the skin of the arm that the participant repor ted “touching” during the study.  It is believed 
that the lack of subcutaneous fat tissue and the relatively thin superficial fascia in the arm 
rendered the site problematic in as much as the layer between the skin and muscle was not sufficiently thick to comfortably accommodate the 5 mm OD device in this low BMI individual. 
This observation has prompted switching the implant site for this IND study to the abdomen 
where the subcutaneous fat/superficial fascia layer is generally thicker and the surface area 
available for implantation is greater.   
7.5 Risk/Benefit Assessment and Guidance for Investigators 
Eligible schizophrenia pa tients will be stable on 2-3 mg/day oral risperidone for at least 2 weeks, 
or will be stable on an antipsyc hotic other than oral risperidone (2-3 mg/day) but complete the 
conversion phase. Patients stable on 2-3 mg/day oral risperidone will be instructed to take oral 
risperidone (3 mg/day, unsupervised dosing) startin g on Day -7. At the PI’s discretion, if patient 
has been screened, patient can co mmence oral dosing of risperidone (3 mg/day, unsupervised) as 
early as Day -10. Patients stable on an antipsycho tic other than oral risperidone (2-3 mg/day) will 
be required to complete the conversion phase prior to beginning the unsupervised dosing on Day -7. During the conversion phase, subjects will cros s-titrate, at the PI’s  discretion, from other 
antipsychotic(s) to oral risperidone therapy over a minimum of 2 weeks. Starting on Day -4, all 
patients will continue taking oral risperidone under supervision.  Implantation of DLP-114 will 
follow the oral risperidone treatment. E xposure following implantation of two DLP-114 is

expected to be comparable to that of a 2-3 mg/day oral risperidone dose for 6 or 12 months.  Rat 
PK studies suggests exposure may be greater the first few weeks following implantation.  Also, 
following implantation in rats, a “burst” effect has been observed, with the highest plasma level observed 2 days following implantation ( 3 x higher than the steady state reached in the first 
week of implantation).  This initial burst is not seen in rabbits or human subjects. 
Dose dumping is considered unlikely. The total am ount of risperidone loaded into each DLP-114 
device is ~360 mg in an alpha-4 device and ~435  mg in an alpha-7 device. The device has a 
robust design and functional testing regimen, and there have been no PK or mass balance signals 
suggestive of dose dumping in preclinical in vivo  studies or clinical studies to date. Examination 
of devices removed from animals and human subjects after 4-12 mont hs showed no evidence of in 
vivo membrane rupture or comp romised reservoir or seals.  
Premarketing experience with oral risperidone includes eight reports of acute overdose with 
estimated doses ranging from 20 to 300 mg and no fatalities. In general, reported signs and 
symptoms resulting from an overdose were thos e resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's 
known pharmacological effe cts, i.e., drowsiness and sedatio n, tachycardia, hypotension and 
extrapyramidal symptoms. 
All components of the DLP-114 device that are dire ctly exposed to tissues have been shown to be 
biocompatible. The mechanism of  release from DLP-114 is passive diffusion. The device permits 
diffusion of water-soluble forms of risperidone ac ross its membranes (driven by the concentration 
gradient created between the reservoir volume a nd the interstitial fluid), while retaining the 
insoluble suspension within the reservoir. The re servoir dimensions, housing material, finish and 
shape are modeled directly after Viadur, an FD A-approved osmotic implant. [1] The system is 
designed for subcutaneous implantation using a sterile disposable implanter tool and a minimally 
invasive procedure similar to that used for Viadur and Vantas [1, 2]. DLP-114 is implanted 
subcutaneously with local anesthesia in a quadrant of the abdomen. Implant removal is 
straightforward; the polished titanium  surface has low tissue binding. 
Some local inflammation observed at the site of implantation in rats and more prominently in 
rabbits was only observed at histopa thology and did not result in a ny visible swelling or erythema 
on the skin surface. Subcutaneous inflammation is  common among injectable sustained release 
products with acidic formulati ons. These products are well-tolera ted and such inflammation is 
reversible.  Histopathology conducted on two sentinel subjects in Delpor’s ex-US Phase 1 study 
showed no clinically significant inflammation following 4 months exposure.  
Potential adverse events that may be observed in this study due to implantation of the device 
include the following: 
 Pain at the site of implantation; 
 Skin irritation at the site of implantation; 
 Local tissue and blood vessel injuries; 
 Hematoma; 
 Local and/or systemic microbial infections; 
 Seroma. 
The distribution, metabolism, excret ion, and systemic effects of risperidone are expected to be the 
same regardless of the route of administration (oral Risperdal, in tramuscular Risperdal Consta or 
subcutaneous implant DLP-114). Several studies have reported risperidone-associated adverse 
effects such as hyperprolactinem ia, weight gain, extrapyramidal  symptoms, and other adverse 
effects in patients with schizophrenia.

Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were 
reported in patients (mean age 85 years; range 73-97)  in trials of risperidone in elderly patients 
with dementia-related psychosis. These observations are the origin of the label warning of 
increased mortality among elderly patients taking risperidone. Elderly will be excluded from this 
clinical trial. 
Para-aminobenzoic acid (4-amino benzoic acid , PABA), is an excipient in the DLP-114 
drug/device product. PABA is an in termediate in the synthesis of folate by bacteria, plants, and 
fungi [3, 4] . Many bacteria, including those found in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli , 
generate PABA. PABA has been used as a component of sunscreens, and, given orally, as a 
diagnostic marker. It is a food additive. Clinical evidence sugges t oral PABA provides benefit as 
an antifibrotic. Small amounts of  PABA are found in cereal, eggs , milk and meats. Detectable 
amounts are normally present in human blood, spinal fluid, urine, and sweat [5]. The total amount 
of PABA loaded into a single DLP-114 implant is 240 mg for the α4 and 290 mg for the α 7 
device. The α4 implant is expected to operate for at least 6 months whereas the α7 is designed to 
operate for at least one year, el uting risperidone at a fairly constant rate throughout the period. 
PABA release from the DLP-114 implant parallels that of risperidone, in an apparent 2:1 
stochiometric relationship. Assuming the PABA release is constant, exposure following 
implantation of a single DLP-114 implant is project ed to be less than 1 mg/day. The projected 
daily exposure of PABA for each study patient is projected not to exceed that of one application 
of a 2% PABA sunscreen (3 mg becoming systemi cally bioavailable) or the consumption of seven 
servings of Brussel sprouts or peas (0.8 to 1.0 mg of total PABA). The exposure to the amount of 
PABA included in the DLP-114 is not expected to pose any significant safety risk to patients. 
PVP is used as a binder to aid tableting of  the DLP-114 risperidone drug formulation. 
Approximately 32 mg of PVP40 is included in each DLP-114 α4 implant and 40 mg in each α7 
device. PVP is used in cosmetic formulations, food additives and pharmace utics. PVP is approved 
as a food additive and clarifying agent for beve rages and beer. PVP is added to wine up to 60ppm 
(21CFR173.55), so a 750 ml bottle of wine could contain up to 45 mg PVP. PVP is used as a 
binder to create tablets of a wi de variety of oral drug products including acyclovir, ibuprofen, 
magaldrate, nystatin, phenytoin, trim ethoprim, sulfonamides and antibiotics. PVP dissolved at a 
concentration of 3.5% in buffered saline  has been used as a plasma substitute in emergency 
battlefield situations and surgery. A lower mo lecular weight PVP is included in intravenous 
formulations of antineoplastic drugs. The exposure to the amount of PVP included in the DLP-
114 is not expected to pose any sign ificant safety risk to patients. 
A small amount of stearic acid is include d in each DLP-114 device (~12 mg in the α4 device and 
~16 mg for the α7 device) as a lubricant to aid tableting of the formulation. Stearic acid is a 
ubiquitous fatty acid found in food and tissues. It is used in food with no limitation other than 
current good manufacturing practice. This ingredient is generally recognized as safe as a direct 
human food ingredient (21CFR 184.1090). The average intake of stearic acid is 5.7 g/day (8.1% of total fat) for women and 8.2 g/day (8.4% of  total fat) for men, according to data from 
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2001-2002 [6].  The exposure to 
the amount of stearic acid included in the DLP-114 is  not expected to pose any significant safety 
risk to patients. 
The patients enrolled in this study are expected to benefit by maintaining plasma levels on the 
implant comparable to plasma levels achieved on their oral risperidone.   
The study is being conducted with schizophrenia pa tients who are stable on oral risperidone (2-3 
mg/day) for at least 2 weeks.  Preclinical and clin ical evidence indicate the operating lifetime of 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 38 of 101 
 
the DLP-114 α4 will be at least 6 months and the α7 device will operate for at least 1 year, but 
this is not certain, the drug and/or the acid (w hich is needed to deploy the drug) may run out 
before 6 months for the alpha 4 device or 12 mo nths for the alpha 7, and the patient may be 
underdosed, particularly in the later part of the dosing period. To safeguard an individual subject, 
stopping rules will include signs of  impending relapse including:  
 Hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia; 
 Increase (worsening) of the PANSS of ≥30% from baseline. PANSS T score confirmed at 
a second visit conducted within 1-7 days; 
 Clinically significant emergent or worsening su icidal, homicidal, or aggressive behavior; 
 A CGI-I Improvement (CGI-I) score of 6 (much wo rse) or 7 (very much worse) after start 
of study; 
 A need for additional antipsychotic treatment following the conversion phase, with the 
exception of protocol-permitte d short-term add-on therapy (in the instance that the 
investigator believes that the subject is  not experiencing a true exacerbation of 
schizophrenia, a supplemental an tipsychotic may be used for a maximum of 14 days upon 
consultation with the medical monitor.)

For a detailed description of the schedule of assessments refer to Section 14  (Study Conduct 
Schedules and Guidelines) and Appendix 1 (Overall Schedule of Assessments). 
For a detailed description of blood collection ti mes (including time point windows) refer to 
Appendix 2  (Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Schedule). 
 Unsupervised oral risperidone period (Day -7 to -5) 
Eligibility in the study requires that  patients have been stable on 2-3 mg/day oral risperidone for 
at least 2 weeks.  Starting on Day -7, and as early as Day -10 at the PI’s discretion, patients who 
are currently on oral risperidone therapy (2-3 mg/d ay) will be instructed to take a dose of 3  
mg/day oral risperidone (unsupervised), daily through Study Day -5. 
 Oral risperidone conversion phase (minim um of 2 weeks prior to implant) 
Patients who are stable on an antipsychotic othe r than oral risperidone (2-3 mg/day) will cross-
titrate, at the PI’s discretion, from the other antipsychotic(s) to oral risperidone therapy over a 
minimum of 2 weeks. The objective of the oral co nversion phase is for all subjects to achieve an 
oral risperidone dose of 3 mg by Day -14. 
 Supervised oral risperidone period (days -4 to 1) 
On Days -4, -3 and -2 all patients will be require d to attend the clinical facility for outpatient 
visits to receive a dose of 3 mg/day oral risperi done (under the supervision of the clinical facility 
staff) and safety assessments. 
On the morning of Day -1 patients will be admitte d and confined to the clinical facility overnight 
and for a period of 7 days. Following admission each  patient will receive an additional supervised 
oral dose of risperidone (3 mg). PK samples will be collected pre-dose and at a number of time 
points following the fourth dose of oral risperid one. On the morning of Day 1 (immediately after 
the 24-hour PK sample, and immediately before  the DLP-114 implantation), another oral dose 
will be administered (3 mg). 
 
 DLP-114 implant treatment period with  oral supplement (Days 1 to 2) 
Patients will be assigned to Group 1 (DLP-114- α4) or Group 2 (DLP-114- α7).  On Day 1, 
following measurements of vital signs and collection of a pre-implanta tion blood samples (for 
PK), each Group 1 patient will be implanted with two DLP-114- α4 and each Group 2 patient with 
2 DLP-114- α7 devices. Following implantation, vital si gns will be monitore d, an ECG will be 
administered and safety laborator y tests will be performed. PK samples will be collected at 
several time points after DLP-114  implantation. A fina l oral dose of risperidone (3mg) will be 
administered 24 hours after implantation 
 
 DLP-114 implant treatment period (days 2-183 [± 7] for Gr 1, or days 2-365 [± 7] for Gr 
2) 
Patients will remain in the clin ical facility for 72 hours post-implan tation and will be discharged 
no later than Day 7. PK samples will be coll ected each day during the confinement period and on 
the day of discharge. 
Both groups will return to the clinical facility for outpatient vi sits once every week for safety 
assessments and PK sampling during the first 4 week s after implantation (i.e ., days 7, 14, and 28) 
 Study Protocol

and bi-weekly after that. Safety assessments will include vital signs, measurement of body 
weight, assessment of AE s, C-SSRS, review of con meds, and inspection of DLP-114 implant site 
at every visit. Other safety assessments (performed  less frequently) will include a urine drug test, 
urine pregnancy test (female subjects only), sa fety lab test (blood and urine), ECG, CGI-I, 
PANSS, BARS, SAS, and AIMS (see Appendix 1 . Overall Schedule of Assessments). 
An ultrasound will be conducted on day 14 and prior to implant removal in order to assess the 
depth of the implanted device and any pos sible vertical migration over time. 
Assessments may be performed more frequently than what’s stated in Appendix 1  based on the 
PI’s discretion. If a serious adverse event is obs erved the active moiety concentration will be 
measured to evaluate the possibility of dose-dumping. 
On the morning of Day 183 [± 7 days] ( α4 Group 1) or Day 364 [± 7 days] (α 7 Group 2) patients 
will attend the clinical facility for the remo val of the DLP-114 implants. Vital signs and body 
weight will be obtained and a PK sample collected prior to the removal of the implant. Following 
the removal of the implant, vital signs will be mo nitored, safety laboratory tests will be conducted 
and a number of PK samples collected. Patients will be confined to the clinical facility for 2 
nights and will be discharged on the followin g day (Day 185 [± 7 days] for Group 1 or Day 366 
[± 7 days] for Group 2) following inspection of the implant site, a complete  physical exam, safety 
review and PK sampling.  It may not be practical  to schedule the exact explantation date at the 
time of patient enrollment (i.e ., 6-12 months in advance).  As a result, the target date of 
explantation may be adjusted [± 7 days] in or der to accommodate potential scheduling conflicts 
with the physician responsible for the explantation procedure.  In the event that the explantation 
date is adjusted, all the target dates following explantation will also be adjusted accordingly. 
 Follow-up and End of Study Visits (7  days [±1] after device removal) 
Patients will return to the clin ical facility 3 days post implan t removal (Day 186 for Group 1 and 
Day 367 for Group 2) for safety assessme nts and collection of PK samples.  
Each patient’s participati on in this study will conclude on Day 190 (Group 1, α4) or Day 371 
Group 2, α 7), 7 days post implant removal. Patients will attend the clinical facility for final safety 
assessments, including vital si gns, an abbreviated physical ex amination, inspection of the 
implantation site, body weight, and AE assessment/review.  
9.2 Dose Administration Stopping Rules for an Individual Subject 
The PI and/or Sponsor may suspend or terminat e dose administration upon any of the following 
events: 
 One occurrence of a Serious Adverse Event (S AE) assessed to be probably or possibly 
related to dosing with the investigational product;

clinically significant by the investigator or sponsor and are assessed as probably or 
possibly related to dosing with  the investigational product; 
 If four or more patients experience the same  or similar moderate intensity AE which is 
possibly or probably related to  the investigational product (or device), the sponsor and the 
investigator will review all available safe ty data and will recommend if dosing should 
continue. 
 Signs of impending relapse, including:

9.7 Study Design Rationale  
This study design aims to  establish the safety and tolera bility of the DLP-114 implant and 
investigate the feasibility of switching from oral  risperidone treatment to DLP-114 implant-based 
treatment.  
The open-label, parallel group de sign is intended to show comparable plasma risperidone PK 
when patients switch from 3 mg oral Risperdal® to either 1) DLP-114- α4 for 6 months (Group 1) 
or 2) DLP-114- α7 for one year (Group 2). 
Several safety assessments includi ng vital signs, ECG, safety labor atory tests, regular inspections 
of the implantation site and AE monitoring are incl uded in the design in order to minimize risk for 
the patients and obtain appropriate set of safety  data to address the study primary objective.  
Given the primary Central Nervous System (CNS) effects of ri speridone, caution should be used 
when this drug is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. In order to minimize the 
risk of CNS acting drug interactions, prescription/non-prescription drugs  and drugs of abuse 
restrictions have been included with appropriate tests conducted throughout the study to ensure 
compliance. 
Risperidone has been classified in US FDA pregnancy category C: Animal reproduction studies 
have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and ther e are no adequate and well-controlled studies in 
humans, but potential benefits ma y warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential 
risks. Given this classification, this study will ai m to mitigate against Exposure In Utero Events 
(EIU). Inclusion/exclusion criteria and study restrictions relating to contraception, as well as pregnancy tests have been in cluded in the study design.

12 ADMINISTRATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS  
 Oral Risperidone Administration 
Risperidone tablets must be taken approximate ly 1 hour prior to any food consumption at 
approximately the same time each morning.  
On Day -7, or as early as Day -10 at the PI’s discretion, through Day -5, patients who are 
currently on oral risperidone thera py (2-3 mg/day) will self-administer 3 mg/day oral risperidone. 
During the conversion phase, subjects who are stable on an antipsychotic other than oral 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 52 of 101 
 
risperidone (2-3 mg/day) will be tapered off their current 
antipsychotic and titrated, at the PI’s discretion, to oral 
Risperidone 3 mg/day. Subjects wi ll be dispensed a sufficient 
quantity of oral risperidone to la st until the next scheduled study 
visit (+/- 3 days). Oral risperidone 1 mg to 3 mg/day will be 
self-administered at the inve stigator’s discretion in the 
conversion phase, either unsuper vised or under the supervision 
of the investigator or other trained designee. Compliance with oral study medication will be monitored by tablet counts. Subjects who are noncompliant wi th oral study medication, in 
the Investigator’s judgment, are to be counselled on the importance of adhering to the daily administra tion schedule 
On Days -4 to -1, patient will self-administer 3 mg/day oral 
risperidone
 in the clinical facility under the supervision of the 
investigator or other trained designee.  
Each oral dose of risperidone  will be administered with 
a full cup (approximately 240 mL) of non-carbonated 
room temperature water.  
Tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed, 
divided, dissolved or crushed.  
Oral risperidone will be taken daily for 6 days as 
follows:  
 Day -4 to Day 2 (6 days) – 3 mg/day 
The penultimate dose of oral ri speridone will be administered 
immediately prior to the DLP-114 implantation, and the final dose 
of oral risperidone, will be administered 24 hours after the DLP-114 
implantation.  The exact dates and times and dose of each study drug 
administration will be recorded in the CRF. 
 DLP-114 Implantation 
Each DLP-114 device is activated by  the end-user on site. A detailed 
description of the hydration protocol is given in the DLP-114 
Instruction for Use. One precaution to ensure proper hydration is to 
inspect the vials following introduction of saline. A bubble is 
expected to form in the vial as shown in Figure 4A . Any larger 
bubble would indicate inadequate hydration and the device should 
not be used.  A bubble size indicator is included on the vial label which allows the user to check if the bubble size is acceptable ( Figure 4B and 4C ) 
 Subcutaneous implantation of two DLP-114 devices (either α4 or α 7) will be performed by a 
qualified medical professional with experien ce conducting minor surgical procedures.  
The DLP-114 devices will be implanted in a quad rant of the abdomen 5 cm from midline and 5 
cm from the ribs using a sterile disposable impl anter tool and local anesthesia in a minimally 
invasive procedure similar to that of other approved drug device products. Refer to the  “Device 
Instructions for Use” for a guide on proper handling and application of the Implanter Tool for  
Figure 4B: The IFU provides guidance on 
how to check the hydration bubble size

delegate). For details on the time points and frequency of all safety assessments, please see Appendix 1  (Overall Schedule of Assessments). 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 55 of 101 
 
 Physical Examination  
Complete physical examination performed at scre ening will include, at a minimum, assessment of 
the following systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose  and throat, respiratory system, cardiovascular 
system, gastrointestinal system , neurological condition, blood and lymphatic systems, and the 
musculoskeletal system.  
Physical examination may be performed at variou s unscheduled time points if deemed necessary 
by the investigator. All physical examinations will be conducted by a licensed physician. 
 Implantation Site Inspection and Wound Care 
Subjects will receive written inst ructions that explain how to ca re for the surgical site after 
implant insertion and removal. Subjects should be informed about care of the implant site and 
implant site safety, educated about situations where they should seek medical attention, and 
queried about implant-related AEs.  
If an expulsion of an implant(s) occurs, and the subject appears to be compliant and wants to 
continue with the study, the current implant si te will have the remain ing implant removed and 
new implants (same dosage strength as original) will be implanted into another quadrant. If an 
expulsion occurs, the site is to contact the medical  monitor to discuss if or al risperidone should be 
given to the patient prior to the following implantation. 
Implantation site inspection will be  by visual and physical examination at each assessment visit. 
The physician will palpate the device and measure from the proximal end of the device to the 
incision to determine whether it has migrated by no ting a change in distance from the incision site 
to the proximal end of the device. Healing of th e incision will be monitored. Dermal reactions 
will be scored on a Skin Irritation Scoring System ( Appendix  3, [1].) recommended for 
transdermal dosage forms that describes the amo unt of erythema, edema, and other features 
indicative of irritation. Any changes from ba seline will be noted and captured as an AE. 
The DLP-114 implant should be implanted in a quad rant of the abdomen 5 cm from midline and 5 
cm below the ribs.  Any migration of the implant from this area, spontaneous expulsion on an 
implant(s), or other device-related event that does not qualify as an adverse event will be captured 
in the CRF on the Implant/Device Event form. 
 Electrocardiogram  
Single 12-lead ECG will  be performed at selected time points ( Appendix 1 . Overall Schedule of 
Assessments). The patient should be in the semi-s upine position for at least 10 minutes before the 
measurement is started and the fo llowing variables will be provided automatically: RR, PR, QRS, 
QT and QTcF intervals and pulse rate. In case of evident bad quality (muscle tremor) of the 
tracing, the ECG will be repe ated. A description of the overall assessment (i.e. normal or 
abnormal plus reason) including clinical significan ce will be made and a copy of the trace placed 
with the source data. All ECGs should be obtai ned prior to vital signs and blood sampling when 
applicable. 
 Vital Signs  
Assessments will include systolic and diastolic  blood pressure, pulse , body temperature, and 
respiratory rate. Patient should be  resting in a semi-supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 56 of 101 
 
and while vital signs measurements are obtained.  Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse (after 
standing for 1, 3, and 5 minutes) will be  performed at selected time-points ( Appendix 1. Overall 
Schedule of Assessments).  
 Safety Laboratory Tests  
All safety laboratory analysis will  be performed by the clinical si te’s certified laboratory, using 
the laboratory’s normal ranges. The investigator mu st review the laboratory report, document this 
review, and record any clinically  relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of 
the CRF. The following clinical laboratory safety tests will be performed ( Appendix 1 . Overall 
Schedule of Assessments):

C-SSRS will be administered at screening and each  patient visit (at least biweekly).  CGI-I will be 
administered at least monthl y and PANSS approximately every 3 months.  PANSS will be 
administered more frequently if the CGI-I worsens.  
 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)  
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) [7] is a suicidal ideation rating 
scale. The scale identifies be haviors and thoughts that are a ssociated with an increased 
risk of suicidal actions in the future. The C-SSRS Baseline/Screening version will be 
conducted at Screening and the Since Last Vis it version will be used for all subsequent 
visits per the Schedule of Events.  
 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (P ANSS) measures positive and negative 
syndromes associated with schizophrenia.  The scale consists of 33 items, 30 of which contribute to the PANSS Total Score (i.e., the sum of the seven P, or positive, items with 
the seven N, or negative, items with the 16 G, or general pathology, items).  The PANSS Total Score ranges from 30 – 210, with highe r scores indicating greater pathology.   
Individual PANSS items are scor ed from 1 – 7, as follows: 
1 = Absent 
2 = Minimal 
3 = Mild 
4 = Moderate 
5 = Moderate/ Severe  
6 = Severe 
7 = Extreme 
The PANSS is administered at screening, base line, and at additional timepoints noted in 
the Schedule of Assessments.  Of note, fo r study eligibility, the PANSS Total Score at 
 Study Protocol

screening must be ≤ 80 and the following five individual items must be ≤ 4: 
Conceptual Disorganization; Suspiciousness;  Hallucinatory Behavior; Unusual Thought 
Content; and Hostility.  Add itionally, there must not be a ≥ 20% change in the PANSS 
Total Score from screening to baseline. Finally, should th e PANSS Total Score worsen 
by ≥30% compared to baseline at subsequent study visits (confirmed at an additional 
visit 1 – 7 days later), the subject may be  exhibiting signs of relapse and may meet 
stopping criteria.    
 CGI-S and CGI-I 
Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) will be rate d based upon the severity of 
schizophrenia symptoms at screening and Day -1 during the oral treatment period, 
immediately prior to the implant + oral period. 
Severity of illness will be a ssessed based on following ratings: 
0 = Not assessed 
1 = Normal, not at all symptomatic 
2 = Minimally symptomatic 
3 = Mildly symptomatic 
4 = Moderately symptomatic 
5 = Markedly symptomatic 
6 = Severely symptomatic 
7 = Among the most extremely symptomatic subjects 
Drug response on symptoms of schizophrenia will be evaluated by the Clinical Global 
Impressions – Improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-I will be performed according to the 
timepoints in the Schedule of  Assessments. The CGI-I scor es range from 1 to 7: 
0 = not assessed (missing), 
1 = very much improved, 
2 = much improved, 
3 = minimally improved, 
4 = no change, 
5 = minimally worse, 
 6 = much worse,  7 = very much worse

 EPS 
EPS symptoms will be monitore d by the Barnes akathisia rating scale (BARS), Simpson–Angus 
scale (SAS) and abnormal involuntar y movement scale (AIMS) at the beginning and at the end of 
the study, and may be performed more frequently based on symptoms at the PI's discretion. 
 Barnes Akasthisia Rating Scale (BARS) 
The Barnes Akasthisia Rating Scale (BARS) is a rating scale administered by physicians 
to assess the severity of drug-induced akat hisia. This scale includes objective and 
subjective items such as the level of re stlessness and global clinical assessment of 
akathisia. The BARS assessment will be pe rformed at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments. 
 Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS) 
The Abnormal Involuntary Move ment Scale (AIMS) is a cl inician-administered scale 
used to detect tardive dyskinesia (TD) and to follow the severity of a person’s TD over 
time. This 12-item anchored scale is clinician administered and scored.   
Items 1 through 10 are rated on a 5-point anchored scale: 
0=None 
1=Minimal, may be extreme normal  
2=Mild  3=Moderate  
4-Severe 
Items 1 through 4 assess orofacial movements. 
Items 5 through 7 assess extremity and truncal dyskinesia. Items 8 through 10 assess global severity as  judged by the examiner and the person’s 
awareness of the movements and the distress associated with them. Items 11 and 12 are yes-no questions concerni ng problems with teeth and/or dentures, 
because such problems can lead to a mistaken diagnosis of dyskinesia.  
A positive AIMS examination is a score of 2 in multiple movements or a score of 3 or 4 
in a single movement. The AIMS assessment  will be performed at the time points 
indicated in the Sche dule of Assessments. 
 Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) 
The Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS ) is a clinician-administered 10-item rating scale 
assessing the presence of drug-related extr apyramidal signs.  The 10 performance tasks 
are rated on a scale of 0 – 4 (normal to severe , as relevant to the task assessed).  The 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 60 of 101 
 
SAS will be performed at the timepoints i ndicated in the Schedule of Assessments.  
 Signs of impending relapse 
Any of the following signs would call for withdrawing the patient from the study: 
 Hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia; 
 Increase (worsening) of the PANSS of ≥30% from baseline. PANSS T score confirmed at a 
second visit conducted within 1-7 days; 
 Clinically significant emergent or worsening su icidal, homicidal, or aggressive behavior; 
 A CGI-I Improvement (CGI-I) score of 6 (much wo rse) or 7 (very much worse) after start 
of study; 
 A need for additional antipsychotic treatment,  with the exception of protocol permitted 
short-term add-on therapy. 
 Video Recording 
Four of the first subjects enrolled in the DLP- 114-03 trial will have their implant and explant 
procedure video recorded and uploaded to a central repository. Approved video-recording 
equipment and standardized instructions for videot aping will be provided to the site. Each video 
recording will be identified by subject number,  date, and time (including no personal identifying 
information). The camera will be positioned in su ch a way that the subjects’ face will not be 
included in the recording to protect the identity of the subject. Subjects who do not wish to be 
video recorded will be allowed to participate in the study. 
The purpose of video-recording a small number of implant and explant procedures is to: 
 Assess the performed procedure to ensure that  it is aligned with the instructions provided 
in the training. 
 Identify and assess any observed misuses. Assessments will help drive product design 
changes and/or label changes to alleviate the risk’s severity or occurrence of the misuse. 
14.4 Pharmacokinetics 
Blood will be collected for the determination of  plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-OH 
risperidone and active moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone) at the end of oral risperidone 
treatment, throughout the duration of the DLP-114 implant treatment and following removal of 
the DLP-114 implant. 
Clinic staff are required to take  the blood samples for PK analysis at the scheduled time points 
within the time windows indicated ( Appendix 2.  Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Schedule). 
Actual sampling dates and times are to be recorded in the CRF. 
If a patient discontinues prior to completion of th e study, all of the PK data collected prior to 
discontinuation will be included in th e PK analysis as appropriate.  
Three (3) mL  of blood  will be obtained for each PK sampling time point.  
The clinical site PK manual provides detailed instructions on sample processing, storage and 
shipping.

15 STUDY CONDUCT SCHEDULES AND GUIDELINES 
15.1 Screening, Selection and Consent 
Screening will be conducted within a period of 28  days prior to the start of the conversion phase 
or unsupervised oral dosing risperidone 3 mg/day . Informed consent will be obtained following 
provision of the PICF at screening and prior to any study procedures bei ng performed. Patients 
will have to meet all el igibility criteria before being enrolled in the study.  
All screening laboratory test valu es (including viral) used for st udy eligibility assessment may be 
derived from patient medical history/record if obtained within a 28-day window prior to

for the study and subsequently included or exclud ed) is to be completed by the investigator, or 
medically qualified delegate, including documentati on that the patient has been stable on oral 
risperidone (2-3 mg/day) for at least 2 weeks, as well as if they have completed the conversion 
phase.  Documentation of screening failure details may be record ed using eligibility screening 
forms or a patient screen failure log.  Eligible pa tients will be assigned to either Group 1 or 2.  
The following assessments/procedures will be performed at the screening visit:

16 ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
16.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence a ssociated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abno rmal laboratory finding), symp tom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (inves tigational/experimental) product, whether or not 
related to this product.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
 Results in death; 
 Is life-threatening (the term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘s erious’ refers to an 
event/reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it 
does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothe tically might have caused death, if it 
were more severe); 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolonga tion of an existing hospitalization (only 
hospitalizations that are longer  than expected based on Investigator judgment, will be 
considered prolonged hospitalizations); 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (an AE that results in a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions); 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth de fect (a congenital anomaly/birt h defect that occurs in the 
offspring of a patient exposed to the investigational product); 
 Is a medically important event or reaction (an AE that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospitalization ma y be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, the event ma y jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations, should 
be considered serious such as  important medical events that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These should also be considered seri ous. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization,  or development of drug dependency or drug

abuse. 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) : is an AE that is believed to be 
related to the investig ational product and is both unexpected and serious. An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severi ty that has been observed; or, if an investigator 
brochure is not required or availabl e, is not consistent with the ri sk information described in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere in th e current application. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue  of greater severity) if the investigator 
brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vascul itis would be unexpected (by virt ue of greater specificity) if 
the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vasc ular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to adverse events or susp ected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
investigator brochure as occurring with a cl ass of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are no t specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation. 
Abnormal laboratory findings  (e.g. clinical chemistry, hemato logy, coagulation and urinalysis) 
or other abnormal assessments (e.g., ECG tracings for safety assessment, vital signs) that are 
judged by the investigator as clinically significant  will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet 
the definitions stated in above. Clinically significant abnormal  laboratory findings or other 
abnormal assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and 
significantly worsen following the start of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. The 
investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnorma l assessment is clinically significant. 
An Implant/Device Event (IDE) is defined as an expulsion, migr ation, or other device-related 
event that does not qualify as an adverse event. The evaluating physician will make the 
determination as to the root cause of the event and classify it accordingly. See section 14.3.2 for 
instructions on expulsion procedure.  
16.2 Evaluating AE and SAE 
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study. The assessment will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE will be graded us ing the most current version of  the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5-point scale: 
 Mild (Grade I) : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms: cl inical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated; 
 Moderate (Grade II) : Minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental acti vities of daily living (ADL); 
 Severe (Grade III): Severe or medically significant but  not immediately life-threatening: 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalizatio n indicated; disabling; limiting self-care 
ADL; 
 Life-threatening (Grade IV) : Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated; 
 Death (Grade V): Death related to the event. 
If an AE has multiple aspects, the aspect with the highest severity will be graded. 
The term severe is a measure of severity. Thus , a severe AE is not necessarily serious. For 
example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 73 of 101 
 
 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator will make an assessment as to the relationship between  investigational product 
effect and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to 
determine whether or not the AE/SAE is causa lly related to the investigational drug product. 
Alternative causes, such as natu ral history of the underlying dise ases, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the investig ational product will be 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure in the 
determination of his/her assessment. 
The causal relationship of the investigational pro duct to an AE will be rated according to the 
following 5-point scale:  
 Unrelated: Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes , and does not meet 
criteria listed under unlikel y, possible or probable; 
 Unlikely: Does not follow a reasonable temporal se quence from administration; may have 
been produced by the patient’s clinical state or  by environmental factors or other therapies 
administered; 
 Possibly: Follows a reasonable temporal sequence  from administration; may have been 
produced by the patient’s clinical state or by environmental factors or other therapies 
administered; 
 Probably: Clear temporal association with improve ment on cessation of investigational 
product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon re -challenge or follows a known pattern of 
response to the investigational product; 
 Definitely: An AE that cannot be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation, e.g., 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). Th e relationship in time is very suggestive. 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurre d and the investigator has minimal information 
to include in the initial report to the sponsor. Howe ver, it is very importan t that the investigator 
always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE form to 
the sponsor. The investigator ma y change his/her opinion of caus ality in light of follow-up 
information, amending the SAE form and the CRF accordingly. The causality assessment is one 
of the criteria used when determin ing regulatory reporting requirements. 
 Action Taken and Outcome 
For all AEs reported, the actions take n and outcomes will be specified. 
Actions taken may include any of the following: 
 No action; 
 Medication required; 
 Tests required; 
 Hospitalization required (or prolonged); 
 Investigational product administ ration interrupted/withdrawn; 
 Other (specify). 
The following terms and definitions are used in  assessing the final outcome of an AE:  
 Recovered - The patient has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the 
condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial-related activity after the 
patient signed the informed consent. 
 Recovering - The condition is improving and the pa tient is expected to recover from the 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 74 of 101 
 
event. 
 Recovered with sequelae - The patient has recovered from the condition, but with lasting 
effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an SAE 
criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. 
 Not recovered - The condition of the patient has not improved and the symptoms are 
unchanged, or the outcome is not known at the time of reporting. 
 Fatal - This term is only applicable if the pa tient died from a condition related to the 
reported AE. Outcomes of  other reported AEs in a patien t before he/she died should be 
assessed as “recovered”, “recovering”, “recovered with sequelae” or “not recovered”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. 
 Unknown - This term is only applicable if the patient is lost to follow-up. 
16.3 Procedures and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events 
The investigator or designee is responsible for de tection, recording and reporting of events that 
meet the criteria and definition of AE.  
As a consistent method of solici ting AE, the patient shall be asked a non-leading question such as: 
"How do you feel?”. 
Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms  present in a patient prior to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent) should be re corded as Medical/Surgical History. In addition, 
any change in health status, which is reported af ter informed consent is obtained but prior to 
starting study treatment will be documented as Medical/S urgical History. 
Any medical occurrence reported or  observed after the informed consent form is signed until 
completion of the last study related procedure (inc ludes follow-up for safety assessments) will be 
recorded as an AE.  
Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing, should be 
reviewed at subsequent assessments as necess ary. If these have resolved, this should be 
documented. A post-study AE is defined as a ny event that occurs outside of  the nominal AE study detection 
period. Investigators are not obligat ed to actively seek AE in form er study patients. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE, including a de ath, at any time after a patient has completed the 
study and he/she considers the event reasonably related to th e investigational product, the 
investigator will promptly notify the sponsor.  
Patients must be provided with a “study card” indicating the name of the investigational product, 
the study number, the investigator’s name, a 24-hour emergency contact number, and, if 
applicable, excluded concomitant medi cations. Patients will also be offered a safety alert bracelet 
bearing the same information, if  desired, instead of or in addition to the study card. The study 
card and/or bracelet will be provided upon discha rge from the clinic follo wing the implant device 
administration. 
16.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or pr esumed relationship to study treatment, must be 
recorded using medical terminology in the CRF and/or other sources. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symp toms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, 
runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head cong estion should be reported as “upper respiratory 
infection”). Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy. All measures required for adverse event management must be 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 75 of 101 
 
recorded in the CRF and reported ac cording to sponsor instructions. 
16.5 Reporting of SAEs and SUSARs 
In accordance with ICH guidelines for GCP, a c opy of the written repor t of any SAEs should 
promptly be sent to the study sponsor. The invest igator must notify the study sponsor (and the 
designated study safety officer) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence of an SAE.

Information regarding SAEs will  be transmitted to the sponsor  using a SAE Form (or Medical 
Device Incident Report form) as described in the study Safety Reporting Plan. The SAE Form 
must be completed and signed by a member of the investigational staff, and transmitted to the 
sponsor (and designated study sa fety officer) within 24 hours ( Table 4 ). The initial and follow-up 
reports of an SAE should be made by facsimile (fax) or e-mail. 
The investigator must report SAEs to the approp riate IEC/IRB that approved the protocol unless 
otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB. 
It is the responsibility of the sponsor to determine whether a reported SA E fits the classification 
of a SUSAR. The investig ator’s opinion regarding the assessme nt of expectedness (if provided) 
and causality will be taken into account in the sponsor’s determination of the SAE as a SUSAR. 
The causality assessment given by the investig ator cannot be downgraded by the sponsor. 
SAEs (and SUSARs) will be reported to competent authorities in accordance with national 
requirements. The sponsor assumes responsib ility for appropriate re porting of SAEs (and 
SUSARs) to the regulatory authorities.  
16.6 Follow-up of AE and SAE 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient and 
provide further information to the sponsor on the patient’s condition. 
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact  and are designated as ongoing, will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/con tacts. SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or 
that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the patient’s participation in the study, must be 
followed until any of the following occurs: 
 The event resolves; 
 The event stabilizes; 
 The event returns to Baseline, if a Baseline value is available; 
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the investigational product or to factors 
unrelated to study conduct; 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 76 of 101 
 
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obta ined (patient or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional inform ation, lost to follow-up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow-up efforts). 
The investigator will ensure that SAE follow-up includes any supplemental investigations as may 
be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or caus ality of the event. This may include additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinati ons, or consultation with other 
health care professionals. 
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to  elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the SAE. If a patient dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up 
period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any post-mortem findings, including 
histopathology. 
New or updated informati on will be recorded on a new SAE form and the CRF. The updated SAE 
form should be sent to the sponsor.  
16.7 Exposure In Utero  Management and Reporting 
In instances of pregnancies or suspected pre gnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age) while the pati ent is on investigational product: 
 Female patient - dosing of the investigational product must be discontinued immediately. 
The pregnant patient should be advi sed to call her healthcare provider. 
 Partner of male patient - dosing of the inve stigational product to the male patient may 
continue at the discretion of  the investigator. The pregnant partner of the male patient 
should be advised to call  her healthcare provider. 
The investigator will notify the sponsor and designated study safety officer of this event and 
document the pregnancy on the Exposure in Utero Form as described in the study Safety 
Reporting Plan.  
The investigator shall obtain Informed Consent fr om the pregnant patient (or the pregnant partner 
of the male patient) in order to allow him/her (o r delegate) to conduct fo llow-up throughout the 
gestational period and on the infa nt following delivery. The invest igator shall follow-up newborn 
infants that have been exposed  to investigational product in utero  for a minimum of 6 months. 
Upon discovery of any congenital anomalies (or ne onatal deaths) the investigator shall submit a 
follow-up report to the sponsor (and study safety officer) using an SAE Form (as per study Safety 
Reporting Plan) including information regarding th e status of the newborn. A miscarriage or 
abortion shall also be reported by the investigator to the study Safety Officer (and the sponsor) 
using an SAE Form. 
17 PATIENTS LOST TO FOLLOW-UP AFTER IMPLANTATION 
When a subject is “lost to follow-up” (i.e., fails to return for study visits), a reasonable effort will 
be made to contact him/her to determine a reas on for the failure to return and encourage the 
subject to return for removal of the implant. The detailed plan that the research center will follow 
in attempts to contact a subject that fails to return for a visit is listed below. 
In the event a subject misses a scheduled out patient visit during the study, the following 
procedures will be conducted to locate the patient:   
 The study coordinator will attemp t to contact the subject (e.g., phone, email, or text) for 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 77 of 101 
 
four consecutive weeks in an effort to locate  the subject and coordina te his/her return to 
the research site. 
 If unsuccessful in contacting the subject th e coordinator will c ontact the subject’s 
caregiver/emergency contact. 
 Once contact is established, the Investigator will assess the subject’s ability to continue in 
the study. 
 If the patient does not contact the site, the Spons or will request for a third party to locate 
the patient to have the implant removed. 
All attempts to contact the subject must be docum ented in the source data .  The subject will be 
considered lost to follow up if the subject is not successfully located using the plan outlined above 
and should be identified as  “lost to follow-up” in the CRF. However, the research site will request 
that all listed contacts continue to monitor for th e subject and request that they call the emergency 
numbers if contact is made with the subject. The research site will also continue to monitor their 
psychiatric network in effort s to locate the subject. 
18 STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
This section describes the general framework to be used for the analysis and presentation of data 
in this study. The information described in this section may be revised during the study to 
accommodate protocol amendments and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study 
execution and data that could affe ct planned analyses. All available data will be included in data 
listings and tabulations. No imputation of values for missing data will be performed. A formal 
Statistical Analysis Plan will be issued prior to database lock. 
18.1 Sample Size Considerations 
The maximum sample size is 30. The primary objec tive of this study is to determine safety and 
tolerability of DLP-114 and as such the samp le size for this study was based upon qualitative 
considerations. No formal sample size calculations were performed.  
18.2 Demographic Data 
For all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, desc riptive statistics (mean, 
standard deviation, median, mi nimum, maximum) will be performed for age, gender, body mass 
index, weight, and height.  
18.3 Safety/Tolerability Data 
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of st udy treatment will be included in the safety and 
tolerability analysis. Baseline for all vital signs, 12-lead ECG measurements, and clinical 
laboratory assessments will be defined as the last evaluation done before the start of study 
treatment administration on Day -4. 
Safety evaluations will be base d on the incidence, intensity and type of AE and clinically 
significant changes in the patient’s physical exam ination findings, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and 
clinical laboratory results. Safety variables will be tabulated and presented for all patients who 
receive study treatment, i.e., the safety population. 
Abnormalities in clinical laborat ory, vital signs, and ECG will be based on pre-defined normal 
ranges and will be tabulated by study treatm ent showing patient counts and percentages. 
The original terms used in the CRF by investigat ors to identify AEs will be coded using the 
current version of the Medical Dictionary of Re gulatory Activities (MedDR A). The percentage of 
patients with treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized for each treatment. 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 78 of 101 
 
Special attention will be given to  those patients who ha ve discontinued treatment due to an AE or 
who experienced a severe or a SAE. 
Laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. Norm al reference ranges and 
markedly abnormal results will be used in the summary of laboratory data. Raw data and change 
from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters will be summarized using de scriptive statistics. A 
listing of patients with any laboratory results  outside the reference ranges that are deemed 
clinically significant will be provided. 
18.4 Pharmacokinetic Data 
Plasma concentrations of plasma  concentrations of risperidon e, 9-OH risperidone and active 
moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone) determined  at specified time points will be used to 
calculate PK parameters. Data will be listed for all patients with available plasma concentrations 
of risperidone, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety (risperidone + 9 OH risperidone). All 
concentrations below the limit of quantification (LOQ) or missing data will be labeled as such in 
the concentration data listings. C oncentrations designated as LOQ will be treated as 0 in the 
summary statistics and for the calculation of PK parameters.  
Reasons for exclusion of a patient or a sample fr om the analysis include, but are not limited, to 
the following: 
 Vomiting within 6 hours after investigationa l product administration (oral risperidone 
only); 
 Too few data (greater than 10% missing values for a patient); 
 Noncompliance with study procedures aff ecting pharmacokinetics (e.g., concomitant 
medication). 
All patients and samples excluded from the analysis will be clea rly documented in the PK study 
report. Pharmacokinetic parame ters for risperidone, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety 
(risperidone + 9 OH risperidone) will be calcul ated using non-compartmental analysis. Only 
plasma concentrations greater than the LOQ for the assay will be used in the PK analysis. Actual 
sampling times will be used in all PK analyses. Per protocol times wi ll be used to calculate mean 
plasma concentrations for graphical displays.  Listing of individual patient pl asma concentrations, actual bl ood sampling times, and PK 
parameters and graphs of concentration vs. time will be prepared by study treatment. Plasma 
concentrations and PK parame ters will be summarized by and compared between study 
treatments using descriptive statistics. 
Statistical analysis will be performed on th e pharmacokinetic parameters using validated 
statistical software. 
19 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING 
19.1 Patient Identification and Enrolment Log and Patient Screening Log 
The investigator agrees to complete a patient identification and enrollment log to permit easy 
identification of each patient during and after th e study. This document will be reviewed by the 
sponsor site contact for completeness. 
The patient enrollment log will be treated as confid ential and will be filed by the investigator in 
the Investigator Site File (ISF). All reports and communications relating to the study will identify 
patients by initials an d assigned number only. 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 79 of 101 
 
The investigator must also complete a patient screening log, which repo rts on all patients who 
were seen to determine eligibi lity for inclusion in the study. 
19.2 Source Documentation 
Source documentation must be available to substa ntiate patient identification, eligibility, and 
participation; proper informed consent procedur es; dates of visits; a dherence to protocol 
procedures; records of safety parameters; ade quate reporting and follow-up of adverse events; 
administration of concomitant medication; drug receipt/dispensing/return records; investigational 
product administration informatio n; and date of patient completion, discontinuation from 
treatment, or withdrawal from the study, and the reason if appropriate. Specific items required as 
source documents will be reviewed with  the investigator before the study. 
At a minimum the following data must be ma intained in source documentation: patient 
identification, patient eligibility, exposure to investigational product, adverse events, and 
concomitant medication. It is recommended that the author of an entry in the source documents be 
identifiable. Worksheets may be used for the captu re of some data to fa cilitate completion of the 
CRF. Any such worksheets will become part of the patients’ source documentation. 
Following the ICH-GCP guidelines, di rect access to source documentation (medical records) must 
be allowed for the purpose of verifying that the da ta recorded in the CRF are consistent with the 
original source data. 
19.3 Case Report Form 
A CRF must be completed for each patient who ha s received at least 1 supervised dose of 3 
mg/day risperidone.  For reasons of confidentiality, the name of the patient should not appear in the CRF. All CRF 
entries, corrections, and alterati ons must be made by the investigator or other authorized study-
site personnel. 
CRFs will be completed according to the sponsor’s (or designee) in structions and reviewed by the 
sponsor (or designee) to determine their accur acy and acceptability. If  necessary, CRF queries 
will be raised by the sponsor (or designee) relating to CRF data entries. The investigator or 
authorized study site staff must address all CRF queries raised. 
20 ETHICS AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 
20.1 Investigator Responsibilities 
The investigator agrees to conduct the clinical study in accordance with the protocol, current 
International Council on Harmonization (ICH) guide lines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and 
applicable regulatory and legal requirements. GCP is an internat ional ethical and scientific quality 
standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation 
of human patients. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study patients are pr otected, consistent wi th the principles that originated in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical study data are credible. 
20.2 Independent Ethics Committee or In stitutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) 
This study protocol and any amen dment(s) must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities in each respective country, as required. The sponsor (or designee) is responsible for 
regulatory submissions. This clinical study ma y not be initiated until all local regulatory 
requirements are met. 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 80 of 101 
 
Before the start of the study, a written favorable  opinion or approval must be received from the 
IEC/IRB. To achieve this, the investigator or the sponsor will submit to the IEC/IRB, as required 
by local regulations, current and comple te copies of relevant documents. 
The written favorable opinion or approval must be dated and must clearly identify the documents 
reviewed, which should include the final protoc ol and any amendments, the informed consent 
form, applicable recruiting materials,  and any patient compensation program. 
During the study, the investigator or sponsor, as required, will submit th e following for IEC/IRB 
review or opinion/approval: 
1. Revisions or updates of documents pr eviously submitted to the IEC/IRB 
2. Relevant new information or documents, as required: 
a. Summaries of the status of the study (at leas t annually or at intervals stipulated in 
guidelines of the IEC/IRB); 
b. Reports of adverse events that are seri ous, unlisted, and associated with the 
investigational drug; 
c. Deviations from or changes to the study protocol to eliminate immediate hazards 
to the patients. 
When and where required by local regulations, before implementation of any change, study 
protocol amendments and revised documents must receive IEC/IRB favorable opinion or 
approval. 
The IEC/IRB will be given official no tification of the study completion. 
20.3 Required Pre-study Documentation 
The study protocol and any amendment(s) signe d and dated by the investigator, the completed 
investigator financial disclosure  form from the investigator, and signed and dated statement of 
investigator (e.g., Form FDA 1572), if applicable, and any other documents specified by ICH-
GCP guidelines must be provided to the sponsor befo re the study is started at an investigational 
site. 
20.4 Clinical Laboratory Certification and Reference Ranges 
Before the initiation of this study, the inve stigator (or nominee) will obtain a copy of the 
certification form, with certification number and expiration date fo r all clinical laboratories used 
in the study. Reference ranges for each clinical la boratory test used in this study will be obtained 
from the appropriate laboratory, which will perform the te st for the study. 
20.5 Informed Consent 
Each patient must give written consent accord ing to local requirements after receiving a full 
explanation of the nature of the study. The cons ent form must be signed before performance of 
any study-related activity. The consent form that is used must be approved by both the sponsor 
and by the reviewing IEC/IRB. The informed cons ent process and form should be in accordance 
with principles that originated in the Decl aration of Helsinki, current ICH-GCP guidelines, 
applicable regulator y requirements, and sponsor policy. 
Before a patient’s entry into the study, the investig ator or an authorized member of the clinical 
staff must explain to the potential patient the ai ms, methods, and potential hazards of the study, 
and any discomfort it may entail. Patients will be  informed that their participation is voluntary 
and that they may withdraw consent to particip ate at any time. They will be informed that 
choosing not to participate will not affe ct the care a patient will receive.

Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 81 of 101 
 
Finally, patients will be informed that the investigator will maintain a patient enrolment log for 
the purposes of long-term follow-up if needed and that their records may be accessed by health 
authorities and authorized sponsor staff without violating the confidentiality of the patient, to the 
extent permitted by the applicable law(s) or regulations. By signing the informed consent form the 
patient is authorizing such access, and agrees to  be re-contacted after study completion, by health 
authorities and authorized sponsor staff, for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safety 
evaluations if needed. 
Patients will be given sufficient time to read the informed consent form and the opportunity to ask 
questions. After this explanation and before entr y into the study, consent should be appropriately 
recorded by means of the patient's personally da ted signature. After the consent is obtained, a 
copy of the informed consent form must be given to the patient. 
20.6 Privacy of Personal Data 
In order to maintain patient pr ivacy, all CRF, investigational product accountability records, study 
reports and communications will identify the pa tient by initials and the assigned patient number. 
The investigator will grant monitor(s) and audito r(s) from Delpor (or designee) and regulatory 
authorities access to the patient’s original medica l records for verification of data gathered on the 
CRF and to audit the data collectio n process. The patient’s confiden tiality will be maintained and 
will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted by the applicab le laws and regulations. 
20.7 Study Completion/Site Closure 
The study is considered completed at the last vi sit of the last patient undergoing the study. The 
final data from the investigational site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) in the time frame 
specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Investigational sites w ill be closed upon study 
completion. An investigational site is consider ed closed when all required documents and study 
supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has been performed. 
21 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
21.1 Study Monitoring 
The sponsor will assign monitors who will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as 
necessary and in compliance with the ICH-GCP Section 5.18.4. 
Monitoring visits will include checking the CRF for completene ss and clarity, cross-checking 
with source documents, and clarific ation of administrative matters . Findings from the review of 
CRF and source documents will be di scussed with the clinical staff. 
The sponsor expects that, during mon itoring visits, the relevant clinical  staff will be available, the 
source documentation will be accessible, and a suit able environment will be provided for review 
of study-related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during 
the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. 
21.2 Audits, Inspections Study Quality Management 
To ensure compliance with ICH GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, Delpor (or a 
designated third party), may conduct a quality a ssurance audit of the study site. Regulatory 
agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of  this study. Such audits/inspections can occur 
at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the 
investigator and institution agree to notify the sp onsor as soon as possible following awareness of 
an impending regulatory inspection. The inve stigator and Institution agree to allow the 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 82 of 101 
 
auditor/inspector direct access to  all relevant documents and alloca te his/her time and the time of 
his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
The sponsor (or its designee) will perform the quali ty assurance and quality control activities of 
this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy , completeness, and reliability of the study data 
presented to the sponsor lies with the inves tigator (and delegate(s))  generating the data. 
Prior to the study initiation, the sponsor (or its de signee) will explain the protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, and CRF to the investigator and clinical facility staff involved in this study. In addition, 
the assigned study monitor will be available to ex plain applicable regulati ons and to answer any 
questions regarding the conduct of the study. 
21.3 Data Quality Control 
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and relia bility of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the investigator 
and associated personnel before the study, an d periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor (or 
designee). Written instructions will be provided for collection, preparation, and shipment of 
blood, plasma, and urine samples. CRF comp letion training will be conducted with study 
personnel before the start of the study. The sponsor’s monitor will review electronic data for accuracy and completeness duri ng onsite monitoring visits and after his/her return to the 
sponsor’s office; any discrepancie s will be resolved with the investigator or designee, as 
appropriate. The data will be entered into the cl inical study database and verified for accuracy. 
21.4 Record Retention 
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the i nvestigator/institution will maintain all source 
documents that support the data collected from each  patient, as well as all study documents as 
specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Docume nts for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all 
study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The 
investigator/institution will take measures to prev ent accidental or premat ure destruction of these 
documents. 
Essential documents must be retained as per the applicable regulator y requirements for the 
country where the site is located or by an agreem ent with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of 
the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained. 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for ot her reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping the study records, cust ody must be transferre d to a person who will 
accept the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the 
new custodian. 
Under no circumstance shall the investigator relo cate or dispose of any study documents before 
having obtained written approval from the sponsor. 
If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any 
documentation relating to this study, the inve stigator must permit access to all study 
documentation. 
22 STUDY PROTOCOL GUIDELINES 
22.1 Protocol Amendments, Deviations and Violations 
Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment. 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 83 of 101 
 
All protocol amendments must be issued by the sponsor, and signed and dated by the investigator. 
Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IE C/IRB approval, or when the 
relevant competent authority has raised any gr ounds for non-acceptance, except when necessary 
to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients, in which case the amendment must be promptly 
submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant compet ent authority. When the amendment(s) involves 
only logistic or administrative aspects of the study, the IRB (and IEC where required) needs only 
to be notified. 
A protocol deviation is an acci dental or unintentional change to, or non-compliance with this 
study protocol that does not increase risk or decrease benefit or ; does not have a significant effect 
on the patient’s rights, safety or we lfare; and/or on the integrity of the data. No deviations to this 
protocol are permitted, except in instances when an emergency occurs that requires a departure 
from the protocol to protect the safety of an individual.  
A protocol violation is an a ccidental or unintentional change  to, or non-compliance with the 
IEC/IRB approved protocol (without prior sponso r and IEC/IRB approval), which increases the 
risk or decreases the benefit, affects the patient’s rights, safety, or welfare, or the integrity of the 
data. Reporting of protocol violations to IEC/IR B and in accordance with applicable Regulatory 
Authority mandates is an Investigator responsibility. 
In situations requiring a departure from the prot ocol, the investigator (or other physician) in 
attendance will contact the appropriate sponsor representative by fax or telephone or e-mail (see 
Contact Information pages provided separately). If possible, this contact will be made before 
implementing any departure from the protocol. In all cases, contact with  the sponsor must be 
made as soon as possible to discuss the situatio n and agree on an appropriate course of action. 
The data recorded in the CRF and source documen t will reflect any depart ure from the protocol, 
and the source documents will describe this departure and the circumstances requiring it. 
23 USE OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICATION POLICY  
All information, including but not limited to information regarding DLP-114 or the sponsor’s 
operations (e.g., patent application, formulas, manufacturing processe s, basic scientific data, prior 
clinical data, formulation information) supplie d by the sponsor to the investigator and not 
previously published, and any data generated as a result of this study, are considered confidential 
and remains the sole property of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information 
in confidence and to use this information only to  conduct this study, and will not use it for other 
purposes without the sponsor’s prior written consent. 
The investigator understands that the informatio n developed in the clinical study will be used by 
the sponsor in connection with the continue d development of DLP-114, and thus may be 
disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the 
information derived from the clinical studies to be  used, the investigator is obligated to provide 
the sponsor with all data obtaine d in the study. The results of the study will be reported in a 
Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor (or designee) under the supervision of the sponsor 
and will contain all data from all investigational sites. Any work created in connection with 
performance of the study and contained in the da ta that can benefit from copyright protection 
(except any publication by the investigator as prov ided for below) shall be the property of the 
sponsor as author and owner of copyright in su ch work. The sponsor shall have the right to 
publish such data and information without approval from the investigator. If an investigator 
wishes to publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the 
 Study Protocol 
Protocol No.: DLP-114-03 
 
 
Delpor Inc Page 84 of 101 
 
sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited 
reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster pres entations, or other materials. If requested by the 
sponsor in writing, the investigat or will withhold such publication fo r up to an additional 60 days 
to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific 
integrity or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The 
sponsor will not mandate modifi cations to scientific content and does not have the right to 
suppress information. The investigator will recognize the integrity of a multi-center study by not publishing data derived from the individual site until the combined results from the completed 
study have been published in full, within 12 months after conclusion, abandonment, or 
termination of the study at all sites, or the sponsor confirms there will be no multi-center study 
publication. Authorship of publications resul ting from this study will be based on generally 
accepted criteria for major medical journals. 
24 LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 
The investigator is required to have adequate current insurance to cover claims for negligence 
and/or malpractice. The sponsor will provide insurance coverage fo r the clinical study as required 
by national regulations. Delpor will be subscribed to an insuranc e policy covering, in its terms 
and provisions, its legal liability for injuries caused to participating persons and arising out of this 
research performed strictly in accordance with the study protocol as well as with applicable law 
and professional standards prior to the dosing of the first patient.

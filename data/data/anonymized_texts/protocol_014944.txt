Study Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Serlopitant for the Treatment of Chronic Pruritus  of 
Unknown Origin  
Protocol Number:  MTI-117 
Sponsor:  Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  
Development Phase:  Phase 2 
Study Objectives:  Primary  objective: To assess the efficacy of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in 
adult subjects with  chronic pruritus  of unknown origin . 
Secondary  objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses 
of serlopitant in adult subjects with chronic pruritus of unknown origin.  
Study Design:  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of chronic 
pruritus of unknown origin. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 rat io to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or 
placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early 
discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 5- week 
follow -up period.  
The study will consist of three perio ds, for a total study period of 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 3 weeks  
• Treatment period: 10 weeks  
• Follow -up period: 5 weeks  
 
Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol -mandated procedures, 
including the stopping of any excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the 
Screening visit . 
During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and 
will be assessed  for conditions associated with chronic pruritus . If the 
investigator deems that additional assessments are necessary to  rule out specific 
conditions based on a subject’s history, physical examination, and/or screening labs (e.g. scabies skin preparations, urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori ), the 
subject may not be randomized until these are completed and the pruritus i s still 
considered to be of unknown origin.  
Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the S creening  visit. Subjects must be 
willing and able to complete the eDiary every day  within a consistent 
timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies , for 
the duration of the study.  
At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period 
(Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day until the 
completion of the 10-week treatment period. Study drug may be taken with or 
without food. 
After the last dose of study drug, all subjects will enter a 5-week follow -up 
period and will undergo a follow -up visit at the conclusion of the follow -up 
period . 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment.

Version 3.0   Page 5 Safety Review:  An internal safety monitoring team consisting of representatives from Menlo 
Therapeutics Inc. and its designees will monitor blinded safety data on a regular 
basis throughout the study. 
Planned Sample Size:  Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized  in a 1:1 distribution.  
Randomization will be stratified by age and  baseline WI -NRS scores. 
Randomization of subjects < 50 years of age will be capped at 25% of the total 
randomized population. This cap may be increased up to 33% of the total 
randomized population at the Sponsor’s discretion based on relative enrollment rates.

Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 7 Safety Endpoints:  Safety endpoints are as follows : 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) 
• Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters following study 
drug exposure  
• Changes from baseline in vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters following study drug exposure  
• Plasma concentrations of serlopitant and metabolites  
Exploratory Endpoint s: The exploratory endpoints are as follows:  
• Change from baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  to Weeks 2, 4, 
6, and 10  
• Change from baseline in Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity (sPGA) to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10 
• Patient Global Impression of Change in Itch Severity (PGIC) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10  
Decision Rule and 
Sample Size: This study will use a 5% one-sided alpha level.  
The target sample size of 200 randomized and dosed subjects ( 100 per group) 
has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alp ha level. Two hundred subjects results in at least 90% power 
assum ing a placebo 4 -point responder rate of % and a serlopitant  4-point 
responder  rate of more than %. 
Statistical Methods:  Efficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat philosophy. The primary 
efficacy population will be the full analysis  population that will include all 
randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment  group to which they are randomized.
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary variable taking on values of responder 
or non -responder. Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 
4-point reduction in WI -NRS from baseline to Week 10. Missing data 
imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 10, 
unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the 
subject used rescue therapy (i.e. an excluded therapy to treat worse ning of 
pruritus ), in which case their responder status will be defined as non- responder. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and study week.  
The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between  treatment 
groups will be tested using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for the 
stratification factors. Testing of selected secondary efficacy endpoints will also 
be employed.

Version 3.0   Page 8 Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be 
tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ 
class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded 
to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted 
only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, AEs by 
severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. 
 
Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be 
tabulated for laboratory results by scheduled visit.  
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at 
any post- baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
laboratory values will be tabulated.  
The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or normal) will be summarized along with a summary of how many  subjects developed a post treatment abnormal 
result.  
Study Sites:  Approximately 40 study sites  
Expected Duration of 
Subject’s Participation  18 weeks: 3 weeks of screening, 10 weeks of treatment, and a follow -up period 
of 5 weeks . 
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) .

1.1 Chronic Pruritus of Unknown O rigin  
Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that elicits the desire or reflex to 
scratch ( Ikoma 2006). Scratching can result in removal of the epidermal and dermal layers of 
the skin, which is thought to be a n evolutionary mechanism to dislodge potential parasites. 
Itch is also caused by many derm atological and systemic diseases that can produce a type of 
pruritus that can become chronic and debilitating ( Hoon 2015). Epidemiological studies 
indicate that point prevalence for chronic pruritus range from 13% to 17%, with l ifetime 
prevalence of 22% to 26% ( Carr 2014). Pruritus can have a substantial negative effect on 
quality of life, including effects on “mood, concentration, eating habits, sexual function, and sleep,” ( Carr 2014) and chronic pruritus has been shown to have an impact on quality of life 
similar to that of  chronic pain ( Kini 2011 ).
  
Chronic pruritus may be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including both derm atological and systemic diseases. Many of these conditions present with visible skin 
involvement, such as in atopic dermatitis. Others may be associated with pruritus in the absence of visible skin involvement, such as in Hodgkin’s disease. However, in 8–15% of patients with chronic pruritus, an underlying etiology cannot be identified ( Weisshaar 2012 ). 
Terms  in the scientific literature that have been used to describe this population include 
generalized pruritus of unknown origin , chronic idiopathic pruritus, and chronic itch of 
undetermined origin ( Millington 2018, Xu 2016, Weisshaar 20 09). Epidemiological studies 
have also shown that the prevalence of chronic pruritus increases with age ( Ständer 2010), 
and the term chronic pruritus in  the elderly has been used synonymously to describe elderly 
patients who present with no overt identified cause of pruritus, representing both a significant proportion of pruritus burden in the elderly, as well as a source of frustration for the affected patient and the treating physician alike ( Ständer 2007, Berger 2013).  
Emerging evidence indicates that the aging process itself may be involved as a primary etiologic factor in chronic pruritus in the absence of other overt causes. Xerosis and other changes in skin barrier function, increasing sensorineural dysfunction, and senescent changes in the immune system have been implicated as contributory factors ( Berger 2011, 
Shevchenko 2018, Xu 2016). It is likely that chronic pruritus of unknown origin and chronic pruritus in the elderly represent significantly overlapping populations, especially as the age range of 51–60 years is one of the peak age ranges associated with a lifetime prevalence of chronic pruritus ( Matterne 2011).  
As the management of chronic pruritus is dependent on treatment of any underlying disease, chronic pruritus in the absence of an identified underlying disease or chronic pruritus in 
which the aging process itself may be the primary causal factor  can make treatment of 
pruritus in these patients  extremely challenging.  No drugs are currently approved in the US 
for the primary treatment of pruritus, and off- label use of available therapies such as H1 
antihistamines, gabapentin, and immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids and biologics can require significant trade -offs in terms of efficacy,  tolerability, safety, and cost 
(Weisshaar  2012).  Issues with to lerability and safety are often magnified in management of 
chronic pruritus with advancing age ( Pereira 2018 ).

Version 3.0   Page 16 1.2 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor  
Substance P is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, a 
group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B ( Hökfelt 2001). SP has been 
implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiologi cal and pathophysiological, 
including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory 
responses ( Lotts 2014, Andoh 1998, Steinhoff 2014). Th e biological actions of SP are 
mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G-proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, and neurokinin-3 receptors ( Harrison 2001). The neurokinin-1 
receptor ( NK
1 receptor ) in particular has been studied in great detail. The NK 1 receptor  is the 
primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple cell types, include 
neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system and keratinocytes in the skin.  
NK 1 receptor  stimulation  has been shown  to be an important pathway for pruritus perception 
(Ständer 2015). Inhibition of this pathway resul ts in decreased pruritus and scratching 
reflexes in animal models ( Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopitant for 
pruritus-related conditions, a commercially available NK 1 receptor antagonist ( Emend  USPI ) 
has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients  with chronic pruritus  due to 
etiologies such as cutaneous T -cell lymphoma  (Duval 2009, Torres 2012, Booken 2011) and 
erlotinib -induced pruritus  (Santini 2012, Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a study of 20 patients  
with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepitant , 16/20 patients  (80%) 
experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity  (Ständer 2010).  
1.3 Serlopitant  
1.3.1 Serlopitant Background and Nonclinical Summary  
Serlopitant is a small m olecule, highly selective NK 1-R antagonist that is administered orally 
and metabolized by cytochrome  P-450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ), with a plasma half -life of 
45−86 hours. It binds with high affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant 
(Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50) of 
61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. 
Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic 
toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 17 been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration nor in a 3- month mouse 
range-finding study and 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study at exposure higher than the 
lowest level which caused cardiotoxicity in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats fo r histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland 
and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum-targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 5-fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily).   
In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopitant provides no contraindications to the continuation of clinical trials via the oral route. Findings in the developmental toxicity studies support inclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials in accordance with the study protocol and local regulatory guidances.  
1.3.2 Serlopitant Clinical Summary  
In humans, serlopitant has been administered to over 1500 individuals. Single doses up to 
400 mg have been well tolerated in young adult males and single doses up to 25 mg have been well tolerated in the elderly. Multiple doses of up to 50  mg a day for 4 weeks have been 
well tolerated in healthy young males, and a single (loading) dose of 15 mg followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2  weeks have been well tolerated in elderly males and females. Forty -one 
(41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily (bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 1  year.
 Plasma concentrations of serlopitant appea r to increase in a dose-proportional 
fashion in both young adult males and elderly  subjects ( males and females ). Peak plasma 
concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 4 hours  in both young adult and 
elder ly subjects. A single loading dose of up to 15 mg serlopitant followed by 6 to 8 weeks of 
up to 5 mg daily serlopitant doses has been well tolerated in adults with chronic pruritus and 
prurigo nodularis . 
Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate good plasma exposures with oral  dosing, linear 
dose- dependent increases in plasma concentration and systemic exposure, a plasma t 1/2 
supportive of once daily dosing, and mild effects of concomitant food ingestion. Central nervous system (CNS) positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated good CNS penetrance and > 90% NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) at plasma exposures anticipated to be safe and well tolerated. Three long -lived active hydroxylated metabolites are observed 
in humans: M1/M1a (L-001256771), M2/M2a (L-001194442), and M3 (L-001426583). These metabolites were present at lower concentrations and were 2 - to 9-fold less potent in 
vivo than the parent compound. The integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
analysis concluded that these metabolites are unlikely to  contribute significantly to 
occupancy of the CNS NK
1-R in humans. 
1.3.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus -Related Studies  
Serlopitant has been evaluated in two completed  Phase 2 studies of subjects with chronic 
pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP-102). Three additional Phase 2 studies in pruritus indications 
(history of atopic dermatitis , epidermolysis bullosa, and psoriasis ) are clinically complete 
with study reports pending. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 18 TCP-101 
TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi-center study that compared  
serlopitant 0. 25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs . placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus. A total 
of 257 adult subjects 18–65 years of age with chronic pruritus  were randomized to receive 
one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 
3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measured on a VAS, summarized as a percentage change from baseline.  
Mean percent decreases from Baseline in VAS score were larger in the active -treatment 
groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. Overall, the results were 
the most profound for the serlopitant  1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from 
Baseline in VAS pruritus  scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week 6 pairwise least 
squares mean difference compared to placebo was 5.8  mm, 13.2 mm, and 14.2 mm for 
serlopitant 0.25  mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg, respectively .  
The frequency of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAE s) and study drug related adverse 
events ( AEs) was higher in the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups compared to the serlopitant 
0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopitant 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopitant 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one serious adverse event ( SAE) reported in the serlopitant 1 mg 
group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopitant groups were diarrhea (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 
0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg  group). 
The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.2%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%).   
TCP-102 
TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that 
evaluated serlopitant 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of prurigo nodularis ( PN). A total of 
128 adult subjects 18-80 years of age with PN were randomized to receive serlopitant or placebo in a 1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 
followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the primary timepoints.  
Serlopitant 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by change in average VAS from baseline. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by repeated measures analysis, the decrease from baseline was significantly greater in the serlopitant  group than the placebo group, with a mean difference (serlopitant 
minus placebo) of -1.0 at Week 4 and - 1.7 at Week 8. The mean difference at Week 2 was 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 19 also significant, -0.9. In a post -hoc analysis, 25.0% of placebo subjects and 54.4% of 
serlopitant sub jects were 4 -point responders  on average VAS at Week 8 . 
TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopitant- treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo -treated 
subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopitant group were nasopharyngitis 
(17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% placebo). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo- treated subjects. The most frequently 
reported t reatment -related TEAEs in the serlopitant group were fatigue (7.8%) and diarrhea, 
peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopitant -treated subjects and 4.8% of 
placebo- treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 
2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, depression, dizziness, and vertigo in 
the serlopitant group; and bradycardia, syncope, respiratory failure, and neurodermatitis in the placebo group. Nine subjects (3 serlopitant, 6 placebo) discontinued due to TEAEs. 
No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or 
electrocardiogram (ECG)
 results.  
The results of the Phase 2 studies in subjects with PN  and in subject s with chronic pruritus , 
together with the extensive safety experience with serlopitant to date and t he scientific 
rationale for NK 1-R inhibition in the treatment of pruritus, serve to support further evaluation 
of serlopitant for the treatment of chronic pruritus of unknown origin. 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)  for further information regarding serlopitant.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of repeated oral doses of 
serlopitant in adult subjects with  chronic pruritus of unknown origin. 
The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral 
doses of serlopitant in adult subjects with chronic pruritus of unknown origin.  
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of chronic pruritus of unknown origin. Approximately 200 subjects who meet the study entry crite ria will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 we eks. After 
completion of the treatment period or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 5-week follow-up period. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 20 This study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 3 weeks   
• Treatment period: 10 weeks 
• Follow-up period: 5 weeks  
 
Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated procedures, including the 
stopping of any excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the Screening visit. 
During the screening period, all subje cts will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be 
assessed for conditions associated with chronic pruritus. If the investigator deems that 
additional assessments are necessary to rule out specific conditions based on a subject’s 
history, physical examination, and/or screening labs (e.g. scabies skin preparations, urea 
breath test for Helicobacter pylori ), the subject may not be randomized until these are 
completed and the pruritus is still considered to be of unknown or igin.  
Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the Screening visit. Subjects must be willing and able 
to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent 6-hour timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies, for the duration of the study. eDiary  
compliance and WI- NRS scores will be used to determine study eligibility (see Section 4.1).  
At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitan t 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) 
at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day  until the completion of the 10- week treatment period . Study drug may 
be taken with or without food. 
After the last dose of study drug, all subjects will enter a 5-week follow-up period and will 
undergo a follow-up visit at the conclusion of the follow-up period. The eDiary will continue to be completed during the follow-up period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment.  3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection 
In the TCP -102 study in patients with PN , serlopitant 5 mg taken daily for 8 weeks was 
superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population as well 
as the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the TCP -101 study in 
patients  with chronic pruritus , serlopitant  5 mg and 1 mg tak en daily for 6 weeks were 
superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population and the 
subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis.  In both the TCP-102 and TCP -101 studies, serlopitant was generally well -tolerated and 
demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated.

Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 21 The current MTI -117 study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
serlopitant for the treatment of chronic pruritus of unknown origin. The  5 mg dose of 
serlopitant was selected for this study based on a combination of human central nervous 
system positron emission tomography receptor occupancy ( RO) data for serlopitant generated 
in healthy young males (Study P002), which showed a serlopitant 4 mg LFC (equivalent to a 
5 mg tablet) once daily dose is likely to achieve ~ 94% NK 1 RO at steady state, together with 
results of studies TCP -101 and TCP-102 that demonstrated a favorable efficacy, safety , and 
tolerability profile of serlopitant at this  dose level  in subjec ts with pruritus. Over 250 subjects 
have been exposed to serlopitant at doses of 5 mg tablet- equivalent daily for at least 6  weeks, 
and ~ 40 subjects have been exposed up to one year.

Version 3.0   Page 25 5.6 Study  Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects should be discontinued from study drug treatment in the following situations: 
• A female subject  desires t o become pregnant at the current time, stops contraception or 
expels her intrauterine device/implant, or becomes pregnant  
• A female subject has new breast findings (e.g. a palpable mass or abnormal 
mammography, discharge), or has abnormal vaginal discharge or bleeding 
• The subject decides to discontinue study drug treatment, or withdraws consent from the 
study 
• The s ubject receives a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (See Appendix B ) 
• Any medical condition that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, 
in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion; this may include the development of persistently (2 successive occasions)  abnormal thyroid function tests (TSH >10, or 
TSH  > 6 with low free T4 ; TSH <  0.1, or TSH < 0. 35 with high free T4); abnormal 
morning prolactin, cortisol, or corticotropin levels ; or signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency 
• Discontinuation is deemed to be in the best interest of the subject, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion, including evidence that the subject does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria intended primarily for safety reasons, or a persistent lack of adherence to study procedures 
 
The Sponsor or designee should be contacted within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of 
any study drug treatment discontinuation. Investigators should make every effort to contact the Sponsor or designee before discontinuing study drug treatment, if possible. 
Subjects who discontinue treatment with study drug prior to completing the treatment period 
will enter a 5-week follow -up period following the last dose of study drug and will have a 
Follow-up visit (see Section 3.1, Section 6.5.10).  Every effort should be made for subjects to 
complete the Follow-up visit after a subject has discontinued from study drug.

Version 3.0   Page 26 any concomitant medication must relate to the subject’s medical history or to an AE, except 
for vitamins/nutritional supplements, emollient use, and routine preventative immunizations.  
All therapies that will be continued as concomitant therapies should be captured in source 
documents within 1 week of the Screening visit. 
5.7.1 Allowed Therapies  
Subjects using oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, or other maintenance 
thera pies that are not Excluded Therapies ( Section 5.7.2) may continue their use during the 
study.  Use of gentle cleansers and bland emollients (including those with urea) is encouraged for all 
subjects. If bland emollient use is elected,  it must be initiated at least 3  weeks ( 21 days) prior 
to Baseline visit  and continued throughout the treatment period. 
Maintenance allergy immunotherapy will be allowed . 
Treatment with non -systemic corticosteroids or antihistamine s that do not involve skin 
application (e.g. inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, or intra- articular) will be  allowed.  
Leukotriene inhibitors will be allowed  for treatment of conditions other than chronic pruritus 
of unknown origin (e.g. asthma). 
5.7.2 Excluded The rapies 
The following therapies and activities are excluded from 3 weeks prior to randomization  
through the treatment and follow-up periods:

Version 3.0   Page 27 The following therapies and activities are excluded from 3 weeks prior  to randomization 
through the treatment period. Use is discouraged, though permitted, in the follow-up period: 
• Topical therapies or emollients  with anti -pruritic properties (including but not limited to 
anti-histamines, menthol or menthol derivatives, polidocanol, camphor, pramoxine, 
cannabinoids, colloidal oatmeal baths, and capsaicin)  
• Systemic therapies with recognized anti -pruritic properties (including but not limited to 
H1 antihistamines, doxepin, gabapentin, pregabalin, cannabinoids, kappa-opioid rece ptor 
agonists, and mu- opioid receptor antagonists)  
 
Use of any excluded therapies (including those for the treatment of pruritus, or as rescue 
therapy) should be reported as soon as possible, and will be recorded as protocol deviations for subjects who re ceive them.   
5.7.3 Rescue Therapies  
The initiation of non-study drug therapy to treat worsening of pruritus is strongly discouraged throughout the treatment period. However, should rescue therapy be required for the safety and well -being of the subject, such use will be recorded and analyzed  (see 
Section  8.2). The subject may remain on study drug, unless the rescue therapy is an NK
1 
receptor  antagonist, a systemic biologic therapy, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, an 
investigational therapy, or any therapy that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion. 
5.8 Assignment to Treatment  
5.8.1 Randomization 
At the baseline visit eligible subjects will be randomized to receive serlopitant 5 mg or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio . Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization 
will be stratified by  the subject’s reported WI -NRS score for the 1- week  period prior to the 
Baseline visit (7 to < 8.5, 8.5 to 10), and by the subject’s age at the Baseline visit 
(18 to  < 50 years, ≥ 50 years).  
Randomization of subjects < 50 years of age will be capped at 25% of the total randomized 
population. This cap may be increased up to 33% of the total randomized population at the Sponsor’s discretion based on relative enrollment rates.  
An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization.  
5.8.2 Blinding  
This study will be conducted as a double- blind study with t he treatment assignment 
concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designee s 
of the Sponsor as required . The placebo will be formulated to be indistinguishable from the 
active study product. Study materials will be  packaged and issued in a manner designed to 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 28 maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involved in the direction and 
execution of study procedures, study assessments, and collection of data. The randomization code for each subject will be ava ilable  to the sites  for use only in an emergency situation. For 
details of the procedure for unblinding of individual subjects in cases of emergency see Section 7.6.  
5.9 Treatment Compliance  
Records of study drug used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be kept 
during the study. Subjects will be asked to return all partially used and empty bottles to the study site at each visit . The site staff will count and record the number of remaining tablets in 
each returned bottle. Study site staff will also regularly review eDiary -based study drug 
compliance records throughout the study. A subject who has deviated significantly from the once-daily dosing regimen will be counseled. 
6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS  
When applicable, efficacy and safety instruments will be provided with instructions for 
administration, in study- specific manuals for site reference.   
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  is a validated, self -reported inst rument for measurement of itch intensity. It 
uses a 24 -hour recall period and asks subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11 -point 
scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. The questionnaire is provided in Appendix C .  
During the study, WI -NRS assessments will be reported by the subject via eDiary. Subjects 
will record their WI- NRS scores once daily at approximately the same time each day 
(+/- 3 hours ) throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, as outlined in 
Appendix A . Subjects may be allowed to adjust the timing of eDiary completion within the 
first week of Screening as needed. Standardized t raining and instructions will be provided to 
all subjects prior to eDiary use.  
6.1.2 Itch Visual Analog Scale 
The Itch VAS is a validated, self -reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It 
uses a 24 -hour recall period and asks subjects to rate t he intensity of their worst itch on a 
100-mm horizontal line ranging from 0 mm (no itch) to 1 00 mm (worst itch imaginable). 
Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. The VAS measurement will be summarized in centimete rs. Standardized paper questionnaires will be distributed to sites and , in order to 
ensure consistency,  cannot be copied, printed, or faxed.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 29 During the study, WI- VAS assessments will be reported by the subject via a paper form 
administered at study visits. Standardized training and instructions will be provided to all 
subjects prior to administration of the WI- VAS assessments.  
6.1.3 Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity  
The Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity ( sPGA) is designed to assess overall 
itch severity. Each subject is asked to rate the severity of his/her itchiness in the past 7 days on a 5- point scale as none, mild, moderate,  severe, and very severe. Higher scores indicate 
greater itch severity. The sPGA sco res will be  captured on paper according to the schedule in 
Appendix A. 
6.1.4 Patient Global Impression of Change in Itch Severity  
The Patient Global Impression of Change in Itch Severity  (PGIC)  is a single item used to 
assess the change in overall itch severity  since the baseline visit. Each subject will rate the 
change in his/her itch severity on a 7-point scale from (very much better) to (very much 
worse). PGIC scores will be captured on paper  according to the schedule in Appendix A. 
6.1.5 Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
The ESS is a QOL instrument intended to measure daytime sleepiness by use of a very short questionnaire (8 items each scored from 0 –3). The ESS score can range from  0 to 24. Higher 
scores indicate g
reater daytime sleepiness. The questionn aire takes approximately 
2 to 3 minutes to complete, and is provided in Appendix D . The ESS questionn
aire will be 
collected as outlined in  Appe
ndix A . 
6.2 Safety Parameters  
S
afety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs and SAEs , vital signs , 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs , and other protocol -specified 
tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of  the study drug according to the 
schedule in Appendix A. 
6.2.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature after the subject has been calmly resting (seated or su pine) for a minimum of 
5 minutes. Vital signs will be assessed according to the schedule in Appendix A  and at 
unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated. On study visits when clinical laboratory tests are performed, assessment of vital signs should precede blood draw.  
6.2.2 Physical Examination  
Physical examinations, including height and weight measurements, will be performed 
according to the schedule in Appendix A  and at unscheduled study visits when clinically 
indicated. A complete physical examination will be performed at the screening visit, while subsequent examinations will be abbreviated and targeted to changes in disease activity

Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 30 and/or subject s’ symptoms. If  targeted breast examinations ar e to be performed in female 
subjects, please perform breast examination after blood draw for clinical laboratory tests.  
6.2.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected according to the schedule in 
Appendix A  and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated, and analyzed at a 
central laboratory unless otherwise specified.  Detailed  instructions regarding sample collection, preparation, and shipment can be found in 
the labora tory manual. Laboratory assessments will include the following, and are ideally 
performed in the morning, particularly at visits with endocrine assessments (Screening, 
Week 10, and Follow- up):

• Iron studies: ferritin, serum iron   
• Serology: hepatitis B and C serology, HIV 
• Serum IgE 
• Pregnancy testing: all females of childbearing potential will have a local urine pregnancy test performed. Positive or equivocal urine pregnancy test results will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test analyzed at a central laboratory  
• Endocrine: TSH, free T4, cortisol, corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH), prolactin  
• Reproductive endocrinology (for all female subjects under 55 years of age at consent, who are not using hormonal contraception or other hormonal therapies at Screening): serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, 
progesterone, anti- Mullerian hormone (AMH)  
• Optional study provided in lab test kits for use at Screening only: endomysial antibody 
with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis  
• Additional optional studies deemed necessary by the investigator to rule out specific 
conditions associated with chronic pruritus based on a subject’s history, physical examination, and/or screening labs may be performed; the investigator should discuss the need for such studies with the medical monitor during the Screening period. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 31 • Standard cosyntropin stimulation testing should be performed on subjects with low 
cortisol level (i.e. < 3.0 mcg/dL); the investigator should discuss low cortisol (and relevant low corticotropin) results with the medical monitor.  
 
6.2.4 Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG wil l be performed after the subject has been calmly resting in a 
supine position for a minimum of  5 min utes before obtaining the ECG. ECGs should precede 
measurement of vital signs and blood dra w for clinical laboratory tests and will be performed  
according t o the schedule in Appendix A  and at unscheduled study visits when clinically 
indicated . ECGs will be  read centrally. The ECG machine and detailed instructions will be 
provided by the ECG vendor. 
6.3 Pharmacokinetic Measurements  
Sparse PK sampling will involve collecting one PK sample at the week 10 visit according to 
the schedule in Appendix A . The date and time of dosing prior to PK sample collection and 
date and time of PK sample collection will be recorded. The plasma concentrations of 
serlopitant and metabolites M1/ M1a, M2/ M2a and M3 will be determined and data used for 
population PK analysis. Detailed instructions regarding PK sample collection, preparation, 
and shipment can be found in the laboratory manual.

right to withdraw from  the study at any time and without providing reasons. If provided, the 
reason (adverse event, study burden, lack of efficacy, other) a subject withdrew consent will 
be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). The PI or site staff must make every effort to contact subjects  who are suspected of being lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact 
such subjects must be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 40 7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug  in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include treatment emergent exacerbation s of pre- existing illness es and AE s that occur as 
a result of protocol- mandated  interventions.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect 
• Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronch ospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital 
department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, 
admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy).

Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 41 The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the inten sity of an 
AE (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g. se vere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulato ry reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF.  
7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogram Findings  
Abnormal physical exam findings that are clinically significant and are identified prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically significant abnormal physical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs.  
Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by the investigator (e.g. require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF . 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease or condition (e.g. elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney disease), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease) needs to be recorded on 
the AE eCRF  (rather than listing individual test findings as AEs).  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs.  
7.1.4 Deaths  
Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the follow-up visit, regardless of attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See Safety  Form Completion Instructions  for complete instructions. 
The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any fem ale 
who has experienced menarche and is pre -menopausal, unless permanently surgically sterile 
(e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) . A postmenopausal 
state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical  cause in a 
previously menstruating female.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 42 For the purposes of this  study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on 
Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines ( “U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” 2010 ; 
“Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; “M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010) :  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods:  
1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion  or ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 
2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence  from heterosexual intercourse, 
only if planned for the entire duration of the study period and consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle for the subject  
3. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; t hese may 
include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods  
4. Intrauterine  device/system   
5. Exclusive (sole) monogamous intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner; the male partner must have 
received medical assessment of the surgical success  
 
Progesterone-only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method of 
contraception, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. Male or female condoms with or without spermicide, and female caps, diaphragms, and sponges with spermicide, or combinations (double barrier) are also excluded as highly effective contraceptive methods. 
Any pregnancy occurring in a female subjec t or the female partner of a male subject, from 
the first study drug administration through the required follow -up visit must be reported 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See Safety Form  
Completion Instructions  for complete  instructions .  
The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies ( for example, spontaneous abortion) 
may qualify as SAEs and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See 
Safety  Form Completion Instructions  for complete instructions.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 43 7.1.6 Worsening of Pruritus   
Pruritus  should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if considered by the investigator to have 
worsened in severity beyond the subject’s typical fluctuations .  
7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting A dverse Events  
7.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded on source documentation and eCRF at 
the site, in accordance with protocol instructions.  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration through the 
follow-up visit . After the required follow -up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug-
related should be reported. 
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the 
investigator to be caused by a p rotocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs 
related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events 
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject contact through the follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator wil l make 
an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality.  
7.2.3 Assessment of Severity  
All AEs  entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0 (“ Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2017 ) to describe the maximum 
intensity of the adverse event.  
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in  Table  1. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 44 Table  1 Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Severity  Alternate Descriptiona 
1 Mild (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical 
or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumenta l activities of daily living  
(ADLb) 
3 Severe (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria) Severe or medically significant but not 
immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self care ADLc 
4 Very severe, life threatening, or 
disabling (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE   
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or report ed AE is not 
in the NCI CTCAE listing.  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the altern ate description of the grade.  
b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
c Self care ADL refer to  bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0 
 
Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory 
definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. 
If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), only the highest  severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF.   
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs  (serious and 
non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contr ibuted to an AE. 
Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: 
• Likely  Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response patt ern to the 
suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. 
• Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study drug. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 45 7.3 Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution 
until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined 
that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 
7.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor and Institutional 
Review Board  or Ethics Committee   
The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities related to investigational drugs in clinical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug.  
An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after 
informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been  discharged from the study, and the SAE is 
considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 
Please see the Safety  Form Report Completion Instructions for safety reporting instructions.  
The investigator must also  comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of 
SAEs to the IRB  or Ethics Committee (EC ). This may include initial or follow -up 
notification of an SAE or other safety information. 7.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Study 
Investigators 
The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related adverse events to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required.  The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or 
EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authorities. All investigators 
participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE 
reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities. 
7.6 Emergency Unblinding  
The investigator will immediately notify the Sponsor or the medical monitor to dis cuss the 
need for unblinding any subject via IWRS. There is no specific antidote for serlopitant and 
usual supportive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 46 8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics by treatment group and 
visit/timepoint. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: 
n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For 
categorical variables counts and percentages will be used.  Summary statistics for imputed 
efficacy data will be reported based upon imputed data. 
Baseline for measures other than the eDiary daily measures will be the last recorded value 
prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, baseli ne will be the 
average result measured over the week prior to treatment.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize  
This study will use a 5% one-sided alpha level.  The target sample size of 200 randomized and dosed subjects (100 per group) has been 
determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% one-alpha level. A sample size of two hundred subjects results in  at least 90% power assuming a 
placebo Week 10 4-point responder rate of % and serl opitant 4-point responder rate of 
%. 
The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13  (“PASS 13 Power Analysis 
and Sample Size Software” 2014 ) and use a Chi -Squared test . The primary analysis will 
control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will under- estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction resulting from 
stratification into account ( Matts 1988).  
8.2 Handling of Missing Data  
Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment , follow-up) be 
required for adverse events or concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible.  
If a subje ct fails to complete their eDiary for a week or more, the WI-NRS endpoints, 
including the primary endpoint, may be missing. In this case, the WI -NRS change from 
baseline value will be imputed. The approach uses the subject’s last week with data. From that point forward their trajectory will be imputed based upon the trajectory of their treatment group. 
The imputation  approach first determines the average change for each week  for each 
treatment group . The difference in the weekly measures between weeks n -1 and n will be 
considered the change for Week n. Any missing changes will be imputed to produce and 
them combined with the prior known value to produce a change from baseline result . For

Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 47 example, a placebo subject with known results at Week 4 but missing at Week 6 will have 
their Week 6 WI -NRS change from baseline imputed as ∆ 4+∆P(4-6), where ∆ 4 is the observed 
change from baseline result for the subject up to Week 4 and ∆ P(4-6) is the average placebo  
change from Week 4 to 6 (i.e. the average placebo decrease from Week 4 to 6). 
For the responder endpoints, the same imputation will be performed and the responder status 
determined based upon the change from baseline and the subject’s disposition and rescue medication status  (See Section 8.8 ).  
As a sensitivity analysis, a similar approach will be used where the imputation step uses multiple imputation methodology. 
8.3 Analysis Population s  
The primary efficacy population will be the full analysis population (FAP) and will include 
all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the 
treatment group  to which they are randomized.  
The primary safety population will be all treated subjects . For safety analyses, subjects will 
be classified based upon the treatment received.   
8.4 Subject Disposition  
An accounting of all randomized subjects by disposition will be presented. Subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and listed, with a description of the reason for early termination/withdrawal.  
8.5 Subject  Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. 
8.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded by the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary to Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) and preferred drug name .  
Prior therapies (including over- the-counter medications) used to treat pruritus  within the 
prior 3 months w ill be reported. Prior medications will be summarized by ATC level and 
preferred drug name and listed.  
Concomitant medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed.  Concomitant medication use will be quantified and analyzed. 
8.7 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure  
Compliance with study drug dosing will be determined based on tablet counts recorded on the eCRF. Compliance will be calculated by analyzing expected number of tablets returned versus actual number of tablets returned. Summaries of treatment exposure will also be produced.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 48 8.8 Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized within the FAP using descriptive statistics by time 
point and treatment.   
8.8.1 WI-NRS  
Subject record their WI -NRS measurements daily in an electronic diary . These daily 
measures are  combined into weekly measures (Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Follow -up) 
by averaging the daily measurements. Change from baseline is the difference between 
baseline and the post baseline weeks. Missing data will be imputed as outlined in 
Section  8.2. From this change from baseline the binary re sponder status (responder / 
non-responder) is created . A subject is a 4-point responder if t heir change from baseline is 
≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4). A 3- point respo nder is similarly defined . Subjects who 
withdraw from the study due to a lack of efficacy or require rescue therapy for treatment of 
worsening pruritus within four weeks prior to the timepoint will be defined as non-responder s regardless of their change from baseline.  
The daily WI-NRS endpoint (change from baseline in  daily WI -NRS scores through Week 2) 
is the change between the baseline WI -NRS (same baseline as the weekly measures) and the 
daily measures over the first two weeks.   
8.8.2 Primary Efficacy  
The WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10 (primary endpoint) will be summarized by 
treatment group . The difference in responder rate s between treatment arms will be tested 
using a CMH
 test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification  factor s. Conceptually t he 
hypotheses being tested are:  
H0:PPlacebo  ≥ Pserlopitant   H a: PPlacebo  < Pserlopitant 
where P Placebo  is the percent of placebo responders and P serlopitant is the similar percent for 
serlopitant.  
Sensitivity analyses using other missing data rules  will be performed. 
8.8.3 Secondary Efficacy and Exploratory 
Secondary endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics by time point and 
treatment. These summary measures will include baseline, result at the time point and change from baseline as is app ropriate for the endpoint. Missing data imputation will be limited to 
the WI -NRS and WI -VAS endpoints. 
The differences between treatment groups for the WI-NRS 4-point at Week s 2, 4, 6, and 8, and 
3-point responder rate s at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will be tested using the CMH test identical 
to the one used for the primary endpoint.

Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 49 The change from baseline to Week s 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and Days 1–14 for the WI- NRS will be 
testing using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment group and stratifica tion 
factor as fixed effects. The change in WI-VAS  to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10 will be tested using a 
similar ANOVA model.  
8.9 Safety Analyses  
8.9.1 Adverse E vents   
The incidence of all AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. 
These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a  subject 
reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject  will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. 
An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, t reatment -related AEs, AEs 
by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.  
SAEs will be listed and summariz ed in a similar manner to AEs . 
8.9.2 Clinical Safety  Laboratory R esults  
Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. S ummary statistics 
for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by 
scheduled visit. Graphs of laboratory values over time will also be produced.  
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at any 
post- baseline assessment will be summari zed. Shifts from baseline labo ratory values will be 
tabulated . 
8.9.3 Vital S igns  
The observed data and change from baseline for each measurement day will be su mmari zed 
with descriptive statistics.  
8.9.4 Electrocardiograms  
The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or normal) will be summarized and descriptively 
characterized, along with a summary of how many subjects developed a post treatment abnormal result.   
8.9.5 Physical Exams  
Physical exam finds will be recorded by the sites within medical history or adverse events and are otherwise not summarized.

Version 3.0   Page 52 9.8 Records and Electronic Case Report Forms  
All study data except central laboratory, PK, IWRS, eDiary , and ECG data will be recorded 
in an eCRF system (note: collection of central laboratory and PK blood draws will be 
recorded in the eCRF). Data will be entered at the site by the appropriately designated and trained site personnel. All source documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the subject’s medical records.  eCRFs will be completed for every subject screened 
in the study. 
The study monitor will review all eCRFs in detail and will have access to participant medical 
records, laboratory data, and other source documentation to allow required eCRF fields to be 
verified by source data. 
Data consistency and plausibility checks agains t data entered into the eCRF will be included 
in the eCRF system. Data corrections can be performed in the eCRFs by the site. For each 
instance of data modification, the system requires a reason for change. The system keeps a full audit trail of the data v alues, the date and time of modification, and the electronic 
signature of the user who performed the change. 
After a full review of the eCRFs by the study monitor and resolution of any data 
clarifications, the investigator will review, sign, and approve the subject’s eCRF. All 
essential documents, source data, clinical records, and laboratory data will be retained by the site in accordance with the ICH E6 guideline and the site’s data retention policies. These records must be available for inspection by the Sponsor, monitor, and regulatory authorities. 
Further detail regarding data management and eCRFs is included in the Data Management 
Plan.  
9.9 Good C linical P ractices and E thical S tudy C onduct  
The study procedures outlined in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with applicable ICH Guidelines, including ICH E6: Good Clinical Practices. As this study is 
conducted under a US IND, the investigator will also ensure that the basic principles of 
“Good Clinical Practice”, as outlined in 21 CFR 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, 21 CFR, part 50 and 21 CFR, part 56 are adhered to. 
The study procedures outlined in this protocol will also be conducted in accordance with the

Glossary of terms  
Assessment  A procedure used to generate data required by the study  
Enrollment  Point/time of patient entry into the study; the point at which informed 
consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to starting any of the procedures 
described in the protocol)  
Investigational drug  The study treatment whose properties are being tested in the study; this 
definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is synonymous 
with “investigational new drug.”  
Investigation al treatment  Drug whose properties are being testing in the study as well as their 
associated placebo and active treatment controls (when applicable). This 
also includes approved drugs used outside of their indication/approved 
dosage, or that are tested in  a fixed combination. Investigational treatment 
generally does not include other study treatments administered as 
concomitant background therapy required or allowed by the protocol 
when used in within approved indication/dosage  
Other study treatment  Any d rug administered to the patient as part of the required study 
procedures that was not included in the investigational treatment  
Subject Number (Subject No.)  A unique identifying number assigned to each patient/healthy volunteer 
who enrolls in the study  
Phase  A subdivision of the study timeline; divides stages into smaller functional 
segments such as screening, baseline, titration, washout, etc.  
Premature patient withdrawal  Point/time when the patient exits from the study prior to the planned completion of all study treatment administration and/or assessments; at 
this time all study treatment administration is discontinued and no further assessments are planned, unless the patient will be followed for 
progression and/or survival  
Stop study participation  Point/time at which the patient came in for a final evaluation visit or when 
study treatment was discontinued whichever is later  
Study treatment  Includes any drug or combination of drugs in any study arm administered to the patient (subject) as part of th e required study procedures, including 
placebo and active drug run -ins. 
In specific examples, it is important to judge investigational treatment component relationship relative to a study treatment combination; study treatment in this case refers to the in vestigational and non -investigational 
treatments in combination.  
Study treatment discontinuation  Point/time when patient permanently stops taking study treatment  for any reason; may or may not also be the point/time of premature patient 
withdrawal

1 Backg round  
1.1 Overview of Neuroendocrine Tumors  
Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are thought to arise from cells at the interface of nerves and 
endocrine glands. While slow growing, these are nonetheless incurable and lethal when 
advanced. The incidence of these tumors is also steadily increasing. The traditional classification of these tumors is anatomical, based on site of origin into foregut, midgut and 
hindgut NETs. Foregut NETs include thymic, bronchopulmonary, gastric, duodenal and 
pancreatic NETs. Treatment opt ions for metastatic pancreatic NETs (PNETs) continue to be 
limited as detailed below. Furthermore, treatment options for non- pancreatic metastatic 
foregut carcinoid tumors are severely limited with no FDA approved cytotoxic or targeted agents currently [ 1].  
The phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled study of lanreotide in patients 
with gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP -NETs)  randomized 204 patients with advanced, non-
functioning, SSA naive GEP -NETs (45% were PNETs)  with Ki -67 < 10% to lanreotide 
autogel 120 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for 96 weeks or until progressive disease or death. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included 
percentage of patients without disease progression at weeks 48 and 96 a nd overall survival. At 
two years of treatment, median PFS was not reached with lanreotide vs 18 months with 
placebo (hazard ratio, HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 -0.73; p = 0.0002). At end of 2 years of 
treatment, 62% of lanreotide treated patients vs 22% of placebo treated patients had not 
progressed or died. Very few serious treatment -related adverse events were noted [ 2]. 
The prospective, international, multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled phase III 
RADIANT -3 trial randomized 410 patients with progressing low - or intermediate grade 
advanced PNET to everolimus 10 mg daily plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo pl us 
BSC.  The primary endpoint was PFS. Treatment with everolimus demonstrated a 6.4 months prolongation of median PFS as assessed by the local investigators (11 months vs 4.6 months, 
HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.27- 0.45; p < 0.0001) [ 3].   
Suniti nib is an oral multi -tyrosine kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor 
and was evaluated in a phase III prospective, multicenter, international, double -blind placebo 
controlled study of patients with advanced, well -differentiated PNETs who were randomized 
to best supportive care vs sunitinib 37.5 mg daily. The primary endpoint was PFS. The study was designed to enroll 340 patients but was terminated after 171 patients were accrued due to 
an unplanned interim analysis that showed more adverse events in the placebo arm. At the 
final analysis, PFS in the sunitinib arm was 11.4 months vs 5.5 months with placebo (HR 
0.42; 95% CI 0.26 – 0.66; p < 0.001) [ 4].  
The aim of this study is to evaluate the response rate of LEE011 in patients with metastatic foregut neuroendocrine tumors.

1.2 Overview of the G1 to S phase transition in mammalian cells  
Normal mammalian cells proliferate in response to extracellular signals by transitioning 
through a series of tightly controlled phases that culminate in cell division. The commitment to transition from G1 to S phase and the i nitiation of cell cycle progression is regulated by the 
retinoblastoma protein (pRb). In the absence of appropriate growth stimuli, pRb, in its unphosphorylated state, binds and inhibits the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors,  preventing these proteins from activating the genes required for  S phase transition [5].  Upon mitogen stimulation, signaling through pathways such as the MAPK and PI3K 
pathways increases the abundance of  D -cyclins, which bind and activate cyclin- dependent 
kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 (CDK4/6).  Cyclin D -bound CDK4/6 then phosphorylates the pRb 
protein to deactivate it and release bound E2F. Once freed, E2F activates S phase -specific 
genes in order to start cell cycle progression.    Full deactivation of pRb requires its sequentia l 
phosphorylation at different sites by both cyclin D -CDK4/6 and cyclin E -CDK2.  The 
phosphorylation events mediated by CDK4/6 are prerequisites for those catalyzed by CDK2 [6]. The kinase activity of CDK4/6 is in turn inhibited by p16, encoded by the INK4a gene [ 5, 
7].  The CIP/K IP proteins, inhibitors of cyclin E -CDK2, also bind to the cyclin D -CDK4/6 
complex, and this results in further activation of CDK2 by sequestering CIP/KIP proteins from their target [ 8]. Cyclin D -CDK4/6 is therefore a key enzyme complex that regulates the 
G1 to S phase transition. 
1.3 Alterations in the D -cyclin- CDK4/6 -INK4a -pRb pathway in human 
malignancies:  
The D -cyclin -CDK4/6 -INK4a -pRb pathway is universally disrupted in cancer to favor cell 
proliferation. Eighty percent of human neoplasms maintain functional pRb but harbor aberrations that increase the activity of CDK4/6 to effectively inactivate pRb functi on.  These 
aberrations include genetic or epigenetic changes that directly increase the kinase activity of CDK4/6 or defects that activate the upstream regulators [ 5, 9].  One of the most common 
events is the inactivation of p16 via mutations, deletion and epigenetic silencing. p16 inactivation is frequently observed in a significant portion of non- small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), me lanoma, pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma [ 10-13]. Moreover, a specific 
mutation of the CDK4 gene (CDKR24C), that confers resistance to p16 binding, has been shown to play a causal role in rare cases  of familial melanoma, suggesting that unchecked 
CDK4 activity  is a key event in these cancers [ 14].

Translocations of the genes encoding D -cyclins to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus are 
found in a majority of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) and in many cases of multiple 
myeloma [15]. These translocations lead to constitutive expression of D -cyclins, which result 
in enhanced CDK4/6 kinase activity and unchecked cell proliferation [ 16]. Amplification of  
cyclin D1 and overexpression of the protein have also been reported in approximately 50% of squamous cell esophageal cancers [ 17] and  in 20 -30% of breast cancers [ 18, 19], suggesting 
that activation of this pathway may play a role  in the growth of these tumors.  Furthermore, 
many of the receptor -mediated growth pathways that are activated in human cancers increase 
D-cyclin transcription and expression to drive cell proliferation.  In mouse breast cancers 
driven by activated Ras or Her2/Neu oncogenes, cyclin D1 and CDK4 have been shown to be necessary for the tumorigenic phenotype in both initiation and maintenance phases, demonstrating that Cyclin -D1/CDK4 is the key effector enzyme complex for Ras - or 
Her2/Neu -driven cancers [20, 21]. Other activating aberrations of mitogen pathways such as 
V600E B -Raf in the MAPK pathway and PTEN deletions in the PI3K pathway also increase 
D-cyclins to  achieve unchecked proliferation, suggesting that CDK4/6 may also be crucial for 
the cancers bearing these alterations [ 22, 23]. Finally, the genes encoding CDK4 and 6 are 
amplified in a subset of human neoplasms. The CDK4 gene is amplified in 100% of liposarcomas along with the MDM2 gene, while CDK6 is frequently amplified in T -
lymphoblastic lymphoma and/or acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 24]. 
1.4 LEE011  
1.4.1  Overview of LEE011  
LEE011 is an orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6. LEE011 exhibits highly specific inhibitory activity against CDK4/cyclinD1 and CDK6/cylinD3 comple xes, 
with concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) values of 10 nM and 39 nM, respectively, in isolated enzyme assays. It is inactive against the majority of other kinases. LEE011 is currently being tested in a first -in-human clinical study [CLEE01 1X2101]  in adult 
patients with refractory cancer.  
Pharmacology of LEE011  
LEE011 inhibits the growth of many tumor cell types in vitro  and in vivo including ER+ 
breast cancer. In a panel of human breast cancer cell lines, dose- dependent inhibition of 
proliferation was observed in ER+ breast cancer cell lines, with IC50 < 1µM being observed for most ER+ breast cancer lines. Regardless of the various genetic aberrations that may be present in the cancer cells, the anti -tumor activity of LEE011 requires t he presence of 
functional retinoblastoma protein (Rb).

Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of LEE011  
Four different species were used to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LEE011: mouse, 
rat, dog and monkey. The absorption of LEE011 after ora l administration was moderate for 
rats (48 to 84%). Bioavailability ranged between 10% and 65% across animal species. Time to maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) was between 2 and 4 hours. Terminal half -life 
(T 1/2) of LEE011 was moderate in rodents a nd monkeys (2 to 7 h), and was longer (18 h) in 
dogs.
 
The binding of LEE011 to plasma proteins was moderate (unbound fraction in human plasma for humans = 30). [
3H]-LEE011 and its metabolites are extensively distributed into the organs 
and tissues of rats including choroid, ciliary body and meninges with the exception of the brain. Radioactivity concentrations were highest in tissues such as the pituitary gland, pineal gland, spleen, kidney and adrenal medulla with remarkably high exposure in the thyroid gland. Distribution of LEE011 and/or its metabolites into melanin- containing structures was 
seen in pigmented rats.  
Oxidative metabolism of LEE011 is dominated by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution of about 20% by flavin- containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). LEE011 is a moderate substrate 
of P-glycoprotein (P -gp). LEE011 is a time -dependent CYP3A4 inhibitor (KI 5.1 µM, kinact 
0.0245 min
-1) and a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2 at higher concentrations (Ki=16 µM). 
LEE011 inhibits the mitoxantrone -resistant protein ( MXR; IC50=24 µM) and human bile salt 
export pump (BSEP; IC50=4.7 µM), but not the BSEP of rat or dog. LEQ803 (N -
demethylation) is the main metabolite in humans, a major metabolite in the rat and monkey, and the only metabolite in dogs. This metabolite is w eakly pharmacologically active; 
however, it interacts with hERG channels in vitro .  
In rat ADME studies, LEE011 was predominantly excreted in the bile as metabolites, with limited excretion of unchanged drug in urine. The bulk of the administered dose (87% ) was 
excreted within 24 h. 
Overall, the elimination of LEE011 may potentially be affected by co- administered drugs that 
inhibit or induce CYP3A4. LEE011 may inhibit substrates of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and BSEP, 
if sufficiently high concentrations are achieved i n vivo . 
Safety pharmacology and toxicology of LEE011  
In vitro , LEE011 did not show mutagenic or phototoxic potential. Safety pharmacology 
studies conducted did not reveal any effects on CNS or respiratory functions. In the dog telemetry study, prolongation of the average QT and QTc was observed with the potential to  
induce PVCs at higher exposure levels. LEE011 and LEQ803 likely contributed to the QT prolonging effects seen in vivo .

In rats and dogs, LEE011 induced bone marrow hypocellularity, lymphoid depletion, atrophy 
of the skin and intestinal mucosa, decreased bone formation and testicular atrophy. The liver, bile system and gall bladder (proliferative changes, cholestasis, sand -like gallbladder calculi, 
and inspissated bile) were identified as additional target organs of toxicity which are not likely related to  the primary pharmacology of LEE011. Correlating hematological and/or 
biochemistry changes were seen for the effects described in the bone marrow, lymphoid system and liver. All of the described changes were fully reversible in rats and dogs.  
Based on the mechanism of action and preclinical toxicology studies conducted, the major potential toxicities for LEE011 include myelosuppression, hepatic toxicity, and prolongation of the QT interval. The risk of these toxicities may be amplified by concomitant admini stration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
Clinical Stud ies with LEE011  
LEE011 is currently being investigated in patients as a single agent in 3 phase I studies:  
CLEE011X1101, CLEE011X2101, CLEE011X2102 and in combination in 10 studies: 8 phase Ib/II CLEE011X2105, CLEE011X2106, CLEE011X2107, CLEE011X2108, CLEE011A2112C, CMEK162X2114, CMEK162X2110, CLGX818X2102, a randomized phase II CLEE011A2201, and a randomized phase III CLEE011A2301. LEE011 is also being investigated in 3 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects: CLEE011A2111, 
CLEE011A2101, and CLEE011A2106.  
 
Single agent experience:  
In single agent trials, a total of 179 patients have been treated: 132 in study CLEE011X2101  
(in a Caucasian population, including 85 in the dose escalation), 15 in CLEE011X1101 (in Japanese patients, all in the dose escalation) and 32 in CLEE011X2102 (in patients under the  
age of 21 years, all in the dose escalation).  A total of 18 patients presented toxicities meeting the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria (10  
in CLEE011X2101, 4 in CLEE011X1101 and 4 in CLEE011X2102): these consisted of  
Grade 3 stomatitis, Grade 3 pulmonary embolism, Grade 3 hyponatremia, prolonged Grade  
3/4 neutropenia (x2), prolonged Grade 2 elevated creatinine, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (x5), Grade 3 asymptomatic QTcF prolongation with Grade 3 neutropenia, Grade 4 febrile  
neutropenia, Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (x2), Grade 3 electrocardiogram QT prolonged,  
Grade 3 fatigue, and Grade 3 asymptomatic QTcF prolongation with grade 4 neutropenia.  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) from study  
CLEE011X2101 were declared as 900 mg qd and 600 mg qd on a 3 weeks on/1 week off  
schedule, respectively. At the RDE, the most common (in at least 2 patients) adverse events  
(AEs) related to study treatment were (all grades, Grade 3/4): neutropenia (46.3%, 28.4%),  
leukopenia (46.3%, 19.4%), nausea (44.8%, 1.5%), thrombocytopenia (34.3%, 9%), fatigue  
(32.8%, 3%), anaemia (28.4%, 3%), diarrhoea (26.9%, 3%), lymphopenia (22.4%, 17.9%),  
electrocardiogram QT prolonged (9%, 0%), hyponatremia (3%, 1.5%), and febrile  
neutropenia (1.5%, 1.5%). Preliminary data for clinical activity from study CLEE011X2101  
show that out of 114 evaluable patients, 3 partial responses were seen at the 600 m g qd dose  
level: one in a BRAF/NRAS wild type, CCDN1 amplified melanoma patient, one in a  
CDKN2A loss head and neck acinar carcinoma patient, and one in an ER+/HER2- , PIK3CA

mutant, CCDN1 amplified breast cancer.  
 
As of 28- Mar-2014, PK data were available from approximately 128 patients from the first -in 
human (FIH) study CLEE011X2101. Following oral dosing, LEE011 was rapidly absorbed  
with median Tmax ranging from 1 to 5 hours. LEE011 plasma exposure exhibited slightly  
over-proportional increases in exposure across the dose range tested (50 to 1200 mg), with no  
clear evidence of time- dependent auto- inhibition of its clearance mediated by CYP3A4.  
Steady -state was generally reached by Day 8 and the mean effective T1/2 based on 
accumulation ratio (i.e., T1/2,a cc) ranged from 15.9 to 32.6 hours across the dose range tested.  
The accumulation ratio based on AUC obtained in a dosing interval (Racc) across the studied  
doses ranged from 1.55 to 2.52.   The MTD and RDE are still under evaluation for study CLEE011X1101 at the dose of 600 mg qd. In study CLEE011X2102, the MTD was determined to be 470 mg/m2 qd and the RDE was determined to be 350 mg/m
2 qd on a 3 week on/1 week off schedule in pediatric patients.  
A food effect study conducted in healthy subjects CLEE011A2111 indicated that LEE011  
administered as drug -in-capsule (DiC) can be taken without regard to meals.  
A drug -drug interaction (DDI) study with ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) and  
rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) conducted in healthy subjects CLEE011A2101 indicated that concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers may  
markedly affect LEE011 exposure and should be avoided.  A DDI cocktail study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) and caffeine (a  
sensitive CYP1A2 substrate) was conducted in healthy subjects CLEE011A2106. Preliminary  
PK data indicate that LEE011 (400 mg) is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, but did not have a  
substantial effect on CYP1A2 substrates in humans. Concurrent use of sensitive CYP3A4  
substr ates with a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided. Concurrent use of CYP1A2 
substrates is not expected to lead to clinically important DDIs.  
 Combination trial experience:  
LEE011 is being evaluated in several combination trials: letrozole (CLEE011A2201, CLEE011A2301]), letrozole and BYL719 CLEE011X2107, letrozole and buparlisib CLEE011A2112C, fulvestrant and buparlisib CLEE011X2108, everolimus and exemestane  
CLEE011X2106, LGX818 (CLEE011X2105, CLGX818X2102), MEK162 CMEK162X2114, or MEK162 and LGX818 C MEK162X2110. These trials are ongoing with the exception of  
CLEE011A2201 whose recruitment has been stopped on 28- July-2014. Phase I trials are still 
in the dose escalation phase. CLEE011A2201 and CLEE011A2301 are blinded trials and  
no safety data are avai lable at the time of this update. The most recent DMC meeting was held  
for study CLEE011A2301 on 03- Sep-2014 after 86 patients have started treatment, and the  
IDMC recommended continuing the study without any changes. 
Clinical pharmacokinetics of LEE011  
The PK of LEE011 have been evaluated following single and repeat daily doses in the 
ongoing single agent, phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas 
CLEE011X2101. Patients in all but one cohort received escalating doses of LEE011 onc e 
daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off schedule. In one cohort, patients received once daily

continuous dosing of 600 mg LEE011. PK sampling (pre -dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h 
post-dose) was conducted on Days 1 and 18 or 21 of Cycle 1. Additional PK sampling 
(predose and 1, 2, and 4 h post -dose) was conducted on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. Sparse 
samples were collected in Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles.  Following oral dosing, LEE011 was 
rapidly absorbed with median Tmax ranging from 1 to 4 h. LEE011 exhibited slightly over -
proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose range tested (50 to 1200 
mg), with no clear evidence of time -dependent auto -inhibition of its clearance mediated by 
CYP3A4. Steady  state was generally reached by Da y 8 and mean T1/2, acc ranged from 15.9 
to 32.6 h across the dose range (50 to 1200 mg). Mean Racc across the studied doses ranged 
from 1.55 to 2.52. At the 600 mg dose level, LEQ803, an active metabolite of LEE011, accounted for  approximately 8% (geometri c mean) of the LEE011 AUC0- 24h after a single 
dose and after multiple doses . Further details regarding pharmacokinetics of single agent 
LEE011 and in combination with other agents is available in the IB.  
1.5      Study purpose/rationale  
Recent advances in molecular genetics have shed new light on the carcinogenesis of NETs. Evidence suggests aberrant cell cycle regulation due to aberrations in MENIN (MEN1), p27 (CDKN1B), p16 (CDKN2A), and Cyclin D1 (CCND1) is critical in the carcinogenesis and malignant pro gression of NETs. 
 
The most common genetic cancer syndrome leading to the development of NETs is 
MEN1. [25] Germline mutation in MEN1 leads to the development of lung, thymic, and 
pancreatic NETs. Mutations in MEN1 appear to mediate carcinogenesis of NETs through dysregulation of p27, and p18.[ 26] Indeed, families with MEN1 phenotype without 
identifiable germline mutations in MEN1 have been found to have mutations in p27 (now called MENX syndrome ).[27] This is further supported by the role of MENIN in regulating 
normal pancreatic islets. A study in mice showed that a physiologic function of MENIN is to regulate endocrine mass through p27.[ 28] During pregnancy, a down regulation of MENIN 
leads to suppression of p27, cell cycle progression, and an increas e in pancreatic endocrine 
mass which serves to prevent gestational diabetes.  
 
Somatic mutation in MENIN is also the most common genetic abnormality in sporadic foregut 
NETs and have been identified in approximately 40% of pancreatic and lung NETs.[ 29-32] 
We recently conducted exome sequencing of approximate 200 genes among 23 cases of advanced NETs treated with everolimus in our prior investigator -initiated phase 2 studies 
conducted at MDACC (unpublished data). In addition to confirming the presence of mutation in MEN1, we also identified the homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B (p15), as well 
as copy number amplification of CCND1. In addition, alterations in p16 may also be mediated by epigenetic modification. We previously also reported the methylation of p16 i n 26% of 
NETs.  
 
Studies have suggested that intact Rb function is a prerequisite for CDK 4/6 inhibitors 
activity. Multiple studies using various methods have documented this in foregut tumors [ 33-
36] 
  2014- 0371  
  May 19, 2015  
  Page 14
    
 
Taken together, evidence suggests germ line mutations, somatic mutations and epigenetic 
silencing  in NETs lead to dysregulation of CDK 4 and CDK 6 in a majority of patients with 
foregut NETs. This dysregulation leads to cell cycle progression, carcinogenesis and malignant progression. LEE011 is an inhibitor of CDK 4 and CDK 6. There is strong scientif ic rationale to study LEE011 in advanced NETs.

3 Investigational plan 
3.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is an open- label, single center,  phase II  study of LEE011. Patients with advanced, 
progressive pancreatic NET and foregut carcinoids  and adequate organ function, 
performance status will be recruited. Patients will be treated with LEE011 600 mg po daily 
3 weeks on/1 week off in 28 day cycles.  This dose is based on prior phase I trials of this drug. 
Patients will be allowed to remain on study until disease progression  or unacceptable 
toxicities. Toxicity evaluations will be conducted at the beginning of each cycle while 
radiographic tumor evaluations will be carried out at baseline and every 3 cycles thereafter.   
The primary objective of the study is objective response rate and secondary objectives 
include progression free survival, safety analyses. Baseline molecular markers in archival  
tumor tissue will be evaluated for potential predictive markers to LEE011 therapy as 
exploratory objectives. A response rate of <5% will be considered unacceptable  i.e. the signal 
for further, larger studies with LEE011 in this patient population is ≥ 1 r esponse .  Refer to the 
statistical analysis section for greater detail.

study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient  
• Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)  
a. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of horm onal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate

cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository  
In case of use of oral contraception , women should have been stable on the same pill 
before taking study treatment.  
Note:  Oral contraceptives are allow ed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier 
method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug- drug interaction.  
Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have 
had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.  
17. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 21 days after st opping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A 
condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.  
18. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol . 
19. Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin -derived anticoagulant for 
treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) or fondaparinux is allowed.  
5 Treatment  
5.1 Treating the patient  
The investigator needs to ins truct the patient to take the study drug as per protocol.  All 
dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and any dose change  or interruption must be 
recorded as appropriately.  
5.1.1  Administration

  Page 22
    
5.1.2  Dosing and treatment schedule  
The following general guidelines should be fol lowed for LEE011 administration:  
• Patients should be instructed to take their once -a-day dose at approximately the same time 
each day . LEE011 can be taken without regard to meals. 
• Each daily dose of LEE011 should be taken with a glass of water and consumed over as 
short a time as possible unless otherwise instructed  
• Patients should be instructed to swallow capsules whole and to not chew or open them unless otherwise instructed.
  
• If vomiting occurs during the course of the treatment, t hen no re -dosing of the patient is 
allowed befor e the next scheduled dose  
• Any doses that are missed (not taken within 6 hours of the intended time) should be 
skipped and should not be replaced or made up on a subsequent day. 
• Patients should inform the  study team of any missed or delayed doses  
• Patients must avoid grapefruit products/juice, and Seville (sour) oranges/juice during the 
entire study. Orange juice is allowed.  
• On a day of lipid panel sampling, patients must be fasting from all food and drink for at 
least 8 hours overnight. Water is allowed during all fasting periods; however coffee, tea and juice are not permit ted during the fasting period.  
 
5.1.3  Dose modification and dose delay  
 
Investigators should follow the guidelines described below for the modification of LEE011 
treatment.  Toxicities will be graded per the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Any plan to deviate from these guidelines in view of 
the patient safety must be previously discussed with Novartis unl ess there is an urgent need 
for action. 
 
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. If study treatment is 
being held due to toxicity, scheduled visits and all assessments should continue to occur except the dosing of the study drug. If the patient requires a dose inte rruption of > 21 days 
from the previous dose, then the patient must be discontinued from study treatment. Patients who discontinue the treatment due to an adverse event or an abnormal laboratory value must be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event.  All dose changes or interruptions 
must be recorded appropriately. Provisional dose levels can be found in the table below.

For all grades  • Check the quality of the ECG.  
• Perform analysis of serum electrolytes (K+, Ca++, Phos, Mg++). If below the 
lower limit of normal, interrupt LEE011 administration, correct with 
supplements or appropriate therapy  as soon as possible, and repeat 
electrolytes until documented as normal.  
• Review concomitant medication usage for the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 
and/or to prolong the QT interval.  
• Check compliance with correct dose and administration of LEE011 .

6.1.1  Screening Examination 
The screening examination must start with the Informed Consent procedure. The investigator 
is obliged to give the patient thorough information about the study and the study related assessments, and the patient should be given ample time to consider his or her participation. The investigator must not start any study related procedure before ICF is signed and dated by both patient (and impartial witness, if applicable) and investigator.  
6.2 Assessment types  
6.2.1  Electrocardiogram  
Standard t welve- lead E CGs should be obtained after the patient has been resting for 5 -10 
minutes prior to each time point indicated. All E CGs should be recorded with the patient in 
the same physical position.  Screening ECGs should be obtained in triplicate approximately 2 
minutes apart.  
If an abnormal E CG is obtained at any time, patient’s electrolytes must be reviewed and 
repeat E CG measurements must be done after correction of electrolyte abnormalities. For 
patients with QTcF ≥481 ms, interrupt study treatment and follow the procedures des cribed in 
the “ LEE011  Dose Modification” section . If treatment is resumed, repeat ECGs 7 days and 14 
days after dose resumption (and then as clinically indicated) . ECGs will be performed 
according to the schedule in ( Table 6 -2).

6.2.2  Efficacy  
Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response after 3 cycles 
+/- 1 week.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained at 
least 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. The PI will be 
responsible for determining each participants ’ response to treatment.  The PI will document 
the response to treatment on a protocol -specific response form. The PI will sign the form 
and it will be included as part of the patient’s medical record.  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 35 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diamete r 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment.  
 
Evaluable for objective response.  Only those patients who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These  patients will have their response 
classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Pa tients who have lesions present at baseline that 
are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable 
for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter for non -nodal lesions and short axis 
for nodal lesions to be recorded) as > 20 mm by chest x -ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, 
or >10 mm with c alipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable.  In order for such lesions to be considered measurable, the radiation must be greater than 6 months prior to the study initiation, and there must have been subsequent evidence of disease progression in the radiated tumor lesions.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pa thologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be > 15 mm in short axis when assessed.  At baseline and in follow -up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 36 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including sm all lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-
measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identi fied as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of  the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum .  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
 
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline  evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified an d reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 37 
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 
≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by color photograph y, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice  thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, 
and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline 
and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
 
PET- CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use 
with RECIST measurements.  Howev er, if the site can document that the 
CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should 
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 38 
not be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations 
cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it c annot be guaranteed 
that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in comple te clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  
96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148- 1159, 2008] .  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria 
which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534- 1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of  the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 39 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -
PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds 
to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on 
CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT 
that is not p rogressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response 
to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of F DG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
d.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Response Criteria  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 40 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions o nly is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

lesions may be accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discont inuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time 
should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.

Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started, including the baseline mea surements.  
 
Progression- Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Response Review  
 
The PI will be responsible for determining each participant ’s response to treatment.  All 
imaging will be done with no thicker than 2.5 mm reconstruction as per the standard of care for our institutional imaging.  
 
6.2.3  Safety  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events, including serious adverse events, the monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, ECG and the regular monitoring of vital signs, and physical exam including weight; and performa nce status.  
 
6.2.4  Biomarkers  
Biomarkers (from blood and/or tissue as indicated on Table 6.1) will be obtained for the 
following objectives:  
1) To evaluate efficacy of target inhibition with LEE011 therapy  
2) To evaluate for predictors of response to LEE011  
3) To evalu ate for markers of resistance to LEE011 therapy  
 
Archival tumor tissue equivalent to at least 2 core biopsies will be collected prior to initiation 
of treatment. Paired pre-  and post - treatment tumor biopsy will be obtained from all patients 
(required).  Pre -treatment biopsy will be obtained within 4 weeks before initiating therapy. 
Post-treatment tumor biopsy will be obtained on day 1 (+ / - 3 days) of cycle 2.  All FNA 
biopsies to be used for molecular profiling will be frozen immediately. Tissue will be  picked -
up by the laboratory personnel of Funda Meric -Bernstam. Tissue biomarker studies will be 
performed at the laboratory of Funda Meric -Bernstam, University of Texas M. D. Anderson 
Cancer Center.

This tumor tissue will be used to asses Ki67 and levels of pharmacodynamics markers 
including but not limited to pRB and cyclin D1 cyclin E, p16, p21 and p27 at baseline and at cycle 2 day 1. Marker expression will be assessed by a pathologist blinded to outcomes and treatment status.  Level of marker expressio n will be assessed by H score, incorporating both 
intensity (0 to 3), and percentage of cells stained; thus providing a score of 0- 300.  For IHC, 
we will compare the H -score at baseline to H -scores on -treatment.  
In addition, genomic profiling including methylation, mutations, deletions and amplifications in the CDK 4/6 pathway genes including but not limited to MEN1 , Cip/Kip protein genes such 
as CDKN1B (coding for p27), INK4 protein genes such as CDKN2A  (coding for p16), D -
cyclin genes such as CCND1, CCND2, CCND3 (coding for cyclins D 1 -3), CDK4, CDK6  will 
be also be performed.  
 
Optional biopsies will be taken at the end of study in patients who are willing and have 
demonstrated  partial response or prolonged progression free survival. These biopsies will be analyzed with additional targeted sequencing in addition to other assays such as FISH, RNA seq, IHC, RPPA, methylation assays, rearrangement assays through the MD Anderson unusual responders program.  
 
Blood for genomic DNA will be collected at baseline.  
 Serum tumor markers including chromogranin- A, neuron specific enolase will be obtained at 
baseline, cycle 2, Day 1, cycle 4 day 1 and every 3 cycles thereafter. These tests may be 
obtained more frequently per treating physician’s discretion . 
 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by response category in an attempt to characterize these changes with respect to efficacy.

7 Safety monitoring and reporting  
7.1 Adverse Events 
7.1.1  Definitions and reporting 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by 
investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. An adver se event is any 
undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting study drug ( LEE011) , even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. Medical 
conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only cons idered adverse events 
if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent form are recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or  test results constitute adverse 
events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy, and are recorded.  
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded on the FDA MedWatch 3500a form for reporting to the supporting drug company, Novartis. To ensure patient safety each serious adverse event must also be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Please refer to Section 7.1.2 for the definition of a  serious adverse 
event .  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for the:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
• treatment, which was elective or pre- planned, for a pre -existing condition  that did not 
worsen  
• treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospital admission.  
Pregnancy, although not itself a serious adverse event, should also be reported on the  serious 
adverse event form and Novartis Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities. 
Safety monitoring and reporting 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by investigator questioning, or detected through phy sical examination, laboratory test or other 
means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate.  
The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse events and assigning the a ttribution for each event for all 
subjects enrolled on the trial.  
Protocol specific data and adverse events will be documented in the medical record and 
entered into PDMS/CORe.  PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form  
(CRF)  for this pro tocol.  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 45 
Adverse events  
Definitions and reporting  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded in  
PDMS/CORe . Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be 
recorded in the Medical History  section  of PDMS/CORe . . Adverse event monitoring should 
be continued for at least 30 days (or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer) following the last dose 
of study treatment. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be 
described using a diagnosis whe never possible, rather than individual underlying signs and 
symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event.  
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by  non-directive questioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered 
by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or 
other assessments. As far a s possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. The severity Grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -4) 
2. Its duration (Start and end dates or if continuing at the Safety Follow -up Visit)  
3. Its relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes)  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, hospitalized, unknown, not applicable)  
5. Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant me dication/non- drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non- drug therapy)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequalae, fatal, unknown)  
7. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as in Section 7.1.2. 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping concomitant treatments, changes in the fr equency or nature of assessments, hospitalization, or 
any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) o f any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drugs can be found in the [Investigators’ Brochure]. This information should be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed.  
Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least 30 days following the last dose of study treatment 
Laboratory test abnormalities  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 46 
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse event in their own right (are considered 
clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy or require changes in study treatment), shoul d be recorded in PDMS/CORe . Whenever possible, 
a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (e.g. anemia instead of low hemoglobin). Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for Adverse Events should be followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported adverse event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as define d below and/or 
as per investigator’s discretion. A dose hold or medication for the lab abnormality may be required by the protocol and is still, by definition, an adverse event. 
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may no t result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospita lization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32). 
 
• Important medical events as defined above may also be considered serious adverse 
events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if 
deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator or the IND Sponsor, IND Office.  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 47 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University  of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board 
Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the  IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of 
knowledge of the event).  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of 
the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.  
 
• (Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for 
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from th e time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention,  until 30 days after the last study treatment/intervention, unless the 
participant withdraws consent. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical 
recovery is complete and laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 30 day time period that are related to the study treatment must be reported t o the IND Office. This may 
include the development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Sponsor (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ensure that serious adverse 
events are reported according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
7.2 Communications between Investigator and Novartis  
7.2.1  Reporting responsibility  
The principal investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology (DS&E)  
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 48 
7.2.2  Reporting procedures to Novartis  
The investigator must complete the FDA MedWatch 3500a form and Novartis SAE 
coversheet in English, assess the relationship to study treatment and send the initial completed MedWatch form and Novartis SAE coversheet by fax 1.888.299.4565 within 24 hours to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology (DS&E) .  The investigator must then ensure 
that the form and coversheet are accurately and fully completed with follow -up information 
and fax those to Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology (DS&E) within 2 to 3 calendar days for deaths or life -threatening events and 5 calendar days for other serious adverse events. The 
original and the duplicate copies of the FDA MedWatch form, Novartis SAE coversheet, and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept wit h the case report forms at the study site.  
Follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated, and whether the patient continued or discontinued study participation. The 
MedWatch form, Novartis SAE  coversheet,  and fax confirmation sheet must be retained. 
Pregnancy follow -up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary 
or spontaneous termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any congenital 
abnormalitie s or birth defects. 
7.2.3  Pregnancies  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported. To ensure patient safety each pregnancy must also be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be follow ed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study  Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to the oncology Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology (DS&E) department. 
Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment 
of the possible relationship to the Novartis study treatment of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
8 Statistical methods and data analysis  
This is a single arm, open -label exploratory/ phase II study.  Since no effective treatments are 
available in this setting, a response rate of 15% (within 95% CI) is considered acceptable – 
i.e., the signal for launching further, larger studies with LEE011 in this patient population is ≥ 
1 response in the current study .  If no response is observed, the  treatment LEE011 is 
considered ineffective. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled and treated to rule out a response rate of 15% of less when at least one response is observed with 96% power.  In other words, with twenty patients treated, the probabilit y of observing at least one response is more than 
96% if the response rate is at least 15%.  Descriptive statistics including with 90% confidence interval will be computed. Observed response profile , clinical benefit rate at 6 months and 
PFS along with rel evant confidence interval s will be used to guide future development 
decisions.

9 Ethical considerations and administrative procedures  
9.1 Ethics and good clinical practice  
This study must be carried out in compliance with the protocol and Good Clinical Practice, as 
described in:  
1. ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996.  
2. Directive 91/507/EEC, The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European 
Community.  
3. US 21 Code of Federal Regulations dealing with clinical studies (including parts 50 and 56 concerning informed consent and IRB regulations). 
4. Declaration of Helsinki, concer ning medical research in humans (Recommendations 
Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Helsinki 1964, amended Tokyo 1975, Venice 1983, Hong Kong 1989, Somerset West 1996). 
 2014- 0371  
  May 1 9, 2015  
  Page 50 
The investigator agrees, when signing the protocol, to adhere to the instructions and 
procedures described in it and thereby to adhere to the principles of Good Clinical Practice 
that it conforms to.  
9.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other information to subjects, must be reviewed by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC/REB). A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the IRB/IEC/REB must be given to Novartis before study initiation. Any amendments to the protocol, must be approved by Novartis, the IND office, and this committee.  
9.3 Informed consent  
The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that 
participation in the study is vo luntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any 
time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or 
relationship with the treating physician.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard wr itten statement, written in 
non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing 
and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the documents, oral presentation may be made or signature given by the subject’s legally appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed conse nt has been obtained. 
The informed consent form is considered to be part of the protocol, and must be submitted by the investigator with it for IRB/IEC/REB approval.  
Fertile men and women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study  
medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the 
study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study. If there is any question tha t the patient will not 
reliably comply, they should not be entered in the study.  
9.4 Discontinuation of the study  
Novartis reserves the right to discontinue support for any study under the conditions specified in the clinical trial agreement.  
9.5 Amendments to the  protocol  
Any change or addition, including administrative aspects, to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis , the IND office  and the IRB  before 
implementation. A copy of the written approval of the IRB/IEC/R EB, must be sent to

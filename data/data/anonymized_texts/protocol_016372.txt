1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATION ALE 
 
1.1 Esophageal and Gastric Cancers  
 
Esophageal and gastro -esophageal tumors have been on the rise since 1975 per the SEER 
database while gastric cancers have remai ned stable [1].  The American Cancer Society 
estimates 38,500 new cases of esophageal and gastric cancer are diagnosed annually in 
the United States [2].  Esophageal cancer has an approximate 86% fatality rate and the 
gastric cancer fatality rate is approximately 48% [2].  Esophageal cancer present s as 
incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease in approximately 60% of cases.   In the 
US during 2012, this corresponds to  an estimated 17,460 new esophageal cancer  cases 
with a staggering  15,070 expected deaths  [3].  Poor long -term survival rates are also s een 
in advanced gastric cancer ; in the United States , approximately 21,320 patients are 
diagnosed annually, while 10,540 are expected to die from the disease [3].  Most  
symptomatic gastric cancer patients in the United States already have  incurable disease at 
time of diagnosis.   The h igh mortality rate from these cancers reflects  aggressive biology, 
advanced stage at d iagnosis, and lack of effective multimodality therapies.  As the goal of 
therapy is palliation in the majority of cases, t he current environment presents many 
opportunities for improvement.   
 
1.2 Combination Regimens for the Treatment of Esophagogastric Cancers  
 
Standard  first-line chemotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced gastroesophageal 
cancer s usually involves a two - or three -drug regimen,  typically including a combination 
of a fluoropyrimidine (5 -FU or capecitabine) and a platin um agent (such as cisplatin or 
oxaliplatin ) [4].  Per NCCN, two -drug cytotoxic regimens are preferred because of lower 
toxicity.  Although three -drug cytotoxic regimens are acknowledged for medically fit 
patients with a good performance stat us, it also requires access to frequent toxicity 
evaluations.  Preferred regimens with category 1 data are DCF (docetaxel, cisplatin , and 
fluorou racil), ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin and fluorouracil), and lastly the combination of a 
fluoropyridine (fluoroura cil or capecitabine) and cisplatin  [5, 6].   
 
Based on the 2008 study for Cunningham et al, capecitabine and oxaliplatin for advanced 
esophagogastric cancer is as effectiv e as fluorouracil and cisplatin when compared in this 
randomized trial  [7].  Therefore, combining  a fluoropyrimidine with either cisplatin or 
oxaliplatin are accepted options.  A randomized phase III trial of irinotecan/5 -fluorouracil 
showed  borderline noninferiority to cisplatin/5 -fluorouracil in naïve patients with 
advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction  and a second -line 
study evaluating irinotecan demonstrated a survival benefit for patients receiving this 
medic ation [8] [9]. Taken together, the efficacy of oxaliplatin and irinotecan ha s been 
demo nstrated in these cancers and are included in the NCCN guidelines.  
 
The combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) 
has become more commonly used in gastrointestinal malignancies in recent years.  In 
2011, the New England Journal of Medicine published  a study of  FOLFIRINOX versus 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 9 of 52 gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer  [10].  The study randomized 342 patients to 
receive either FOLFIRINOX or single agent gemcitabine  (standard of care) .  The median 
overall survival was 11.1 months in the FOLFIRINOX grou p compared to 6.8 months in 
the gemcitabine group (HR death, 0.57; 95% confidence 0.45 -0.73; P<0.001).  Also in 
this study, t he objective response rate was 31.6% in the FOLFIRINOX  group versus 
9.4% in the gemcitabine group (P<0.001).  More adverse events were  noted in the 
FOLFIRINOX group, specifically 5.4% percent with febrile neutropenia.  
 
Similar ly, a phase III trial of infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and 
irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) was used as first line treatment for metastatic colorectal ca ncer 
[11].  The study randomized 244 patients to receive either FOLFOXIRI or FOLFIRI.  
The study noted an increase in grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, but not a statistically significant 
increase in febrile neutropenia with FOLFOXIRI.  Both the progression -free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) were both significantly improved in the FOLFOXIRI 
arm (median PFS, 6.9 v 9.8 months, hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; P = 0.0006; median OS, 
16.7 v 22.6 months; HR, 0.70; P=0.032).  Responses, as assessed by  investigators were 
41% vs. 66% for FOLFIRI  and FOLFOXIRI  respectively (P = .0002). Response 
confirmed by an external panel was 34% versus 60% (P < .0001).       
 
We hypothesize that FOLFIRINOX will result in a similar increase of overall response 
rate and  survival in patients with gastroesophageal cancers.  
 
1.3 HER2 Expression  
 
The HER -2 receptor is a member of the epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) family of 
receptors which participate in activation of pathways controlling epithelial cell growth 
and differentiation  [12]. Amplification of HER2 or overexpression of its protein product 
has been wide ly used as a target for therapy in breast cancer.  HER -2 positivity has been 
identified in 23.7% of gastric cancers, providing the opportunity to target HER2 
positivity in advanced disease (4).   
 
1.4 Trastuzumab (Herceptin)  
 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant DNA -derived humanized monoclonal antibody against 
HER2 and is approved by FDA for treatment of metastatic and early stage breast cancer 
that overexpresses HER2.   It has also been approved by FDA for use with chemotherapy 
in the treatment of gastric and gastroes ophageal tumors that are HER2 -positive . 
 
A recent international phase 3 study trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) compared 
capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six 
cycles compared to chemotherapy in combinati on with trastuzumab as first line treatment 
of HER2 -positive advanced gastric or gastro -esophageal junction cancer [13].  The 
median survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12 -16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus 
chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10 -13) in those assigned to chemotherapy 
alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60 -0.91; p=0.0046) [13].  This pivotal study led to the 
approval of trastu zumab for the treatment of HER -2 expressing gastroesophageal cancers.  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 10 of 52  
1.5 Study Ration ale 
 
FOLFIRINOX has been show n to provide marked increases in response rates and 
survival in patients with cancers of the lower gastrointestinal tract such as colorectal 
cancer.  We hypothesize that this regimen will be tolerated and that similar effects will be 
seen in patients with c ancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract.  T his study proposes a 
phase II clinical trial FOLF IRIN OX chemotherapy for treatment of advanced gastric, 
gastro -esophageal junction, and esophageal tumors .  Because of t he statistically 
significant improvement  in outcomes  identified in the ToGA trial , trastuzumab will be 
added to the  FOLFIRINOX  regimen for patients who are HER2 -positive .  To our 
knowledge, that regimen has not been previously administered to patients, so safety and 
tolerability will be monitored and reported.  Disease response parameters from the 
HER2 -positive patients will be collected for future analysis.  
 
1.6 Correlative Studies Background  
 
It is readily accepted that mutations acquired during cancer initiation and progression can 
result in altered proteins that contribute to transformation. [14-17] Alternatively, many 
passenger mutations are acquired as byproducts of the genomic instability accompanying 
cellular transformation. In either scenari o, these genomic alterations may result in the 
expression of mutant proteins that are perceived as foreign proteins by the immune 
system and are more exploitable targets for immune -mediated tumor control. [18, 19]  
Abnormal proteins that arise as a consequence of somatic mutations, termed neoantigens, 
when recognized by T cells can lead to an immune -mediated anti -tumor response in 
patients. [20, 21]  It has been clinically demonstrated that checkpoint blockade 
immunotherapy facilitates the expansion of preexisting T cells specific for tumor 
neoantigens and that mutation -associated neoantigen recognition is an important 
component of the endogenous antitumor immune response. [22] Therefore the likelihood 
of generating tumor neoantigens appears to be roughly proportional to the number of 
somatic mutations present within a given tumor. Our working hypothesis is that the 
response rates to checkpoint inhibitors may be enhanced by e levating the expression of 
tumor neoantigens through effective chemotherapy.  
 
1.6.1 Evidence supporting that chemotherapy enhances immune response  
 
Standard cancer chemotherapy can promote tumor immunity by inducing 
immunogenic cell death as part of its intended therapeutic effect and by disrupting 
tumoral immune evasion. Chemotherapy drugs at their standard doses and 
schedule can mediate their antitumor effects by inducing immunogenic cell death 
involving the concomitant release of tumor antigens and the  emission of danger -
associated molecular patterns (DAMP) in the tumor microenvironment. [23] 
However, multiple factors including tumor biology, the particular 
chemotherapeutic agent and dose/schedule, may influence whether tum or cell 
death is immunogenic, and which cell death pathway is activated. Other forms of 
immunogenic chemotherapy -induced cell death include autophagy. [24, 25]  It has 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 11 of 52 been suggested that the generation of endogenous immune mediated anti -tumor 
responses may be required for durable success of conventional 
chemotherapies. [26] This hypothesis has led to considerable interest in combining 
immunotherapy with conventional chemotherapy, even though the optimal 
methods of combining these treatment strategies are incompletely understood.  
 
Immunotherapy concepts that favor combinations w ith chemotherapy to augment 
efficacy include chemotherapy induced enhancement of tumor antigen 
presentation by upregulating the expression of tumor antigens themselves, or of 
the MHC class I molecules to which the antigens bind. Alternatively, 
chemotherapy  may upregulate costimulatory molecules (e.g. B7 -1) or 
downregulate coinhibitory molecules (PD -L1/B7 -H1 or B7 -H4) expressed on the 
tumor cell surface, enhancing the strength of effector T -cell activity. 
Chemotherapy may also render tumor cells more sensiti ve to T cell –mediated 
lysis through fas -, perforin -, and Granzyme B –dependent mechanisms. [27, 28] 
Numerous reports confirm the expected synergy between conventional 
chemotherapy and immune therapy, and as above, the synergy is mediated by 
diverse mechanisms including preferential depletion of regulatory T reg cells [29-
31], liberation of homeostatic or inflammatory cytoki nes[32, 33]  and enhanced 
immunogenicity of chemotherapy treated tumors. [25, 34]  In the context of 
vaccines targeting self -antigens, chemotherapy given prior to or during [35] 
vaccination can yield synergy and enhanced survival. [31, 36]  In a phase III trial , 
ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA -4, was used in 
combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.  Patients 
receiving ipilimumab in combination with dacarbazine had significantly improved 
overall survival compared with patients receiving dacarbazine alone. [37] 
Additionally, a phase II trial in patients with advanced staged lung cancers 
combined ipilimumab with standard chemotherapy. Treatment timing in this study 
showed that a ‘phased regimen’ in which immunotherapy began after 
chemotherapy r esulted in substantially improved progression -free survival (PFS) 
compared with chemotherapy alone. [38, 39]  This study also showed that the 
clinical effects of administer ing immunotherapy in combination with 
chemotherapy may be dependent on the sequencing of treatment.  
 
Conversely, however, other clinical trials have shown that certain standard 
chemotherapies may also inhibit immunotherapy.  One concern has been that the 
chemotherapy will preferentially kill rapidly proliferating cells - in this case the T 
cell response required for immune -mediated anti -tumor activity. In clinical trials 
of pancreatic and prostate cancers, specific vaccine/chemotherapy sequencing 
strategies may have impaired vaccine -induced immunity. [40, 41]  Thus, the 
optimal integration of immunotherapies with standard cancer therapies to 
minimize antagonistic interactions and engage potential synergies is therefore of 
great importance. One strategy is to g ive immunotherapy in the setting of minimal 
residual disease, after the tumor mass has been optimally reduced with surgery or 
effective systemic chemotherapy. This sequencing strategy minimizes the 
negative impact of tumor bulk (e.g. via tumor -expressed im munosuppressive 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 12 of 52 factors) on the potency of the antitumor immune response. It also allows 
chemotherapy to modulate the immune phenotype of any residual tumor cells. 
Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown improved responses to 
immunotherapy in t he setting of either lower tumor burden or in combination with 
preparative regimens aimed at cytoreduction. [42, 43]  However, the use of distinct 
chemotherapy drugs which can have differing immune effects, adds to the 
complexity of determining the relationships between chemo therapy treatments 
and immune response (reviewed in [27, 44] ). 
 
1.6.2 Correlative Study Procedures  
 
Patients undergoing highly active chemotherapy will undergo extensive immune 
profiling with aim towards characterizing the immune response to this 
chemotherapy to inform future immunotherapy studies and aid in optimizing thes e 
treatments. Assessment of the tumor, tumor microenviro nment and immune 
system will be characterized at baseline, after 2 cycles of chemotherapy and at 
time of p rogression.  
 
Biopsies from primary or metastatic lesions : Ten consenting patients with 
accessible metastatic lesions will undergo optional paired core biopsies from one 
metastatic lesion prior to the start of FOLFIR INOX chemotherapy and after 2 
cycles of therapy.  At the time of tumor progression, patients will be approached 
about having a b iopsy of a n accessible site of metastatic disease. . Four to 8 cores 
will be taken at each time point. Biopsy of metastases will be obtained by core 
needle and will be performed under ultrasound or CT -guidance  via interventional 
radiology . These specimens will be used to characterize changes in biomarkers 
and immune parameters associated with tumoral response or resistance.   
  
Peripheral blood testing: Participating patients will undergo phlebotomy at the 
specified time points: Pre -chemotherapy th en post -chemotherapy at 2 -week 
intervals at the time of standard -of-care phlebotomy for a maximum of 8 blood 
draws. Blood will again be drawn at the time of documented tumor progression.  
 
Tumor immune correlates: Analysis will be performed by co-investiga tors from 
the Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs (CHiiPs) and 
the McDonnell Genome Institute (MGI).  Expression of PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2, 
and CTLA -4 (an alternative checkpoint pathway) will be determined by IHC on 
tumor cells and tumor inf iltrating leukocytes (TIL). Tumor samples obtained from 
primary or metastatic biopsies will be analyzed for these biomarkers. Expression 
levels of checkpoint molecules (PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2, and CTLA -4) will be 
compared in paired primary and metastatic biops ies.  Each patient will serve as is 
its own comparator.  The frequency of concordant or discrepant expression of 
various mechanisms of checkpoint inhibition between primary and metastatic 
disease sites will be defined.  
 
Single cell suspensions will be mad e from fresh tissue to characterize the 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 13 of 52 phenotype of various populations of infiltrating leukocytes (T cells, B cells, NK 
cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells) by multi -parametric flow 
cytometry (FACS) and mass cytometry (CyTOF). Expression of var ious 
activation and inhibitory markers on the TIL will also be assessed.  
    
Tumor neoantigen assessments:  Mutation burden will be determined by whole 
exome sequencing. PBMCs will be used to obtain germline sequences for 
comparison to isolated tumor from t issue biopsies (somatic mutations).  
- Tumor cells will be microdissected from tissue biopsies and sent for whole 
exome sequencing and RNAseq to quantify the mutational landscape as a 
surrogate of antigenic burden. Whole exome sequencing and RNAseq will be 
performed on tissue samples to identify potential neoepitopes via MHC class I 
and II prediction algorithms. Identified neoepitopes will be validated in 
peptide -specific autologous peripheral blood mononuclear stimulation assays.  
- Tumor neoantigen identificat ion and definition by established techniques. 
MHC tetramers against the specific identified tumor neoantigens will allow

4.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
Patients must not start any protocol intervention  prior to registration through the Siteman 
Cancer Center.  
 
 
The following steps must be taken bef ore registering patients to this study:  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 16 of 52  
1. Confirmation of patient eligibility  
2. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database  
3. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN)  
 
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility  
 
Confirm patient eligibility collecting  the information listed below : 
 
1. The registering MD’s name  
2. Patient’s race, sex, and DOB  
3. Three letters (or two letters and a dash) for the patient’s initials  
4. Copy of signed consent form  
5. Completed eligibility checklist , signed and dated by a member of the study team  
6. Copy of appropriate source documentation  confirming patient eligibility  
 
4.2 Patient Registration in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore Database  
 
All p atients must be registered through the Siteman Cancer Center  OnCore  database . 
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  All 
data will be recorded with this identification number on the appropriate CRFs.  
 
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Assessment of HER2 Status  
 
A new biopsy is not requi red for patient participation. However, if a patient does not have 
adequate tissue to assess HER2 status, then a fresh biopsy will be necessary as a 
determination of HER2 status is part of the standard of care therapy.  
 
5.2 Premedication Administration  
 
Given the high incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with the FOLF IRINOX 
regimen, a combination of aprepitant, 5 -HT3 antagonist, and dexamethasone before 
chemotherapy is strongly recommended.  
 
5.3 Agent Administration  
 
The FOLFIRINOX regimen used for thi s study is the following drugs given on a 28-day 
cycle:  
• Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 IV on Day s 1 and 15  
• Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV on Day s 1 and 15  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 17 of 52 • Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV on Day s 1 and 15  
• 5FU 400 mg/m2 bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 continuous infusion over 46 hours 
beginning on Day s 1 and 15  
 
In order for a patient to be treated, his/her total bilirubin must be < 1.5 x ULN and his/her 
AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) must be < 3.0 x ULN.  Patients with elevated liver function 
tests may be enro lled (i.e., if they have a biliary obstruction), but their values must have 
resolved as described above prior to initiation of Cycle 1 treatment  with FOLFIRINOX . 
 
For HER2 -positive patients, trastuzumab will be administered intravenously with a 
loading dos e of 6 mg/kg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by a dose of 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
(Day 15 and Day 1 of all future cycles).  In the event a participant’s HER2 status is 
pending at the time treatment is initiated, trastuzumab will be added to the study regimen 
with the next cycle after determining HER2 -positive status.  
 
All study drugs will be administered every 2 weeks on a 28-day cycle  as described above .  
Trastuzumab will be administered first  (for patients who are HER2 -positive only) , 
followed by irinotecan. O xaliplatin and leucovorin are then administered  concurrently.  
Lastly , the 5 -FU bolus will be given, followed by the 5 -FU continuous infusion.  In the 
event of a leucovorin shortage, levo leucovorin may be substituted at a dose of 200 
mg/m2.  When supplies of leucovorin become available, change to the protocol -specified 
dose.  If neither leucovorin nor levoleucovorin are available, treatment without 
leucovorin would be acceptable but should  be re -addressed with each treatment.  
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Supportive care: Patients should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of 
blood and blood  products, antibiotics, anti -nausea/diarrhea , etc., when appropriate.  
 
Diarrhea management:  Patients should be closely monitored for diarrhea. Dose 
modification for diarrhea is clearly outlined under Section 6.0. Patients should be 
instructed to take loperamide at the first sign of poorly formed or loose stools. Patients 
should take loperamide in  the following fashion: 4 mg at the first onset of diarrhea, then 2 
mg every 2 hours until diarrhea resolved. The total dose of loperamide should not exceed 
16mg/day. Patients are instructed to notify their treating physicians if diarrhea is not 
resolved w ithin 24 hours.  Additional antidiarrheal medications including Lomotil, 
tincture of opium, or octreotide can be used.  
 
Palliative radiation therapy:  Palliative radiation therapy may not be administered 
concurrently with the trial chemotherapy . The  need fo r palliative radiation therapy will be 
considered evidence of progressive disease,  and patients will be taken off study.  
 
5.5 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of child bearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses , women  with 
amenorrhea, women w ith irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 18 of 52 precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative urine  pregnancy test within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 .   
 
Female and male patients (a long with their female partners) are required to use two forms 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the 
study and for 30 days following the last dose of any of the study agents .  
 
If a patient is suspected to b e pregnant, all study agents  should be immediately 
discontinued.  In addition a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy 
test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume dosing.  
 
If a female patient or fe male partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy 
or within 30 days  after the last dose of any of the study agents , the investigator must be 
notified in order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.6 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation 
documented in the case  report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up 
to 4 cycles following disease maximal response  (based on CT imaging) or until one of the 
following criteria applies:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression  
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment  of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable  for further treatment in the judgment  of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non -compliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the  study  
 
If the treating physician determines that a maximal response has been achieved and 
would like to simpl ify the study regimen in order to mitigate toxicities for a maintenance 
strategy , possible options can include but are not limited to modified FOL FOX -6 (with 
trastuzumab  for HER2 positive  patients ), combination 5-FU/leucovorin (with 
trastuzumab  for HER2 positive  patients ), FOLFIRI (with trastuzumab for HER2 positive  
patients ), irinotecan (with trastuzumab for HER2 positive  patients ), or trastuzumab alone 
(for HER2 positive  patients only ). Maintenance therapy may also include drugs not 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 19 of 52 specifically part of the FOLFIRINOX regimen.  Patients will continue to have follow up 
radiological assessments according to treating physician’s discretion,  until docu mented 
progression. Study coordinator should be notified of scans so RECIST can be requested.  
 
A patient who remains on any component of the study regimen or on maintenance 
therapy will be considered still on study as long as disease progression has not occurred.  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar . 
 
5.7 Duration of Follow -up 
 
Patients will be followed for toxicities for up to 30 days after the end of study treatment  
and until death  for survival assessment .  Patients removed from study for unacceptable 
adverse events will be followed until resolution  or stabilization of the adverse event.

6.7.1 Dose Modifications  for Trastuzumab  
 
Dose modification of trastuzumab is not permitted.  
 
6.7.2 Infusion -associated Symptoms with Trastuzumab  
 
Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 23 of 52 chills, and on occasion nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), 
headache, dizziness, hypotension, rash, and asthenia.  In postmarketing reports, 
serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported.  Severe reactions which 
include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe 
hypotension were usually reported during or immediately following the initial 
infusion.  However, the onset and clinical course were variable including 
progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or 
delayed post -infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration.  For fatal events, 
death occurred within hours to days following a  serious infusion reaction.  
 
Interrupt trastuzumab infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically 
significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered, which 
may include: epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronch odilators, and 
oxygen.  Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete 
resolution of signs and symptoms.  The rate of infusion should be decreased for 
mild or moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) infusion reactions.  Permanent 
discontinuation  should be strongly considered in all patients with severe (grade 3 
or 4) infusion reactions.

8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1 Irinotecan (Camptosar®)  
 
8.1.1 Irinotecan Description  
 
Irinotecan is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class.  It is 
indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or 
rectum whose disease has recurred or progressed following 5FU -based therapy.  
 
Molecular formula: C33H38N4O6•HCl•3H 2O. 
Chemical name:  (4S)-4, 11 -diethyl -4-hydroxy -9-[(4-piperidino -piperidino) 
carbonyloxy] -1H-pyrano[3’,4’:6,7] indolizino [1,2 -b]quinoline -3,14(4H, 
12H)dione hydrochloride trihydrate.  
Molecular weight:  677.19.  
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin . Camptothecins interact specifically 
with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by 
inducing reversible single -strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN -
38 bind to the topoisomerase I -DNA complex and prevent religat ion of these 
single -strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan 
is due to double -strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when 
replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, 
DNA, and  either irinotecan or SN -38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair 
these double -strand breaks.  
 
Irinotecan serves as a water -soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN -38. 
SN-38 is formed from irinotecan by carboxylesterase -mediated cleavage of the 
carbamate bond between the camptothecin moiety and the dipiperidino side chain. 
SN-38 is approximately 1000†times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of 
topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumor cell lines. In vitro 
cytotoxicity assays s how that the potency of SN -38 relative to irinotecan varies 
from 2 - to 2000 -fold. However, the plasma area under the concentration versus 
time curve (AUC) values for SN -38 are 2% to 8% of irinotecan and SN -38 is 95% 
bound to plasma proteins compared to app roximately 50% bound to plasma 
proteins for irinotecan. The precise contribution of SN -38 to the activity of 
irinotecan is thus unknown. Both irinotecan and SN -38 exist in an active lactone 
form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form. A pH -dependent equil ibrium exists 
between the two forms such that an acid pH promotes the formation of the 
lactone, while a more basic pH favors the hydroxy acid anion form.  
 
Administration of irinotecan has resulted in antitumor activity in mice bearing 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 28 of 52 cancers of rodent ori gin and in human carcinoma xenografts of various 
histological types.  
 
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans, irinotecan plasma 
concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal 
elimination half -life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half -
life of the active metabolite SN -38 is about 10 to 20 hours. The half -lives of the 
lactone (active) forms of irinotecan and SN -38 are similar to those of total 
irinot ecan and SN -38, as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium.  
 
The metabolic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN -38 is 
mediated by carboxylesterase enzymes and primarily occurs in the liver. SN -38 
subsequently undergoes conjuga tion to form a glucuronide metabolite. SN -38 
glucuronide had 1/50 to 1/100 the activity of SN -38 in cytotoxicity assays using 
two cell lines in vitro. The disposition of irinotecan has not been fully elucidated 
in humans. The urinary excretion of irinoteca n is 11% to 20%; SN -38, <1%; and 
SN-38 glucuronide, 3%. The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of 
irinotecan and its metabolites (SN -38 and SN -38 glucuronide) over a period of 48 
hours following administration of irinotecan in two patients ranged fro m 
approximately 25% (100 mg/m2) to 50% (300 mg/m2). 
 
8.1.4 Supplier(s)  
 
Irinotecan  is considered standard of care for this indication and is commercially 
available.  
 
8.1.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Irinotecan is supplied as a sterile, pale yellow, clear, aqueous so lution. It is 
available in two single -dose sizes: 2 mL -fill vials contain 40 mg irinotecan 
hydrochloride and 5 mL -fill vials contain 100 mg irinotecan hydrochloride. Each 
milliliter of solution contains 20 mg of irinotecan hydrochloride (on the basis of 
the trihydrate salt), 45 mg of sorbitol NF powder, and 0.9 mg of lactic acid, USP. 
The pH of the solution has been adjusted to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium 
hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Irinotecan is intended for dilution with 5% 
Dextrose Injection,  USP (D5W), or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, prior 
to intravenous infusion. The preferred diluent is 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.  
 
The dosage given for this study is 180 mg/m2. 
 
8.1.6 Storage and Stability  
 
The solution is physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room 
temperature (approximately 25ºC) and in ambient fluorescent lighting. Solutions 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 29 of 52 diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and stored at refrigerated temperatures 
(approximately 2° to 8°C), and protected from light are physically and  chemically 
stable for 48 hours.  
 
8.1.7 Administration  
 
Irinotecan is administered intravenously over the course of 90 minutes.  Irinotecan 
is emetogenic. It is recommended that patients receive premedication with 
antiemetic agents. In clinical studies of the weekly dosage schedule, the majority 
of patients received 10 mg of dexamethasone given in conjunction with another 
type of antiemetic agent, such as a 5 -HT3 blocker (e.g., ondansetron or 
granisetron). Antiemetic agents should be given on the day of treatme nt, starting 
at least 30 minutes before administration of irinotecan. Physicians should also 
consider providing patients with an antiemetic regimen (e.g., prochlorperazine) 
for subsequent use as needed.  
 
8.1.8 Special Handling Instructions  
 
As with other potenti ally toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the 
handling and preparation of infusion solutions prepared from irinotecan injection. 
The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of irinotecan contacts the skin, 
wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If irinotecan 
contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water.  
 
8.2 Leucovorin  
 
8.2.1 Leucovorin Description  
 
Leucovorin is indicated after high dose methotrexate therapy in osteosarcoma.  It 
is also indicated for use in co mbination with 5FU to prolong survival in the 
palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  
 
Molecular formula: C20H21CaN 7O7. 
Chemical name:  Calcium N –[p –[[[(6RS) -2-amino -5-formyl -5,6,7,8 -tetrahydro -
4-hydroxy -6-pteridinyl]methyl]amino ]benzoyl] -L-glutamate(1:1).  
Molecular weight:  511.51.  
 
8.2.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
Leucovorin is readily converted to another reduced folate, 5,10 -
methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of 
fluorodeoxyuridylic acid to thymidylate synthase  and thereby enhances the 
inhibition of this enzyme.  
  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 30 of 52  
8.2.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
The mean peak of 5 -methyl -THF was 258 ng/mL and occurred at 1.3 hours. The 
terminal half -life for total reduced folates was 6.2 hours. The area under the 
concentration versus time curves (AUCs) for l -leucovorin, d -leucovorin and 5 -
methyltetrahydrofolate were 28.4 ± 3.5, 956 ± 97 and 129 ± 12 (mg.min/L ± 
S.E.).  
 
8.2.4 Supplier(s)  
 
Leucovorin  is considered standard of care for this indication and is commercially 
available.  
 
8.2.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Leucovorin is indicated for intravenous or intramuscular administration and is 
supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder. The 350 mg vial is preservative free. The 
inactive ingredient is sodium chloride 140 mg/vial for  the 350 mg vial. Sodium 
hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid are used to adjust the pH to approximately 8.1 
during manufacture. One milligram of leucovorin calcium contains 0.002 mmol of 
leucovorin and 0.002 mmol of calcium.  
 
Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is supplied in sterile, single -use vials.  
 
The dosage given for this study is 400 mg/m2. 
 
8.2.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Store at 25°C (77°F); excur sions permitted to 15 -30°C (59° -86°F). Protect from 
light.  
 
8.2.7 Administration  
 
Leucovorin will be administered intravenously over the course of 120 minutes.  
 
Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, no more than 160 mg 
of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16 mL of a 10 mg/mL, 
or 8 mL of a 20 mg/mL solution per mi nute).  
 
8.2.8 Special Handling Instructions  
 
None.

8.3 Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®)  
 
8.3.1 Oxaliplatin Description  
 
IV Oxaliplatin is FDA approved in combination with infusional 5FU and 
leucovorin (FOLFOX) for the treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of 
the colon or rectum whose disease has recurred or progressed during or within 6 
months of completion of first line therapy with the combination of bolus 
5FU/leucovorin and irinotecan.  
 
Molecular formula:  C8H14N2)4Pt.  
Chemical name:  cis- [(1R,2R) -1,2-cyclohexan ediamine -N, N’] [oxaloto (2 -)-O, 
O’] platinum.  
Molecular weight:  397.3.  
 
8.3.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
Oxaliplatin is a newer platinum derivative with an oxalo ligand group.  Although 
the exact mechanism of oxaliplatin remains unclear, the cytotoxicity of platinu m 
compounds is thought to result from inhibition of DNA synthesis.  Intrastrand 
platinum DNA adducts, the main cytotoxic lesions, are formed by cross -linking 
activated platinum species and specific base sequences, notably two adjacent 
guanine residues or t wo adjacent guanine -adenine bases.  
 
8.3.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Time to peak concentration with a single 2 -hour infusion of oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 
yielded a peak plasma concentration of 0.814 mcg/mL.  The area under the curve 
for total plasma platin um was 207 -290 mg/L per hour.  Ultrafiltrable plasma 
platinum was 11.9 -13.6 mg/L per hour.  Oxaliplatin has 70 -95% platinum -protein 
binding while 37% represents total platinum taken up by red blood cells (addition 
of oxaliplatin to whole blood).  The volum e of distribution is 440 L after a single 
2 hour infusion of 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin.  It undergoes rapid and extensive (30%) 
nonenzymatic biotransformation.  In vitro studies indicate no cytochrome P450 -
mediated metabolism.  Its metabolites include approxima tely 17 different 
platinum containing derivatives with some being cytotoxic.  It is not known 
whether oxaliplatin is excreted into breastmilk.  Renal clearance is 9.3 -17 liters 
per hour.  Elimination half -life: intravenous, total plasma platinum, alpha hal f-life 
(0.2-0.43 hours), beta half -life (15 -16.8 hours), gamma half -life (252 -391 hours).  
The decline of ultrafiltrable platinum levels is tri -exponential with a  relatively 
short alpha and beta half -life (0.43 and 16.8 hours) and a long terminal gamma 
half-life (391 hours).  
  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 32 of 52  
8.3.4 Supplier(s)  
 
Oxaliplatin is considered standard of care for this indication and is commercially 
available.  
 
8.3.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Oxaliplatin is formulated as a white freeze -dried powder in amber glass vials and 
contains 50 m g or 100 mg of oxaliplatin in lactose monohydrate.  Each vial is 
sealed with a stopper with a crimped aluminum cap.  
 
The freeze -dried powder is reconstituted by adding 10 -20 mL (for the 50 mg vial) 
or 20 -40 mL (for the 100 mg vials) of sterile water for injection or 5% dextrose 
solution and then by diluting in an infusion solution of 250 mL or 500 mL of 5% 
dextrose solution.  These manipulations cannot be performed with aluminum 
needles.  The reconstitution or final dilution can’t ever be performed with a  
sodium chloride solution.  
 
The dosage given for this study is 85 mg/m2. 
 
8.3.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Oxaliplatin is a freeze -dried powder and may be stored at room temperature as 
long as it is protected from light for up to 3 years.  It should not be combined with 
alkaline medications or media, which cause oxaliplatin to degrade.  Do not use 
needles or IV infusion sets containing aluminum items (risk of degradation of 
oxaliplatin upon contact with aluminum) for the preparation or administration of 
oxaliplatin.  Oxaliplatin should not be mixed with sodium chloride or other 
chloride containing solutions.  Reconstituted solution must be prepared in a 5% 
dextrose solution of sterile water for injection in the original vial.  This solution 
may be stored for 24-48 hours at 2 -80ºC.  Infusion solution: after dilution in 5% 
dextrose solution, the shelf -life is 24 hours at room temperature.  
 
8.3.7 Administration  
 
Oxaliplatin will be administered intravenously over the course of 2 hours.  
Antiemetic premedication (5 -HT3 blocker with or without dexamethasone) is 
recommended.  Cold temperatures can precipitate/exacerbate neurological 
symptoms which should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin.   
 
8.3.8 Special Handling Instructions  
 
Oxaliplatin should never be reconstitut ed/diluted with a chloride -containing 
solution, and aluminum parts should be avoided when mixing or preparing 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 33 of 52 oxaliplatin.  Oxaliplatin is incompatible with alkaline media (i.e., solutions of 
5FU).  Oxaliplatin should be prepared in 250 -500 mL D5W.  
 
8.4 5FU (5 -fluorouracil)  
 
8.4.1 5FU Description  
 
Fluorouracil is effective in the palliative management of carcinoma of the colon, 
rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas.  
 
Molecular formula: C4H3FN 2O2. 
Chemical name:  5-fluoro -2,4 (1H,3H) -pyrimidinedione.  
Molecular weight:  130.08.  
 
8.4.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
The precise mechanisms of action of fluorouracil have not been fully elucidated.  
The main mechanism is thought to be the binding of the deoxyribonucleotide of 
the dru g (FdUMP) and the folate cofactor, N5 -10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, to 
thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex, which 
inhibits the formation of thymidylate from uracil, thereby interfering with DNA 
synthesis.  In addition FUTP can be incorporated into RNA in place of uridine 
triphosphate (UTP), producing a fraudulent RNA and interfering with RNA 
processing and protein synthesis.  
 
8.4.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Absorption: Following IV administration of fluorouracil, no in tact drug is 
detected in plasma after 3 hours.  
 
Distribution:  Fluorouracil is distributed into tumors, intestinal mucosa, bone 
marrow, liver, and other tissues. Despite its limited lipid solubility, the drug 
readily crosses the blood -brain barrier and dist ributes into CSF and brain tissue. 
Distribution studies in humans and animals have usually shown a higher 
concentration of the drug or its metabolites in the tumor than in surrounding tissue 
or in corresponding normal tissue. It has also been shown that th ere is a longer 
persistence of fluorouracil in some tumors than in the normal tissues of the host, 
perhaps due to impaired uracil catabolism. From these data, it has been suggested 
that the drug may possibly have some specificity against certain tumors in 
comparison with normal tissues.  
 
Elimination:  Following IV administration, the plasma elimination half -life 
averages about 16 minutes (range: 8 -20 minutes) and is dose dependent. A small 
portion of fluorouracil is anabolized in the tissues to 5 -fluoro -2-deoxyuridine and 
then to 5 -fluoro -2-deoxyuridine -5-monophosphate, the active metabolite of the 
drug. The major portion of the drug is degraded in the liver. The metabolites are 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 34 of 52 excreted as respiratory carbon dioxide and as urea, α -fluoro -β-alanine, α -fluoro - 
β -guanidopropionic acid, and α -fluoro - β -ureidopropionic acid in urine. 
Following a single IV dose of fluorouracil, approximately 15% of the dose is 
excreted in urine as intact drug within 6 hours; over 90% of this is excreted in the 
first hour.  
 
8.4.4 Supp lier(s)  
 
5FU is considered standard of care for this indication and is commercially 
available.  
 
8.4.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Inspect for precipitate; if found, agitate or gently heat in water bath. Bolus 
injections are prepared using undiluted drug. Continuous infusions of fluorouracil 
should be prepared for administration via ambulatory infusion pump according to 
the individual  institution’s standards. These solutions may be prepared in D5W or 
0.9% NaCl.  
 
The dosage given for this study is 400 mg/m2 bolus and 2,400 mg/m2 continuous 
infusion over 46 hours.  
 
8.4.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Intact vials should be stored at room temperature  and protected from light. Slight 
yellow discoloration does not usually indicate decomposition. 5 -FU is stable in 
syringes for up to 72 hours. Stability in ambulatory pumps varies according to the 
pump, manufacturer of drug, concentration and dilution. Ple ase refer to 
appropriate reference sources for additional information.  
 
8.4.7 Administration  
 
5-FU will be administered intravenously, first in as a bolus and then as a 
continuous 46 hour infusion.  Fluorouracil should be administered only 
intravenously, taking  care to avoid extravasation.  No dilution is required.  
 
8.4.8 Special Handling Instructions  
 
None.  
 
8.5 Trastuzumab (Herceptin ) 
 
8.5.1 Description  
 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a recombinant DNA -derived humanized monoclonal 
antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 35 of 52 HER2 (Kd = 5 nM) [45, 46] .  The antibody is an IgG 1 kappa that contains human 
framework regions with the complementarity -determining r egions of a murine 
antibody (4D5) that binds to HER2.  
  
8.5.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolis m 
 
Trastuzumab administered once weekly demonstrated dose -dependent 
pharmacokinetics. Mean half -life increased and clearance decreased with 
increasing dose level. Th e half -life averaged 1.7 and 12 days at the 10 and 500 mg 
dose levels, respectively. Trastuzumab’s volume of distribution was 
approximately that of serum volume (44 mL/kg). At the highest weekly dose 
studied (500 mg), mean peak serum concentrations were 37 7 mcg/mL.  
 
In studies using a loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by a weekly maintenance 
dose of 2 mg/kg, a mean half -life of 5.8 days (range = 1 to 32 days) was observed. 
Between Weeks 16 and 32, trastuzumab serum concentrations reached a steady 
state with  a mean trough and peak concentrations of approximately 79 
microgram/mL and 123 microgram/mL, respectively.  
 
Data suggest that the disposition of Trastuzumab is not altered based on age or 
serum creatinine (up to 2.0 mg/dL). No formal interaction studies have been 
performed.  
 
8.5.3 Supplier(s)  
 
Trastuzumab is the standard of care in this patient population and is commercially 
available.   
 
8.5.4 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
The diluent provided has been formulated to maintain the stability and sterility of 
trastuzuma b for up to 28 days. Other diluents have not been shown to contain 
effective preservatives for trastuzumab. Each vial of trastuzumab should be 
reconstituted with ONLY 20 mL of BWFI, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol 
preserved, as supplied,  to yield a multi -dose sol ution containing 21 mg/mL 
Trastuzumab. Use of all 30 mL of diluent results in a lower -than-intended dose of 
trastuzumab. THE REMAINDER (approximately 10 mL) OF THE DILUENT 
SHOULD BE DISCARDED. Immediately upon reconstitution with BWFI, the 
vial of trastuzu mab must be labeled in the area marked "Do not use after:" with 
the future date that is 28 days from the date of reconstitution.  
 
Trastuzumab is supplied as a lyophilized, sterile powder nominally containing 
440 mg Trastuzumab per vial under vacuum.  
 
Each carton contains one vial of 440 mg trastuzumab and one 30 mL vial of 
Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol. NDC50242 -134-60.  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 36 of 52  
8.5.5 Storage and Stability  
 
Vials of trastuzumab are stable at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F) prior to reconstitution. Do not 
use beyond the expiration date stamped on the vial. A vial of trastuzumab 
reconstituted with BWFI, as supplied, is stable for 28 days after reconstitution 
when stored refrigerated at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F), and the solution is preserved for  
multiple use. Discard any remaining multi -dose reconstituted solution after 28 
days. If unpreserved SWFI (not supplied) is used, the reconstituted trastuzumab 
solution should be used immediately and any unused portion must be discarded. 
DO NOT FREEZE HERC EPTIN THAT HAS BEEN RECONSTITUTED.  
  
The solution of trastuzumab for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or 
polyethylene bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be 
stored at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F) for up to 24 hours prior to use. Diluted trastu zumab has 
been shown to be stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature (2 -25°C). 
However, since diluted trastuzumab contains no effective preservative, the 
reconstituted and diluted solution should be stored refrigerated (2 -8°C).  
 
8.5.6 Administration  
 
Treatm ent may be administered in an outpatient setting by administration of a 6 
mg/kg loading dose by intravenous (IV) infusion over 90 minutes.  The 
maintenance dose is 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks after the loading dose.  DO NOT 
ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS.   Patients should be observed for 
fever and chills or other infusion -associated symptoms.  
 
8.5.7 Special Handling Instructions  
 
None.  
 
 
9.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
9.1 Archived Tumor Tissue  for Analysis by GPS@WUSTL  
 
Archived tissue will be sent for genetic testing though the Genomics and Pathology 
Services at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (GPS@WUSTL).  
The testing evaluates for mutations in 28 genes associated with a variety of cancers 
involvin g blood, lymph nodes, and solid tumors.  These 28 genes were chosen by 
GPS@WUSTL as they all have implications in cancer therapy.  We hope to identify other 
possible relationships between treatment outcomes in this study and “actionable” gene 
mutations not ed from the GPS profiling. These results may be useful to select future 
treatments for the participating patients or help to inform future clinical trials.   
 
Archived specimens from consenting patients will be sent to:

4320 Forest Park Avenue  
St. Louis, MO 63108  
 
9.2 Tumor Tissue Correlates – OPTIONAL  
 
Ten consenting patients with accessible metastatic lesions (regardless of whether they are 
receiving FOLFIRINOX alone or with trastuzumab) will undergo paired core biopsies 
from the metastatic lesion at the following time points:  
• baseline (prior to the start of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy)  
• end of Cycle 2 of FOLFIRINOX  
• time of progression (optional even if the patient consented to the paired biopsies)  
 
These specimens will be used to quantify expression of PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2, and 
CTLA -4 by I HC on tumor cells and tumor infiltrating leukocytes.   Additionally, mutation 
burden will be determined by whole exome sequencing, with somatic mutations being 
detec ted by comparing isolated tumor from tissue biopsies to peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (see Section 9.3).  Specimens will be evaluated for tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) to assess possible interplay between these effector and suppressive 
subsets i n determining the response or resistance to chemotherapy.  
 
9.2.1 Specimen Collection  
 
Four to 8 cores will be taken at each time point by ultrasound or CT -guidance.  
 
9.2.2 Processing Instructions  
 
Tissues will be collected and submitted to the TPC.  Following processing in the 
TPC, DNA will be extracted and transported to MGI for sequencing and analysis.   
Remaining specimens will be stored per standard pathology protocol.  
 
9.3 Peripheral Blood Correlates  -- OPTIONAL  
 
Ten consenting patients will have b lood drawn at the following time points:  
• baseline (prior to start of FOLFIRINOX)  
• Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4  
• Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4  
• time of progression  
 
PBMCs will be used to quantify and characterize the immunologic landscape at baseline 
and various time points during treatment.  The T cell repertoire and reactivity to existing 
and induced neoantigens, pre- and post -treatment will be further characterized by a multi -
parametric flow cytometry, spectratyping, and next -generation sequencing.  Assess ments  
of various cytokines/chemokines throughout treatment will be performed to assess both 
temporal and quanti tative expression.  This will be performed using multiplex -based 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 38 of 52 assays and gene expression profiling.  Multiplex analysis and QPCR to assess the 
following cytokines: IFN -gamma, IFN -alpha, IFN -beta, IL -2, TNF -alpha, IL -2, IL -4, IL -
5, IL -13, IL -10, IL -6, TG F-beta as well as chemokines such as CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10.  
 
9.3.1 Specimen Collection  
 
Sixty mL of blood will be drawn into 6 10 -mL BD Vacutainer® sodium heparin 
(green top) tubes at each time point.  
 
9.3.2 Processing Instructions  
 
Specimens will be transported to the Tissue Procurement Core within one hour of 
collection.  PBMC single cell suspensions will be obtained and isolated by Ficoll -
Hypaque gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in 10% DMSO according to 
standard procedures.

12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
12.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8 
weeks.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1)  [47].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant 
lymph no des are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest 
x-ray, as >10 mm with CT s can, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 41 of 52 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in s hort axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), includ ing small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, infl ammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither meas urable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic l esions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified  as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to r eproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the  diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  T he baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and a bove the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throu ghout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 42 of 52  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up with the exception of 
PET/CT and CT scans . CT scans may be used in follow up if a PET/CT scan was used at 
baseline. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentatio n by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferab le.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion sh ould be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variable s involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the s cope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET -CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 43 of 52 cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological respo nse when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers 
are initially above  the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is  
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions 
on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorit hm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed  by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date o f the 
initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR i n a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific med ical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 44 of 52 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
 
12.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether targ et or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increa se in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute incre ase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while 
on study.  
 
12.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note :  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level abov e the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of 
overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the 
progression status should be confir med at a later time by the review panel (or 
Principal Investigator).  
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 45 of 52  
12.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for  progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective pro gression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

*  ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this 
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
  
12.4.4  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 46 of 52 recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive d isease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
12.4.5  Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of 
progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
12.4.6  Overall Survival  
 
OS is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any 
cause.  
 
12.4.7  Response Review  
 
Response rate is the primary endpoint .  All responses will be reviewed by an 
expert(s) independent of the study (such as IRAC) at the study’s completion.  
 
 
13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Instituti onal Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, 
the Principal Investigator will provide a Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) report to the 
Washington University Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) semi -

enrolled) or one year after accrual has opened (if fewer than five patients have been enrolled at 
the six -month mark).  
 
The Principal Investigator will review all patient data at least every six months, and provide a 
semi -annual report to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee ( QASMC ). This 
report will include:

according to institutional guidelines.  
 
 
14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
In prior studies of the FOLFOX regimen in patients with gastroesophageal cancer, an objective 
response rate (ORR) of approximately 40% and median survival (MS) of 9.6 months has been 
observed  [48-50]. In prior studies in other cancers (i.e. colorectal cancer), the addition of 
oxaliplatin  to FOLF IRI increased the ORR in the treated patients by appro ximately 20% in 
comparison to other stan dard therapies [11]. We therefore propose a favorable response rate of 
≥60% for the study regimen (FOLFIRINOX). This Phase II study will use a two -stage Simon 
MinMax accrual desi gn to ensure that the total number of the patients exposed to this therapy is 
minimized  [51]. A total of 41 evaluable HER2 -negative patients will be enrolled in this study.   
HER2 -positive patients will not be considered part of the enrollment goal of 41 evaluable 
patients.  Because approximately 20% of these patients are expected to be HER2 -positive, we 
anticipate enrolling 65 patients total.  
  
If there is evidence that the true underlying overall response rate (CR, PR) is at least 60% in 
these patients, then the routine administration of the study regimen to patients with this 
malignancy wil l be warranted and should be investigated in subsequent trials. However, if the 
ORR for FOLFIRINOX is lower than 40% in these patients, then the study should be terminated 
early. Initially, 28 eligible patients will be entered into the study. If there are fewer than 12 
responses in these first 28 patients, the trial will be terminated with the conclusion that there is 
little evidence to suggest that the overall response rate would reach 60%. A s ample size of 41 
patients will provide a 56% chance to terminate the trial early if the true response rate is 40% or 
less. If there are 12 or more responses in these first 28 patients, the trial will continue until 41 
patients have been treated. If there a re 21 or more responses in these 41 patients, then the study 
Protocol Version: Amendment 12; 12/21/17   Page 48 of 52 will be completed and future studies utilizing this regimen could be considered. This design has a 
one-sided alpha of 0.10 and a power of 0.90. That is, the probability of declaring a successful 
trial (RR≥60%) is at least 0.90 if the true ORR rate is ≥ 55%; and the probability of declaring an 
unsuccessful trial (RR <40%) is at least 0.90 if the true RR rate is no more than 40%.  
 
The regimen containing FOLFIRINOX plus trastuzumab will only be administered to patients 
who are HER2 -positive. To our knowledge that regimen has not been previously administered to 
patients. HER2 -positive patient disease response results will not be inclu ded in this proposed 
analysis .  Their clinical data will be collected to provide information  for possible future studies.  
  
Other Statistical Analysis Plan:  Demographic information such as age and race will be tabulated. 
Descriptive statistics, including m eans, standard deviations and ranges for continuous 
parameters, as well as percent ages and frequencies for categorical parameters, will be presented. 
Adverse medical events will be tabulated. NCI toxicity Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory 
abnormalities will b e listed.   AEs occurring in patients treated with trastuzumab will be included.  
 
Exploratory endpoints : The quantified tumor -associated and systemic biomarkers and immune 
responses obtained through tumor tissue biopsies and peripheral blood at baseline (pr e-
chemotherapy), post -chemotherapy, and at disease progression. Paired t -test and/or paired -
sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank test will used to compare the antitumor immune responses before 
and after chemotherapy.  
 
Power Analysis and Sample Size : For the explor atory analysis, approximately 10 patients will be 
needed. The proposed sample size was chosen to minimize the potential risk to study participants 
and was not based on either statistical modeling or methods to obtain adequate power for any 
immune endpoint analysis. However this correlative study design is a pre and post treatment 
comparison with the same patient being measured twice. The magnitude of TSA changes at 
baseline and after therapy is unknown. If we assume the pre -treatment and post -treatment TSA 
magnitude to increase by 50%, with a 10% significance level, we need 10 patients to achieve 
80% of power to detect a post -treatment TSA increase compared with the pre -treatment 
measurements, using a 2 -sided one sample paired t test.

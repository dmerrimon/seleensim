Protocol Amendment 2 Final
19-FEB -2015 3Protocol Amendment 2 Rationale
Amendment number: Amendment 2 Final
Rationale/background for changes: 
Protocol amendment 2 was prepared:
 To cancel the planned interim anal yses and to keep the final anal ysis only : The 
need to validate and develop some assay s has led to a delay  in the release of data 
on time. Since no vaccine is administered in the CMV- 014 EXPLO study  and as 
the interim anal yses were not linked to subjects’ safety or efficacy, but rather to 
exploring the natural history  of CMV disease, it was decided to group the planned 
interim analy sisafter Year 1 and Year 2 and to have a single final anal ysis of the 
total follow -up at the end of the study .
 To clarify  that the tertiary  endpoints (i.e. exploratory  tests) and the subcohort 
selected for testing will be based on the evaluations of primary  and secondary  
endpoints.
 To stop collection of blood samples for gene expression signature (qPCR or RNA 
microarray ) as of protocol amendment 2 approval: A Year 1 dataset will be used 
for anal ysis of gene expression in a subset of subjects.
In addition, the list of contributing authors together with the Sponsor Signatory  
Approval page have been updated follow ing changes in the team members/ function 
names . The notation of the terms “ATP cohort” and “Total cohort” were adapted to 
maintain consistency  throughout the protocol.
The summary  of the amendment will be provided in APPENDI X C.

19-FEB -2015 7SYNOPSIS
Detailed Title A study  to explore c ytomegalovirus primary  infection, re -
activation and re -infection in an adolescent female population.
Rationale for the 
study GSK Biologicals anticipates developing a proph ylactic 
cytomegalovirus ( CMV )vaccine indicated for the use in 
women and adolescents to protect their offspring against 
congenital cy tomegalovirus ( cCMV) infection and disease. 
This study  is therefore designed:
To estimate the incidence of CMV secondary  
infections (re -infections / re -activations) in adolescent 
females.
To estimate the incidence of CMV primary  infection 
in adolescent females.
To develop as says able to distinguish and detect re -
infections versus re -activations.
Objectives Primary
To estimate the incidence of CMV secondary  
infections in seropositive adolescent females.
Secondary
To estimate the incidence of CMV primary  infections 
in seronegative adolescent females.
Tertiary
To develop assays that allow the differentiation of 
CMV secondary  infections caused either by  re-
infection or b y re-activation, in CMV seropositive 
adolescent females.
To assess the diagnostic value of different assay s to 
evaluate seroconversion in blood and the detection of 
CMV DNA in different body  fluids.
To describe the proportion of secondary  infection 
caused either b y re-infection or re- activation.
To collect samples for immunological and biolo gical 
disease -related exploratory  assay s.
To explore socio- demographic or behavioral factors 
associated with CMV infection.
In case of pregnancies, t o document the birth 
prevalence of CMV congenital infections.

19-FEB -2015 8To evaluate the concordance between scr eening testing 
data at local laboratories (or alternatively , central 
laboratories) and the GSK Biologicals or designated 
laboratory  testing data.
Study design Prospective, multi- center , multi -country  study .
Visit schedule :
10scheduled Site Visits approximately  every  
4months.
9Sample Collection Visits approximately  at mid -
term between 2 site visits (i.e. approximately  
2months after a Site Visit) where samples will be 
collected either through self -collection by  the 
subjects ,through collection bya home -visiting nurse 
or through a new visit at the study  cent er.
Study population: Adolescent females aged between 
10and 17 years regardless of CMV status.
Type of study : Self -contained .
Data collection : Electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ).
Duration of the study :
Participant: Approximately  36months.
Newborn (in case of pregnancy ): Approximately  10days.
Epoch 001: Prospective data collection starting at 
Visit 1 (Month 0) and ending at Visit 10 (Month 36).
Synopsis Table 1 Study  groups foreseen in the study
Study Groups Number of subjects Age (Min/Max)
S+ +/-240seropositive subjects 10 –17 years
S- Estimated approximate number of seronegative subjects(1): 160 10 –17 years
(1)As subjects will be enrolled consecutively without previous CMV screening with a target number of 
240seropositive subjects, the number of seronegative subjects enrolled will depend on the seroprevalence of the 
participating countries.

19-FEB -2015 9Discussion of study 
designThestudy  sites will be selected in multiple countries, 
including countries where the CMV prevalence is assumed to 
be high in order to enroll primarily  CMV seropositive 
adolescent females to allow the evaluation of CMV secondary  
infections. Since enrolment wi ll proceed without previous 
CMV screening, some of the enrolled subjects will be 
seronegat ive. The enrol ledseronegative subjects will allow 
the estimation of the incidence of CMV primary  infections in 
the adolescent population.
To increase the probability to capture all CMV infections 
(primary  and secondary  infections), regular sample collection 
time-points have been arranged:
Site Visits : Subjects will be asked to perform a Site 
Visit approximately  every  4months for 3 years 
(10Site V isits in total). At S ite V isits, blood, urine and 
saliva ,will be collected.
Sample Collection Visits : Subjects will be contacted 
to perform urine and saliva sample collections at home
either by  self-collection or by  a home -visiting nurse. 
Alternativel y subjects may be asked to come back to 
the study  center where the investigator or designate 
will collect the samples. These Sample Collection 
Visits will occur approximately  every  4months for 
3years between 2 Site Visits (9 Sample Collection 
Visits in total).
Number of subjects Subjects will be enrolled consecutivel y without previous 
CMV screening. Enrolment will be terminated once 
approximately  240 seropositive subjects are included in the 
trial. The number of seronegative subjects enrolled will 
depend on the seroprevalence of the participating countries. It 
is estimated that approximately  400 subjects will be enrolled 
in total.
Endpoint s Primary
Occurrence of CMV secondary  infections determined in 
all seropositive subjects on samples collected during the 
4-month Site Visit suntil study conclusion:
Anti-CMV tegument protein IgG antibody
concentration in serum (ELISA).
Number of CMV DNA copies (pp6 5 or other genes)

Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject,
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product, or temporall y associated with a stud y procedure.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For 
marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or 
misuse.
Anonymisation: Information that identifies a specific individual 
(including, but not limited to name, address and national 
identification number such as social security  number, date 
of birth) has been removed and no link to the donor, 
through a code number for example, is maintained.
Child in care: A child who has been placed under the control or 
protection of an agency , organization , institution or entity  
by the courts, the government or a government body , 
acting i n accordance with powers conferred on them by  
law or regulation. The definition of a child in care can 
include a child cared for by  foster parents or living in a 
care home or institution, provided that the arrangement 
falls within the definition above. The definition of a child 
in care does not include a child who is adopted or has an 
appointed legal guardian.
CMV secondary 
infection :Recurrent CMV infection, defined as either a viral re -
activation or a re -infection with a new strain of CMV.
Coded: Inform ation is associated with a subject number i.e. a 
code number. Coded information can onl y be linked back 
to the individual via a key code i.e. a listing of the 
research participants and their code. Within the 
pharmaceutical industry  coding data is the usual
mechanism used for protecting an individual’s research 
data. The key  code is kept secure, usuall y by the 
investigator, and GSK researchers cannot identify the 
research individual other than in exceptional and 
controlled circumstances.

19-FEB -2015 221. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpes virus family , is a double -stranded 
deox yribonucleic acid (DNA ) virus. CMV infects a large proportion of the world’s 
population, with a seropositivity  ranging from 30% to 100% in adults, depending on the 
countries, populations, density  and socioeconomic status [ Cannon, 2010].
CMV is generall y passed from infected people to others through direct contact with body 
fluids (such as saliva, tears, blood, breast milk, semen and urine). It can also be 
transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus during pregnancy . The virus in the 
mother’s blood crosses over the placenta and infects the fetus’s blood. A primary  
infection with CMV is likely  to be as ymptomatic in healthy  individuals, although it may  
cause a mild mononucleosis- like sy ndrome. However, CMV infection can be serious or 
even life-threatening in subjects with deficient or immature immune sy stems, such as 
congenitally  infected fetuses , organ -transplant patients and human immunodefiency  virus 
(HIV) -infected patients. The most frequent complications from congenital CMV (cCMV) 
infection are neonatal neurological sequelae (mainly  sensorineural hearing loss) 
following infection of the mother during pregnancy  [Mussi -Pinhata , 2009; Fowler , 2006].
Congenital CMV infection results from in utero transmission from the mother to her 
fetus , either because she undergoes a primary  (i.e. first) CMV infection during pregnancy  
or because she experiences a recurrent CMV infection, defined as either viral re -
activation or viral re- infection with a different strain of CMV [ Hyde, 2010]. Recent 
studies have shown that maternal re -infection by  new strains of CMV is a major source of 
congenital infection in seropositive population [Yamamoto , 2010; Ross, 2006].
The overall prevalence of cCMV infection in industrialized countries, regardless of the 
serostatus of the mother, is estimated to be 0.6- 0.7% [ Dollard, 2007]. From these, it is 
estimated that 12.7% of the CMV infected children present CMV- specific sy mptoms 
(such as mental retardation, deafness) at birth. From the remaining 87.3% of children 
without sy mptoms at birth an additional 13.5% may  develop permanent sequelae (such as 
primarily  deafness) [ Dollard, 2007].
Upon primary  infection of the mother during pregnancy  (between 1.38% and 3.85% per 
year [Colugnati , 2007]), the transmission rate of the virus to the fetus is approximately  
30% in contrast to seropositive women in whom vertical transmission has been estimated 
to be 1%. In countries or populations where high seropositivity  rates are observed 
actuall y more cCMV infected babies will be born from secondary infec tions (re -
infection/ re -activation) than from primary  infections. 
As pre -existing maternal immunity  to CMV provide some protection against vertical 
transmission of the virus [ Nyholm , 2010], primary maternal infection may  place the child 
at higher risk of permanent and serious disabilities [ Hyde, 2010]. I t is g enerally  believed 
that primary  infections cause more severe disease than re -infection sor re-activations 
[Fowler , 2003]. However, several investigators ha ve also reported severe cCMV disease 
in babies born from seropositive mothers resulting in lifelong disabilities, mainly  leading

i-Pinhata , 2009]. 
Some attempts have been made to evaluate the relative contribution of re -activation of 
latent virus or re -infection with a different CMV strain to intrauterine transmission of t he 
virus to the infants born to women with pre -existing immunity . An enzy me-linked 
immunosorbant assay  (ELISA) was developed to distinguish serological responses 
against infection with different CMV strains [ Novak , 2008; Boppana , 2001]. The 
principle of this assay  was based on the defined heterogeneit y ofantibody  binding
epitopes of gly coprote in H (gH) and/or gly coprotein B (gB) from two laboratory  strains 
of CMV ( AD169 and Towne ). The detection of new antibody  reactivity  to either epitope 
on gH or gB in serum samples of seropositive women was considered as seroconversion 
and infection with a n ew virus strain (re -infection). One limitation of this assay  is that not 
all CMV -specific IgG -positive individuals can be identified using these antigens. 
Specimens from more than a third of the seropositive individuals did not contain 
antibodies against a ny of the four antigenic determinants tested. This suggests the 
presence of additional poly morphic epitopes on gH and gB as well as on other envelope 
glycoproteins of CMV, such as gl ycoprotein N.
Providing protection against cCMV infection in babies born t o mothers with pre -existing 
immunity  will be a major challenge for any  vaccine in development. The feasibility  of 
running vaccine trials to demonstrate vaccine efficacy  in this seropositive population 
needs to be carefully  explored.
1.2. Rationale for the study
GSK Biologicals anticipates developing a proph ylactic CMV vaccine indicated for the 
use in women and adolescents to protect their offspring against cCMV infection and 
disease. This study  is therefore designed:
To estimate the incidence of CMV secondary  infections (re- infections / re -
activations) in adolescent females.
To estimate the incidence of CMV primary  infection in adolescent females.
To develop assay s able to distinguish and detect re -infections versus re -
activations.

3.1. Discussion of study design
Thestudy  sites will be selected in multiple countries, including countries where the CMV 
prevalence is assumed to be high in order to enroll primarily  CMV seropositive 
adolescent females to allow the evaluation of CMV secondary  infections. Since 
enrolment will proceed without previous CMV screening, some of the enrolled subjects 
will be seronegative. The enrolled seronegative subjects will allow the estimati on of the 
incidence of CMV primary  infections in the adolescent population.
To increase the probability to capture all CMV infections (primary  and secondary  
infections), regular sample collection time- points have been arranged:
SiteVisits : Subjects will be asked to perform a Site Visit approximately  every  
4months for 3 years (10 Site Visits in total). At S ite Visits, blood, urine and 
saliva will be collected.
Sample Collection Visits: Subjects will be contacted to perform urine and 
saliva sample collections at home either b y self -collection or by a home visiting 
nurse. Alternativel y subjects may be asked to come back to the study  center 
where the investigator or designate will collect the samples. These Sample

2 Site V isits ( 9 Sample Collection Visits in total).
4. STUDY POPULATION
4.1. Number of subjects /centers
The study  will be conducted world -wide in countries with a high seroprevalence. 
Considering a 15 -20% drop- out rate over the study  period it is estimated that 
approximately  240 seropositive subjects should be enrolled to obtain approximately  
200evaluable seropositive subjects. 
Overview of the recruitment plan
Subjects will be enrolled consecutivel y without pr evious CMV screening. Enrolment will 
be te rminated once approximately  240 seropositive subjects are included in the trial, 
based on the local laboratory  results (or alternatively , based on the GSK designated and 
validated central laboratory  results) obtain ed from the sample collected at Visit 1. The 
number of seronegative subjects enrolled will depend on the seroprevalence of the 
participating countries. It is estimated that approximately  400 subjects will be enrolled in 
total.
4.2. Inclusion criteria for enrolment
All subjects must satisfy  ALL the following criteria at study  entry :
A female adolescent between, and including 10 and 17 years at the time of 
enrolment ( subjects become ineligible for enrolment on their 18thbirthday ) 
regardless of pregnanc y status and contraception method used or not used.
Subjects who the investigator believes that the subject and/or the subject’s 
parent(s)/Legall y Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR [s])can and will comply  
with the requirements of the protocol (e.g.: samp le collection either through self –

Practice (GCP) ,all applicable subject privacy requirements and the guiding principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The study  has been designed and will be conducted in accordance with the ICH 
Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
pediatric popula tion (ICH E11) and all other applicable ethical guidelines.
GSK will obtain favorable opinion/approval to conduct the study  from the appropriate 
regulatory  agency , in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements, prior to a site 
initiating the study  in that country or will document that neither a favorable opinion nor 
an approval to conduct the study  is needed.
Conduct of the study  includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and 
favorable opinion/approval of study  protocol and any  subsequent amendments.
Subject/ subject’s parent(s)/L AR(s) informed consent and subject informed assent, as 
appropriate .
Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol.
GSK will provide full details of the above procedures to the investigator , either verbally , 
in writing, or both.
Freely  given and written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or
each subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and subject informed assent, as appropriate, prior to 
participation in the study . 
GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody  
the applicable ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongl y 
recommended that this model ICF be followed as closely  as possible, the informed 
consent requirements given in this document are not intended to pre -empt any  local 
regulations which require additional information to be disclo sed for informed consent to 
be legall y effective. Clinical judgment , local regulations and requirements should guide 
the final structure and content of the local version of the I CF. 
In accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for GCP, thos e subjects 
who can onl y be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject’s parent(s) or

19-FEB -2015 416.1. Safety definitions
6.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product, or temporally  associated with a study  procedure.
For an AE to be reportable, there is a minimum set of criteria (as recommended by  the 
Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and ICH) to be 
considered:
an identifiable reporter 
an identifiable patient,
suspect medicinal product (immunization history )
detailed description of the event
suspected causal relationship (event is explicitely  labelled as "related" by  the 
reporter)
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study . 
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of a c oncurrent 
medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward me dical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen. 
Example of events to be recorded in the medical history  section of the CRF/eCRF:
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
start of the study  (i.e. prior to enrolment in an observational study ).

Protocol Amendment 2 Final
19-FEB -2015 426.1.2. Defini tion of a serious adverse event
A SAE is any  AE that:
a.Results in death ,
b. I s life -threatening ,
NB: The term ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ,
NB: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out-patient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are also considered adverse event s. 
If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the 
event will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospitalization ’ 
occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an S AE.
d. R esults in disability /incapacity , OR
NB:The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea , influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) 
which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study  subject.
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergenc y room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.
6.1.3. Clinical laboratory  parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualify ing as serious adverse events
Abnormal laboratory  findings (e.g. clinic al chemistry , hematology , urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments that are judged b y the investigator to be clinically  significant will 
be recorded as SAEs if they  meet the definition of an SAE, as defined in Section 6.1.2.

19-FEB -2015 43Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal assessments that 
are detected during the study  or are present at baseline and significantly  worsen following 
the start of the stud y will be reported as SAEs. 
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically  
significant.
6.2. Detecting and recording serious adverse events
6.2.1. Time period fordetecting and recording serious adverse events
In order to fulfill international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study  
participation (i.e. protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing 
therap y) will be collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participate 
in the study until she is discharged .
6.2.2. Evaluation of serious adverse events
6.2.2.1. Active questioning to detect serious adv erse events
Each subject/ subject’s parent (s)/LAR(s)will be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately  should the subject manifest any  signs and sy mptoms she perceives/ they
perceive as serious.
All SAEs either observed by  the investigator or his/her staff or reported by  the 
subject/subject’s parent (s)/LAR(s) spontaneousl y or in response to a direct question will 
be evaluated b y the investigator. The nature of each event, data and time (where 
appropriate) of onset, outcome, and relationship to the study  procedures should be 
established.
When an SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an SAE 
on the eCRF or SAE Report screens, as applicable. It is not acceptable for the 
investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to GSK Biologicals 
instead of the appropriate completed SAE pages on the SAE screens in the eCRF. 
However, there may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on 
the copies of the medical records prior t o submission to GSK Biologicals.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.

19-FEB -2015 446.2.2.2. Assessment of intensity
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all SAEs reported during the study . The assessment will be based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgement.
The inte nsity  of each SAE recorded in the eCRF or SAE Report screens, as applicable, 
should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An SAE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An SAE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An SAE which prevents normal, every day activities 
In adults/adolescents, such an SAE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at work/school and would necessitate the 
administration of corrective therap y.
6.2.2.3. Assessment of causality 
The investigator should assess the causalit y of each SAE. The investigator will use 
clinical judgment to determine the relationship of SAEs to study  procedures. Alternative 
causes, such as natural history  of the underl ying diseases, concomitant therapy  and other 
risk factors will be considered and investigated.
There may  besituations when a SAE has occur red and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the SAE to GSK Biologica ls. The investigator may  change his/her 
opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE information 
accordingl y. 
If an event meets the criteria to be determined ‘serious’ (refer to Section 6.1.2 ), it will be 
examined by  the investigator to the extent to enable determination of all contributing 
factors applicable to each SAE. 
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical his tory.
Concomitant medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  the protocol.
Other cause (specify ).

If the electronic SAE reporting s ystem does not work, the investigator (or designate) must 
complete, then date and sign a SAE R eport Form and fax it to the GSK Biologicals 
Clinica l Safety  and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours. 
This back-up s ystem should only  be used if the electronic SAE reporting sy stem is not 
working and NOT if the sy stem is slow. As soon as the electronic SAE reporting s ystem 
is working again, the investigator (or de signate) must complete the SAE screens in the 
eCRF within 24 hour s. The final valid information for regulatory  reporting will be the 
information reported through the electronic SAE reporting system.
6.3.3.2. Updating of SA E information after freezing of the subject’s eCRF
When additional information is received on a SAE aft er freezing of the subject’ s eCRF, 
new or updated information is to be recorded on a SAE Report Form, with all changes 
signed and dated b ythe investigator. The updated form should be faxed to the GSK 
Biologicals Clinical Safety  and Pharmacovigilance department or to the Study  Contact 
for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor I nformation Sheet) WI THIN 24 HOURS of 
receipt of the follow -up information.
6.4. Follow -up of serious adverse events
After the initial SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject 
and provide further information on the subject’s condition to GSK Biologicals.
All SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the 
end of the stud y.
Investigators will follow- up subjects with SAEs until the event has resolved, subsided, 
stabilized , disappeared, or until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up. 
Clinically  significant laboratory  abnormalities will be fol lowed up until they  have 
returned to normal, or a satisfactory explanation has been provided. Additional 
information (including but not limited to laboratory  results) relative to the subsequent 
course of such abnormalities noted for an y subject must be mad e available to the Site 
Monitor.
GSK Biologicals may  request that the investigator performs or arrange sfor the conduct 
of additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully  as 
possible the nature and/or causalit y of the SAE. T he investigator is obliged to assist. I f a

7. SUBJECT COMPLET ION AND WITHDRAWAL
7.1. Subject completion
A subject who returns for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol is considered to 
have completed the study.
7.2. Subject withdrawal
Subjects who are withdrawn because of SAE must be clearly  distinguished from subjects 
who are withdrawn for other reasons .Investigators will follow subjects who are 
withdrawn as result of a SAE until resolution of the event (see Section 6.3).
From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any subject who did 
not come back for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol .
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for 
the anal ysis.
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for 
scheduled visits or follow -up. 
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF . The investigator 
will docum ent whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y 
the subject herself, b ythe subject’s parent (s)or LAR (s),or by the investigator , as well as 
which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
SAE.
Protocol violation (specify ).
Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event .
Moved from the stud y area .
Lost to follow -up.
Death .

8.2. Sample size consideration
The sample size for this study  is not based on formal statistical considerations. Thetarget
is to recruit approximately  200 evaluable seropositive adolescent females. Considering a 
conservative incidence rate of CMV infection of 2% per year, it is expected that 
approximately  12seropositive subjects will be re -infect edduring the study  period.
A target number of approximately  200 evaluable seropositive adolescent females will be 
analyzed. Considering a 15- 20% drop out rate during the 3 -year stud y period, 
approximately  240 seropositive subjects will be enrolled.
Some laboratory  assay s will be performed on a subset. The subset wi ll be defined based 
on the outcome of the primary /secondary  endpoints or the development of the assay . The 
subset is the minimum number of subjects that will be tested. If applicable, all subjects 
could be tested.
8.3. Classification of cases (amended 19 Februa ry 2015)

Immunogenicity
The cut -off value is defined by  the laboratory  before the analy sis and is described in 
Table 6.
A seronegative subject is a subject whose titeris below the cut -off v alue. 
A seropositive subject is a subject whose titeris greater than or equal to the cut -
off value. 
For seronegative subjects, s eroconversion is defined as the appearance of antibodies (i.e. 
titergreater than or equal to the cut- off value). 
The geomet ric mean titers (GMTs) calculations will b eperformed b y taking the anti -log 
of the mean of log titer transformations. Antibody  titers below the cut -off of the assay  
will be given an arbitrary value of half the cut -off for the purpose of GMT calculation.

9. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
To comply  with ICH GCP administrative obligations relating to data collection, 
monitoring, archiving data, audits, confidentiality  and publications must be fulfilled. 
9.1. Remote Data Entry i nstructions
Remote Data Entry  (RDE), a validated computer application , will be used as the method 
for data collection. 
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data 
necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be entered/trans mitted into a validated database 
or data s ystem. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with 
applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures.
While completed eCRFs are reviewed b y a GSK Biologicals’ Site Monitor at the study  
site, omissions or inconsistencies detected b y subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or correction of omissions or inconsistencies with documentation and 
approval b y the investigator or a ppropriatel y qualified designate . In all cases, the 
investiga tor remains accountable for the study  data. 
The investigator will be provided with a CD-ROM of the final version of the data 
generated at the investigational site once the database is archived and the clinical study  
report is complete and approved b y all parties .
9.2. Monitoring by GSK Biologicals
Monitoring visits by  a GSK Site Monitor are for the purpose of confirming that GSK 
Biologicals’ sponsored studies are being conducted in accordance with the ethical 
principles that have their origins in the Declaratio n of Helsinki and that are consistent 
with GCP and the applicable regulatory  requirement(s) (verify ing continuing compliance 
with the protocol, amendment(s), verify ing that the site staff and facilities continue to be 
adequate to conduct the study ). 
The i nvestigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel 
for monitoring visits.
Direct access to all stud y-site related and source data is mandatory  for the purpose of 
monitoring review. The monitor will perform a RDE review and a Source Document 
Verification (SDV). By  SDV we understand verifying CRF/ RDE entries b y comparing 
them with the source data that will be made available b y the investigator for this purpose.

Protocol Amendment 2 Final
19-FEB -2015 54The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes the source dat a for the different 
data in the RDE. This document should be completed and signed b y the site monitor and 
investigator and should be filed in the monitor’s and investigator’s stud y file. Any data 
item for which the RDE will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and 
documented in the source documentation agreement form. 
For RDE, the monitor will mark completed and approved screens at each visit 
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures, GSK monitors 
will contact the site p rior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and GSK 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also 
include iden tification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the CRF
entries will serve as the source document.
GSK will monitor the study  to verify  that, amongst others, the: 
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete .
Safety and rights of subjects ar e being protected .
Study is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol and any  
amendments, an y other study  agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory  
requirements. 
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the monitor will conduct site 
closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with 
applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures.
9.3. Archiving of d ataat study sites
Following closure of the study , the investigator must maintain all site study  records in a 
safe and secure location. The records must be maintained to allow eas y and tim ely 
retrieval, when needed ( e.g.audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any  
subsequent review of data in conjunction with assessment of the facility , supporting 
systems, and staff. Where permitted by  applicable laws/regulations or instituti onal policy , 
some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format other than hard cop y 
(e.g.microfiche, scanned, electronic for studies with an eCRF); however, caution needs 
to be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator mus t assure that all 
reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy  of the original and meet 
accessibility  and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard cop y, if required. 
Furthermore, the investigator must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these 
reproductions and that an acceptable qualit y control process exists for making these 
reproductions.

19-FEB -2015 59APPE NDIX A LABORATORY ASSAYS
Note that some assays , the general principles of which are described below, are still in 
development or planned for development at GSK laboratories or delegate and that it 
cannot be assumed that all of them will be successfully developed due to possible 
technical constraints. It is also assumed that some alread y available assay s can be slightly  
modified in order to improve robustness and quality  of these assay s.
1.Anti -CMV tegument proteins IgG ELISA (biotest like assay)
The assay  is an indirect solid-phase ELISA for the detection of specific IgG antibodies 
using two highly  purified, autologous fusion proteins, CG1 and CG2, each combining 
two immunodominant fragments from HCMV tegument (pp150; CG1:UL 32, amino acids 
(aa) 495 -691 and 862- 1048; CG2:UL 32, aa 695 -854) and the delay ed-early DNA binding 
protein (pp52; UL44, aa 297 -433). If the sample contains specific antibodies, these bind 
to the recombinant antigens in the microtit erwells. Non-specific antibodies are removed 
by washing steps. The antibody -antigen complex is detected b y peroxidase -labeled anti-
human IgG antibodies. The presence of bound antibodies is demonstrated by adding the 
chromogen- substrate solution.
2.Anti -gB IgG ELISA
Anti- HCMV gB antibod y concentrations are measured by  ELISA using recombinant gB 
as coating antigen on 96 -well microplates. After washing, the wells are blocked with a 
saturating reagent . Two dilutions of sera, in duplicate, as well as controls are incubated 
onto the coated wells to allow the specific antibodies, present in the sample, to react with 
gB. Non-specific antibodies are removed by  washing steps. The antibody -antigen 
complex is detected by  peroxidase -labeled anti -human IgG antibodies. The presence of 
bound antibodies is demonstrated b y adding the chromogen -substrate solution.
3.Anti -CMV IgM ELISA
The method used for qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies to 
cytomegalovirus in human serum is an immunoenzy matic assay  based on the antibody  
capture ELISA techn ique. The removable poly styrene wells of the 96 well microplates 
are precoated with IgG mouse monoclonal to human IgM. During the first step of the 
immunological reaction, diluted serum samples and controls (negative, positive, cut- off 
control and diluent) are incubated into the pre-coated plate. The plates are washed to 
remove non- specific reactants, and a mix of enzy me-labeled detection antibody  (IgG to 
CMV conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) and CMV antigen is added. The presence of 
specific IgM to CMV allows the tracer to bind to the solid phase through the presence of 
CMV antigen. After a washing step to remove excess of conjugate, the chromogen -
enzy me substrate is added to measure the enzy me activity . After incubation at room 
temperature away  from di rect light the enzy matic reaction is stopped by  the addition of 
Stop Reagent. The intensity  of the resultant color change is measured b y a 
spectrophotometer. The optical density  (OD) is proportional to the concentration of the 
anti-CMV IgM present in the s ample. The IgM concentration in the cut -off control is 
calibrated in order to provide a cut -off, unknow nsamples with an OD above the cut -off 
OD + 10% cut -off OD are positive, those with an OD below the cut -off OD – 10% cut -

OD) samples are retested.
4.Anti -CMV tegument protein IgG avidity index
This assay  will be performed using an elution step with a chaotropic agent to remove 
low-avidity  antibodies bound to CG1 and CG 2 fusion proteins. Briefl y, each diluted 
serum is first added to wells of plates coated with CG1 and CG2 fusion proteins. After 
incubation, the unbound antibodies are removed by washing, and a chaotropic agent is 
then added in the coated wells to dissociat e low -avidity  antibodies. The microplate is then 
washed, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti- human IgG antibodies is 
added. After incubation, unbound antibodies are removed b y washing and the 
chromogen- substrate solution is added to reveal the enzy me activity . The color reaction is 
stopped by  addition of a stop reagent and the resulting color is measured 
spectrophotometricall y. An avidity index is then calculated.
5.Anti -gB IgG avidity index
This assay  will be performed according to [ De Souza , 2003] using an elution step with 
urea to remove low -avidity  antibodies from gB antigen. Briefly , each diluted serum is 
first added to wells of plates coated with gB antigen. After incubation, the unbound 
antibodies are removed by washing, and 8M urea in phosphate buffered saline is then 
added in the coated wells to dissociate low-avidity antibodies. The microplate is then 
washed, and HRP -conjugated anti -human IgG antibodies are added. After incubation, 
unbound antibodies are removed b y washing andthe chromogen- substrate solution is
added to reveal the enz yme activity. The color reaction is stopped by  addition of a stop 
reagent and the resulting y ellow coloris measured spectrophotometricall y.
The avidity  index is calculated as the mean absorbance of reactions in which the immune 
complexes are exposed to urea divided b y the mean absorbance of reactions in which the 
immune complexes are not exposed to ure a, expressed as a percentage.
6.Anti -CMV neutralisation assay
The microneutralization test uses MRC -5 human lung embry o fibroblast cells as the 
infection target. The different serum sample dilutions are mixed with a fixed amount of 
virus at different dilutio ns and the serum -virus mixture is incubated at 37°C with MRC -5 
cells. Infected cells are then fixed with acetone. The degree to which neutralizing
antibodies decrease CMV infection of cells in the assay  is determined b y counting the 
number of nuclei expressing the CMV 72 kDa IE1 protein. Nuclear IE1 is detected using 
highl y sensitive immunoperoxidase staining. The stained nuclei are counted. The 
neutralization titer is expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that reduced b y 
50% the number of infec ted cells as compared to a control without s erum.
Additional microneutralization assay s using other cell ty pes such as epithelial, 
trophoblast cells as the infection targets and other virus strains may  also be performed.

19-FEB -2015 617.Antibody recognition profile
The ex act methodology  to perform antibody  recognition profiling is not y et decided but 
the ty pe of assay  may  be derived from classical high or low density  peptide array s. The 
peptide –microarray  is a technology  allowing the simultaneous measurement of serum 
reactivit y (IgG, IgM, IgA or IgE) to hundreds or thousands of peptides in a single 
biological sample. Briefly, solid support spotted/coated with CMV peptides are incubate d 
with serum dilutions. Slides are then washed to remove unbound antibodies and 
incubated with labeled anti -human I mmunoglobulin. After a washing step, antibody  
recognition profile against different peptides is revealed by  fluorescence or other means 
following the technology platform selected.
8.Detection of CMV -DNA (qPCR)
Quantitative PCR provides a rapid and sensitive method for the diagnosis of CMV 
infection. The CMV detection test used by GSK Biologicals is designed to detect the 
pp65 gene.
Real-time PCR technology allows the determination of the copy  number of sequence-
specific nucleic acids target molecules. The amplification of the target sequence is 
detected using the 5’ nuclease assay  based on the Taqman chemistry . In those PCR 
experiments, the formation of a PCR product is monitored in real -time during 
amplification by  means of a fluorogenic probe that binds specificall y to the amplified 
product. The reporter fluorophore is at the 5’ end of the Taqman probe and the quencher 
is at the 3’ end. As long a s the probe is intact, no fluorescence is observed from the 
fluorophore. During the poly merization step, the Taq DNA pol ymerase displaces the 
Taqman probe b y 3-4 nucleotides, and the 5’ nuclease activity  of the DNA poly merase 
separates the fluorophore from the quencher. The fractional cy cle number at which the 
generated fluorescence passes a fixed threshold above the baseline defines a “Threshold 
Cycle” (Ct value). A standard curve can be generated from the log of the starting copy  
number of DNA references against the measured Ct value.
In the context of this study , the qPCR technology  is used to detect CMV DNA in 
different matrix (blood, urine and saliva ) following adapted purification methodology .
9.CMV strain typing
In addition to direct detection of CMV through PCR, the company is seeking to develop, 
evaluate and validate next generation sequencing based assay and/or other technologies
aiming to characterize CMV genomic diversity  that allow discriminating re- infection or 
re-activation to primary  infection.
10.mRNA microarray /qPCR
Transcriptional profiling in the blood consists of measuring RNA abundance in 
circulating nucleated cells. Changes in transcript abundance can result from expos ure to 
host or pathogen -derived immunogenic factors and/or changes in relative cellular 
composition. Techniques such as mRNA microarrays of qPCR may  be used to evaluate 
these changes, if available.

Amendment number: Amendment 1
Amendment date: 31-JUL-2013
Co-ordinating author: , GSK Biologicals ’
Rationale/background for changes: 
Initiall y, the stud y was set -up, as a preparation for large phase III trials, to assess with 
good precision the rates of CMV re- infections and reactivations in CMV seropositive 
adolescents from different countries or areas with presumabl y high CMV 
seroprev alence. Additionally , the study  aimed at collecting human biological samples 
to support the development of new laboratory  assay s that would be both specific and 
sensitive for the detection of these biological events but also that would facilitate the 
condu ct of large efficacy  trials using non/less -invasive sampling methods. 
Since the initial discussions on the CMV- 014 study , the company  has progressed on its 
reflection of a clinical program needed for the development of a CMV vaccine. Over 
time it appeared clearer that the success of a phase III trial necessitated a better 
understanding of the complex virology  and immune parameters in CMV seropositive 
subjects. Consequently , the Company  has decided to switch the CMV program from a 
classical development stra tegy to a more experimental, clinical research status. 
The CMV -014 EXPLO study  has been redesigned to better align with this new scope 
and will serve the design of future vaccine research studies in terms of scientific 
questions to be addressed, like assay s to be used and developed. The protocol 
amendment of the stud y CMV -014 EXPL O is reflecting these strategic changes : the 
incidence of CMV primary  and secondary  infection in adolescent females will be 
evaluated using less stringent assumptions on CMV re-infection and reactivation attack 
rates . Assay s primarily  intended to evaluate the feasibility  of sample collection and 
testing in the context of large phase III trials were removed from the present study  that 
will focus more on the development of assa ys used to better decipher the complex 
virological and immune parameters associated to CMV infection.

19-FEB -2015 64In consequence:
The planned number of seropositive subjects was decreased from 475 to 240, 
with an estimated total enrolled subjects of 400 instead of 80 0 which is still 
considered sufficient to evaluate the incidence of CMV primary  and secondary  
infection.
The objectives and endpoints of the study  were revised:
The anti -tegument IgG ELISA testing in saliva was removed, as it was more 
aimed to address oper ational questions in anticipation of Phase III clinical 
trials rather than to address the actual evaluation of the incidence of CMV 
primary  and secondary  infections. Indeed, in case of good correlation between 
the anti -tegument IgG ELISA in serum and in sa liva, the anti -tegument IgG 
ELISA in saliva was intended to be used as a more practical diagnostic 
readout to evaluate CMV infection in large Phase III trials. 
Similarly , the qPCR on dry  saliva and dry  urine samples were removed. They  
were initially  inclu ded to assess the feasibility  to collect some samples using 
more practical sampling devices in large Phase III trials. 
The anal ysis of anti -gB IgG ELISA in serum was moved to tertiary  endpoint 
because the anti -tegument IgG ELISA in serum (which should pro vide 
equivalent results) is already  tested as per primary and secondary  endpoints. 
The anti -gB ELISA might only  be used in a subset of subjects to confirm 
results generated with the anti- tegument IgG ELISA and/or to confirm the 
case definition. 
The occurr ence of congenital CMV infections of newborns from subjects who 
became pregnant during the study  will still be evaluated. Nevertheless deep 
genot ypic characterization activities will be reserved to CMV strains infecting 
the mothers and not the babies. 
Theevaluation of T -cell proliferation (mentioned as a tertiary  endpoint) was 
removed as it was finally decided not to collect PBMC in this study . 
Note that all samples will still be used, except the dry  urine and dry  saliva samples 
which are prepared from t he collected urine and saliva samples collected from the 
subjects (no change of procedure for the subjects). Some dry  urine samples were 
alread y prepared for the enrolled subjects and will not be used. No dry  saliva samples 
were already prepared. Dry saliv a and dry  urine samples will not be prepared from 
upcoming samples. The section on the laboratory  assay s was updated accordingl y.

Study Groups Number of subjects Age (Min/Max)
S+ +/-475240 seropositive subjects 10 –17 years
S-Estimated approximate number of seronegative subjects(1): 
32516010 –17 years
(1)As subjects will be enrolled consecutively without previous CMV screening with a target number of 
475240seropositive subjects, the number of seronegative subjects enrolled will depend on the seroprevalence of 
the participating countries.
Discussion of study design
Thestudy  sites will be selected in multiple countries, including countries where the 
high CMV prevalence is assumed to be high in order to enroll primaril y CMV 
seropositive adolescent females to allow the evaluation of CMV secondary  infections. 
Since enrolment will proceed without previous CMV screening, some of the enro lled 
subjects will be seronegat ive. The enrol led seronegative subject s will allow the 
estimation of the incidence of CMV primary  infections in the adolescent population.
To increase the probability to capture all CMV infections (primary  and secondary  
infections), regular sample collection time- points have been arranged:
Site Visits : Subjects will be asked to perform a Site Visit approximately  every  
4 months for 3 years (10 Site Visits in total). At Site Visits, blood, urine, dry 
urine ,and saliva, and dry saliva will be collected.
Number of subjects
Subjects will be enrolled consecutivel y without previous CMV screening. Enrolment will 
be terminated once approximately  475 240seropositive subjects are included in the trial. 
The number of seronegative subjects enrolled will depend on the seroprevalence of the 
participating coun tries. It is estimated that approximately  800 400 subjects will be 
enrolled in total.
Primary endpoint
Occurrence of CMV secondary  infections determined in all seropositive subjects on 
samples collected during the 4 -month Site Visits until study  conclusion:
Anti-CMV tegument protein IgG antibody concentration in serum (ELISA).
Anti-gB IgG antibody concentration in serum (ELISA).
Anti-CMV tegument protein IgG antibody concentration in saliva (ELISA).
Number of CMV DNA copies (pp65 or other genes) i n urine (qPCR).

19-FEB -2015 79Appendix A: Laboratory assays
Note that some assays , the general principles of which are described below, are still in 
development or planned for development at GSK laboratories or delegate and that it 
cannot be assumed that all of them will be successfully developed due to possible 
technical constraints. It is also assumed that some already available assays can be 
slightly modified in order to improve robustness and quality of these assays.
1.Anti -CMV tegument proteins IgG ELISA (biotest like assay)
The assay  is an indirect solid- phase ELISA for the detectio n of specific IgG antibodies 
using two highly  purified, autologous fusion proteins, CG1 and CG2, each combining 
two immunodominant fragments from HCMV tegument (pp150; CG1:UL 32, amino acids 
(aa) 495 -691 and 862- 1048; CG2:UL 32, aa 695 -854) and the delay ed-early DNA binding 
protein (pp52; UL44, aa 297 -433). If the sample contains specific antibodies, these bind 
to the recombinant antigens in the microtiter wells. Non -specific antibodies are removed 
by washing steps. The antibody -antigen complex is detected b yperoxidase -labeled anti -
human IgG antibodies. The presence of bound antibodies is demonstrated by adding the 
chromogen- substrate solution (TMB and H202) .
2.Anti -gB IgG ELISA
Anti- HCMV gB antibody  concentrations are measured by  ELISA using recombinant gB 
as coating antigen on 96 -well microplates. After washing, the wells are blocked with a 
saturating reagent bovine serum albumin. Two dilutions of sera, in duplicate, as well as 
controls are incubated onto the coated wells to allow the specific antibodies, pres ent in 
the sample, to react with gB. Non-specific antibodies are removed by washing steps. The 
antibody -antigen complex is detected by peroxidase -labeled anti -human IgG 
antibodies. The presence of bound antibodies is demonstrated by adding the 
chromogen -substrate solution. 
Non-specific reactants are removed b y washing, and peroxidase -conjugated anti- human 
IgG poly clonal antibodies are added to bind with anti -gB IgG antibodies. Excess 
conjugate is removed b y washing. Enz yme substrate solution (TMB) is added, and the 
blue color is allowed to develop. The reaction is stopped by  addition of sulphuric acid, 
resulting in a color change to yellow. The intensity of the color is quantified and 
expressed in EU/mL . The optical density  (OD) is proportional to the conce ntration of anti 
gB antibodies present in the sample. Titers of each serum dilution are calculated b y 
reference to a standard serum using the 4 -parameters equation (mean OD), and the final 
titer of a serum is the mean of the titers falling in the proportio nal part of the reference 
curve.
3.Anti -CMV IgM ELISA
The method used for qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies to 
cytomegalovirus in human serum is an immunoenzy matic assay  based on the antibody  
capture ELISA technique. The removable poly styrene wells of the 96 well microplates 
are precoated with IgG mouse monoclonal to human IgM. During the first step of the 
immunological reaction, diluted (1:101) serum samples and controls (negative, positive,

to remove non -specific reactants, and a mix of enzy me-labeled detection antibody  (IgG to 
CMV conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) and CMV antigen is added. The presence of 
specific IgM to CMV allows the tracer t o bind to the solid phase through the presence of 
CMV antigen. After a washing step to remove excess of conjugate, the chromogen -
enzy me substrate solution containing 3, 3’, 5, 5’ -tetramethy l benzidine and hy drogen 
peroxide is added to measure the enz yme activity . After incubation at room temperature 
away  from direct light the enzy matic reaction is stopped by  the addition of Stop Reagent 
(sulphuric acid solution) . The intensity  of the resultant color change is measured by  a 
spectrophotometer at a defined wav elength (450 nm) against a reference wavelength (630 
nm). The optical densit y (OD) is proportional to the concentration of the anti -CMV IgM 
present in the sample. The IgM concentration in the cut -off control is calibrated in order 
to provide a clinical cut-off, unknown samples with an OD above the cut -off OD + 10% 
cut-off OD are positive, those with an OD below the cut -off OD – 10% cut -off OD are 
negative. In the greyzone around the cut -off OD (cut -off OD +/ -10% cut -off OD) 
samples are retested.
4.Anti -CMV t egument protein IgG avidity index
This assay  will be performed using an elution step with a chaotropic agent to remove 
low-avidity  antibodies bound to CG1 and CG2 fusion proteins. Briefl y, each diluted 
serum is first added to wells of plates coated with CG 1 and CG2 fusion proteins. After 
incubation, the unbound antibodies are removed by washing, and a chaotropic agent is 
then added in the coated wells to dissociate low- avidity  antibodies. The microplate is then 
washed, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- conju gated anti -human IgG antibodies is 
added. After incubation, unbound antibodies are removed b y washing and the 
chromogen -substrate solution is TMB and ox ygen peroxide are added to reveal the 
enzy me activity . The color reaction is stopped by  addition of a stop reagent sulphuric 
acid and the resulting yellowcolor is measured spectrophotometricall y. An avidity index 
is then calculated.
5.Anti -gB IgGavidity index
This assay  will be performed according to [De Souza, 2003] using an elution step with 
urea to remove low -avidity  antibodies from gB antigen. Briefly , each diluted serum is 
first added to wells of plates coated with gB antigen. After incubation, the unbound
antibodies are removed by washing, and 8M urea in phosphate buffered saline is then 
added in the coated wells to dissociate low-avidity antibodies. The microplate is then 
washed, and HRP -conjugated anti -human IgG antibodies are added. After incubation, 
unbound antibodies are removed b y washing and the chromogen -substrate solution is
TMB and oxygen peroxide are added to reveal the enzy me activity . The color reaction is 
stopped by  addition of sulphuric acid a stop reagent and the resulting yellow color is 
measured spectrophotometricall y. 
The avidity  index is calculated as the mean absorbance of reactions in which the immune 
complexes are exposed to urea divided b y the mean absorbance of reactions in which the 
immune complexes are not exposed to urea, express ed as a percentage.

19-FEB -2015 816.Anti -CMV neutralisation assay
The microneutralization test uses MRC- 5 human lung embry o fibroblast cells as the 
infection target. The different serum sample dilutions are mixed with a fixed amount of 
virus at different dilutions and the serum -virus mixture is incubated overnight at 37°C 
with MRC -5 cells. I nfected cells are then fixed with acetone. The degree to which 
neutralizing antibodies decrease CMV infection of cells in the assay  is determined by  
counting the number of nuclei expressing the CMV 72 kDa IE1 protein. Nuclear IE1 is 
detected using highly  sensitive immunoperoxidase staining. The stained nuclei are 
counted using a manual reading method. The neutralization titer is expressed as the 
reciprocal of the serum dilution that reduced b y 50%the number of infected cells as 
compared to a control without serum. Other target cells and clinical virus isolates 
obtained from the urine of pregnant women may  be used to explore more deepl y the 
neutralization function of the anti -CMV antibodi es and its possible association with the 
virus genot ype as determined by  DNA sequencing.
Additional microneutralization assay s using other cell ty pes such as epithelial, 
trophoblast cells as the infection targets and other virus strains may  also be perform ed.
7.Antibody recognition profile
The exact methodology  to perform antibody  recognition profiling is not y et decided but 
the ty pe of assay  may  be derived from classical high or low density  peptide array s. 
Whatever the technology used , The peptide –microarra y is a technology  allowing the 
simultaneous measurement of serum reactivity  (IgG, IgM, IgA or IgE) to hundreds or 
thousands of peptides in a single biological sample. Briefl y, solid support spotted/coated 
with CMV peptides selected based on their capacity to discriminate the antibody  profiles 
induced either b y the vaccine or b y reinfection with a different CMV strains, are 
incubated with serum dilutions. Slides are then washed to remove unbound antibodies 
and incubated with labeled anti- human Immunoglobulin . After a washing step, antibody  
recognition profile against different peptides is revealed by  fluorescence or other means 
following the technology platform selected.
8.Detection of CMV -DNA (qPCR)
Quantitative PCR provides a rapid and sensitive method for th e diagnosis of CMV 
infection. The CMV detection test used by GSK Biologicals is designed to detect the 
pp65 gene.
Real-time PCR technology  allows the determination of the copy  number of sequence-
specific nucleic acids target molecules. The amplification of the target sequence is 
detected using the 5’ nuclease assay  based on the Taqman chemistry . In those PCR 
experimen ts, the formation of a PCR product is monitored in real -time during 
amplification by  means of a fluorogenic probe that binds specificall y to the amplified 
product. The reporter fluorophore is at the 5’ end of the Taqman probe and the quencher 
is at the 3’ end. As long as the probe is intact, no fluorescence is observed from the 
fluorophore. During the poly merization step, the Taq DNA pol ymerase displaces the 
Taqman probe b y 3-4 nucleotides, and the 5’ nuclease activity  of the DNA poly merase 
separates the fl uorophore from the quencher. The fractional cy cle number at which the

Cycle” (Ct value). A standard curve can be generated from the log of the starting copy  
number of D NA references against the measured Ct value.
In the context of this study , the qPCR technology  is used to detect CMV DNA in 
different matrix (blood, urine, dry urine,and saliva, and dry saliva ) following adapted 
purification methodology.
9.CMV strain typing
In addition to direct detection of CMV through PCR, the company is seeking to develop, 
evaluate and validate next generation sequencing based assay  and/or other technologies 
aiming to characterize CMV genomic diversity that toallow discriminating re -infection 
or re-activation to primary  infection.
10.mRNA microarray / qPCR
Transcriptional profiling in the blood consists of measuring RNA abundance in 
circulating nucleated cells. Changes in transcript abundance can result from exposure to 
host or pathogen -derived immunogenic factors and/or changes in relative cellular 
composit ion. Techniques such as mRNA microarrays of qPCR may be used to evaluate 
these changes, if available.
The study  of transcriptomics may  be explored to examine the expression level of mRNAs 
related to immune genes by  using high -throughput techniques based on DNA microarray  
technology .

Amendment number: Amendment 2
Amendment date: 19-FEB-2015
Co-ordinating author:  (XPE Pharma & Science for GSK 
Biologicals)
Rationale/background for changes: 
Protocol amendment 2 was prepared:
To cancel the planned interim anal yses and to keep the final anal ysis only : The need 
to validate and develop some assay s has led to a delay  in the release of data on time. 
Since no vaccine is administered in the CMV- 014 EXPL O study  and as the interim 
analyses were not linked to subjects’ safet y or efficacy, but rather to exploring the 
natural history of CMV disease, it was decided to group the planned interim 
analysisafter Year 1 and Year 2 and to have a single final anal ysis of the total 
follow-up at the end of the study .
To clarify  that the tertiary  endpoints (i.e. exploratory  tests) and the subcohort 
selected for testing will be based on the evaluations of primary  and secondary  
endpoints.
To stop collection of blood samples for gene express ion signature (qPCR or RNA 
microarray ) as of protocol amendment 2 approval: A Year 1 dataset will be used for 
analysis of gene expression in a subset of subjects.
In addition, the list of contributing authors and the Sponsor Signatory  Approval page 
have be en updated following changes in the team members/ function names. The 
notation of the terms “ATP cohort” and “Total cohort” were adapted to maintain 
consistency  throughout the protocol.

19-FEB -2015 91Section 8.4.2 According-tTo-pP rotocol cohort 
The according -to-protocol (ATP) C cohort will include all subjects who meet all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria for the study , who do not have any  elimination 
criteria during the stud y (Section 5.5.2.9) and who comply  with the study  procedures 
indicated below .
The ATP Cohort Year 1will include all subjects who attend the 4 Site Visits (Visit 1 to 
Visit 4) and have samples collected from at least 2 Sample Collection Visits during 
Year 1.
The ATP Cohort Year 2will include all subjects who attend the 3 Site Visits (Visit 5 to 
Visit 7) and have samples collected from at least 2 Sample Collection Visits during 
Year 2.
The ATP Cohort Year 3will include all subjects who attend the 3 Site Visit s (Visit 8 to 
Visit 10) and have samples collected from at least 2 Sample Collection Visits during 
Year 3.
A detailed, comprehensive list of reasons for elimination from ATP anal yses will be 
established at the time of data cleaning.
Section 8.6.1 Sequence of analyses 
The anal yses will be performed stepwise: 
An interim anal ysis will be done every  12months (Month 12 and Month 24). No 
study  report will be written.
Section 8.6.2 Statistical considerations for interim analyses
In this stud y no treatm ent is given to the subjects. An interim anal ysis can therefore be 
performed every  12months (Month 12 and Month 24) on all available results without 
adjustment of the sample size.
Section 8.7 Statistical methods
Statistical analy ses will be described in d etail in a separate document, the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).
The primary  anal ysis will be performed on the ATP cohort(s). Anal ysis on the Total 
Ccohort may beperformed to complement the primary anal ysis.

ABSTRACT  
This subprotocol is a  component of the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH trial  APEC1621 . The APEC1621SC 
screening  protocol details the assay used for the integral genomic profiling which will determine eligibility 
for this subprotocol . Here we will conduct a phase 2 trial of selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  in 
children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (including non-Hodgkin lymphomas, histiocytoses and 
CNS tumors ) harboring specified activating genetic alterations  of the MAPK signaling pathway.  
Selumetinib  (AZD6 244 hydrogen sulfate)  is a potent orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor  against 
ERK activation by activated MEK proteins . Selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  will be given twice 
daily continuously for 28 -day cycles. The primary endpoint will be objective response rate as determined 
by RECIST. Progression free survival (PFS) will be assessed as a secondary endpoint.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN SCHEMA  
 
Day 1 -28 Day 28  
Selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate) (BID)  Evaluation  
 
Patients will receive selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  twice daily  for 28 -day cycles.  Evaluations 
will occur at the end of every other cycle x 3, then every 3 cycles.  
 
Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug related dose -limiting 
toxicity that requires removal from therapy ( Section 6.0 ). Therapy may otherwise continue for up to 2 years 
provided the patient meets the cr iteria for starting subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any 
of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy criteria ( Section 10.0 ).

1.1 Primary Aims  
 
1.1.1 To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial 
response) in pediatric patients treated with  selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate) with advanced solid tumors  (including CNS tumors) , non-Hodgkin  
lymphomas or histiocytic disorders  that harbor activating genetic alterations  in the 
MAPK  pathway.  
 
1.2 Secondary Aims  
 
1.2.1 To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with  
selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) with advanced solid tumo rs (including 
CNS tumors) , non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor  MAPK 
activation mutations . 
 
1.2.2 To obtain additional information about the tolerability of selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate)  in children with relapsed or refractory cancer . 
 
1.3 Exploratory Aims  
 
1.3.1 To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) and specifically, whether tumors that harbor different mutations 
or fusions will demonstrate differential response to selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) treatment.  
 
1.3.2 To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics  over time through 
evaluation of circulating tumor DNA.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
The RAS –RAF –MEK1/2 –ERK1/2 pathway, also known as the classical MAPK pathway, 
is responsible for controlling multiple key physiological processes.1 The MAPK pathway 
is one of the most frequently dysregulated signaling cascades in human cancer and the 
aberrant activation of this pathway commonly occurs through gain -of-function mutations 
in genes encoding RAS and RAF family members as  well as by loss of NF1. Despite the 
low frequency of mutations in the MEK1/2 genes themselves2,3, MEK1 and MEK2 have 
emerged as an ideal targets for therapeutic development due to their narrow substrate 
specificities, distinctive structure and their place at the bottleneck in the MAPK signali ng 
pathway. Among the malignances seen in pediatric and young adult population with known 
MAPK pathway aberrations include: hematological and lymphoid malignancies (activating 
N/K RAS mutations, 20%4), rhabdomyosarcoma (activating BRAF, NRAS and PTP N11 
mutations 20%5), low g rade glioma (activating mutation  or fusion in BRAF 70 -100%), as 
well as in glioblastoma multiforme (loss of NF -1, 15%), neuroblastoma (activating 
mutations in NRAS, PTPN11, 2.9 -3.6%6) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (NF1 
loss 40 -88%)7 and melanoma (activating mutation in BRAF, 86%). 8 
 
MEK inhibitors have shown clinical responses in patients with BRAF mutated melanoma 
refractory to BRAF inhibitors leading to FDA approval of trametinib for refractory 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 9 melanoma both as a single agent9 as well as in combination with BRAF inhibitor 
dabrafenib.10 Similarly, they have also shown clinical responses (20% with PR) in 
melanoma with NRAS mutated melanomas.11 In patients with KRAS mutant lung cancers 
MEK inhibitors combined with gemcitabin e12 improves response rate and event -free 
survival. There is pre -clinical evidence for activity of MEK inhibitors in NF1 deficient 
neurofibromas and melanomas and a phase 1 trial o f selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate) (AZD6244) demonstrated  clinical responses in 17/24 (17%)  pediatric patients with 
neurofibromatosis -1 (NF -1) with large plexiform neurofibroma .13-16 In uveal melanoma, 
which is characterized by mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, G -binding protein alpha 
subunits that signal via the MAPK pathway, selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) 
results in a higher response rate and prolonged progression free survival when  compared 
with chemotherapy.17 In summary, there is currently clinical evidence supporting diverse 
alterations in multiple MAPK genes  as bio markers for response , for example:  activating 
RAS gene mutations (N RAS /KRAS /HRAS ), activating BRAF mutations (V600E and 
others)  and fusions , GNAQ and GNA11 activating mutations, inactivating mutations in 
PTPN11 and loss of NF1 through inactivat ing mutations or insertion/deletion. 14  
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity  
There are several pre -clinical studies demonstrating efficacy of MEK inhibitors in 
pediatric tumors with known RAS -ERK pathway aberrations. MEK/ERK inhibitor 
UO126 has shown to inhibit growth of rhabdomyosarcoma both as a single agent 
in vivo and  in vitro18 as well as in combination with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor 
PI103. 19 In addition, in vitro and in vivo  synergy has also been seen between 
inhibitors of TORC1/2 (AZD8055), and MEK (AZD6244) in embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcoma.20 Pre-clinical data also support potential activity for MEK 
inhibitors against neuroblastoma with MAPK gene mutations.21 Lastly, NF -1 
deficiency has shown to be predictive of sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro  in 
glioblastoma multiforme.22 In preclinical studies, some MAP2K1  mutations are 
sensitive to MEK inhibition.23,24 In view of the high frequency of aberrations seen 
in target biomarkers of M EK inhibitors within the pediatric oncology population, 
as well as the promising clinical activity in melanoma as well as in plexiform 
neurofibroma, TAP committee members were enthusiastic for including MEK 
inhibitors as a part of the Pediatric MATCH trial .  
 
2.2.2 Animal Toxicology  
Mice and monkeys treated with selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) were 
reported to develop diarrhea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in some 
animals.  Tissue mineralization was reported in mice  that was not reversible with 
discontinuation of drug .  At the highest dose levels, skin lesions and/or scabs were 
observed in some mice  as well as decreased cellularity of femoral bone marrow.   
Embryofetal development and survival in mice was impacted at levels that do not 
induce matern al toxicity  (Selumetinib Investigators  Brochure) . 
 
2.3 Adult Studies  
 
2.3.1 Phase 1 Studies  
As of October 2015, selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) has been used in 
approximately 2880 subjects, including two trials with pediatric subjects 8799 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; Phase  1] and PBTC -029 [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; Phase 1/2].  The 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 10 recommended Phase 2 dose for monotherapy has been established as 75 mg bid 
based on Phase 1 and PK data [D1532C00005; D1532C00066].  Early Phase 1 
studies reported the best overall response of stable disease in 18 -40% of patients. 
25-28   
 
The most frequent AEs reported in Phase 1 studies with selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) dose 100 mg bid included rash (74%), diarrhea (58%), nausea 
(55%), fatigue (55%), and peripheral ed ema.  Grade 3 rash was reported in 14%, 
and 5.3% experienced Grade 3 fatigue. [D1532C0005].   
 
2.3.2 Phase 2 Studies  
Phase 2 studies treating patients with malignant melanoma, pancreatic cancer, 
colorectal cancer, non -small -cell lung cancer, advanced hepatocellu lar carcinoma, 
metastatic biliary tract cancer, refractory papillary thyroid cancer, acute myeloid 
leukemia, multiple myeloma, and ovarian/peritoneal carcinoma, report that 11 -
80% of subjects experienced stable disease with selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate) .29-43 The most common AEs reported in Phase 2 monotherapy studies 
included dermatitis (94%), diarrhea (54%), nausea (49%), peripheral edema 
(31%), vomiting (24%), and fatigue (21%) [DC1532C00003/8/ 11/12].  
 
2.3.3 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
The PK of selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) in the above studies was 
approximately dose proportional across the dose ranges studied for the Hyd -
Sulfate formulation  (25-100 mg) .  Drug exposure was reduced by CYP3A4 
induction with rifampicin, and increased by the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole 
and the CYP2C19 inhibitor fluconazole.  Minimal effects on drug exposure were 
observed in subjects with end stage renal disease compared to healthy volunteers, 
and dialysis had minimal effect on removal of systemic selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) . While the re was no change in exposure in subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment, subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment showed 
higher selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ) AUC  compared to healthy 
volunteers receiving the same dose.   Food was observed t o decrease the rate of 
selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ) absorption , but with relatively small 
reduction in total exposure.  Therefore, pending further study, it is recommended 
to take the drug on an empty stomach ( 1 hour before or 2 hours after food ). 
 
2.4 Pediatric Studies  
 
2.4.1 Prior Experience in Children  
Two pediatric studies including children with NF1 -associated  plexiform 
neurofibroma s and low -grade glioma s report partial responses in 21% and 55%  of 
patients , respectively.44,45  Early studies suggest that the adult RP2D (75 mg twice 
daily) equi valent may be toxic in children.  In a phase 1 study, Banerjee and 
colleagues report treat ing children with recurrent/refractory low -grade gliomas 
with 33 and 43 mg/m2/dose twice daily (patient numbers not noted in the abstract), 
and both levels were deemed intolerable due to DLTs of headache, rash and 
mucositis.  De -escalation to 25 mg/m2/dose twice daily (n=24) improved 
tolerability and resulted in plasma levels sufficient to inhibit ERK activation. The 
authors conclude that 25 mg/m2/dose twice daily  is optimal for pediatric studies.  
Gross and colleagues describe a plan for a phase 2 study, for children with NF1 
and inoperable neurofibromas to receive 25 mg/m2 twice daily.46  In a pha se 1 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 11 study, Widemann reported DLT in the first three cycles in 1/6  children and young 
adults with NF1 and inoperable neurofibromas treated with 25 mg/m2 twice daily 
(approximately 50% of the adult recommended phase 2 dose), which was 
reversible grade 3 ras h. By comparison 4/6 children receiving 30 mg/m2 twice 
daily dosing experienced DLTs.  Throughout all treatment cycles, 3/6 patients in 
the 25 mg/m2 group and 4/6 in the 30 mg/m2 group experienced DLTs including 
creatine kinase elevation, gastrointestinal  toxic effects, acneiform  or 
maculopapular  rash, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, all of which 
were reversible. The authors conclude that 25 mg/m2/dose twice daily is optimal 
for pediatric studies. 16  
 
2.4.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Corr elative Biological Studies  
Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) PK in children appear to be similar to 
adults.16,26 Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) was absorbed rapidly and the 
increase in drug e xposures with increasing dose were less than dose -
proportional.  The selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) half-life in children 
was approximately 6 hours  at the 25 mg/m2 dose.16 
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
This is a phase 2 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) in children with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumors, CNS tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and histiocytic 
disorders harboring specific activating mutations that result in pathologic activation of the 
MAPK pathway.  
 
Patients will receive selumetinib (AZD6244  hydrogen sulfate) for 28 -day cycles  at the 
MTD  and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)  of 25 mg/m2/dose BID .   
 
The primary aim of this trial will be to establish the objective response rate to selumetinib 
(AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) .  While there will not be multiple pre-determined mutation -
based cohorts, responses will be analyzed retrospectively with respect to sp ecific MAPK 
pathway activating mutations.  
 
Key secondary objectives include further evaluation of the tolerability of selumetinib 
(AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) in pediatric patients.  Toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE 
V5.0.  Imaging for disease evaluation  will occur every other cycle x 3, then every thr ee 
cycles.  Disease response will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors and 
2-dimensional measurement for CNS tumors.

Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 12 3.0 SCREENING AND STUDY  ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES  
 
Patient enrollment for this  study will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN ), a web -based registration system available on a 24/7 basis. It is integrated with the NCI 
Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU)  Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data and , upon 
enrollment, initializes the patient position in the RAVE  database.   
Access requirements for OPEN :  
Investigators and site staff will need to be registered with CTEP and have a valid and active Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program -Identity and Access Management (CTEP -IAM ) account  (check at < 
https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam/  >). This is the same account (user id and password) used for 
credentialing in the CTSU members' we b site. To perform registrations in OPEN, the site user must 
have been assigned the 'Registrar' role on the relevant Group or CTSU roster. OPEN can be 
accessed at https://open.ctsu.org  or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members’ side of the website 
at https://www.ctsu.org . Registrars must hold a minimum of an AP registration type.  If a DTL is 
required for the study, the registrar(s) must also be assigned the OPEN Registrar task on the DTL.  
 
All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. It is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise 
System for regulatory and roster data and, upon enr ollment, initializes the patient position in the 
Rave database . OPEN can be accessed at https://open.ctsu.org  or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU 
members’ side of the website at https://www.ctsu.org . To assign an IVR or NPIVR as the treating, 
crediting, consenting, drug shipment (IVR only), or investigator receiving a transfer in OPEN, the 
IVR or NPIVR must list on their Form FDA 1572 in RCR the IRB number used on the site’s IRB 
approval.  If a DTL is required for the study, the IVR or NPIVR must also be assigned the 
appropriate OPEN -related tasks on the DTL.  
  
3.1 Genetic Screening Pr ocedure s for Eligibility  
Patient enrollment onto the APEC1621 SC screening protocol is required. Tumor and blood 
samples will be obtained and the  results of the evaluation of the tumor specimens will 
determine if the patient's tumor has an actionable Mutat ion of Interest ( aMOI ) for which a 
MATCH treatment subprotocol is available.   
The treatment assignment to a MATCH subprotocol  (if a relevant aMOI is detected)  will 
be communicated to the enrolling institution via the COG or MATCHBox treatment 
assignment mechanism at the time the results of MATCH are returned , upon which a 
reservation to APEC1621 E will be secured by COG. Reservations should be withdrawn by 
the institution if at any point the patient indicates they do NOT intend to consent to 
participation or the site investigator indicates the patient will never be eligible for 
APEC1621 E.  
3.2 IRB Approval  
In order to participate in Pediatric MATCH, an institution m ust participate in the NCI 
Pediatric CIRB . NCI Pediatric CIRB approval of this study must be obtained by a site prior 
to enrolling patients .  
 
Submitting Regulatory Documents :  Submit required forms and documents to the CTSU 
Regulatory Office, where they w ill be entered and tracked in the CTSU RSS.   
 Online: www.ctsu.org  (members’ section) → Regulatory Submission Portal  
 Regula tory Help Desk: 866 -651-2878  
 
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative and accepting CIRB approval for the study 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 13 are not required to submit separate IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory 
Office for initial, continuing, or amendment revie w.  However, sites must submit a Study 
Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB (via IRBManager) to indicate 
their intention to open the study locally. The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then 
communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office for comp liance in the RSS.  The Signatory 
Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the 
Signatory Institution are participating in the study so that the study approval can be applied 
to those institutions. Other site registrati on requirements (e.g., laboratory certifications, 
protocol -specific training certifications, or modality credentialing) must be submitted to 
the CTSU Regulatory Office or compliance communicated per protocol instructions.  
 
3.3 Informed Consent/Assent  
The inve stigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments 
involved and their attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will 
be carefully explained to the patient or the patient’s parents or guardian if the pat ient is a 
child, and a signed informed consent and assent will be obtained according to institutional 
guidelines.  
 
3.4 Screening Procedures  
Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this trial 
must only be done after obtaining written informed consent.  This can be accomplished 
through the study -specific protocol.  Documentation of the informed consent for screening 
will be maintained in the patient’s research chart. Studies or procedures that were 
performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for 
baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.  
 
3.5 Eligibility Checklist  
Before the patient can be enrolled, the responsible institutional investigator must sign and 
date the completed eligibility checklist.  A signed copy of the checklist will be uploaded 
into RAVE immediately following enrollment . 
 
3.6 Study Enrollment  
Following a MATCH treatment assignment to a protocol, p atients may be enrolled on the 
study once all eligibility requirements for the study have been met. Before enrolling a 
patient on study, the Study Chair or Vice Chair should be notified. Patients who give 
inform ed consent for the protocol in order to undergo screening for eligibility are not 
considered enrolled and should not be enrolled until the screening is completed and they 
are determined to meet all eligibility criteria. Study enrollment is accomplished by going 
to the CTSU OPEN (Oncology Patient Enrollment Network) https://open.ctsu.org/open/ . 
For questions, please contact the  COG Study Research Coordinator, or the  CTSU OPEN 
helpdesk at https://www.ctsu.org/CTSUC ontact.aspx .  Patients must be enrolled before 
treatment begins.  Patients must not receive any protocol therapy prior to enrollment.  
 
Patients must be enrolled within 8 weeks (56 days) of treatment assi gnment.  Protocol 
therapy must  start no later than 7 calendar days after the date of enrollmen t. Patients 
enrolling onto APEC1621E will have a COG ID obtained through their prior enrollment 
onto the screening protocol or from a prior COG study.   
 
Note:  No starter supplies will be provided. Drug orders of selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) should be placed with CTEP after  enrollment and  treatment 
assignment to APEC1621E with consideration for timing of processing and shipping 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 14 to ensure receipt of drug supply prior to start of protocol therapy.  
 
3.7 Institutional Pathology Report  
The institutional pathology report from the tumor specimen submitted for sequencing will 
have been uploaded into RAVE immediately following enrollment on the APEC1621 SC 
screening protocol.  
3.8 Dose Assignment  
The dose level will be assigned via OPEN at the time of study enrollment.  
 
4.0 PATIENT  ELIGIBILITY  
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior to 
enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to assess eligibility must be no older 
than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  Laboratory tests need not be repeated if therapy starts 
within  seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility .  If a po st-enrollment lab value is outside 
the limits of eligibility, or laboratory values are older  than 7 days, then the following laboratory 
evaluations must be re -checked within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, 
bilirubin, ALT (SGPT)  and serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the 
patient may not receive protocol therapy and will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging 
studies , bone marrow biopsy  and/or aspirate  (when applicable)  must be obtained within 14 days  
prior to start of protocol therapy  (repeat the tumor imaging  if necessary).   
 
 
Clarification in timing when counting days : As an example, please note that if the patient’s last day 
of prior therapy is September 1st, and the  protocol requires waiting at least  7 days for that type of 
prior therapy, then that patient cannot be enrolled until September 8th.   
 
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be 
waived.  All clinical and laboratory data required for determining eligibility of a patient 
enrolled on this trial must be available in the patient’s medical or research record which will 
serve as the source document for verification at the time of audit.

given twice a day at a dose of 25 mg/m2 BID with a maximum dose of 75 mg per dose . 
Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug related 
dose-limiting toxicity that requires removal from therapy ( Section 6.0 ). Therapy may 
otherwise continue for up to 2 years provided the patient meets the criteria for starting 
subsequent cycles  (Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any of the criteria for removal from 
protocol therapy criteria ( Section 10.0 ).  
 
A cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days.  A cycle may be repea ted up to a total 
duration of therapy of approximately 2 years.  
 
Patients will be treated at the established pediatric MTD/ RP2D  which is 25 mg /m2/dose 
BID.  
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and weight 
measured  within 7 days  prior to  the beginning of each cycle , and according to the dosing 
nomogram (see Appendix IV ).  Patients should swallow the capsules  as a whole and should 
not chew or crush them.  Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) should be taken on an 
empty stomach at least 2 hours after food and patients should not eat or drink (except water) 
for at least one hour after taking selumetinib. If a p atient vomits within 30 minutes after 
the dose of  selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) , is administered, that dose may be 
repeated once. Otherwise, the dose will be missed.  
 
Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug  related 
dose-limiting toxicity that requires removal from therapy ( Section 6.0 ). Therapy may 
otherwise continue for up to 2 years provided the patient meets the criteria for starting 
subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any of the criteria for removal from 
protocol therapy criteria ( Section 10.0 ).

Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 20  
5.2 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles  
A cycle may be repeated every 28 days if the patient has at least stable disease and has 
again met laboratory parameters as defined  in the eligibility section, Section 4.0  and 
eligible to continue agent administration per the requirements in Section 6.0 .  
5.3 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded acco rding to version 5.0 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).   All appropriate treatment areas 
should have access to a copy of  version 5.0 of the CTCAE.   A copy of the CTCAE can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Any suspected or confirmed 
dose-limiting toxicity should be reported imme diately (within 24 hours) to the Study Chair.  
 
5.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to  protocol therapy. Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological 
toxicities are defined differently.  
 
5.4.1 Non-Hematological Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
5.4.1.1  Any Grade 3 or greater non -hematological tox icity attributable to the 
investigational drug with the specific exclusion of:  
- Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of < 3 days duration  
- Grade 3 diarrhea ≤ 3 days duration  
- Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT that returns to 
levels that meet initial eligibility criteria or baseline within 7 days. See 
Section 6.3 . See Appendix XIII for values that represent thresholds 
between CTCAE grades.  
Note : For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L  
regardless of baseline . 
- Grade 3 or 4 fever < 5 days duration.  
- Grade 3 infection < 5 days duration.  
- Grade 3 hypop hosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to supplementation  
- Grade 3 papulopustular, acneiform, or maculo -papular rash that resolves 
to < Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days of initiation of topical steroid as 
described in Section 7.3.1 .  However, any investigational drug-related 
Grade 3 rash that is considered intolerable by the patient or limits ADLs 
will be considered a DLT regardless of duration.  
- Grade 3 asymptomatic elevation of CPK  
 
• Any Grade 2 visual disturbance that persists for ≥ 1 week.  
• Any Grade 2 non -hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days and is 
conside red sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by 
patients that it requires treatment interruption.  
• Note: Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will not 
be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
5.4.1.2  Dose -limiting hypertension  
• Any Grade 4 hypertension  
• A blood pressure >  25 mmHg above the 95th percentile for age, 
height, and gender ( Appendix IX ) confirmed by repeated 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 21 measurement is dose limiting.  
• In patients who begin antihyper tensive therapy a blood pressure > 10 
mmHg but ≤ 25 mmHg above the 95th percentile for age, height, and 
gender ( Appendix IX ) for > 14 days is dose limiting.  
 
5.4.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
Hematological dose limiting toxici ty is defined as:  
 
In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section 4.1. 7.1),   
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia , not due to malignant 
infiltration.  
• Grade 3  thrombocytopenia  that persists for ≥ 7 days  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia  requiring a platelet transfusion on 2 separate 
days 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia  with clinically significant b leeding  
• Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that causes a delay of > 14 days 
between treatment cycles " (e.g. platelets <100K or ANC<1000 ). 
 
Note :   Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia will not be considered a dose -limiting 
toxicity . 
 
6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The Study Chair must be notified of any dosage modification or use of myeloid growth 
factor.  
 
6.1 Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.1.1 If a patient experiences hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in Section 
5.4.2 , the treatment will be held.  Counts should be checked every 3 -4 days for 
thrombocytopenia and every other day for neutropenia during this time. If the 
toxicity resolves to meet eligibility parameters within 14 days of drug 
discontinuation, the patient may  resume treatment at a reduced dose as outlined in 
the dose reduction table ( Appendix IV ). Doses reduced for toxicity will not be re -
escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose.  
 
6.1.2 If toxicity does not resolve to meet eligibility parameters within 14 days of drug 
discontinuation, the patient must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.1.3 If hematological dose -limiting toxicity recurs in a patient who has resumed 
treatment at the reduced dose, the patient mu st be removed from protocol 
therapy.  
 
 
 
 
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.2.1 If a patient experiences non -hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 22 Section 5.4.1 , the treatment will be held. When the  toxicity resolves to meet 
eligibility parameters or baseline within 14 days of drug discontinuation, the 
patient may resume treatment at a reduced dose as outlined in the dose reduction 
table ( Appendix IV ). Doses reduced for toxi city will not be re -escalated, even if 
there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose.  
 
6.2.2 If toxicity does not resolve to meet eligibility or baseline parameters within 14 
days of drug discontinuation, the patient must be removed from protocol therapy . 
 
6.2.3 If the same  dose-limiting toxicity recurs in a patient who has resumed treatment, 
the patient must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.3 Dose Modifications for Hepatic Adverse Events  
 
6.3.1 If a patient experiences Grade ≥ 3 ALT, treatment  will be held. If toxicity resolves 
to meet eligibility criteria  within 7 days, the drug may be resumed at the same 
dose.  Grade ≥ 3 ALT that persists ≥ 7 days will be considered dose -limiting and 
require dose modification per Section 6.2 . 
 
6.4 Dose Modifications for Dermatology/Skin Disorders  
 
Grade   Action  
Grade 1 or 2  
 • Maintain dose  
Intolerable Grade 2; 
Grade 3  
 • Hold AZD6244 selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) 
until resolution to ≤ tolerable Grade 2 and dose reduce as per 
Section 6.2 . See also Section 7.3.1  
6.5 Dose Modifications for Visual Disturbances  
 
Grade   Action  
Grade 1  • Maintain Dose  
Grade 2 
 • Hold selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) until eye 
exam is completed; If  the Ophthalmology exam is normal 
and the  toxicity resolves to < Grade 1 within 1 week  or an 
alternate cause  for the vision problem is identified – restart  
selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) at  the same dose 
level . Otherwise  Grade 2 visual disturbance  that persists for ≥ 
1 week hours  will be considered a DLT and require a dose 
reduction as per Section 6.2 . 
Grade 3 or 4  
 • Hold AZD6244 selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) 
until Eye exam is completed; If  alternate etiology for vision 
change is identified, contact study chair to discuss restarting 
of selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) . Otherwise  ≥ 
Grade 3  visual disturbance will be considered a  DLT and 
require a dose reduction as per Section 6.2 .

  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 23 Grade   Action  
Grade 1 or 2 or Grade 
3 asymptomatic  
 • Maintain dose; continue monitoring as per protocol, or more 
frequently if clinically indicated.  
Grade 3 symptomatic 
or Grade 4  
 • Hold AZD6244 selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) 
until resolution to ≤ Grade 1  and dose reduce as per Section 
6.2. 
 
6.7 Dose Modifications for Hypertension  
 
• Baseline blood pressure  (BP) is defined as the blood pressure obtained at the 
examination used for study enrollment.  This baseline BP should be obtained as 
follows:  1) Obtain 3 serial blood pressures from the same extremity with the 
patient i n the same position at rest with an appropriately sized cuff. Measures 
must be obtained at least 5 minut es apart. Avoid using the lower extremity if 
possible. 2) Average the systolic blood pressure from the 2nd and 3rd 
measurements.  3) Average the diastoli c blood pressure from the 2nd and 3rd 
measurements.  4) The baseline BP is the average of the systolic over the 
average of the diastolic measurements.  
 
• Elevation  in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure should be  considered 
when following the algorithm below.  
 
• The upper limit of normal (ULN)  is defined as a BP equal to the 95th 
percentile for age, height, and gender. See Appendix IX . 
 
• The NCI CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized to determine the grade of  
hypertension for  reporting purposes.  
 
• Elevated BP measurements should be repeated on the same day to confirm  the 
elevation. If confirmed, p atients with elevated BP should have BP 
measurements performed at least twice weekly until BP is ≤ ULN.  
 
• The algorithm below will be used to manage selumetinib -related hypertension.  
 
• Hypertension should be managed with appropriate anti -hypertensive agent(s) 
as clinically indicated. It is strongly recommended that nephrology or  
cardiology be consulted in the e valuation and management of hypertension.

same dose.  
 
Arm 2 of algorithm:  
• If BP ≤ 10 mm Hg above the ULN for age, height, and gender, continue  selumetinib  at 
the same dose and recheck the BP within 72 h ours. 
o If the BP is ≤ ULN on recheck, continue selumetinib  at the same dose.  
o If the BP remains above the ULN on recheck, then start antihypertensive therapy 
(Section 7.6 ) and follow Arm 3 of the algorithm from the point that anti -
hypertensive therapy is started.  
 
Arm 3 of algorithm:  
• If BP is 11 to 25 mm Hg above the 95% for age, height, and gender on ≥ 2 of 3

therapy, hold selumetinib , monitor BP at least every 3 days, and follow Arm  
4 of the algorithm from the point that selumetinib  is held.  If selumetinib is 
stopped, antihypertensives should be continued until BP is < ULN. If 
selumetinib is resume d, anihypertensives should continue for the duration of 
selumetinib therapy unless clinically indicated to discontinue . 
▪ If the BP returns to ≤ ULN within 14 days, restart selumetinib  at a reduced

6.8 Dose Modification for Elevated Fasting Cholesterol  
The following guidelines should be used for patients who develop elevated fasting 
cholesterol.  
 
Grade  Action  
Grade  2 • Continue  selumetinib ; consider  treatment  with an HMG -CoA 
reductase  inhibitor  depending  upon  recommendations  of 
institutional  hyperlipidemia  consultants.  
Grade  3 • An HMG -CoA reductase  inhibitor  should  be started,  and dosages  
adjusted  based  upon  recommendations  of institutional  
hyperlipidemia  consultants.  
• It is expected  that optimal  effects  of the lipid lowering  medication  
will be observed  2-4 weeks  after its initiation.  Treatment  with 
selumetinib  is to be restarted  at the same  dose level  when  
recovery  of hypercholesterolemia  to ≤ Grade  2 is observed.  
Grade  4 • Hold  selumetinib . 
• An HMG -CoA reductase  inhibitor  should  be started,  and dosages  
should  be adjusted  based  upon  recommendations  from 
institutional  hyperlipidemia  consultants.  
 
 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT  THERAPY  
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these 
treatments are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents  
No other  investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary . See Section 7.5 for drugs that should not be used 
concomitantly due to potential interactions with  selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) . 
See below for recommendations on management of specific toxicities associated  with 
selumeti nib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) .  
7.3.1 Recommendations for Skin Toxicity:  
The most common drug related adverse event is rash, which have included many 
different types and can begin as early as cycle 1 or 2. Descriptions include: 
erythematous rash, maculopapular rash, pruritic rash, acneiform dermatitis, 
exfoliative rash. Grade 3 rashes are often associated with pruritus and can have 
scaling.  Based on the experience on the current adult Phase 1/2 study the following 
recommendations should be followed. For Grade 3  rash selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) should be held until resolution to Grade  1 or better and then 
treatment can be resumed at a reduced dose as outlined in the dose reduction table 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 28 (Appendix IV ). For eczematous  rashes, moisturizers or low -dose topical 
corticosteroids may be used if based on the rash appearance they would be 
considered appropriate treatment. For pustular rash, topical clindamycin gel or 
lotion may be applied twice daily.  For more severe cases, oral teracyclines may 
be useful in older children.  Ketoconazole shampoo may be used for scalp rash.  If 
oral corticosteroids are required for severe r ash, selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate) should be held until improvement to < Grade 1 at a reduced dose as 
outlined in the dose reduction table ( Appendix IV ). 
 
7.3.2 Recommend ations for Paronychiae : 
Patients who develop parony chiae may be treated with flurandrenolide tape, 
topical steroid cream, topical antib iotics or systemic antibiotics as clinically 
indicated.  
 
7.3.3 Recommendations for Diarrhea:  
Patients who experience diarrhea may be treated symptomatically with oral 
hydration and anti-diarrheal medications according to institutional standards.  
Example loperamide dosing is outlined in Appendix VIII . 
 
7.3.4 Recommendations for Visual Dis turbance:  
Patients who experience visual disturbance should undergo complete 
ophthalmologic  examination including visual acuity, visual fields (if feasible) and 
fundoscopic exam.  
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be 
administered for culture proven bacteremia or invasive fungal infection. The Study Chair 
should be notified before growth factors are initiated.  
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications  
 
7.5.1 Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 3A4/5 to form active N -desmethyl selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) 
metabolite; In addition, UGT 1A1 and 1A3 form glucuronide conjugates. Use 
caution in patients who are taking stron g inducers or inhibitors of these CYP or 
UGT enzymes.  
7.5.2 CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers: Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers are 
not permitted on this study (See Appendix II  for list of agents). Note:  CYP3A4 
inducing anti -epilep tic drugs and dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, 
on a stable dose, are allowed.  
7.5.3 The use of drugs that are strong CYP2C19 inducers (eg., rifampin, ritonavir) or 
inhibitors (eg., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) should be avoided during the 
study.  
7.5.4 High vitamin E doses may potentiate warfarin’s anticoagulant activity.  Monitor 
PT/INR more frequently in patients receiving both warfarin and selumetinib 
(AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) capsules.  Avoid concomitant intake of supplemental 
vitamin E.  
 
7.5.5 Selum etinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is also a substrate of BCRP (breast 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 29 cancer resistance protein) and P -glycoprotein (P -gp) transporters. Use caution in 
patients who are taking strong inducers or inhibitors of either transport protein.  
 
7.6 Concurrent Anti -Hypertensive Therapy  
The algorithm in Section 6.7  will be used to manage selumetinib - related hypertension. 
Should initiation of anti -hypertensive therapy be required, single agent therapy (commonly 
including the calcium channel blockers amlodipine or nifedipine, which are permissible 
without discussion with the study chair) should be started and the blood pressure should be 
monitored at least twice weekly until BP is within the 95th percentile for age, hei ght, and 
gender per Section 6.7 . 
 
8.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED  
 
8.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluation  
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days 
prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to assess eligibility 
(see Section 4.0 ) must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  Laboratory 
tests need not be repeated if therapy starts withi n seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess 
eligibility.  If a post -enrollment lab value is outside the limits of eligibility, or laboratory  
values are older  than 7 days, then the following laboratory evaluations must be re -checked 
within 48 hours prior t o initiating therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
and serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not 
receive protocol therapy and will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging studies , bone 
marrow aspirate and/or biopsy,  must be obtained within 14 days  prior to start of protocol 
therapy  (repeat the tumor imaging if necessary).

1 Women of childbearing potential require a negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment; sexually 
active patients must use an acceptable method of birth control.  Abstinence is an acceptable method of 
birth control.  
2 If patients have Grade 4 neutropenia then CBCs should be checked at least every other day until recovery 
to Grade 3 or until meeting the criteria for dose limiting toxicity.  
3 If patients develop Grade 3 or greater  thrombocytopenia  then CBCs should be checked every 3 to 4 days 
until recovery  per section 6.1 . 
4 Tumor Disease Evaluation should be obtained on the next consecutive c ycle after initial documentation 
of either a PR or CR.  Subsequent scans may restart 2 cycles after the confirmatory scan. Please note 
that for solid tumor patients, if the institutional investigator determines that the patient has progressed 
based on clin ical or laboratory evidence, he/she may opt not to confirm this finding radiographically.  
4-A     Neurological exam also required for CNS patients.  
4-B  Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma/ Histiocytosis patients are required to have PET scans within 2 weeks prior 
to start of therapy and should also be followed with PET scans if positive at diagnosis. Refer to Section 
12.8   
4-C    Patients with neuroblastoma must have both CT/MRI and MIBG scintigraphy prior to enrollment if the 
patient wa s enrolled with or has a history of having MIBG avid tumor. Otherwise the patient must have 
both CT/MRI and bone scan prior to enrollment. For patients with neuroblastoma and measurable disease 
by CT or MRI, lesions should be measured and followed using th e same modality (CT or MRI) in 
addition to MIBG or bone scan. For patients with neuroblastoma and evaluable disease by MIBG 
scintigraphy or bone scan, use the same modality (MIBG scintigraphy or bone scan) to image and follow 
patients; CT/MRI are not requi red but may be performed as clinically indicated. Refer to Section 12.5.4  
and Section 12.9 . 
5 Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy only required in patients suspected of having bone marrow 
metastasis on the basis of history, symptoms, laboratory evaluation or other clinical data.  Should only 
be performed on patients with known bone marrow involvement at baseline.   
6 Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy should be performed  only when complete response or partial 
response is identified in target disease or when progression in bone marrow is suspected . 
7  Patient diary (see Appendix III) should be reviewed after completion of each treatment cycle and 
uploaded into RAVE.  
8  With consent , two samples will be collected on this protocol (cycle 5 Day 1; and for patients receiving  
≥ 5 cycles only: at progression  or end of protocol therapy) , see Section 8.4  for details of the ctDNA 
studies. Note  that a  ctDNA sample is scheduled to be obtained on the APEC1621 SC screening protocol 
prior to the initiation of treatment on this subprotocol.  
9 Blood pressure will be measured with an appropriate sized cuff at rest. Blood pressure meas urement will 
be repeated within the same day if the blood pressure (BP) is elevated (> the 95th percentile for age, 
height, and gender). Please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to 
determine baseline BP ( See Section 6.7 ). If both BP measurements are >95th percentile for age, height, 
and gender, follow the guidelines in Section 6.7 . Patients with elevated BP at any time should have BP 
measurements perfor med at least twice weekly until BP is within the 95th percentile for age, height, and 
gender (See Appendix IX ). 
10  Plain radiographs of at least one tibial growth plate should be obtained in all patients prior to first dose 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 31 of pr otocol therapy. In patients with open growth plates, follow -up plain radiographs of the same growth 
plate(s) should be obtained according to Section 8.2.1 . 
11     If Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia or Grade 3 or 4 hypertriglyceridemia is detected when  routine (non -
fasting) laboratory studies are performed, the tests should be repeated within 3  days in the fasting state 
to permit accurate grading . 
 
8.2 Monitoring for Specific Toxicities   
8.2.1 Growth Plate Toxicity  
Patients will have a plain AP radiograph of a single proximal tibial growth plate 
obtained prior to the first dose of protocol therapy.   
a. If patients are found to have a closed tibial growth plate, no further radiographs 
will be required.  
b. If patients  are found to have an open tibial growth plate, then repeat plain AP 
radiographs of the same tibial growth plate will be obtained prior to  cycles 2, 
5 and every 6 months.  
• Patients with evidence of growth plate thickening or other changes should 
have a kn ee MRI performed to further assess the degree of physeal 
pathology and undergo more frequent x -ray follow up at least every 3 
cycles or as clinically indicated. MRI should be performed without 
contrast.  
• Patients with knee MRI changes should be managed in  an individualized 
manner. Decisions regarding continuation of selumetinib should be made 
after discussion with the Study Chair or Study Vice -Chair and MATCH 
Leadership, taking into account the presence of any symptoms referable to 
the knee as well as the patient’s response to selumetinib. Consultation with 
an orthopedic surgeon may also be indicated. Plans for follow -up imaging 
will also be made on an individualized basis, taking into account the 
presence of symptoms at the knee or other joints as well as the decision to 
continue selumetinib or not.  
 
8.3 Radiology Studies  
 
8.3.1 Bone Age/Knee MRI  
All tibial radiographs and knee MRIs (if obtained) should be submitted for 
review.  
 
8.3.2 Central Radiology Review for Response:   
Patients who respond (CR, PR) to therapy or have long term stable disease (SD) 
(≥ 6 cycles) on protocol therapy will be centrally reviewed.  The Operations center 
will notify the site when a patient has met the criteria for review. The tumor disease 
evalua tions to be submitted for review include bas eline (pre -study) evaluations as 
well as all end of cycle tumor disease evaluations which occurred while the patient 
was on the subprotocol therapy study.  
8.3.3 Technical Details of Submission:  
To ensure an adequate interpretation of FDG -PET and CT with contrast scans, 
scans transferred between the treating institutions and the Imaging and Radiation 
Oncology Core Group IROC RI (QARC) must be submitted in Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medi cine (DICOM) format. BMP ﬁles, JPG ﬁles, or hard 
copies (ﬁlms) are unacceptable for adequate interpretation of PET and CT with 
contrast scans. Imaging studies must be submitted electronically as outlined in the 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 32 following paragraph. The images will be made available to study radiologists and 
nuclear medicine physicians for central review.  
 
Submission of Diagnostic Imaging data in DICOM format is required.  Submission 
of the digital files and reports via TRIAD is preferred.  Instructions for TRIAD set 
up are b elow.  
 
Alternatively, the images and reports may be submitted via sFTP to IROC Rhode 
Island. Digital data submission instructions including instructions for obtaining a 
sFTP account, can be found at http://irocri.qarc .org. Follow the link labeled digital 
data.  Sites using the Dicommunicator software to submit imaging may continue 
to use that application.  
Corresponding Radiology reports may be submitted along with the electronic 
submission via TRIAD or sFTP or may be e mailed to 
DataSubmission@QARC.org .   
 
Questions may be directed to DataSubmission@QARC.org  or 401.753.7600.  
  
Digital RT Data Submission Using TRIAD (if TRIAD is available at your site):  
TRIAD is the American College of Radiology’s (ACR) image exchange 
application.  TRIAD provides sites participating in clinical trials a secure method 
to transmit DICOM and DICOM RT files and other digital objects, such as reports. 
TRIAD de -identifies and validates the images as they are transferred.  
 
TRIAD Access Requirements:  
Site physics staff who will submit images through TRIAD will need to be 
registered with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and have a valid 
and acti ve CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account.  Please refer to 
CTEP Registration Procedures of the protocol for instructions on how to request a 
CTEP -IAM account.  
To submit images, the site TRIAD user must be on the site roster and be assigned 
the 'TRIAD site user' role on the CTSU roster.  Users should contact the site’s 
CTSU Administrator or Data Administrator to request assignment of the TRIAD 
site user role.   
 
TRIAD Installations:  
 
When a user applies for a CTEP -IAM account with the proper user  role, he/she 
will need to have the TRIAD application installed on his/her workstation to be able 
to submit images. TRIAD installation documentation can be found by following 
this link https://triad install.acr.org/triadclient/    
 
This process can be done in parallel to obtaining your CTEP -IAM account 
username and password.  
 
If you have any questions regarding this information, please send an e -mail to the 
TRIAD Support mailbox at TRIAD -Support@acr.org . 
 
IROC Rhode Island (formerly QARC) will facilitate the central reviews.  
 
For FDG -PET imaging, the transferred imaging data should include uncorrected 
and attenuation -corrected PET projection data, as well as the reconstructed PET or 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 33 PET/CT images used by the institution to achieve a response assessment. If low - 
dose CT was used  for attenuation correction, the acquired CT images should also 
be submitted. The imaging data submitted for central review must allow the study 
to be reconstructed and displayed in transaxial, sagittal and coronal formats using 
standard reconstruction tec hniques. Reconstructed MPEG clips and similar types 
of reconstructions will not be accepted. CT and MRI images similarly should be 
submitted in a format that either includes properly reconstructed multi -planar 
viewing formats in soft tissue and bone window s, or includes the thin -section axial 
acquisition data from which multi -planar reconstructions can be re -created.  
 
Sites not able to submit imaging electronically may submit imaging via CD.   CD’s 
may be sent by courier to:

8.4 Circulating Tumor DNA Study  (optional)  
 
8.4.1 Sampling Schedule   
An initial sample was previously required at time of enrollment onto the 
APEC1621SC  screening protocol. Additional samples will be collected into Streck 
Cell-Free DNA  BCT tube s at the following timepoints:  
(1) Cycle 5 Day 1  
(2) At disea se progres sion or end of protocol therapy (for patients receiving ≥ 5 
cycles of therapy only)  
 
Peripheral blood samples for cell -free DNA should be obtained as follows:  
• For patients ≥ 10 kg collect  20 mLs  (10 mL per tube x 2 tubes)   
• For patients ≥ 5 kg but < 10 kg collect 10  mL (one tube)  
• For patients <  5 kg researc h samples will not be collected   
 
In all cases, blood draw volumes should strictly adhere to institutional limitations , 
taking other blood dra ws into consideration.  However, if a reduction in volume is 
required, samples should be collected in 10 mL increments (ie . 0, 10, or 20  mL 
should be collected such that each Streck Cell -Free DNA BCT is completely 
filled) . 
 
Established institutional guidelines  should be followed for blood collection via 
vascular access devices. Heparin should be avoided in pre -collection flush 
procedures. If therapeutic heparin dosing contamination is a possibility, 
venipuncture is recommended as a first choice collection method. If a Streck Cell-
Free DNA BCT tube immediately follows a heparin tube in the draw order, we 
recommend collecting an EDTA tube as a waste tube prior to collection in the 
Streck Cell -Free DNA BCT.  
 
For patients who do not have indwelling catheters, blood should be collected via 
venipuncture. To guard against backflow, observe the following precautions:  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 34 • Keep patient’s arm in the downwa rd position during the collection 
procedure.  
• Hold the tube with the stopper in the uppermost position so that the tube 
contents do not touch the stopper or the end of the needle during sample 
collection.  
• Release tourniquet once blood starts to flow in the tube, or within 2 
minutes of application . 
• Fill tube completely.  
• Remove tube from adapter and immediately mix by gentle inversion 8 to 
10 times. Inadequate or delayed mixing may result in inaccurate test 
results .  
• Store blood in Streck tube at room temperat ure until shipment  
 
8.4.2 Sample Processing  
Samples do not need to be processed at the collection site.  
8.4.3 Sample Labeling  
Each tube must be labeled with the patient’s study registration number, the study 
I.D (APEC1621E), and the date and time the sample was drawn.  Data should be 
recorded on the appropriate transmittal form found in RAVE , which must 
accompany the sample(s).  
 
8.4.4 Sample Shipping Instructions  
Specimen should be shipped at room temperature to the BPC (address below). 
Upon arrival  separation, extraction, and storage of plasma and cellular DNA  will 
be performed . Samples should be shipped from Monday through Friday for 
Tuesday through Saturday delivery.  If blood is collected over the weekend or on 
the day before a holiday, the sample should be stored in a refrigerator until shipped 
on the next business day.  Ship by FedEx Priority Overnight using the COG FedEx 
account.  Blood samples should be shipped the same day as collection, ship blood 
for Saturday delivery if shipped on Friday.

Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 36  
Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is primarily metabolized by CYP 1A2 
to form the ac tive N -desmethyl metabolite; in addition, UGT 1A1 and1A3 form 
glucuronide conjugates. CYP 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 can also metabolize the 
parent agent to form N -desmethyl selumetinib; however, as observed during in 
vitro studies using a pan -CYP inhibitor, ot her available pathways contribute to 
selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  and N-desmethyl selumetinib 
metabolism. Use caution in patients who are taking strong inducers or inhibitors 
of these CYP or UGT enzymes.  
 
Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is also a substrate of BCRP (breast 
cancer resistance protein) and P -gp transporters. Use caution in patients who are 
taking strong inducers or inhibitors of either transport protein.  
 
Selumetinib  (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) does not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2C8, 
2C19and 3A4 or UGT isoforms 1A1 and 2B7. It is a weak inducer of CYP enzymes 
3A, 1A and 2C9 and a weak inhibitor of CYP 2C9, 2B6 and 2D6. In vitro studies 
demonstrate selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is an inhibitor of BCRP,  
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3 transporters. It does not inhibit 
OCT1, MATE1, MATE2K or P -glycoprotein (MDR1). The N -desmethyl 
metabolite is a weak inhibitor of CYP 3A4 and 1A2. In vitro data suggest that 
selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is unlikely to cause clinically relevant 
drug-drug interactions by these mechanisms.  
            
Patient Care Implications: Study participants should be counseled to avoid 
excessive sun exposure and use adequate sun protection measures if sun exposure 
is antic ipated during the study.  
 
9.1.8 Selumetinib (AZD6244) Toxicities  
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  for 
Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate [NSC 748727]), AZD6244 (NSC 
741078)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a 
single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent 
using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the 
comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and 
italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol 
specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer 
to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelop ment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguide
lines.pdf  for further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 986 patients. 
Below is the CAEPR for Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.

Note : Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any 
adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may result in events never 
previously associated with either agent.  
  
9.2 Agent  Ordering and Agent Accountability  
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by eligible participating Investigators (or their 
authorized designee) at each participating institution. The CTEP -assigned protocol number 
must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents. The eligibl e 
participating investigators at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 40 DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), NCI 
Biosketch, Agent Shipment Form, and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF). If there are 
several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied investigational agents 
for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead participating investigator at that 
institution.  
Note:  No starter supplies will be provided. Drug or ders of selumetinib (AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate) should be placed with CTEP after enrollment and treatment 
assignment to APEC1621E with consideration for timing of processing and shipping 
to ensure receipt of drug supply prior to start of protocol therapy.  If expedited 
shipment is required, sites should provide an express courier account through the Online 
Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application. Provide the patient ID number in the 
comment box when submitting an order request.   
9.3 Clinical Drug Request  and In vestigator Brochure Availability  
Submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) 
application . The current versions of the IBs for the agents will  also be accessible to site 
investigators and research staff through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) 
application . Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” ac count status , and a 
“current” password , and active person registration status . For questions about drug orders, 
transfers, returns, or accountability call or email  PMB  anytime.  Refer to the PMB’s website 
for specific policies and guidelines related to agen t management . Questions about IB access 
may be directed to the PMB IB coordinator via email.  
  
9.4 Agent Inventory Records  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a 
careful record of the receipt, dispensing and fi nal disposition of all agents received from 
the PMB using the appropriate NCI Investigational Agent (Drug) Accountability Record 
(DARF) available on the CTEP forms page.  Store and maintain separate NCI 
Investigational Agent Accountability Records for each  agent, strength, formulation and 
ordering investigator on this protocol .

10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OF F STUDY 
CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Clinical (including physical examination or serum tumor markers) or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from protocol therapy (See Sectio n 6). 
c) Refusal of protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian  
d) Non-compliance that in the opinion of the investigator does not allow for ongoing 
participation.  
e) Completion of 26 cycles  of therapy.  
f) Physician determines it is not in the patient’s best interest.  
g) Repeated eligibility laboratory studies ( CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
or serum creatinine)  are outside the parameters required for eligibility prior to the start 
of protocol therapy  (See Section 8.1 ). 
h) Study is terminated by Sponsor.  
i) Pregnancy  
j) Patient did not receive protocol treatment after study enrollment . 
 
 
 
Patients who are removed from  protocol therapy during cycle 1 should continue  to 
have  the required observations in Section 8.1  until the originally planned end of the 
cycle or until all adverse events have resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens 
LATER. The only exception is with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent  from the APEC1621SC screening protocol . Patients who are removed from 
protocol therapy in subsequent cycles s hould have the necessary observations to 
ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
10.2 Follow -Up Data Submission and APEC1621SC Off Study Criteria  
Patients who are off subprotocol therapy will continue to be followed on the APEC1621SC 
screening protocol. Follow -up data submission will occur until one of the APEC1621SC 
Off Study Criteria is met (See Section 10 of APEC1621SC for details). Ongoing adverse 
events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient is removed from protocol therapy, 
but within 30 d ays of the last dose of investigational agent, must be followed and reported 
via RAVE and CTEP -AERS (if applicable).  Follow -up data will be required until off study 
criteria are met unless consent is withdrawn or the patient dies or is lost to follow -up. 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
APEC1621E will require a minimum of 20 evaluable patients  and a maximum of 49 
patients, allowing for 15% inevaluability. Assuming an enrollment rate of 4 -6 biomarker 
positive patients per year, this subprotocol  is expected to be completed within 8-12 years . 
 
11.2 Dosing Considerations   
A pediatric MTD/ RP2D dose has been established  for selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate)16; therefore  patient s will be treated at that dose.  Please see Section 5.1  for a specific 
discussion of the dosing of selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) to be used in this 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 42 study.   
 
11.3 Study Design  
The p rimary cohort will employ a single stage A’Hern  designs of N=20. The agent will be 
deemed worthy of further study in the relevant subset of patients (i.e. biomarker positive 
in any histology, biomarker positive in a particular histology, etc) if the decision rule is 
met. Operating characteristics are s hown below.  
 
Cohort  N Decision Rule  Alpha  Power  
Primary biomarker positive  20 ≥ 3 responses  10% 90% 
 
Histology -specific biomarker positive expansion cohorts will, by definition, be deemed 
worthy of further study, since they will have at least 3 responses. The table below shows 
90% confidence intervals (Wilson method) for a range of observable response rates.  
 
Cohort Size  Observed Response Rate  90% Confidence Interval  
10 30% 13% - 56% 
10 40% 19% - 65% 
10 50% 27% - 73% 
 
 
11.3.1  Primary Cohort :  
APEC1621E  will evaluate a primary cohort of 20 mutation -matched (“biomarker 
positive”) evaluable patients of any histology for the primary study  aim of 
determining the objective response rate ( CR/PR according to the response criteria 
in Section 12.3 ) to selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ). Using an A’Hern 
design47 with alpha=10%, a sample of N=20 will provide 90% power to detect an 
improvement in response rate from 5%, if the treatment is ineffective, to 25% if 
the targeted therapy  is sufficiently effective to warrant further study. If there are at 
least 3 responses out of 20  in the primary cohort , the biomarker/therapy match will 
be deemed a success.  
 
11.3.2  Histology -Specific Biomarker Positive Expansion Cohorts:  
If ≥ 3 patients in the primary cohort with the same histology show signs of 
objective response (CR/PR  according to  the response criteria  in Section 12.3 ), a 
histology -specific biomarker positive  expansion  cohort will open after the primary 
cohort is completed to up to 7 evaluable  patients  for a  total sample size of 10 
evaluable biomarker positive patients with that histology. This will allow us to 
estimate m ore precisely the activity in biomarker positive patients of that 
histology. See Appendix VI for a list of target tumor histologies.  
We will open up to 3 such expansion cohorts for biomarker positive patients (i.e., 
if 3 histolog ies have ≥ 3 responses, we will open a total of 3 expansion cohorts as 
described above). Note that this can only happen if the response rate in the primary 
cohort is at least 45% (9/20) and there cannot be more than 21 additional  evaluable  
patients in tota l for these expansion cohorts.   
 
11.4 Methods of Analysis  
Response criteria are described in Section 12 . A responder is defined as a patient who 
achieves a best response of PR or CR on the study.  Response rates will be calculated as the 
percent of evaluable patients who  are responders,  and confidence intervals will be 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 43 constructed  using the Wilson score interval method.48 Decision making for A’Hern design 
cohorts will follow rules described above.  
 
Toxicity tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by type of toxicity  
and grade . A patient will be counted only once for a given toxicity for the worst grade of 
that toxicity reported for that patient.  Toxicity information recorded will include the type, 
severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the p robable association with the study 
regimen.    
11.5 Evaluability for Response  
Any eligible patient who is enrolled and receives at least one dose of protocol therapy will 
be considered evaluable for response. Any patient who receives non -protocol anti -cancer 
therapy during the response evaluation period will be considered a non -responder for the 
purposes of the statistical rule, unless they show an objective response prior to receiving 
the non -protocol anti -cancer therapy (in which case they will be considered a  responder). 
Patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by central review will 
be considered to have experienced a response.  When opening expansion cohorts, t he 
evaluation  period for determination of best response will be 6 treatment  cycles . All other 
patients will be considered non -responders. Patients who are not evaluable for response 
evaluation may be replaced for the purposes of the statistical rule.  All patients considered 
to have a response (CR or PR) must have imaging studies reviewed centrally at the COG. 
Centers will be notified by the COG about requests for scans of patients with s table disease. 
Preliminary assessment of activity using institutionally provided tumor measurements will 
be entered into CDUS quarterly. The centr al review by COG will be provided as the final 
reviewed assessment of response when such becomes available.  
 
11.6 Evaluability for Toxicity  
All patients who receive at least one dose of protocol therapy  will be considered in the 
evaluation of toxicity.  
11.7 Progression free survival  (PFS)  
Progression free survival will be defined as time from the initiation of protocol treatment 
to the occurrence of any of the following events: disease progression or disease 
recurrence or death from any cause. All patients sur viving at the time of analyses without 
events will be censored at their last follow -up date.  
 
PFS along with the confidence intervals will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. 
Patients with local calls of disease progression  (i.e. calls made by the treating institution) , 
will be counted as having had an event , even if the central review does not declare 
progression. We will also report PFS based on central radiology review as a secondary 
analysis, if adequate number of disagreements in progressions e xist between the treating 
institution s and the central radiology review to make such an analysis meaningful.     
 
11.8 Correlative Studies  
A descriptive analysis of the exploratory aims described in Section 1.3  will be performed 
and will be summarized with simple summary statistics. All of these analyses will be 
descriptive in nature.  
 
11.9 Gender and Minority Accrual Estimates  
The gender and minority distribution of the study population is expected to be:

  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 45 12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
12.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in version 5.0 of the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting.   All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of CTCAE  version 5.0.  A copy of the  CTCAE  
v5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
12.2 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival ( PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of subprotocol 
treatment to time o f progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Development  of new disea se or progression in any established lesions is considered 
progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions 
show opposite responses, the prog ressive disease takes precedence.  
 
12.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors  
See the table in Section 8.0  for the schedule of tumor evaluations. Eligible p atients must 
have measurable disease present at baseline and have had their disease re -evaluated after 
one dose  of protocol therapy . In addition to t he scheduled scans, a confirmat ory scan should 
be obtained on the next consecutive cycle  following initial documentation of objective 
response.  
 
As outline d, patients will be assigned to one of the following categories for assessment of 
response:  a) solid tumor (non-CNS) and measurable disease ( Section 12.4 ); b) 
neuroblastoma with MIBG positive lesions ( Section 12.5 ); c) CNS tumor  (Section 12. 7); 
and d)  non-Hodgkin lymphoma/hystiocytosis  (Section 12. 8). Note: Neuroblastoma patients 
who do not have MI BG positive lesions should be assessed for response as solid tumor 
patients with measurable disease . 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -
247, 2009].  Key points are that 5 target lesions are identified and that changes in the largest  
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RE CIST v 1.1 criteria.  
 
12.3.1  Definitions  
12.3.1.1  Evaluable for objective response : Eligible patients who receive at least one 
dose of protocol therapy will be considered evaluable for response. 
Evaluable patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response 
confirmed by central review before receiving non -protocol anti -cancer 
therapy w ill be considered a responder. All other evaluable patients will 
be considered non -responders.  
 
12.3.1.2  Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Eligible patients who have 
lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the 
definitions of measurable disease and have received at least one dose of 
protocol therapy will be considered evaluable for non -target disease. The 
response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal 
progression of the lesions.  
 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 46 12.3.2  Disease Parameters  
 
12.3.2.1  Measurable disea se: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by chest x -ray, as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, or ≥ 10 
mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements m ust be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable. If the investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include them, the condit ions under which 
such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol.   
12.3.2.2  Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed 
by CT scan (CT scan slice thicknes s no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.   
12.3.2.3  Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 
≥ 10 to <  15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI),  are considered as non -
measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
12.3.2.4  Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of t heir size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend its elf to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calcula ted and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only 
the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
12.3.2.5  Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 47 measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in  metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by c linical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
12.3.3.1  Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) an d  
10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case 
of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
12.3.3.2  Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptabl e as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
12.3.3.3  Conventional CT and MR I:  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 
mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Ideally, 
the same type of scanner should b e used and the image acquisition protocol 
should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  
 
12.3.3.4  PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of 
a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for 
use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that 
the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identic al diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the 
PET-CT can be used for RECIST  or International Pediatric non -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma Response Criteria  measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer 
lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
12.3.3.5  Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used  to assess response.  
If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
12.3.3.6  Cytology,  Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 48 (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 Cytology should be o btained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease.  
 
12.3.3.7  FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, 
it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of F DG-PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positi ve FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the posi tive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
For patients with a positive PET scan at diagnosis, PET can be used to 
follow response in addition to a CT scan using the International Pedia tric 
non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Response Criteria .49  
 
12.4 Response Criteria for Patients w ith Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
12.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <10 mm.  If immunocytology is available, 
no disease must be detected by that methodology.  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decr ease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 49 diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered progressio ns). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non -target or non -
measurable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study  
 
12.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Targ et Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

12.4.4  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.9  from  a sequence of overall response assessments.  
 
12.5 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with MIBG Positive Lesions  
 
12.5.1  MIBG Positive Lesions  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 51 Patients who have a positive MIBG scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable 
for MIBG response. The use of 123I for MIBG imaging is recommended for all 
scans. If the patient has only one MIBG positive lesion and that lesion was 
radiated, a biopsy must be done at least 28 days  after radiation was completed and 
must show viable neuroblastoma.  
 
12.5.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by the treating 
institution : 
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Parti al Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions  
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
12.5.3  The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess 
efficacy for study endpoint. See Section 8.2  for details on transferrin g images to 
the Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by the treating institution for end of 
course response assessments.  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segmen t,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by adding the score of all the segments. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time point 

  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 52 by the correspo nding pre -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
If morphological evidenc e of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspiration 
is present at enrollment, no tumor cells can be detected by routine morphology 
on two subsequent bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Response . 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced).  
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.5.4  Overall Response  Assessment  
 
Table 4: Overall Response Evaluation for Neuroblastoma Patients and MIBG Positive Disease 
Only  
If patients are enrolled without disease measurable by CT/MRI, any new or newly 
identified lesion by CT/MRI that occurs during therapy would be considered 
progressive disease.

12.5.5  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Section 12. 9. 
 
12.6 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.6.1  Bone Marrow Involvement  
Note: patients with bone marrow as the ONLY site of disease are not eligible for 
this study. Response criteria in this section are intended to be used when 
assessing marrow involvement as a component of overall response.  
 
Histologic analysis at the local instit ution of marrow tumor cell involvement is 
required for patients with a history of marrow involvement. Marrow aspirate and 
biopsy should be evaluated at baseline and every 2 cycles thereafter. Note: If 
progressive disease is documented by RECIST criteria us ing tumor measurements 
or by MIBG scan, then a repeat BM is not needed to confirm PD.  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 53  
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on 2 
consecutive bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies 
performed at least 21 days  apart. Norm alization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at 
study enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by morphology have progressive disease if there 
is a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND 
a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
morphology. (For example, a patient entering with 5% 
tumor in marrow by morphology must increase to ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must increase to  > 60%).  
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma 
in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if 
tumor is detected in 2 consecutive bone marrow biopsies 
or aspirations done at least 21 days  apart.  
 
Stable Disease : Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.  
 
12.6.2  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as  described in Section 12.9 . 
 
12.7 Response Criteria for Patients with CNS Tumor s 
 
12.7.1  Measurable Disease  
Any lesion that is at minimum 10 mm in one dimension on standard MRI or CT, 
for CNS tumors.  
 
12.7.2  Evaluable Disease  
Evaluable disease is defined as at least one lesion, with no lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimens ion. Such lesions may be evaluable by 
nuclear medicine techniques, immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers, 
CSF cytology, or other reliable measures.  
 
12.7.3  Selection of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
For most CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Targ et lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 54 accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the slic es showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non -target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
12.7.4  Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
Response criteria are ass essed based on the product of the longest diameter and its 
longest perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesions – e.g., when multiple  lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Off all steroids 
with stable or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Partial response (PR ): ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the 
initial baseline measurements ; on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids with 
a stable or improving neurologic examination . 
 
• Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD ; on a stable or 
decreasing dose of steroids with a stable or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the  sum of the products 
of the  perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of the product s observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Increasing doses of corticosteroids required to maintain stable neurological 
status should be strongly considered as a sign of clinical progression unless in 
the context of recent wean or transient neurologic change due e.g. to radiation 
effects.   
 
12.7.5  Response Criteria for Non -Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non -target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
12.7.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 55  
12.7.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The 
overall response a ssessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.9 from a sequence of overall response assessments.  
  
12.8 Response Criteria for Patients with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma/Histiocytosis  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Pediatric non -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma Cri teria, with modification from the Lugano classification.50 
 
12.8.1  Disease Parameters  
 
12.8.1.1  Measurable disease : A measurable node must have an LDi (longest 
diameter) greater than 1.5  cm. A  measurable extranodal lesion should 
have an LDi greater than 1.0  cm. All tumor measurements must be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
12.8.1.2  Non-measured disease : All other lesions (including nodal, extranodal, and 
assessable disease) should be followed as nonmeasured disease (e.g., 
cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial 
effusions, ascites).    
 
12.8.1.3  Target lesions : For patients staged with CT , up to six of the largest target 
nodes, nodal masses, or other lymphomatous lesions that are measurable 
in two diameters (longest diameter [LDi] and shortest diameter) should 
be identified from different body regions representative of the patient’s 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 56 overal l disease burden and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal 
disease, if involved.  
 
12.8.2  Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all disease.  CT or MRI should be free of residual mass or 
evidence of new disease. FDG -PET should be negative.  
 
Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu)  
Residual mass is negative by FDG -PET; no new lesions by imaging examination; 
no new and/or progressive disease elsewhere  
 
Partial Response (PR)  
50% decrease in SPD (the sum of the products of the largest diameter and the 
perpendicular diameter for a tumor mass) on CT or MRI; FDG -PET may be 
positive (Deauville score or 4 or 5 with reduced lesional uptake compared with 
baseline); no new and/or PD; m orphologic evidence of disease may be present in 
BM if present at diagnosis; however, there should be 50% reduction in percentage 
of lymphoma cells . 
 
No Response (Stable Disease)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qua lify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Progressive disease  
For those with > 25% increase in SPD on CT or MRI, Deauville score 4 or 5 on 
FDG -PET with increase in lesional uptake from baseline, or development of new 
morp hologic evidence of disease in BM   
 
12.8.3  Evaluation of Non -measured Lesions (CT -based response, PET/CT based 
response not applicable)50 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Absent non -measured lesions.  
 
Partial response (PR) : Absent/normal, regressed, lesions, but no increase.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : No increase consistent with progression  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : New or clear progression of preexisting 
non-measured lesions.  
 
12.8.4  Evaluation of organ enlargement50  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Regress to normal  
 
Partial response (PR) : Spleen must have regressed by >50% in length 
beyond normal  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  No increase consistent with progression  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 57  
Progressive Disease (PD) : In the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length 
must increase by 50% of the extent of its prior 
increase beyond baseline. If no prior splenomegaly, 
must increase by at least 2 cm from baseline.  
 
New or recurrent splenomegaly  
 
 
12.9 Best Response  
Two objecti ve status determinations of disease status , obtained on two consecutive 
determinations, separated by at least a 3 week  time period, are required to determine the 
patient’s overall best response. Two objective status determinations of CR before 
progression are required for best response of CR. Two determinations of PR or better 
before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are required for a best response of PR. 
Two determinations of stable/no response or better before progression, but not qualifying 
as CR or PR, are required for a best response of stable/no response; if the first objective 
status is unknown, only one such determination is required. Patients with an objective 
status of progression on or before the second evaluations (the first evaluation i s the first 
radiographic evaluation after treatment has been administered) will have a best response of 
progressive disease. Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify for a best 
response of progressive disease and if all objective statuses a fter the first determination and 
before progression are unknown.  
 
12.9.1  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 58 Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQ UIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse e vents are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms  
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner t o 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or c ommercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was 
associated with the event.  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
 
 
13.1 Expedited Reporting Requirements  – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospital ization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization (for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospitalizations that are part 
of routine medical practice.  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal lif e functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 59 6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they m ay jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
13.1.1  Reporting Requirements  - Investigator Responsibility  
Clinical investigat ors in the treating institutions and ul timately the Study Chair 
have the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and 
assignment of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention.  It is the 
responsibility of the  treating physician to supply the medical docume ntation 
needed to support the expedited AE reports in a timely manner.  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS) must also be reported via 
routine reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) 
Case Report Form (CRF) withi n the study database.   
 
13.1.2  CTEP -AERS Expedited Reporting Methods  
Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page 
https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task . 
 
Send supporting documentation to the NCI by fax (fax# 301-230-0159 ) and by 
email to the APEC1621 E COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator.  ALWAYS 
include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed documents . 
 
13.2 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the  current version of the  NCI CTCAE  
V5.0.  The  description s and grading scales found in the current version of CTCAE  
V5.0 will be used for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE.  A copy of the CTCAE  v5 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  V5.0. 
 
Step 3:  Review Table A  in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specif ic requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.   
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates 
hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be rep orted regardless 
of attribution and design ation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any 
events identified as proto col-specific expedited  adverse  event  reporti ng exclusions.  
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital 
anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs 
following treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND.  
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports.  
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 60 • As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that 
resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS 
reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) hospitalization is associated with the 
recurring AE.  
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via 
the web at http://ctep.can cer.gov  (telephone CTEP at: 301-897-7497  within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -Hour Notification web -based 
application is unavailable) . Once internet connectivity is restored, a 24 -hour notification 
phoned in must be entered el ectronically into CTEP -AERS  by the original submitter at 
the site.  
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A).   
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 61 Table A:  Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/bi rth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported via CTEP -AERS  within 
the timeframes detailed in the  table below.

NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS  within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -
hour report.  
o “7 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on th e AE must be submitted within 7  calendar 
days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 7  calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is  limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011

13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse even ts on the COG case report  
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported . 
 
13.4.2  If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of 
therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported.  
 
13.4.3  The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) 
grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 
13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline  or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher  (note that the 
resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the 
AE decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
13.4.5  An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported 
once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported 
each course it r ecurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipients of Adverse Event Reports  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF 
packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 63  
13.5.2  Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to 
the local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Specific Examples for Exped ited Reporting  
 
13.6.1  Reportable Categories of Death  
• Death attributable to a CTCAE  v5.0 term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by “Newborn deaths occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth .”  
• Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed 
to a CTCAE  v5.0 term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease 
progression ” under the system organ class (SOC) of General disorders and 
administration site conditions.”  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associ ated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
• Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours.  
 
• Any death that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment with 
an investigational agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or 
definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due to progressive disease must be 
reported via CTEP -AERS per the timelines outlined in the tabl e above.  
 
13.6.2  Reporting Secondary Malignancy  
 
Secondary Malignancy:  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy 
(e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the 
initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an  NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute 
myelocytic leukemia [AML])   
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS)   
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
  APEC1621E  
   
Version Date: 08/19/2019   Page 64 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
 
Second Malignancy:  
A second malignancy  is one unrela ted to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
13.6.3  Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or 
“Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form , available at: 
http://ctep.ca ncer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to (301) 230 -0159 . The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent sho uld be documented in the “Description of Event” 
section of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to 
agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in 
an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions  - Other (pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions SOC . 
 
• Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known  at intervals deemed appropriate by her physicians. The “Pregnancy 
Information Form” should be used for all necessary follow -ups. This form 
is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopmen
t/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyReportForm.pdf . If the baby is 
born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is 
required.  
 
Pregnancy  Loss ( Fetal Death ) 
Pregnancy loss is def ined in CTCAE  v5.0 as “Death in utero.”  
 
Any pregnancy loss  needs to be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss) ”. Do NOT report 
a pregnancy loss  as a Grade 5 event since  CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.  
 
Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE  v5.0 as “Newborn deaths occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by the investigator to be at least possibly 
due to the investigational a gent/intervention, should be  reported expeditiously, as 
Grade 4 “Death Neonatal ” under the system organ class (SOC) of “ General 
disorders and administration site conditions.”  When the death is the result of a 
patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report 
a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of 
men on study  as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event 
as a patient death.

14.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data and safety is ensured by several integrated components includi ng the COG Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
14.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group 
policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role of 
the C OG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of 
patients and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC 
consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one 
consumer representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy 
scientific committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 
6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC 
from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the 
Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study 
statistician to prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The DSMC will 
provide recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics Chair and t he 
Group Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to continue the study 
unchanged. Data and Safety Committee reports for institutional review boards can 
be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web 
site. 
 
14.4.2  Monitor ing by the Study Chair and MATCH  Leadership  
The study chair will monitor the study regularly and enter evaluations of patients’ 
eligibility, evaluability, and dose limiting toxicities into the study database. In 
addition, study data and the study chair’s evaluations will be reviewed by the 
MATCH  Chair, Vice Chair and Statistician on a weekly conference call.

Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non-Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental study 
drug, selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) .  This clinical trial is sponsored by the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI).  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information for others who 
care for this patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a prescriber need to know:  
  
Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  interacts with certain specific enzymes in the liver and certain 
transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cells.  
 
• The enzymes in question are CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 and UGT 1A1 and 1A3. 
Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) is metabolized by these enzymes and may be affected 
by other drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes.  
• The proteins in question are P -gp and BCRP.  Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  is a 
substrate of BCRP and P -gp transporters and may be affected by other drugs that inhibit or induce 
these  transporters.  
             
                 March 2016  
 
To the patient: Take this paper with y ou to your medical appointments and keep the attached 
information card in your wallet .   
 
Selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  interacts with many drugs which can cause side effects. Because 
of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicines before you enroll on this 
clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicines, or if you start 
taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medications  with your 
doctors, include medicine you buy without a prescription (over -the-counter remedy), or any herbal 
supplements such as St. John’s Wort. It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication 
list with you.  
 
Many health care presc ribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your health care providers (doctors, 
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in a clinical trial.  
 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Selumetinib (A ZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  must be used very carefully with other medicines that need 
certain liver enzymes and transport proteins to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  Before you 
enroll onto the clinical trial, your study doctor will work with  your regular health care providers to review 
any medicines and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 3A/5, UGT 1A1 and 1A3, P -gp and BCRP.”  
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including  herbal supplements) may contain 
ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctor or pharmacist to 
determine if there could be any side effects.  
• Avoid taking extra vitamin E found in vitamins or supplements.  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call your 
  APEC1621E

Subsequent Cycles  * Please refer to section 8.1  for the specific timing of these observations
Required Observations in All Subsequent Cycles  
 
a. History/Physical Exam (including VS)  
b. Ht/Wt/BSA  
c. CBC/differential/platelets If patients develop Grade 3 or greater  thrombocytopenia  
then CBCs should be checke d every 3 to 4 days until recovery  per Section 6.1  
d. Electrolytes including Ca++, PO4, Mg++  
e. Creatinine, ALT, bilirubin  
f. Albumin  
g. Tumor Disease Evaluation – Every other cycle x 3 then q 3 cycles. Tumor Disease 
Evaluation should be obtained on the next consecutive cycle after initial 
documentation of either a PR or CR.  Subsequent scans may restart 2 cycles after the 
confirmatory scan. If the institutional inve stigator determines that the patient has 
progressed based on clinical or laboratory evidence, he/she may opt not to confirm 
this finding radiographically  
h. Bone Marrow Aspirate and/or biopsy - Only required in patients suspected of having 
bone marrow metas tasis on the basis of history, symptoms, laboratory evaluation or 
other clinical data.  Should only be performed on patients with known bone marrow 
involvement at baseline. Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy should be performed 
only when complete response or partial response is identified in target disease or when 
progression in bone marrow is suspected.  
i. Patient Diary - (see Appendix III ) should be reviewed after completion of each 
treatment cycle and uploaded into RAV E. The patient diary should be collected 
weekly.  
j. Circulating Tumor  DNA  (ctDNA -optional )- With consent t wo samples will be 
collected on this protocol (Cycle 5 Day 1; and for patients receiving ≥ 5 cycles,  at 
progression or end of protocol therapy) see Section 8.4 for details of the ctDNA 
studies.  
k. ECHO or gated radionuclide study . Every 3 months.  
l.     Creatine Kinase (C PK) 
m.   Blood Pressure. Blood pressure will be measured with an appropriate sized cuff at 
rest. Blood pressure measurement will be repeated within the same day if the blood 
pressure (BP) is elevated (> the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender). Please 
note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine 
baseline BP (See Section 6.7 ). If both BP measurements are >95th percentile for age, 
height, and gender, follow the guidelines in Section 6.7 . Patients with elevated BP at 
any time should have BP measurements performed at le ast twice weekly until BP is 
within the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender (See Appendix IX ). 
n.     Ophthalmologic exam.  Prior to every other cycle  
o.    Plain radiograph tibial growth plate.  Plain radiogra phs of at least one tibial growth 
plate should be obtained in all patients prior to first dose of protocol therapy. In 
patients with open growth plates, follow -up plain radiographs of the same growth 
plate(s) should be obtained according to Section 8.2.1 . 
p.    Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides -If Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia or Grade 3 or 4 
hypertriglyceridemia is detected when  routine (non -fasting) laboratory studies are 
performed, the tests should be repeated within 3  days in the fasting state to permit 
accurate grading

APPENDIX X: YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY APEC1621E  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age)  
A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) in children  
with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer.  You have had treatment for the cancer already 
but it did not go away or it came back after treatment.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did not get rid of the 
cancer. A research study is when doctors work  together to try out new ways to help people who are 
sick. In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer that you have.  
 
3. You agreed to be part of a study to see if your cancer has any specific changes that could help us 
decide what medicine might “match” best to your cancer.  
 
4. We have found a medicine called selumetinib that could “match” your tumor. The doctors want to 
see if selumetinib will help children with your type of cancer get better. We don’t know if 
selumetinib will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is why we are doing the study.  
 
5. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that selumetinib 
may cause your cancer to stop growing or to shrink for a pe riod of time but we don’t know for sure 
if there is any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
6. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that you may have problems, or side effects 
from selumetinib. There may be risks that we don’t know about . 
 
7. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your cancer that your 
doctor can tell you about.  
8. If you decide to be treated w ith selumetinib you might have some tests and check -ups done more 
often that you might if you weren’t part of the study.  
 
9. As part of the study we are also trying to learn more about children’s cancers and how 
selumetinib works  in them. We will draw some ex tra blood samples for this if your family agrees.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY APEC1621E  
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age)  
A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) in children  
with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer. You have had treatment for the cancer already but 
the cancer did not go away or it came back after treatment .  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did not get rid of the cancer . 
A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this 
study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer that you have.  
 
3. The main purpose of this study is to learn how well cancers that have specific changes (mutations) 
respond to medicines that are aimed at those changes. This combination of a tumor with a mutation and 
a medici ne that aims at that mutation is called a “match”.  
 
4.  Your tumor has a mutation that matches selumetinib, and so you have been assigned to selumetinib.  
The doctors want to see if selumetinib will make children with your type of cancer get better.  We don’ t 
know if selumetinib will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is why we are doing the study.  
 
5.  You will get selumetinib by mouth twice daily for a 28 -day period. This entire 28 -day period is called 
a cycle. Selumetinib should be swallowed whole. Do not chew or open . You may continue to 
receive selumetinib for up to about 24 months (approximately 26 cycles) as long as you do not have 
bad effects from it and your cancer does not get any worse. If you decide to be treated with selumetinib , 
you will a lso have exams and tests done that are part of normal cancer care. Some of these may be done 
more often while you are being treated with selumetinib . The doctors want to see if selumetinib will 
help children or adolescents with your type of cancer get bett er. We don’t know if selumetinib  is better 
than other medicines. That is why we are doing this study.  
 
6. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that selumetinib may cause 
your cancer to stop growing or to shrink for a period of time but we don’t know for sure if there is any 
benefit of being part of this study.  
 
7. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” The primary risk to you from this study is that you may have side effects, from 
selumetinib. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks we k now about from selumetinib. There may 
be other risks from selumetinib that we don’t know about yet.  
 
8. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this 
study at any time once you start. There may b e other treatments for your illness that your doctor can 
tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
9. As part of the study we are also trying to learn more about the mutations that occur in cancers that happen 
in children  and teens, as well as how selumetinib works. If your family agrees we will draw some extra 
blood samples to do these tests .

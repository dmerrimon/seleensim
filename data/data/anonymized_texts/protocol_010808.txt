 I. Study Purpose 
The purpose of this research study is to compare two psychotherapy treatments for the 
symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with a no therapy, wait-list control 
condition. The two treatments are Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Accelerated 
Resolution Therapy (ART). CPT looks at the impact the traumatic event has had on 
your life and helps you to examine and change unhelpful thoughts and feelings related 
to the event, yourself, others and the world. CPT is a gold-standard treatment for PTSD. 
Prior randomized control trials of CPT have demonstrated efficacy of the intervention in 
reducing PTSD symptom severity with samples of victims of childhood sexual abuse, 
interpersonal violence, and military-related trauma (e.g., Chard, 2005; Monson et al., 
2006; Resick et al., 2008). CPT is widely disseminated within the Veterans Affairs 
Healthcare System (VA), where CPT is one of two empirically-supported PTSD-focuse d 
treatments offered to veterans (Chard, Ricksecker, Healy, Karlin, & Resick, 2012), and 
across community treatment and academic medical centers.  
Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) also involves processing thoughts and feelings 
related to the event, but does this in a different way than CPT by relying more on 
visualization or imagination rather than talking. There has only been one randomized 
clinical trial of ART for the treatment of PTSD (Kip et al., 2013), and the effectiveness of 
ART in comparison to a gold-standard PTSD psychotherapy is unknown. In order to 
prove efficacy, ART must to be compared to a gold standard treatment for PTSD, such 
as CPT. 
The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of these two 
therapies on PTSD symptoms, along with related symptoms such as depression, sleep 
and physical health to see which treatment is better. The study will also try to determine 
if there are people who respond better to one treatment or the other.  
II. Specific Objectives 
This study is designed to provide clinicians, researchers, administrators, and patients 
with information on the comparative effectiveness of PTSD psychotherapy treatments. 
Page 5  
 A. Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of Cognitive Processing Therapy 
and Accelerated Resolution Therapy in reducing PTSD symptom severity for Veteran 
and civilian patients with PTSD.  
B. Secondary Objective 
The secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of Cognitive Processing 
Therapy and Accelerated Resolution Therapy in reducing depression symptom severity.  
C. Tertiary Objective 
The tertiary objective is to examine whether treatment effectiveness is reduced when 
patient preference for treatment is incongruent with their random assignment. 
D. Exploratory Analyses 
Exploratory analyses will be performed to examine whether demographic (e.g., sex, 
age, Veteran/Non-Veteran status) and other clinically-relevant variables (e.g., sleep 
quality, anger, pain, health care utilization) predict differential response and/or drop-out 
across treatment condition.  
III. Study Design  
This study will examine the effectiveness of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) as 
compared to Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) and a Wait list (WL) control using a 
Randomized, Cross-Over Design with blinded assessment.  280 participants will be 
randomly assigned to receive ART, CPT or WL condition. Upon completion of the WL 
condition after 7 weeks , participants will be re-randomized to ART or CPT.   
The primary outcome is improvement in PTSD symptom severity as measured by 
change on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV or DSM-5 (CAPS-IV/ 
CAPS- 5) after treatment. This primary outcome measure will be administered by post-
doctoral fellows in psychology who will remain blinded to treatment condition. The 
Page 6  
 CAPS-IV and CAPS-5 will be administered at pre- and post-treatment, and 3-month and 
1-year follow-up visits.  
A. Study Population 
Participants will be 280 male and female Veterans and civilians who meet criteria for 
PTSD, or subthreshold PTSD, due to any Criterion A traumatic event. Subthreshold 
PTSD occurs when a patient has a Criterion A traumatic event, and endorses symptoms 
in each of the PTSD Diagnostic Criterions (B-E), but falls below the number and/or 
severity of total Criterion requirements to meet criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. Inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and recruitment are described in Section IV. 
1. Rationale for Inclusion of Non-Veteran participants 
Civilians will be included in this study as they have different Criterion A traumatic events 
(e.g., non-combat). It is imperative to the primary study objective to assess the 
comparative effectiveness of CPT and ART across a variety of trauma(s).   
B. Study Treatment Conditions 
1. Treatment Conditions 
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). CPT looks at the impact the traumatic event has 
had on your life and helps you to examine and change unhelpful thoughts and feelings 
related to the event, yourself, others and the world. CPT will be conducted in 5-15, 60 
minute sessions held once or twice a week.  CPT will be implemented using the 
Cognitive-Only version, excluding the trauma account.  
Acceleration Resolution Therapy (ART). ART, like CPT also involves processing 
thoughts and feelings related to the event, but does this in a different way relying more 
on visualization or imagination rather than talking. ART will be conducted in 5-15, 60 
minute sessions held once or twice a week. 
Wait List (WL) . WL will include a 7 week minimal attention control period with weekly 
check-in calls (see Appendix A for telephone script) to ensure that the participant has 
Page 7  
 not experienced any significant worsening in their symptoms that might require 
interventions, (e.g. suicidal intent). 
2. Rationale for Wait List Condition 
The 7 week timeline for the Wait List condition is commensurate with the average length 
of psychotherapy. Many of the clinics within the Department of Veterans Affairs have a 
wait time to start psychotherapy. In the national Cooperative Studies Program research 
study CSP- 591, VAMC sites such as Cincinnati, have averaged 38 days from initial 
participant screening to entry into treatment. Furthermore, patients with PTSD have 
symptoms of avoidance and may prefer not to start therapy immediately.  
3. Procedure for Determining the Number of Sessions for CPT and ART 
Early completers: After a minimum of five sessions,  individuals with two successive 
sessions (i.e., sessions 4 and 5) with a PCL-5 of 18 or under and with agreement of 
both therapist and participant, will be considered early completers and will be given their 
post-test assessment.  They will be reassessed at 3-months and 1 year follow ups from 
their last treatment session. 
Drop Outs:   Participants in any of the three conditions (CPT, ART, or WL) who drop out 
of treatment will be asked to remain in the study for participation in the assessment 
portion of the study only. Treatment discontinuation will be based on a discussion 
between the participant, the study therapist, and the research team to determine the 
vest clinical care plan for ongoing treatment. Participants will be discontinued from 
treatment if they show substantial worsening of PTSD, other symptoms, or functioning 
requiring lengthy hospitalization if the worsening is due to treatment.  If participants 
decide to discontinue treatment early, they will be asked by their clinician for a reason 
and if they consent to be contacted for post-treatment assessments. If they agree to be 
contacted, study staff will contact the participant to schedule their post-treatment 
assessment immediately following their last treatment session. Participants will also be 
contacted to participate in the 3 and 12 month follow up assessments. Participants will 
be reminded of the voluntary nature of this study and their option to withdraw 
participation at any time.

 C. Study Sites 
The study will be conducted at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center, Trauma Recovery 
Center, in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and at the UC Health Stress Center located in 
Cincinnati, Ohio.

be seen at the Cincinnati VA MC or the UC Health Stress Center depending on their 
associated site. All civilian participants will be seen at the UC Health Stress Center. 
D. Outcome Measures 
Page 9  
 The primary outcome is improvement in PTSD symptom severity as measured by 
clinically significant change on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV or 
DSM- 5 (CAPS-IV/CAPS-5).  
A complete description of all of the outcome measures  is in Appendix B . 
E. Sample Size and Planned Statistical Analyses 
1. Planned Statistical Analyses 
The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of CPT and ART in reducing the 
primary outcome -- PTSD symptom severity -- fo r Veteran and civilian patients with 
PTSD. We predict that CPT will be significantly superior to WL (and potentially superior 
to ART) in reducing PTSD symptoms post-treatment.  To test this hypothesis we will 
use a 3 (Group: CPT, ART, WL) x 4 (Time: Baseline, Post-treatment) mixed-model 
ANCOVA covarying for baseline PTSD ratings.  A significant omnibus interaction, and 
lower-order interactions, in the hypothesized direction will confirm this hypothesis. 
The secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of CPT and ART in reducing 
depression symptom severity.  We predict that CPT will be superior to WL (and 
potentially ART) in reducing depression symptoms post-treatment.  We will test this 
hypothesis with a mixed-model ANCOVA following the same analysis plan as for the 
primary objective. 
The tertiary objective is to examine whether treatment effectiveness is reduced when 
patient preference for treatment is incongruent with their random assignment as we 
predict.  To test this hypothesis, we will first categorize participants to a dichotomized 
preference group based on self-report.  We will then perform a 2 (Group: Preferred 
Therapy, Non-preferred Therapy) x 4 (Time: Baseline, Po st-Treatment, 3 Month, 1 
Year) mixed-model ANCOVA covarying for baseline PTSD for both the primary (PTSD) 
and secondary (depression) outcome variables. A significant omnibus interaction, and 
lower-order interactions, in the hypothesized direction will confirm this hypothesis.  
Additionally, the primary and secondary analyses will be rerun covarying for preference 
to examine this variable’s differential influence on CPT and ART outcomes. 
Page 10  
 Exploratory analyses will be performed to examine whether demographic and clinical 
variables differentially predict response and drop-out across treatment condition. 
Considering the exploratory nature of these analyses we make no predictions.  
However, we will use hierarchical multiple regression to examine the influence of 
demographics independent of the influence of clinical factors in predicting response 
(i.e., 50% symptom reduction) and drop out for each treatment.  Based on the sample 
size estimate below, we will recruit a sample sufficient to include up to 24 predictors 
within these analyses – a more than sufficient number. 
2. Sample Size Estimates  
In order to estimate sample size, we used means and SDs from pilot data, prior studies 
from other groups (Frost et al., 2014; Kip et al., 2012; 2014) and a previously published 
study from our group (Suris et al., 2013) to determine the expected effect size (ES) for 
differences in PTSD symptoms across pre- and post-treatment (i.e. time).  We also 
calculated treatment differences at the post-treatment time point only.  We employed 
the ES metric delta (Δ) for mean time differences and Cohen's d for mean treatment 
differences.  According to Cohen (1990), an ES d = 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 
medium, and 0.8 large for behavioral research.  Effect sizes within the large range are 
clinically relevant for behavioral research and even medium effect sizes should be 
“visible to the naked eye of a careful observer (Cohen, 1990).”  Sample size estimates 
were then made using G*Power version 3.1 (Franz Faul, University of Keil, Germany).  
Using G*Power, we also estimated the a priori sample size required to identify the 
repeated-measures ANOVA interaction terms to be tested in the primary and secondary 
analyses. 
ESs were large for active treatment differences across pre- and post-treatment times (d 
= 1.04 for CAPS reduction with CPT; d = 2.02 for PCL reduction in civilians with ART; d 
= 1.28 for PCL reduction in military with ART).  To detect similarly large differences (ds 
> 0.8) in PTSD severity means over time at α = 0.05, power = 0.95 (to be conservative 
since there should be considerable power for these analyses), two-tailed in the 
proposed study would require at least a total N = 32 (n = 16 for each active treatment).  
A total sample size of N = 152 (n = 76 per active treatment condition) would be required 
Page 11  
 to identify PTSD symptom reductions over pre-and post-treatment in the WL condition 
considering the medium ES. 
ES was small for active treatment difference between CPT and PCT symptoms post-
treatment (d = 0.16).  No data directly comparing CPT and ART are available in the 
extant literature.  To detect a similarly small difference (ds < 0.2) in PTSD severity 
means post-treatment with α = 0.05, power = 0.80, two-tailed in the proposed study 
would require at least a total N = 706 (n = 353 for each active treatment).  Therefore, 
the proposed N = 240 would be insufficient to identify statistically significant differences 
between CPT and ACT post-treatment if we assume a similarly small effect size.  The 
extant literature does not provide ES estimates between CPT vs. WL and ART vs. WL, 
but these ESs would be expected to be considerably larger than the CPT vs. PCT 
estimate. 
In the absence of prior WL data with which to estimate ES, and considering that we 
intend to test interaction effects primarily, we estimate the necessary sample size to 
detect statistically significant Time x Treatment interactions across the entire power and 
ES range.  Results indicate that for the primary analysis we will have sufficient power to 
detect even small effects with a total sample size = 246 (n = 123 per active treatment 
condition).  For the secondary analysis we will have sufficient power to detect even 
small effects with a total sample size = 138 (n = 69 per active treatment condition). 
It should be noted that the above calculations are based on simple contrasts between 
means and hypothetical power functions for the interaction term in repeated measures 
ANOVA, none of which include covariates. These estimates are conservative in that 
inclusion of covariates, as expected in the final analysis, generally increases 
power and we intend to over-sample minimally to accommodate participant 
attrition, further assuring adequate power . The total sample, then, will be N = 240, 
split equally between the two active treatments.   This estimate, based primarily on 
repeated measure ANOVA, is very conservative as it provides a sufficient sample size 
to detect even small interaction effects. If needed, we propose oversampling by up to 40 
participants to account for drop-outs from assessment or to bolster marginal effects.

 F. Random Assignment:  
David Fleck, PhD, our statistician, has created a randomization table for all participants 
using a randomized, cross-over design. For participants who are randomized to the 
Wait List condition, following the completion of this seven week condition, they will be 
randomized into one of the two active treatment conditions, CPT or ART, using the 
randomization table (see Appendix C ).  
IV. Participant Characteristics and Recruitment 
A. Inclusion Criteria 
Participants will include 280 males and females ages 18 and older who meet criteria for 
PTSD (or subthreshold PTSD).  Individuals will be included regardless of gender, 
ethnicity, military/civilian status, or type of trauma(s).  
Participants must also agree to participate in either treatment, agree to allow IRB-
approved study staff to access their medical record to review the extent to which they 
use UC or VA services before or during the study, have access to a telephone or agree 
to come into the Cincinnati VAMC, Trauma Recovery Center for the initial set of 
questions to determine whether they are eligible to participate, and agree to have their 
assessment and treatment sessions digitally audio recorded.  
B. Exclusion Criteria 
Participants who 1) meet criteria for unmedicated bipolar, mania, or unmedicated 
psychotic disorders; 2) meet criteria for a substance use disorder requiring detoxification 
treatment; 3) have active suicidal or homicidal intent with (a) plan(s) and (a) means; 4) 
have a medical condition that will interfere with twice weekly therapy sessions will be 
excluded from the research study; 5) show severe problems with memory or other 
problems with thinking and reasoning (defined as 1 SD below age-graded norms on the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], Nasreddine et al. 2005) .  
Page 13  
 Individuals with a psychotropic medication change within the last 30 days will be asked 
to stay consistent with their current dose for a minimum of 30 days before admission to 
the study.  
C. Concurrent Treatment  
Participants will be asked to refrain from any concurrent psychotherapy that focuses on 
treating the symptoms of PTSD or related mental health disorders.  Exceptions will be 
made for those active in substance use treatment programs, including 12 step programs 
and relapse prevention.  
D. Recruitment 
Participant recruitment will take place both at the University of Cincinnati, and at the 
Cincinnati VA Medical Center. The Trauma Recovery Center hosts a weekly orientation 
group for patients seeking PTSD-specific treatment which enrolls approximately 10 new 
Veterans per week. Historically, sharing research study information in this orientation 
group, in addition to soliciting UC and Cincinnati VAMC clinician and physician primary 
care referrals, have been successful methods of recruitment ( See Recruitment Material: 
VA Orientation Group Recruitment Slide ). Participants will indicate interest in this study 
through completion of a confidential questionnaire, given to the orientation group leader 
(See Recruitment Material: VA Orientation Group Questionnaire_ART Question ). 
Participants in the group will also sign a permission to contact form during the 
orientation group, granting permission for the clinician leading the group to discuss the 
potential participant’s eligibility in the research study with study staff ( See Recruitment 
Material: Contact Permission Form ). Participant recruitment will also take place at the 
UC Health Stress Center. This clinic currently treats an average of 40 patients per 
week, and receives approximately 10-15 weekly referrals for PTSD-specific treatment. 
IRB-approved study fliers will be posted in approved areas to aid in recruitment, in 
addition to distributing IRB-approved mailings to providers within the Cincinnati VAMC, 
UC Stress Center, local primary care centers, hospitals, and community mental health 
treatment centers within the greater Cincinnati area ( See Recruitment Material: 
Recruitment Flyer) . We will also use Study KIK and radio advertisements as additional 
Page 14  
 recruitment tools, and the Study KIK and radio advertisements will only use study 
descriptive information that has been IRB approved from the study flier. The contact 
number on all study recruitment tools will be 513-233-1620. This telephone number is 
associated with the VA site, so all interested participants for the study from both UC 
Stress Center and Cincinnati VAMC will contact study staff at the VA site. 
E. Screening and Informed Consent 
1. Phone Screen and Study Site Determination 
All phone screens will occur at the VA site. Study staff will contact potential participants, 
and prior to any screening data being collected participants will be asked to identify how 
they learned about the study and which site (UC or VA) they were referred from. Civilian 
participants can only be seen at the UC Health Stress Center. Once the participant’s 
associated site is known, study staff will inform the participant that all study 
appointments will be held at their associated site and changing study sites during their 
involvement in the study will be prohibited.  If the participant agrees with staying with 
their associated site, the phone screen will continue. If the participant does not agree, 
study personnel will explain the requirements for the study and refer the participant back 
to their original provider. All data collected during the phone screen will be stored on the 
appropriate secure network. Study staff will be equipped with access to both sites 
network, despite being housed at the VA site (e.g. UC laptop will be provided to store all 
UC participant’s phone screen data). All data collected during the phone screen, 
including PHI, will be stored electronically on the appropriate site’s secure network (e.g. 
PHI of VA participants will be kept on the secure VA Network; PHI of UC participants 
will be stored on the secure UC Network).  
The phone screen will be used to determine if the participant might be eligible for the 
study by assessing inclusionary and exclusionary criteria, including patient current 
mood, behaviors, treatment, and medications ( See Forms: 01-Phone Screen, 02-
Concomitant Medications, 03-Demographic Information, 04-Suicidal & Homicidal 
Screen). All forms during the phone screen will be completed electronically in a 
database on the participant’s designated site’s secure network. If participants do not 
Page 15  
 have access to a phone they must agree to come to the Trauma Recovery Center in 
Fort Thomas, KY to complete the screening in person with study staff. If a participant is 
initially eligible for this study, staff and the participant will schedule all future study 
appointments at the participants designated site, either the Cincinnati VA Medical 
Center --Trauma Recovery Center or the University of Cincinnati Health Stress Center. 
Study staff will remind the participant that all future study appointments will be held at 
that location (including assessments and treatment sessions), and changing study sites 
during the duration of their involvement in the study will be prohibited.  
2. Informed Consent 
Each site has a site-specific Informed Consent Form (ICF, See VA ICF and UC ICF) . 
Research study staff will review and discuss the ICF and HIPAA Authorization forms at 
the Pre-treatment Assessment with the potential participant. The documents must be 
completed and signed before any study procedures are performed. The person 
obtaining the consent will review the documents with the potential participant in a 
location providing privacy to discuss all elements of the document and study 
procedures. The person obtaining the consent will give the potential participant time to 
read the ICF and ask questions. A copy of the ICF will be given to interested 
participants to review and discuss with study personnel. The following elements will be 
discussed with the potential participants: 
 The purpose and objectives of the study 
 The length of the study 
 Any potential risks, discomfort, inconvenience 
 The importance of following study procedures 
 The importance of compliance with all assessments and study visits 
 Randomization 
 Participation is voluntary and the participant may withdraw from the study 
at any time without loss of benefits to which he/she may otherwise be 
entitled 
 Alternative treatments 
 Reimbursement schedule for visits 
Page 16  
  The participant’s SSN is required 
 Consent to be audio recorded during assessments and treatment sessions 
 Provisions for keeping study data confidential and exceptions of 
confidentialit y  
 AEs are treated at no cost to the participant 
 
The participant must sign the ICF and the HIPAA Authorization (Cincinnati VAMC site 
only) before any study procedures are performed. A copy of the signed ICF will be given 
to the participant. The original signed forms will be filed in the Participant Consent Form 
Master File, which will be retained at each individual study site. For participant’s at the 
UC Health Stress Center site, a copy of the signed ICF will be scanned into their 
medical records. 
 
V. Assessments 
A. Assessors:   Clinical psychology post-doctoral fellows will perform all pre- , post-, and 
follow-up assessment interviews, and will be trained and supervised by licensed clinical 
psychologists.   The assessors will remain blind to treatment condition throughout the 
study. Assessors will administer the: Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV 
and DSM-5 (CAPS-IV/CAPS-5), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), 
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and the Creative Imagination Scale. 
Participants in the two active treatment conditions will complete a self-report  
assessment battery at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 month, and 1-year follow- up.  
B. Self-Report Assessments:  The self-report assessment forms will be completed by 
either paper- and-pencil questionnaires or the survey feature in RedCap. For 
assessments completed in RedCap survey, participants will complete the RedCap 
survey on a secure laptop computer or tablet at their designated location (connected to 
VA patient wifi at the Cincinnati VA or UC Health patient wifi at the UC Health Stress 
Center). Once a self-report survey has been completed by a participant, the RedCap 
system will not allow a participant access to change their responses. Participants will 
not have access to any data within RedCap, and will only be able to view their self-
Page 17  
 report assessment forms in RedCap Survey mode. Table 2.0 indicates which self-report 
assessments can be completed by RedCap Survey and which assessments will be 
conducted by Assessor interview. 
All potential participants will complete a pre-treatment assessment. Following their 7 
week wait list period, participants in the WL condition undergo their first post-
assessment. Their first post-assessment will be entered as their pre-treatment data 
when they are randomized to the active treatment condition. All participants will be 
reassessed in-person or by phone following treatment completion (post-treatment) and 
for their 3-month and 1 year follow- up. 
Participants in the two active treatment conditions will complete additional assessments 
at post-treatment, 3 month, and 1-year follow- up. The measures in those assessments 
will be counter-balanced, and will include: the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- 5 
(SCID5), Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV and DSM-5 (CAPS-IV/CAPS-
5), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Patient Health Questionaire-9 and -15 (PHQ-9, 
PHQ-15), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventor y -2 (STAXI-
2), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), 
Perth Emotional Reactivity Scale (PERS), The Future Scale (HOPE), Suicide/Homicide 
Screen (SI/HI Screen), and the Health Care Utilization (HCU).  
At the pre-assessment only will the following forms be included: a locator information 
form, a treatment preference questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MOCA), and the Creative Imagination Scale (CIS). 
Participants in the two active treatment conditions will also be assessed by their 
clinician at each session with the PCL-5 and PHQ-9. Participant will complete the 
Expectancy of Therapeutic Outcome form at session #1. Participants will complete the 
Working Alliance Inventory (WAI- SR) at Session #2 and the Post-treatment 
assessment. Participants will also complete the HOPE and PSQI assessments at 
sessions #3 and #6.

VI. Participant Payment 
Participants may find the continued assessment burdensome, thus their reimbursement 
will increase for the 3-month and 1-year follow- up assessments by modest amounts in 
relation to the additional burden. The questionnaire assessments during treatment are 
brief, and are a standard part of clinical care, so participants will not be compensated.

*Individuals in the WL condition will receive two post-treatment assessments (one after 
WL period and one after completion of either CPT or ART following WL period), and will 
thus receive an additional $75.00 for completion of the 2nd post-treatment assessment. 
 
Participants randomly assigned to CPT or ART will receive up to $330 in total 
compensation for their participation in this study. Participants randomly assigned to WL 
will receive up to $405 in total compensation for their participation in the study. 
Participants will be issued a debit card by the Greenphire ClinCard System. When a 
visit is completed funds will be approved and loaded onto the participants’ card. 
Participants will be issued one card for the duration of their participation. If a participant 
card is lost or stolen, they are instructed to call (866) 952-3795. An instruction sheet will 
be provided for further information. Greenphire and its Customer Support members will 
not have access to participant name or contact information; they will have a participant 
study ID number that will be provided to you by the study coordinator. Participants are 
able to use this study ID number to check the balance on their Greenphire debit card. 
 
VII. Delivery of Therapy 
A. Therapists: Two therapists at the UC Stress Center and 8 therapists at the 
Cincinnati VAMC, Trauma Recovery Center will perform all of the therapy. Therapists 
will be licensed clinical psychologists or licensed independent clinical social workers. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to therapist and then condition at both locations. 
Thus, all therapists will provide both therapies.  
B. Training:   Laney Rosenzweig and three ART trainers will come to the Cincinnati 
VAMC for a 3-day ART training of the 10 therapists. Dr. Chard will ensure that 
therapists are appropriately trained in CPT.  
C. Consultation:  Laney Rosenzweig and her team will provide weekly phone 
consultation in ART. All study therapists have already achieved CPT Provider status . 
Page 20  
 Dr. Chard will provide CPT consultation. Therapists will be approved as study therapists 
after Ms. Rosenzweig signs  off on their abilities.  
D. Digital Audio Recordings:  All therapy sessions will be digitally audio recorded for 
later adherence review. See Data and Safety Monitoring section for more information.  
E. Adherence and Competence Ratings : Dr. Kevin Kip and his team, (who are 
otherwise unaffiliated with the conduct or outcome of this study), at the University of 
South Florida will provide Adherence and Competence Ratings for ART on 10% of the 
total number of treatment cases.  
VIII. Data and Safety Monitoring 
Every effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of participant study records. The 
University of Cincinnati will be allowed to inspect sections of participant medical and 
research records related to this study. The data from the study may be published; 
however, individual participants will not be identified by name. Participant identity will 
remain confidential unless disclosure is required by law.  
There are times when we may have to show participant records to people from the Food 
and Drug Administration, the Office of Human Research Protections, The General 
Accounting Office, the Office of the Inspector General, and the study monitors may look 
at or copy portions of records about participants. This information will not be shared 
unless requested via official channels from the offices with an appropriate rational for 
the request. 
A. Data Entry and Storage:  A paid study coordinator and/or post-doctoral fellow will 
screen all potential participants over the phone. A paid research associate will enter 
assessment interview data for the study into RedCap. Each individual site for the study 
will maintain its own site-specific electronic database through REDCap.  All data will be 
identified by code number. The written interview assessment data will be stored in 
locked file cabinets that will be accessible only to study staff, located in room 3268.02 at 
UC and in room 204 for data collected at the Cincinnati VAMC, Trauma Recovery 
Center . At the end of the research study, data from both sites will be de-identified and 
Page 21  
 combined into one large data set held by the Cincinnati VA Medical Center at the end of 
the research study. This combined data set will not include any identifying information. 
The key listing participant names and code numbers will be kept in an electronic file at 
each respective site on the S drive that is password protected and only accessible by 
study staff. During the study, records will be released to appropriate professionals only 
upon written consent by the participant. Destruction of all research records pertaining to 
this study will be in accordance with the Department of Veterans Affairs and University 
of Cincinnati record retention schedule. The electronic recordings of the assessments 
and sessions will be stored on the S drive in the University of Cincinnati system, or 
Cincinnati VA system depending on participant location assignment, with password 
protection accessible by study staff only. The electronic recordings will be uploaded to a 
secure DMZ sharepoint server that will be accessed by Dr. Kevin Kip and his team for 
adherence review. 
B. Certification of Confidentiality:  To further protect participant privacy, the 
researchers will apply to obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS), immediately following IRB approval. With this 
certificate, the researchers may not disclose information (for example by court order or 
subpoena) that may identify a participant in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, 
administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. Disclosure will be necessary, however, 
upon request of DHHS for audit or program evaluation purposes.

SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT (SRA) [V7.0] 
The following questions are a guide to engaging a patient in an empathetic  
conversation about a difficult subject. Although there are items to check,  
suicide risk is best evaluated through a trusting relationship rather than  
simply relying on a checklist.  
 
1) Socio-demographic risk factors (check those that apply) 
  -Elderly      [  ]      -Unmarried [  ] 
  -White        [  ]      -Male      [  ]

- Provides reason to continue living [  ] 
- Other: 
 
5) Has the patient had thoughts about death or about killing him/herself? Yes [  ] No [  ] 
   (If yes, ask the following): 
Page 30  
   -Do you have a plan for how you would do this?  Yes [  ] No [  ] 
  -Are there means available? (e.g. a gun, pills) Yes [  ] No [  ] 
  -Explain:  
  -Have you actually rehearsed or practiced how you would like to kill yourself?    Yes [  ] 
No [  ] 
  -Do you tend to be impulsive?    Yes [  ] No [  ] 
  -How strong is your intent to do this?  
  -Have you heard voices telling you to hurt or kill yourself?    Yes [  ] No [  ]

6) Is there a history of previous suicide attempts by: 
   Yourself           Yes [  ] No [  ] 
   Family members     Yes [  ] No [  ] 
 
SUICIDE RISK ASSSESSMENT SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: 
The answers to the above questions can not be totaled for a score. Rather, they  
are a guide for formulating a clinical judgment. Based on your clinical  
judgment, using the information currently available, please check below as  
applicable) 
  A) There is no current risk of suicide           [  ] 
  B) There is less than imminent risk of suicide    [  ] 
  C) There is imminent risk of suicide           [  ] 
  
 Narrative explaining conclusion:  
 
SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN  
  (A, B, and C are suggestions. Describe actual plan below) 
 Example A:  No current risk, no plan needed. 
 Example  B:  If there is less than imminent risk of suicide, develop a 
  treatment plan which may include some or all of these element s: 
    -Inform and involve someone close to the patient. 
    -Limit access to means of suicide. 
    -Arrange for increased contact with the patient. 
    -Make a commitment to help the patient through the crisis. 
    -Provide the patient/family with crisis telephone numbers, 
     e.g. 911 or the (SAMHSA) Veterans Crisis Line 1-800- 273-TALK and "pressing 1". 
      Document that these numbers were given.  
Example C:  If there is an imminent risk of suicide, do not leave the patient alone.  
Arrange for psychiatric consultation or transfer to a hospital emergency room by escort, 
ambulance or police.  
   Note: patients who are hospitalized are given an additional assessment by the 
admitting physician to determine whether special precautions are indicated and level of 
observation needed.

 Appendix B. Study Measures.  
Adult Hope Scale (HOPE; Snyder et al., 1991). This 12-item self-report measure 
wh
en administered is labeled the “Future Scale”. Each item is assessed on an 8-point 
Likert scale. It is designed to measure cognitive strategies to meet a goal and 
motivation to achieve the goal.  
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). This is a 14-item self-report measure of physical pain. 
Current, average, and worst pain is captured on a 10-point Likert scale. This measure 
also assess pain management and pain-related functional impairment.  
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV and DSM- 5 (CAPS-IV/CAPS- 5; 
Weathers et al., 2013). PTSD diagnosis will be determined pre- and post- intervention 
by a trained clinician using the CAPS-IV/CAPS-5, in which the 20-item DSM-5 PTSD 
symptoms will be assessed. The CAPS-5 is considered the “gold standard” for PTSD 
assessment. Preliminary analyses from a Veteran sample at the Cincinnati VAMC 
Trauma Recovery Center suggest that this measure has demonstrated good internal 
consistency (α = .79 ). 
Creative Imagination Scale (CIS; Barber & Wilson, 1978).  This is a measure of 
imaginative suggestibility that will be administered pre-treatment by the post-doctoral 
fellow in psychology. It is a widely used and accepted valid measure of suggestibility 
within the field of hypnosis research.  
Health Care Utilization  (HCU). This is a 14-item self-report measure documenting to 
what extent a patient has utilized care, including participation in treatment including 
psychotherapy, medication management, and hospitalization.  
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005 ). This is a brief, 10-
minute cognitive screening tool to assist clinicians in the detection of mild cognitive 
impairment. This measure has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .83).  
Patient Health Questionaire- 15 (PHQ -15). This is a 15-item self-report assessment of 
somatic symptoms designed for use in clinical practice and research. This measures 
demonstrated good internal reliability (α = .80) in primary care samples.  
Page 33  
 Perth Emotional Reactivity Scale (PERS; Becerra et al., 2017). This is a 30-item self-
report questionnaire designed to measure emotional reactivity. Activation, intensity, and 
duration of a person’s emotional responses are measured separately for positive (e.g., 
happiness) and negative emotions (e.g., sadness). Internal reliability for general 
negative reactivity scale (α = .94) and general positive reactivity scale (α = .83) were 
excellent, with good fit indices for the subscales (α = .81-.89). 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  (PSQI). This is a self-report measure designed to 
assess the quality and patterns of sleep in seven areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep 
latency, duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping 
medications, and daytime dysfunction over the past month.  
Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory  (PTCI; Foa et al., 1999 ). This self-report 
measure is designed to assess cognitions following trauma(s). There are three factors 
within the PTCI, Negative Cognitions about the Self, Negative Cognitions about the 
World, and Self- Blame. This measure has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 
.86 - .97) and test-retest reliability (P = .74 - .89). 
PTSD Checklist for DSM- 5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013).  Participants will complete 
the PCL-5, a self-reported PTSD symptom severity measure, pre-, mid-, and post- 
intervention. The PCL-5 is comprised of 20 items on a four-point Likert scale that 
assess all DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Preliminary analyses from a Veteran sample at the 
Cincinnati VAMC Trauma Recovery Center suggest that this measure has 
demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .88 ). 
State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2nd Edition  (STAXI-2; Spielberger, 1999). 
The STAXI-2 is a 57-item assessment designed to measure anger from a state-trait 
personality perspective. The STAXI-2 is comprised of six scales and five subscales and 
each item is rated on a 4-point scale of anger intensity or frequency. Participants will 
complete this full measure pre-, mid-, and post- intervention.  The STAXI-2 has 
demonstrated good internal reliability (.81 to .91) and validity (α = .73-.84; Spielberger, 
Krasner, & Solomon, 1988; reviewed in Deffenbacher et al., 1996) and is one of the 
most commonly used measures of anger. 
Page 34  
 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- 5 (SCID-5; First et al., 2015).  Diagnoses for 
any co-occurring mental disorders will be made pre- and post- intervention by a trained 
post-doctoral fellow in psychology using the SCID-5, a structured clinician interview 
designed to assess for the presence of DSM-5 disorders and aid in differential 
diagnoses.  
Expectancy of Therapeutic Outcome (Therapy Expectancy). This self-report 
assessment is completed a pre-treatment only, and assesses 4 participant expectancy-
related thoughts about the treatment program they have been assigned (e.g., “how 
logical does this type of treatment seem to you”?). This measure has been used in prior 
PTSD clinical trials.  
Treatment Preference. During the pre-treatment assessment, participants are given a 
brief overview of CPT and ART and are asked to indicate which treatment they prefer 
and how confident they are in their treatment preference on a 4-point Likert scale. This 
measure has been used in prior PTSD clinical trials. 
Twenty-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale  (TAS-20; Bagby, Parker, and Taylor, 1994).  
This 20-item self-report measure assesses difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty 
describing feelings, and externally-oriented thinking.  This measure has demonstrated 
good internal reliability ( α = .81) among a psychiatric sample.  
Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI- SR; Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006 ). This 
12-item revised and shortened version of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) is a 
measure of working alliance between therapist and patient in three areas: goal, task, 
and bond. This measure has demonstrated excellent total score internal reliability ( α = 
.91 - .92) and subscale internal reliability (α = .85 - .90).

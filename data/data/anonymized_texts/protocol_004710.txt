Duration of treatm ent 16 weeks
Statistical m ethods For the primary  anal ysis, the anal yses for dose -finding will be 
performed using multiple comparison and modelling techniques
(MCPMod) whereb y several possible dose response models
(patterns) will be evaluated , while keeping full control of the ty pe I 
error at 2.5%, one -sided to identify  the best -fitting model or subset 
of models.  
To account for the repeated nature of the data and the 
covariates in the model, mixed model repeated measures ( MMRM)
analysis will be carried out and covariate adjusted fixed effect 
estimates of average response for each dose group and the 
covariance matrix will be extracted from the fit and used for 
MCPMod analy sis.  The anal ysis will be repeated for the relative 
body  weight change from baseline to 16 weeks . Descriptive 
statistics will be presented for primary  and secondary  endpoints.

samples are taken.  ECG recording may be r epeated by investigator for medical or quality reasons. For ECG measurements, f ollow guidelines in section 
5.2.4 .
14.At visits 9, 10, and 11, IRT will assign medication kits for use at home until the next scheduled clinic visit.  For example, at visit 9 ,kits assigned will 
include the medication to be administered in the clinic for visit 9 and all the medication needed f or the patient for use at home until visit 10 .  IRT will 
assign semaglutide kits only at visits 2, 6, 9, and 10.
15.Patients randomized to dose group s 5 and 6 will be dosed twice a week.  The first dose of each week will be administered on the days shown in t he Flow 
Chart , and all visit procedures for that day will be complet ed as indicated in the Flow Chart .  The 2nddose of each week will be administered 3 or 4 days 
after the 1stdose of each week.   Patient will visit the clinic for the 2ndinjection except between visits 9 and 10, between visits 10 and 11 , and between visits 
11 and 12 .
16.Patients should be trained on how to self administer the medication provided as pre -filled syringes.  If the patient is not willing to self administer the 
injections, the patient should be given the option to visit the clinic and have the medication administer edby the qualified site staff.  Training at visit 
11 is only for patients in dose groups 5 and 6 (twice weekl y dosing).
17.Pre-dose PK samples (except Visits 12 and 13) . PK samples will not be collected on dosing days between v isits 9 and 10, between visits 10 and 11, and 
between visits 11 and 12.
  PK samples will not be collected when patients in dose groups 5 and 6 (twice a week dosing) come to the clinic for their 2nd

patients in dose group 7 (semaglutide, open -label).
19.Blood samples f or the explorato ry biomarkers. The first biomarker s ample at randomization visit should be taken before the administration of study  
drug as this will serve as the baseline.
20.Patients should be instructed to come in the fasting state after at least 10 hours without regular food intake , at the vis its biomarker samples are drawn, or
at the visits when PRO questionnaires are completed .  On days when fasting is required, patients should plan on taking their metformin dose (if 
applicable) after the blood draws and PRO questionnaires are completed.
21.
Sample for pre -specified pharmacogenomic stesting.  This sample is collected from all patie nts participating in the study.
22.Blood samples for biobanking.  Samples collected at visit 2 and end of treatment .  Samples collected for biobanking at end of treatment will include 
only two samples (1 x 4 ml K2 -EDTA tube and 1 x 4 ml serum tube). Sample for DNA banking will not be collected at the end of t reatment visit.  This 
testing is optional for the patients, and the samples are collected only if the patient has signed a separate consent form (s ee section 5.6).

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20181. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highl y prevalent disease affecting 30.3 million 
Americans, or 9.4 % of the US population in 2015.  According to the American Diabetes 
Association, about 1.5 million Americans are newly  diagnosed with ty pe 2 diabetes every  
year.
T2DM is associated with a variet y of medical conditions, including all components of the 
metabolic sy ndrome, obesity ,cardiovascular, pulmonary , gastroi ntestinal (GI), endocrine, 
musculo- skeletal aswell as psy chosocial diseases.  Although some of these conditions can be 
treated b y currentl y available medications, others including obesit y are very difficult to treat 
and pose a sig nificant challenge to caregivers. T2DM is also an important health condition 
for the aging population, as approximately  one- quarter of people over t he age of 65 years 
have T2DM and one -half of older adults have prediabetes. Patients with T2DM have higher 
rates of premature death, functional disability , and coexisting illnesses.
The first treatment for T2DM is often dietary  intervention, phy sical activity, and weight loss
. 
Most of the time these measures are not enough to bring blood glucose levels and body  
weight down to the normal range.  T he next step is taking a medicine that lowers blood 
glucose levels. Recommended first line therap y is metformin, followed b y other oral anti -
hypergly cemic medication or injectable medication such as glucagon -like-peptide 1 receptor 
agonist or insulin.
The proportion of patients with T2DM who achieve recommended glycosylated hemoglobin 
A1c ( HbA1c), blood pressure, and low densit y lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels has 
increased in recent years.  Nevertheless, a 2 013 report found that 33 –49% of patients still did 
not meet general targets for gl ycemic, blood pressure, or cholesterol control, and only  14% 
met targets for all three measur es while also avoiding smoking. Therefore, T2DM still poses 
a significant clinica l and economic burden to individuals and societ y. After adjusting for 
inflation, economic costs of T2DM increased b y 26% from 2012 to 2017. 
This is attributed to 
the increased prevalence of T2DM and the increased cost for care per person with T2DM
(P19-01871).
There is strong and consistent evidence that obesity management is beneficial in th e 
treatment of t ype 2 diabetes.  In patien ts with ty pe 2 diabetes who have obesity /overweight , 
modest and sustained weight loss has be en shown to improve gl ycemic control and to reduce 
the need for glucose -lowering medications.
BI 456906 is a dual glucagon -like-peptide 1 receptor (GL P-1R) and glucagon receptor 
(GCGR) agoni stthat is being evaluated forthe indications of gl ycemic control in T2DM and 
chronic weight management in obesity /overweight . GLP - 1R agonism achieves glucose 
lowering b y inducing glucose -dependent insulin- secretion a cting at the pancreatic β -cell.  In 
addition, GL P-1R agonists lower body  weight by  the inhibition of food intake and also b y 
delay inggastric e mptying and intestinal transit. GCGR agonism is expected to reduce bod y

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018In addition, participation in the study  is of major importance to the development of a new 
subcutaneous (s.c.) once- weekl y medication, which might improve the future therapy  in 
patients wi th T2DM and obesity /overweight.
1.4.2 Risks
The risk for patients caused by  the study  procedures and the risks related to the exposure to 
the study  drug are reasonably  low and do not outweigh the potential benefits. The expected 
side effects are known to be dose dependent, eas y to monitor and manageable in clinical 
trials. 
Among the expected and well known side effects for GL P1-R agonist based therapies are: 
Gastrointestinal disorders
Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Cardiac disorders
Administration site conditions
These side effects can be reduced b y careful dose escalation, are known to be dose 
dependent, are easy  to monitor and manageable in clinical trials. 
In this stud y, the following safet y measures will be applied in order to minimize the risk for 
trial patients:
An extensive safet y laboratory will be performed.
Patients with severe h ypoglycemia within 6 months prior to scre ening, or a history  of 
hypoglycemia unawareness or poor recognition of hy poglycemic s ymptoms are 
exclude d from the trial.
Self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) devices will be provided to patients 
(section 5.2.5.2). P atients can also use their own device.
Rescue medication in case of h ypergl ycemia can be i nitiated during the treatment 
period of the trial ( section 4.2.1 ).
Patients in the placebo group will remain on standard of care that includes metformin 
therap y, and diet and exercise counseling.
There are no risks e xpected by  stopping the study  drug during the course of the trial.
Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring will be performed at screening, randomization 
and within predefined intervals during the trial ,andcriteria for heart rate , QT 
prolongation andcardiac conduction disorders are defined.
Dose adjustment in the highest weekl y dose group and the 
highest twice weekly  
dosing group is allowed ( section 4.1.2 )
During the study , patients will be under medical observation and thoroughly 
monitored for both expected and unex pected AEs including administration and 
evaluation of the Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ).
Pediatric patients are excluded from the trial.
Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast- feeding or intend to 
become pregnant or ar e not using an adequate contraceptive method througho ut the 
trial including the 4 -week follow -up peri od are excluded from the trial

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this trial requires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations in selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients´ 
safet y.
The mechanism of action of BI 456906 , and available preclinical and clinical data for 
BI456906 are not indicating an increased risk of infections. Based on the pharmacological 
mechanism of BI 456906, the review of the non -clinical and clinical data available so far for 
this compound, and co nsidering the clinical and post -marketing data available from the 
GLP-1 receptor agonists available on the market, there is no indication that BI 456906 could 
increase the risk of severe viral infections. 
Patient p articipation in this trial will be consistent with local public health guidance and
regulations.  
Patients with sy mptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection will be excluded from 
participation in the trial.  During participation in the study , if a patient is diagnosed with 
COVID -
19,or is suspected to have SARS -CoV - 2 infection when diagnostic testing is not 
available, trial treatment will be terminated and the patient will be discontinued from the 
study . 
If local regulations require a SARS -Cov-2 test for patients to participate in the trial, the site 
investigator may  order a poly merase chain reaction (PCR) test or another test to diagnose 
acute infection that will be performed locall y at screening. Patients who test positive will be 
informed about the test result and they will not be eligible to partic ipate in the trial in 
accordance to exclusion criterion 27 in the protocol .
A safet y monitoring committee ( SMC ) will be established, comprising of trial investigators, 
members of the BI trial team , and trial independent members. The SMC will review blinded 
safet y data at regular intervals (section 8.7 ).
1.4.3 Discussion
BI 456906 was well tolerated in safet y pharmacology and toxicology studies and the main 
effects seen reflected the intended pharmacology  of the compound. 
 
In a multiple rising dose trial with weekl y dose escalation up to 3.0 mg q.w., BI 456906 
did not reveal relevant safety  signals although drug -relate d gastrointestinal and cardiac side 
effects were reported. All side effects were expected in nature such as nausea, d yspepsia, 
decreased appetite, heart rate increase and conduction disorders and are in line with other
GLP-1 R agonist based therapies. Most of the reported AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity . Severe AEs diarrhea (2)and vomiting (1) were reported for 3 out of 67 pati ents 
treated with BI 456906. No deaths, SAEs, protocol -specified AESIs, or other significant AEs
were reported in this trial to date.
The expected benefit for the selected patient population is improved gl ycemic control and 
body  weight loss, and an improvement of the associated metabolic risk factors and patient 
reported outcomes .

2.1 M AIN OBJEC TIVES , PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
2.1.1 Main objectives
The m ain objective of the trial is to demonstrate a dose -
relationship of BI 456906 on HbA1c 
(absolute change) from baseline to 16 weeks relative to placebo in patients with T2DM .  
Secondary  objectives are to assess the effect of BI 456906 on change in body  weight. An 
open -
label comparator (semaglutide) will allow for comparison of the effects against a pure 
GLP-1R agonist.
This trial is to demonstrate proof of clinical concept (PoC C)with respect to a non -flat dose 
response curve and to define a suitable dose escalation scheme and dose range for BI 456906 
regarding 
safet y, tolerability  and efficacy . For this purpose, a multiple comparison procedure 
with modelling techniques (MCP
Mod) approach is considered.
2.1.2 Primary endpoint
Absolute c hange in HbA1c from baseline to 16 weeks.
2.1.3 Secondary e ndpoint s
1.The relative bod y weight change from baseline to 16 weeks (key secondary endpoint) .
2.The absolute bod y weight change from baseline to 16 weeks .
3.The absolute change in waist circumference from baseline to 16 weeks.
4.
The percentage of patients with 5% or greater body weight loss from baseline to
16weeks .
5. The percentage of patients with 10% or greater body  weight loss from baseline to
16weeks.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018The results of this dose -finding study  will serve as PoCC in patients with T2DM , and will 
provide the basis for decision making to proceed to the next phase based on safet y,
tolerability , and also efficacy  including HbA1c and body  weig ht. In addition, the dose 
escalation scheme identified in this trial is expected to be extrapolated to associated 
indications such as chronic weight management. Due to the fact that GL P-1R agonist based 
therapies are associated with gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and vomiting, a ll doses 
above 0.6 mg  will be reached through dose escalation.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP S
This trial is designed to evalua te safet y, tolerability, PK and PD of BI 456906 in
male and female patients with T2DM using multiple escalation schemes and doses, and will 
support dose selection for phase 3 clinical development of BI 456906 . To compare the effect 
on gl ycemic control and body  weight reduction to e stablished GLP-1R agonists, an 
open label active comparator (semaglutide) was chosen. Semaglutide currently  represents the
most efficacious GLP -1Ragonist with once -weekly  posology  and is approved in the 
indication for gly cemic co ntrol in patients with T2DM. To optimize for the well known 
gastrointestinal side effects with GL P-1 based therapies, especially  at the beginning of 
treatment, 6 dose escalat ion schemes with different dose escalation phases were s elected to 
define the most favorable dose escalation in terms of tolerability and PD for phase 3 trials.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is planned to screen 615 patients and randomize 410 patients with ty pe 2 diabetes in this 
clinical trial. Enrollment w ill be competitive and patients will be enrolled in approximately  
80study  sites in multiple countries. Additional study  sites may  be added for patient 
recruitment , or initiated sites may  be closed for lack of enrollment. Although the trial is 
targeting gl ycemic control as its primary  endpoint, many  patients with elevated body  mass 
index ( BMI )are expected to enter the trial , which will benefit in the asses sment of weight 
loss criteria as secondary endpoints.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the investigator site file at the investigational site irrespective of whether or not 
they have been treated with investigational drug. If a patient is enrolled in error (does not 
meet all inclusion criteria o
r meets one or more exclusion criteria on the day  of enrol lment), 
the sponsor should be contacted immediatel yby the investigator to determine whether the 
patient may  continue in the trial. If both agree that it is medically  appropriate to continue, the 
investigator must obtain documented approval from the sponsor to allow the wrongl y 
enrolled patient to continue in the trial.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
Patients with T2DM who have insufficient gl ycemic control despite diet, exercise and 
metformin treat ment.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20184.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial anddose modifications
Doses from 0.3 mg to 3.6 mg were selected for weekly or twice -weekl ydosing based on the 
following considerations: 
Safety  and tolerability  of BI 456906 was evaluated in healthy  subjects and patients with 
obesity /overweight up to 16 weeks for doses up to 3.15 mg/week (dail y dosing) and up to 4.8 
mg /week (weekl y dosing), ie exceeding the highest dose planned for 1404 -0002. The results 
indicate that the most common GI  side effects could be mitigated by a more gradual increase 
in exposure.
The lowest dose of 0.3 mg in this tri al was selected to support modelling of exposure -
response (MCPMod dose -response and population PK/PD modelling) and is predicted to 
achieve sub -therapeutic PD response comparable t o placebo.
 
The selection of different dose levels and uptitration schemes to be investigated will support a 
robust dose- exposure -response anal ysis of multiple safet y and efficacy  measures to support 
selection of a suitable dose regimen for BI 456906.  This will allow for optimizing

the target titrated dose at the end week 6 (visit 8) due to moderate to severe nausea and/or 
vomiting in the previous two weeks, and the investigator does not believe that the patient will 
tolerate the pre-planned dose with further increasing exposure, dose adjustment is a llowed.
In dose group 4, the weekly target dose may  be reduced to 1.8 mg at the beginning of week 7
 
 
 
If in the opinion of the investigator the patient does not tolera te the reduced dose in dose 
groups 4 and 6, patient wil l be discontinued from treatment, and the patien t will complete the 
end of treatment visit, and the follow -up period.  Dose adjustment is allowed only  atthe end 
ofweek 6 (visit 7 ), and only  in dose g roups 4 and 6.  The actual dose received by  the patient 
(weekl y or twice weekl y) should be recorded in the e CRF.
4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After the assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be 
randomized to one of the dose groups (dose groups 1 to 6 or semaglutide).  Within dose 
groups 1 to 6, patients will be randomized to active or placebo in a 5:1ratio.  Semaglutide 
group (dose group 7) will be open label without placebo
.  In each of the dos e groups from 
1 to 6, a total of 60 patients will be randomized (50 active and 10 placebo).  A total of 
50patients will be ran domized to dose group 7, the open label semaglutide group.
For patients discontinued during the treatment period (does not inclu de follow -up period), 
additional patients may  be added. In each dose group, additional patients may  be added after 
5 pat ients discontinue from the trial (starting with the 6thdiscontinued patient in that 
particular dose group). The number of patients added in eac h dose group should not exceed 
12 patients in dose groups 1 to 6, or 10 patients in dose group 7, which is 20% of the total 
planned randomized in each dose group. Patients in the screening period may  be allowed to 
continue and be randomized in the study even if the maximum limit is reached in each dose 
group .  For dose groups 1 to 6, added patients will be randomized using Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT).  It isnot guaranteed that the added patient will be assigned to the same 
treatment as the discontinu ed patient.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20184.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
The trial has a double blind design within each dose group (dose groups 1 to 6).  Patient s, 
investigator s and every one involved in trial conduct or anal ysis or wi th any other interest in 
this trial will remain blinded with regard to the random ized treatment assignments until after 
database lock.  The semaglutide group (dose group 7) is open label.
Patients in dose groups 1 to 6 will receive medication from vials t hat contain active or 
placebo from weeks 1 to 6 , and this randomized treatment assignment will remain blinded .  
The volume which should be administered at each visit will be known to the study  site staff 
who administers the injection.   Therefore the blindi ng will be maintained within each dose 
group, but not across dose groups.
For weeks 7 to 16, p atients in dose groups 1 to 6 will receive medi cation from pre
-filled 
syringes (0.5 mL fill volume) that contain active medication or placebo.  Each patient will
receive 2 injections (active/active, or active/placebo, or placebo/placebo) once a week
(dose groups 1 to 4 ) or twice a week (dose group 5 and 6)for 10 weeks .
The particular dose group (1 to 6) to w hich the patient was randomized should not be made 
available to the patient.  Patient will know if they  are randomized to the open label 
semaglutide group , or to one of the two twice weekly  dosing groups (5 and 6) .  Patients 
assigned to the open label semaglutide group will receive single-patient -use pens from which 
the respective dose for each week is administered.
The access to the randomiz ation code will be kept restricted until its release for final analy sis
.
The randomization codes will be provided to bioanaly ticsgroup during the course of the trial
to allow for the exclusion from the anal yses samples from placebo patients.  Bioanal ytics will 
not disclose the randomization code or the results of their measurements until the trial is
unblinded after database lock . The randomization codes m aybe provided to the unblinded 
team if a decision was made to conduct interim analy sis(Section 7.2.7 ).
4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT .  It must be used only  in
an emergency
 situation when the identity  of the study drug must be known to the investigator
in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trial
participants.  The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/ or 
appropriate eCRF page.  If the patient is unblinded by  the investigator, patient will have to be 
discontinued from the trial.  Discontinued patients will complete the EOT and follow-up 
visits.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from BI’sPharmacovigilance group to 
access the randomiz ation code for individual patients during trialconduct.  The access to the 
code will only  be given to authoriz ed pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the 
pharmacovigila ncedatabase s ystem 
and not be shared further.

Association, denotes severe cognitive impairment requiring external 
assistance for recovery
Hypoglycemic events should be treated and additional glucose monitoring should be 
implemented per investigator discretion andmedical judgement.   
Investigator sh ould make a determination if a hypergly cemic or a hypoglycemic event should 
be reported as an AE.
A fasting plasma glucose sample and a HbA1c sample should be taken before initiation of 
rescue therap y and sent to the central laboratory  for anal ysis.  The HbA1c sample is not 
required if the test was performed b y the central laboratory  within the last 4 weeks.
Rescue medication can be used from when treatment is initiated until the end of the 
treatment. The choice of rescue medication and its dosage will be left to the discretion of the 
investigator, depending upon existing concomitant medications.  Regardless of the choice 
made, rescue medication should be taken in accordance with the loca l prescribing 
information of that respective medication, taking into account potential contraindications.
If, in the investigator’s clinical opinion, no further effect from the rescue medication is 
anticipated and the patient’s hy pergl ycaemia cannot be co ntrolled, study  medication should 
be permanently  discontinued, and the patient should be discontinued from the trial.  If 
continuous additional anti- hypergl ycemic medication is instituted, study  medication should 
be permanently  discontinued, and the patien t should be discontinued from the trial.  If a 
decision is made to discontinue the patient from the trial, patient should complete the end of 
treatment visit and complete the follow -up period.
Any rescue medication or any  change in dose (i.e. reduction/increase) of antidiabetic 
medication (including background therap y) will be recorded in the source documents and on 
the appropriate pages of the eCRF.
Rescue medication will not be provided as part of the clinical trial supplies, unless required 
by local law s and regulations.
There are no special emer gency  procedures to be followed in this trial.
4.2.2 Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Patients should continue to take the same dose of metformin that they  were on at the time of 
randomization in the trial .  Investigator may  reduce the dose if hy poglycemic episodes are 
observed.  However, t he metformin dose should be at least 100 0 mg/day .  If there is change 
in the formulation (e.g. immediate release to extended release), the investigator shoul d 
determine the comparable dose.

5.1 A SSESSMENT OF EFFICAC Y
The primary  endpoint is the a bsolute change in HbA1c from baseline to 16weeks .  
Throughout the protocol, the term “baseline” refers to the last observation prior to 
administration of the first dose of the stud y drug . 
Secondary endpoints are directed towards assessment of bod y weight changes, and the 
endpo intsare as follows:
1.The relative bod y weight change from baseline to 16 weeks (key secondary endpoint).
2.The absolute bod y weight change from baseline to 16 weeks .
3.The absolute change in waist circumference from baseline to 16 weeks.
4.The percentage of patients with 5% or greater b ody weight loss from baseline to 16 
weeks .
5. The percentage of patients with 10% or greater b ody weight loss from baseline to 16 
weeks.
5.1.1 HbA1c
Blood samples will be taken from patients for the determination of HbA1c at the central
laboratory .  Further details about sample collection, handling, shipment, and assay  procedures 
can be found in the central laboratory  manual.
5.1.2 Weight and 
waist circumference
Weight measurements should alway s be done on the same scales for one patient whenever 
possible .  Mechanical and digital scales are acceptable. In order to get comparab le bod y 
weight values, shoes, coats/jackets , and an y headgear should be taken off, and pockets should 
be emptied of heav y objects (i.e. keys, coins etc.).  Headgear w orn for religious reasons are 
acceptable, but this should be worn for all weight measurement sin the trial.  Patient should 
empty  the bladder before weight is measured.
Waist circumference should be determined b y measuring th e midpoint between the lowest rib 
and the iliac crest.  The measuring tape should be made of a material that is not easily  
stretched.  The tape should be placed perpendicular to the long axis of the body  and 
horizontal to the floor and applied with sufficient tension to conform to the measurement 
surface.  
Waist circumference measurements should be made around a patient’s bare midriff, 
after the patient exhales while standing without shoes and with both feet touching the ground 
and arms hanging freel y.

up with the patie nt if there are an y clinicall y significant findings in the ECG report.
After the screening visit, the investigator must review the ECG results from central reading to 
ensure patient has met all the entry  criteria for the study .  The QTc Fvalue at the screening 
visit is the average of the three recordings.  Any pre -existing conditions should be recorded as 
baseline conditions.   ECG recorded at the randomization visit should be evaluated b y the 
investigator before the patient receives the first dose.  If abnormalities are observed by the 
investigator in the ECG reading at randomization visit, the investigator may wait until the 
results from central reading are available, and the randomization visit may be rescheduled.
After the patient is randomized, if a clinically significant increase in the QTc Finterval from 
baseline or an y other clinically  significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is 
identified, the investigator will assess the sy mptoms (e.g., palpitations, near s yncope, and 
syncope) and decide if the pa tient will continue in the trial.  The investigator must also ensure 
that patient does not meet any  of the stopping criteria , such as tach ycardia, arrh ythmia or 
conduction disorders (Sectio n
3.3.4.1).  An y new findings or deterioration of previous 
findings observed during the trial will be recorded as AEs or SAEs ,and should be followed 
up and/or t reated as medically  appropriate per local standards.
Although the ECGs are transmitted to the vendor for central reading, the investigator has the 
responsibility  to complete an initial review as soon as the ECG recordings are obtained at the 
clinic visit.  At any  time during the trial, the i nvestigator may  decide to place a hold on 
further dos ingof the patient if there is an indication of an y abnormalities in the ECG, and 
would prefer to wait until the results from the central reading are available.
All ECGs that are read in the central location will be stored in the vendor’s database, and will 
be transmi tted to the sponsor periodicall y.
5.2.5
Other safety parameters
5.2.5.1 Suicidal risk assessment and reporting
There has been no suicidal risk identified for BI 456906 in clinical data obtained to date.  
However, evaluation of suicidal behavior and ideation is important in clinical development 
and the Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale, C -SSRS, will be used to prospectivel y
assess suicidal behaviour and ideation ( R12-4395).
The C -SSRS is a ninvestigator -rated interview, developed by  clinical experts in cooperation 
with th e FDA , assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation.  It does not give a 
global score, but provides some categorical and some severit y information specificall y for 
behavior and ideation.
The C -SSRS interview may  be administered by  any type of phy sician, psy chologist, clinical 
social worker, mental health counselor, nurse, or research coordinator with C -SSRS training.  
It has a t ypical duration of five minutes, and causes only a low burden on pati ents.  At a 
minimum, the interview consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation an d 4 
related to suicidal behavio r, and may  be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive 
responses.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018The C -SSRS has been widely  used in large multinationa l clinical trials.  The C -SSRS will be 
administered at the screenin g visit (using the “ baseline /screening” version) with the aim to 
exclude subjects with a life time history  of suicidal ideation and behavio r.  After the baseline 
visit, t he assessment “sinc e last visit” will be perfor med at clinic visits as specified in the 
Flow Chart .  The investigator is to review positive and negative reports for plaus ibility  and 
clinical relevance.  Doubtful reports may  be repeated or reports may  be validated by  a 
consulting ps ychiatrist. If there is a positive report of suicidal behavio r or suicidal ideation 
type 4 or 5 after start of trial, the investigator is to immediately  interview the patient during 
the clinic visit, and advise th e patient to consult with a psychiatrist.  If the positive report is 
confirmed, appropria te actions for the patient ’s safety  must be initiated.  Treatment with 
study  drug should be stopped and patient shoul d be discontinued from the trial .  Additionally , 
all C-SSRS reports of suicidal ideation ty pe 4 or 5 and 
all reports of suicidal behavio r must 
be reported as separate SAEs by the investigator.  For ‘Self -injurious behavior, no suicidal 
intent’ (Ty pe 11) standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be applied. For each negative 
report (suicidal ideation type 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the investigator is to decide 
based on clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the protocol, and if it is 
considered an AE then it must be reported a ccordingl y.
5.2.5.2 Selfmonitoring of blood glucose
Allpatients will be provided an electronic blood glucose monitoring device and supplies for 
use at home during the trial for sel f-measurement of blood glucose. Patients may  also use 
their own device for SMBG monitoring. The SMBG device is dispensed to the patient at the 
screening visit (visit 1).  Instructions on the proper use of the SMBG equipment will be 
provided 
to the patient by the site staff.  A paper dia ry will be dispensed along with the 
device, and t he patient will enter the blood glucose measurements done at home in the diary.
SMBG should be performed regularl y.  Recommendations are as follows:
Randomiz ed treatment period: w eekly blood glucose measurements ina fasted state 
(fasting for at least 10 hours) .
Follow -up period: a t least one blood glucose measurement ina fasted state (fasting for 
at least 10 hours) .
At any  time patient is symptomatic,  
i.e. experiences signs/s ymptoms of hy per-or 
hypoglycemia.

Blood glucose measurements recorded in the patient diary  (other than the seven -point 
measurements) are not entered in eCRFs unless it is related to an AE or SAE.
Throughout the trial, the patient should bring the paper diary  to every  clinic visit.  Study  site 
staff should review the diary  at each visit and follow -up if nece ssary . Site staff should 
provide additional instructions or trai ning to the patient if needed.

5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of adverse event s 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
AnAE can therefore be any  unfavo rable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The followin g should also be recorded as an 
AE in the eCRF andBI SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, and physical examination and laboratory  test results, if 
they are judged clinicall y relevant b y the investigator .
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe,
-requires inpatient hospitaliz ation orprolongation of existing hospitaliz ation
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require

above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasi as or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitaliz ation or development of dependency  or abuse. 
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
repor ted as SAEs as described above.
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in 5.2.6.2, subsections “AE Collection ”and“ AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines” .
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
AESI srelates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of 
particular concern for prospective safety  monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the sa me class. 
AESI s need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE s, please seesection 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Pancreatitis
Hepatic inju ry
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters :
an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2 fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample, or
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “ DILI checklist” provided in eDC.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepa tic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analyzed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.

The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the follo wing:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are generall ytolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities.
As GI and cardiac AEs have been shown to be associated with pharmacological doses of 
GLP-1R agonists and glucagon, the intensity  of such AEs are defined as follows for this 
clinical trial:
Nausea

5.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility  of a 
causal relati onship between the AE and the given study  treatment , considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal r elationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medi cation, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event 
(e.g. pre-existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if t he dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) .
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despite removing the original trigger.

situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the study  drug treatment cont inues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.6.2.1 AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF(s) by  the 
investigator :
•From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’s end of trial : all 
AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
•After the individual patient’s end of trial: the investigator does not need to activel y 
monitor the patient for new AEs but should only  report any  occurrence of cancer and trial 
treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESI s of which the investigator may 
become aware of by any means of communication (e.g. phone call). Those AEs should be 
report ed on the BI SAE form (see 5.2.6.2.2), but not on the eCRF.
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately  (within 24 hours ) t o the s ponsor’s 
unique entry point (country  specific reporting process will be provided in the I SF). The same 
timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the 
investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.   All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trial
must be fol lowed up until they  have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , 
or no further information can be obtained.
5.2.6.2.3 Pregnancy
In rare ca ses, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has ta ken study  drug , the investigator must report any  drug exposure during 
pregnancy  in a trialparticipant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  means of Part A of the 
Pregnancy  Monitoring Form to the 
sponsor ’s unique entry  point.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trial s (Part B).

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The trial consists of a sc reening period, treatment period, and a follow -up period.  Fo llowing 
the 2- week screening period, patients will be random ized (visit 2) to one of the dose groups 
(dose groups 1 to 6 or semaglutide) .  During the treatment period, t here w ill be a dose
escalation period (for dose groups 2 to 7) followed by  adose maint enance period .  The
treatment per iod is followed by  a 4-week follow -
upperiod.
Patients should make a ll efforts to complete the trial which includes the 4 -week follow -up 
period.  Investigators should encourage treatment compliance , and adherence to the protocol 
procedures.  All patients should adhere to the vi sit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart .  
Any deviations from the planned visit schedule should be documented.
In exceptional cases, if standard clinic visits at the trial sites are impossible or i n situations 
where an individual patient is unable or unwilling to attend a clinic visit due to COVID -19 
related safet y risks , the investigator must assess the risk -benefit for the individual pat ient and 
may decide to perform a visit remotely  if this is in the best interests of the patient and if 
agreed with the sponsor. 
All COVI D-19 related deviations from the original schedule of visits and procedures will be 
documented and the implications con sidered for the anal ysis of the trial data.
If any visit after randomization is rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original 
visit date.
At all clinic visits blood pressure should be measured , and ECG recorded before blood 
samples are taken.
Diet and exercise counsel ing will be provided to patients by a dietician or a trained staff 
member at the stud y site at visits specified in the Flow Chart.  Patients should be reminded at 
every  clinic visit to follow the recommended diet and exercise regimen.  
Pregnancy tests
All women of child bearing potential will undergo serum pregnanc y test at the screening visit 
(visit 1).  Patients who test positive for the serum pregnancy  test will be excluded from the 
trial.  Urine pregnancy  tests will be done at all visits in the cl inic starting from v isit 2.  There 
will not be a pregnancy  test when patients in dose groups 5 and 6 (twice a week dosing) come 
to the clinic for th eir second dose of each week .  Ifthe urine pregnancy  test is positive, a 
serum pregnancy  test will be done to confi rm pregnancy .  Ifthe serum pregnancy  test is

6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECT ED VISITS
6.2.1 Screening and run -in period
Screening (visit 1)
No trial procedures should be performed until the patient has con sente d to take part in the 
trial.  If the patient is willing to provide a blood sample for unspecified pharmacogenomic s
and biomarker testing (biobanking) , a sepa rate consent must be obtained .  Each patient will 
be assigned a unique patient number and enrol lmentwill be recorded in eCRF.
Once the patient has consented, the patient is considered to be enro lled in the trial. The 
patient should be recorded on the enro llment lo g and be registered in the IRT .
Baseline conditions, medical history , and eligibility  criteria will be assessed at visit 1 .  
Concomitant therap y and AE (if an y) will be recorded.  At the conclusion of visit 1, patients 
should receive instructions on procedures to be followed during the screening period.
If the patient has met all the eligibility  criteria, r andomizatio n visit (visit 2) will be scheduled .
Screening period may  be extend ed by  two weeks for administrative reasons after consultation 
with the Clinical Trial Manager .  Total scree ning period should not exceed 4 weeks 
(informed consent to randomization) unless written approval is obtained from the Clinical 
Trial Leader.
If scr eening period is extended for more than two weeks, the i nvestigator should review the 
laboratory  reports from the screening visit (v isit 1), and make a determination if any  labs 
specified in the protocol must be repeated before the randomization visit.  If deemed 
necessary , test samples should be drawn and sent to the central laboratory .  
Discontinuation during the screening period
Ifpatients discontinue from the trial during the screening period, no additi onal clinic visits 
are required, and they  will be marked as screen failures.   Patient will be registered as a screen 
failure in IRT.
Rescreening and re testing
A patient may be re screened once with ap proval from the Clinical Trial Manager .  Patients 
who met all the inclusion criteria but were screen f ailed due to acute medical conditions that 
have since been resolved or those who were screen failed for administrative reasons (e.g., 
extended travel, life events) will be good candidates for re- screening.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018If the investigator believes that an ineligible l ab test result is the result of an error or 
extenuating c ircumstance, then that lab test can be retested o ncewithout the patient having to
be re screened.  Patients who do not meet to HbA1c inclusion criteria cannot be retested or 
rescreened.
6.2.2 Treatment per iod
Patients who meet all the protocol criteria will be randomized at v isit 2.  After randomization, 
patients will start the treatment period which includes a dose escalation phase, followed b y 
the dose maintenance phase as shown in Figure 3.1: 1.
Procedures to be completed at each clinic visit can be found in the Flow Chart.
At visits specified in the Flow Chart , patients should be instructed to come in the fasting state
after at least 10 hours without food intake .  Water intake is allowed. Fasting is required when 
patients attend visits when samples for biomarkers are collected or when PRO qu estionnaires 
are administered.
 
 
At each clinic visit, patients should be advised to follow the recommended diet and exercise 
plan.  Diet and exercise counse ling sessions are held at visits indicated in the Flow Chart.  All 
clinic visits during the treatment period should preferabl y be on the same day  of the week.  
On day s when fasting is r equired , the clinic visit should ideally  be scheduled in the mornings, 
if this is convenient for the patient .
Unscheduled visits may  be arranged if necessary .  Procedures completed during an
unsche duled visit will depend on the circumstances under which the visit was scheduled, and 
at the discretion of the investigator.
After c ompletion of the treatment period , patients wil l have the End of Treatment visit 
(visit12).  A ll patients will then 
enter the 4- week follow -up period, and complete the 
observation period with the follow- up visit (visit 13).
Discontinuat ion during the treatment period
Ifpatients discon tinue from the trial during the treatment period (dose escalation phase or 
maintenance pha se), they should co mplete the End of Treatment visit (v isit 12), and a
followup visit (corresponding to v
isit 13) will be scheduled 5 weeks after the last dose of 
study  drug .  Every  effort should be made to complete all the procedure s at the EOT and 
follo
w-up visits.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20187. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
The primary  trial objective inc ludes demonstration of PoC C with respect to a non -flat dose 
response curve , characterizat ion of the dose -response relationship within the therapeutic 
range, and selection of the dose range for phase III development. For this purpose, the 
primary  anal ysis uses methodology  for dose findi ng emplo ying MCPMod.
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The null hy pothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve comparing the placebo and the 
BI 456906 dose groups. The alternative hy pothesis is that there is a non -flat dose response 
curve indicating a benefit of BI 456906 over Placebo. 
The MCPMod procedur e allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose 
response patterns, whilst protecting the overall probabil ity of type I error (one sided α of 
2.5%). The pre -specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in 
Section
7.2.2 .
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
For the dose -finding all randomized patients with at least 1 post- baseline measurement 
according to the treatment the patients were assigned will be included in the 
primary  anal ysis. 
More details and all other analysis sets will be specified in the TSAP.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint 
analyses
The anal yses for PoCC and dose -finding will b e performed using MCPMod [R10-1424]
whereb y several possible dose response models (patterns) will be evaluat ed, while keeping 
full control of the type I error at 2.5%, one -sided) to identify  the best -fitting model or subset 
of models. 
To account for the repeated nature of the data and the covariates in the model, mixed model 
repeated measurements ( MMRM) analy sis will be carried out and covariate adjusted fixed 
effect estimates of average response for each dose group and the covariance matrix will be 
extracted from the fit and used for MCPMod anal ysis.  For the twice weekl y dosing schemes
the total dose per week will be considered for the MCPMod analy sis.
For this anal ysis a restricted maximum likelihood (REM L) based approach using MMRM 
compar ing the change from baseline of HbA1c at different timepoints of treatment.
The anal ysis will include the fixed, categoric al effects of treatment and the fixed continuous 
eff
ects of baseline at each visit.  Visit will be treated as the repeated measure with an 
unstructured covariance structure used to model the within patient measurements.

The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom 
and adjust standard errors. The treatment comparison to placebo will be the contrast between 
treatments at the different visitsand will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. The 
primary  comparison will be performed at the visit of the primary  interest.
For the PoCC testing and for the sample size calculation, the basic shape of each of the 
models to be tested must be pre -defined. Following models will be considered for this 
analysis 
The following model assumptions and resulting graphs ( Figure 7.2.2: 1 )have been 
selected to cover both plausible and a diverse range of dose response patterns.

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events 
with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of 5 weeks after the last 
dose of study  drug ,willbe assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patient s will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events 
will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the 
REP. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will 
also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current ve rsion of the MedDRA 
at database lock .
Laboratory  data will be analy zedboth quan titatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory
 data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summariz ed. 
Treatment groups will be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as 
well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patient s with abnormal values or clinicall y 
relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trialand at the end -of-trialevaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.
 
The PRO endpoints an alyses are of exploratory  nature and details will be provided in the 
TSAP .
7.2.7 Interim Analyses
Interim anal yses may  be performed during the conduct of this trial .  A limited number of the 
sponsor 
staff will be unblinded for the conduct of the interim anal ysis.  Investigators, stud y 
site staff, trial team, and patients will remain blinded.  If a decision is made to perform an 
interim analy sis, m ore details will be specified in the interim anal ysis logistics plan .  The data 
from interim anal ysis may allow planning future trials and reporting key  results but will not 
includ e MCPMod anal yses.

For the primary  endpoint the MMRM will be used to handle missing values. The imputation 
rules for secondary  and further endpoint s will be specified in the TSAP.
7.4 RANDOMIZ ATION
BI will arrange for the randomi zation and the packaging and labelling of study  drug . The 
randomi zation list(s) will be generated using a validated system, which involves a pseudo -
random number generator so that the res ulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -
predictable. The block size will be documented in the CTR Access to the codes wil l be 
controlled and documented (sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.5 )
7.5 PATIENTS DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
The sample size calculation is based on an assumed maximum effect size of BI 456906 vs. 
placebo of 
0.5% change in HbA1c for the primary  endpoint, as well as on the pre-specified 
models listed insection 5.1.2. The maximum effect size is assumed to be 0.5% with the 
standard deviation (SD) 1% ( R17-4311).
For the contrast test (one-sided 2.5% alpha level), a sample size of 45 evaluable patients is 
needed in order to reach 94% average power for the assumed effect size of 0.6% . The powers 
for each model shape under different assumptions (different effect size and sample size) are 
summarized in the table below.

8.2 D ATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A risk-based approach isused for trialqualit y management .  It is initiated by  the assessment 
of critical data and processes fortrial participant protection and reliability  of the results as 
well as identification and assessment of associated risks.   An Integrated Quality  and Risk 
Management Plan (IQRMP) documents the rationale and strategies for risk management
during trial conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other 
processes focusing on areas of greatest risk .  Continuous ri sk review and assessment may 
lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design, or monitoring approaches.
A quality  assurance audit/inspection of this trialmay be conducted b y the sponsor ,sponsor ’s 
designees ,or by IRB /IECor by  regulatory  authoritie s.  The quality  assurance auditor will 
have access to all medical records, the investigator ’s trial-related files and correspondence, 
and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial .
8.3 RECORDS
Electronic CRF sfor individual patient s will be provided by  the 
sponsor .  See section 4.1.5.2
for rul es about emergency  code breaks.  For drug accountability , refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirem ents,the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient .  Source data as well as reported 
data should foll ow the “AL COA principles” and be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and a ccurate.  Changes to the data sho uld be traceable (audit trail).  Data reported on 
the e CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
The current medical history  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evide nce of an y 
diagnostic tests.  In this case the investigator must make three documented attempts to 
retrieve previous medical records.   If this fails, a verbal feedback from the patient which is 
documented in their medical records at the stud y site, would be acceptable.
During the site visit the sponsor’s CRA or audito r must be granted access to the original 
patient file (please see section 8.3.2 ).  The investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers 
(e.g. patient ’sname, initials, address, phone number, social securit y number ) have properl y 
been removed or redacted from an y copy of the patients’ source documents before sending 
them to the sponsor.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action (e.g. re -training )must 
be documented in the patient file.

Title of Study: Phase 2a Study of Systemic PK and Serial ECG Determinations Following 8 Weeks of 
HyBryte Treatment
Investigators: Brian Poligone, MD; potentially one additional TBD Investigator
Study Centre(s): Rochester Skin Lymphoma Center; 1 other site TBD
Publication (reference): N/A
Study Period (years): 0.4 year
Date of First Enrollment: 02 May 2022
Date of Last Completed: 31 October 2022Phase of Development:  Phase 2a
Objectives:  The primary objectives of this study are to assess:
•the systemic blood levels of hypericin during 8 weeks of standard HyBryte photodynamic 
therapy; and
•any ECG changes during 8 weeks of standard HyBryte photodynamic therapy.
Methodology: This will be an open label trial. Subjects with CTCL (stage IB or IIA) with lesions of 
≥10% of body surface area will be enrolled and receive topical HyBryte applied to all accessible lesions 
twice per week followed by visible light treatment 18-24 hours later starting at 5 J/cm2 and titrated up at 
each visit until there is evidence of mild erythema of the treated lesions following the light session 
(Grade 1 erythema on the Erythema Score). At baseline and at the end of weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10, serum 
for Hypericin levels will be obtained and 12-lead ECG’s will be performed at baseline (prior to drug 
application), at Week 4, Session 2 (immediately before and 2 hours after completion of the light 
session), at Week 6, Session 2 (immediately before the light session), Week 8, Session 2 Light Session 
visit (immediately before and 2 hours after completion of the light session), and Week 10/End of Study 
visit. Routine safety laboratories (hematology, clinical chemistries) will be analyzed at baseline, at the 
Week 8 Session 2 Light Session visit, and 2 weeks after completion of therapy (Week 10/End of Study). 
AE’s will be recorded throughout the study. 
Number of patients (planned): Approximately 6 subjects will be recruited

11.Subject has any condition that, in the judgment of the PI, is likely to interfere with participation 
in the study
12.Subjects receiving drugs known to cause photosensitization within 2 weeks of starting HyBryte 
therapy unless they have not had evidence of photosensitization after receiving a stable dose of 
the medication for a minimum of 4 weeks 
Test product, dose and mode of administration: HyBryte (0.25% hypericin ointment) applied in a 
thin film on all lesions avoiding treatment of healthy skin (weight of drug actually used will be 
measured by weighing the drug jar at the time of each light treatment by study personnel and estimating 
the amount applied by changes in jar weight) and covered with opaque covering.  The light panel for use 
in this study is the Daavlin 7 Series Phototherapy Device using visible light lamps (510K clearance 
K212510). The drug will be activated 18-24 hours after application starting at 5 J/cm2 of visible light 
metered by duration of exposure and titrated up at each visit until a mild erythema (Grade I Erythema 
Score) in the treated lesions is seen following the light session.
Duration of treatment: Subjects will apply HyBryte to all accessible lesions followed 18-24 hours later 
by visible light treatment twice per week using the Daavlin 7 Series Phototherapy Device. Treatments 
will continue twice per week (at least 2 calendar days apart) for a total of 8 weeks of treatment (16 
actual treatments). Subjects will have serum hypericin levels obtained at baseline (prior to drug 
application) and at weeks 4 (immediately before and 2 hours after light session), 6 (immediately before 
light session), and 8 (immediately before drug application, immediately before and 2 hours after light 
session). Subjects will have ECGs obtained at baseline (prior to drug application) and at weeks 4 
(immediately before and 2 hours after light session), 6 (immediately before light session), and 8 
(immediately before and 2 hours after light session). Subjects will return as outpatients 2 weeks after the 
final drug application (Week 10/End of Study) for safety laboratory assessments, PK samples, ECG, 
lesion evaluations and collection of adverse events.
Reference therapy, dose and mode of administration: Not applicable as there is no reference therapy 
in this uncontrolled study.
Criteria for evaluation:
Primary Objectives:
This is an exploratory study to assess the systemic exposure to hypericin following topical application of 
HyBryte. Given the relatively small sample size, no formal efficacy assessments will be performed.
Safety:
The safety variables evaluated are: Serial ECG’s, clinical hematology assessments, clinical chemistry 
assessments, vital signs, and the collection of adverse/serious adverse events.

Amendment 1: 20 April 2022INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1 Background Introduction
This section contains a brief description of the rationale and available information 
concerning the chemistry, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, pharmacokinetics 
(PK), and previous clinical experience with HyBryte. Please refer to the Investigator's 
Brochure (IB) for additional details and information.
1.1.1 Natural History and Treatment of Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), of which the most common early stages are also 
known as mycosis fungoides (MF), is the most common type of T-cell lymphoma. CTCL 
affects approximately 25,000 to 50,000 individuals in the US (1). MF most commonly 
presents with skin involvement only, manifested as scaly, erythematous patches. As MF 
progresses, patients develop thicker skin lesions (plaques), skin tumors, lymph node (LN) 
involvement, blood involvement (Sézary syndrome), and visceral organ involvement. A 
few patients will present with more advanced stages of CTCL requiring systemic therapy 
from the time of diagnosis (2). Advanced disease with diffuse LN and visceral organ 
involvement is usually associated with a poorer response rate to standard therapies and 
the patient’s survival can often be measured in months (3). A sub-group of CTCL 
patients present with extensive skin involvement (generalized erythroderma) and 
circulating malignant cerebriform T-cells that is commonly designated Sézary syndrome 
(SS) (4, 5).
MF has substantial morbidity and potential mortality. Mortality is related to stage of 
disease (6). Median survival for stage T1 (cutaneous patches or plaques <10% body 
surface area (BSA)) or T2 (patches or plaques >10% BSA) exceeds 12 years; T1 or T2 
patients with lymph node or blood involvement and T3 (one or more cutaneous tumors) 
or T4 patients (erythroderma) have a 5-year median survival; those with visceral 
involvement or LN effacement by tumor have only a 2.5-year median survival. 
The diagnosis of CTCL is confirmed by skin biopsy, which characteristically 
demonstrates the pathognomonic epidermal infiltration (Pautrier’s micro-abscesses) of 
hyperchromatic T-cells that are immunohistochemically positive for the CD4 marker 
identifying the “helper” T-cell subset and often fail to express CD7 (7, 8). Blood 
involvement can be investigated through flow cytometry, Sézary count and/or gene 
rearrangement studies to determine the presence of a circulating clone (6, 9). More 
advanced skin disease produces vertical growth resulting in tumors or ulcers and is 
frequently associated with regional LN involvement that can be detected via physical 
examination and radiological imaging. 
Treatment of MF involves skin directed therapies, biologic response modifying therapies 
(aimed at promoting a host response to tumor), radiation therapy (directed at individual 
tumors or total body electron beam irradiation), and in some instances multi-agent 
chemotherapeutic modalities. Most patients have received short courses of topical

Amendment 1: 20 April 2022corticosteroids prior to the diagnosis of MF (10). The malignancy-specific topical 
treatments include mechlorethamine (11-13) (nitrogen mustard or Mustargen®) 
administered in a tap water solution or as an ointment, and carmustine (BCNU) (14). 
Both treatments have significant response rates in early stage MF disease, but have 
virtually no effect on extra cutaneous disease or the circulating malignant T-cells in SS 
patients (13). Response to skin directed therapies is often slow with peak response seen 
only after 6-18 months of therapy.
1.1.2 Hypericin
Hypericin is a natural compound found in the stems and petals of plants of the genus 
Hypericum (15-17). HyBryte™ is chemically synthesized hypericin formulated for 
topical application and not extracted from plants. 
Hypericin is an effective virucidal agent that directly inactivates a broad range of viruses, 
including retroviruses (18-23), both as a stand-alone drug (24, 25) and after 
photoactivation (22, 26-29). Based on these promising in vitro virucidal effects, the 
compound was clinically evaluated for its utility in the management of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (30) and hepatitis C infections (31). However, no 
convincing evidence of clinical effectiveness as an antiviral was observed in these studies 
up to toxicity-limited doses, which were exclusively phototoxicity related. 
In addition to its antiviral activity, hypericin has been shown in animal models to 
accumulate selectively in cancer cells up to a ratio of 12:1 cancer to healthy cells (32, 
33). Again, hypericin appears to have tumoricidal effects both as a stand-alone drug (34-
37) and after activation with visible light (15, 38-45). A clinical trial of parenteral 
synthetic hypericin for the treatment of brain gliomas found the drug to be safe and 10 of 
the 41 treated patients were considered treatment responders (46). 
Although the information from these parenteral clinical trials is not directly applicable to 
the evaluation of the topical formulation of synthetic hypericin (HyBryte), the systemic 
doses of the drug were safe and at blood levels many magnitudes higher than expected 
following topical administration. 
The dose-limiting toxicity in the systemic hypericin clinical trials was phototoxicity. The 
existence of this photoactivity, however, forms a basis for considering hypericin as an 
agent in topical phototherapy. In vitro  studies with T-cells showed that hypericin could 
inhibit induced proliferation and near complete apoptosis in malignant CTCL T-cells 
with substantially less effects on normal T-cells similarly treated (47) and induced the 
inhibition of cell proliferation in adult T-cell leukemia cell lines with minimal effect on 
peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes (48).
In general, it appears that the primary mechanism of the light-activated hypericin is 
through a Type II photoreaction. Hypericin localizes in the perinuclear region within the 
endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (50, 51). When activated with visible light in

Amendment 1: 20 April 2022the 500-650 nm range (exact activation wavelengths dependent on the solute used), the 
molecule is converted into a high energy state that transfers the energy to free oxygen 
creating high energy, singlet oxygen, 1O2. This, in turn, leads to a sequence of 
photochemical and photobiological processes generating highly reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), which activate the caspase signaling cascade leading to apoptosis via the 
mitochondrial pathway. Hypericin additionally interacts with a variety of cytosolic 
proteins and lipoproteins. ROS generation also leads to cell necrosis, a cell death pathway 
that may augment its anti-tumor effects through a process of immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) that activates the immune system against the tumor (52).
A Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both CTCL 
and psoriatic lesions after 6 weeks of treatment with HyBryte and treatment was well 
tolerated (49). 
A Phase 3 trial with a short, 6-week course of HyBryte therapy demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement of lesion response as compared to the blinded 
placebo rate as well as further improvement afforded by an additional 6-week cycle of 
open label drug use. At the end of the initial treatment period, there was a statistically 
significant improvement in the response rate among the HyBryte group compared to the 
placebo group (p=0.0416) and this rate dramatically improved with more prolonged 
treatment with increased response rates of 40% with 12 weeks of therapy (p<0.0001) and 
49% with 18 weeks of therapy (p<0.0001). This benefit was similar in patch lesions as 
well as with the thicker, more difficult to treat plaque lesions. Treatment response was 
durable and more durable with extended treatment. HyBryte treatment was well tolerated, 
with a low rate of adverse events (AE). The most prevalent AEs were related to skin 
reactions and application site pain and irritation. The rate of skin/application site 
reactions was significantly lower than has been reported for other skin-directed therapies.
1.2 Pharmacokinetics 
Hypericin was initially developed for the systemic treatment of enveloped viral infections 
including HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and gliomas. Following dosing with either 
intravenous (iv) or oral (po) routes, the only consistently reported AEs were caused by 
phototoxicity, the biologic effect that is being exploited and tightly regulated in the 
topical treatment of CTCL. Minimal blood levels of hypericin were expected to result 
from low dose topical application of the drug. During the Phase 3 trial, serum blood 
levels of systemic hypericin were assessed at the end of the third cycle of therapy (after 
5-6 weeks of continuous therapy on multiple lesions). Specific serum blood samples were 
taken approximately 24 hours after the application of the drug, the time when the 
maximal skin effects were seen. Systemic hypericin was not detected in the blood, 
indicating levels were <5 ng/mL (lower limit of detection of the bioanalytical method). 
This study is designed to expand the information about the systemic absorption of 
hypericin after topical application. Since the systemic levels of hypericin following 
topical administration were expected to be orders of magnitude lower than that following 
iv or po administration in which there was no evidence of electrocardiogram (ECG)

the more sensitive assay) and allow contemporaneous assessment of ECG readings.
1.3 Systemic Hypericin Pharmacokinetics
The PK and safety margin afforded by topical application of HyBryte is best understood 
in the context of PK results obtained in studies of well tolerated systemic hypericin (po or 
iv administration) as shown in Table 1. With blood levels uniformly determined to be <5 
ng/ml after continuous hypericin use in the Phase 3 study, comparison to the well-
tolerated po and iv dosing suggest a safety margin 6-1280 fold.

Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 20.
1.4.1 Dosing Regimen
HyBryte ointment will be applied to all accessible CTCL lesions by the patients 
following training by the site staff. Care will be taken to minimize application to other 
skin areas, and cover the treated area with opaque bandaging/clothing. The lesions will 
then be exposed to visible light using the Daavlin Series 7 Phototherapy Device with 
visible light lamps (FDA 510K approval K212510) 18-24 hours later starting at 5 J/cm2 
and titrated up until the treated lesions exhibit a mild erythema following the light 
session. Drug application/light session will be done twice a week (at least 2 calendar days 
apart) for 8 weeks. The light treatment will be performed at least 2 calendar days apart 
each week.  Light treatment is not permitted on consecutive days.

3.2 Secondary
Routine safety laboratory investigations and vitals will be obtained at baseline prior to 
drug application, at Week 8, Session 2 Light Session visit prior to light therapy and 2 
weeks after the completion of therapy (Week 10 follow-up visit/End of Study). 
4 STUDY PLAN
4.1 Study Design
This study is an observational, Phase 2a trial. Patients will receive treatments twice a 
week consisting of drug application followed 18-24 hours later with a light session (using 
Daavlin Series 7 Phototherapy Device with visible light lamps) for 8 weeks (up to 16 
total treatments). The light treatment will be performed at least 2 calendar days apart each 
week. Light treatment is not permitted on consecutive days. Blood samples for evaluation 
of serum hypericin concentration will be obtained at baseline, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, 
and 2 weeks after the last light session (Week 10/End of Study), and ECGs will be 
obtained at baseline, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, and the Week 10 follow-up visit. Safety 
laboratory tests and vital signs will be obtained at baseline, at the end of treatment (Week 
8), and at the end of the 2-week follow-up period (Week 10/End of Study).

Amendment 1: 20 April 20225.3.6 Week 6, Session 2
18-24 hours prior to the scheduled light session, the patient will be instructed to apply 
study drug to all accessible lesions. At that visit the following will be performed:
The patients will complete an VAS itch form and the data transcribed into the eCRF. 
Prior to the light session, 5 mL of blood obtained and processed for serum hypericin 
levels.
Prior to the light session, a 12-lead ECG obtained including QT interval measurements.
Adequate application of the drug will be verified by a pink staining on visual inspection 
of lesions.
Each patient will bring in their jar of study drug to the clinic. The jar will be weighed by 
clinic staff in order to estimate the amount of drug applied.
5-10 minutes before  the light session, lesions will be graded using the Erythema Grading 
Score.
The light duration for the session to deliver the target dose of light determined by the 
Erythema Score of the previous treatment response of light will be calculated. 
Patients will undergo the light treatment (may require repositioning to assure that all 
lesions are being treated).
5-10 minutes after completion of the light session, lesions will be graded using the 
Erythema Grading Score. If the score is <1, the next light dose should be increased. If the 
Erythema score is 1, the subsequent dose should be held at the same dose. If the score is 
>1, the next dose should be lowered by at least 1 J/cm2.
Patients will be asked about any AEs experienced since the last light session and these 
will be recorded in the eCRF. Information on all unresolved, previously reported AEs 
will be obtained.

5.4 Premature Discontinuation
Patients have the right to withdraw from this trial at any time (as described in the 
informed consent document) without prejudice to further care. An investigator may 
withdraw a patient from the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 
•The patient withdraws his/her consent or refuses follow-up evaluations. 
•The patient is lost to follow-up and will not attend further study visits.
•The investigator determines that further participation would be detrimental to the 
patient’s health or well-being.
•The patient fails to comply with the study requirements so as to cause harm to self 
or seriously interfere with the validity of the study results.
•The female patient becomes pregnant during the treatment period. In this case, 
treatment should be halted and the patient followed until the end of the pregnancy. 
If a child is born, the infant should be followed through at least 6 months of age.
•At the discretion of the site investigator if he/she feels that it is in the best 
medical interest of the patient.
Patients withdrawn from the study will have as many of the trial assessments completed 
as the patient permits including blood tests and lesion evaluations.
Patients withdrawn from the study may be replaced up to a total of 8 subjects provided 
that both the PI and the Soligenix Medical Monitor agree that the reasons for withdrawal 
do not suggest a change in the risk assessment of the HyBryte therapy.
6 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURES
Subjects will have the following procedures performed.
6.1 Light Session
The amount of visible light to be delivered will start at 5 J/cm2 and be titrated up until 
either the patient experiences a mild (Erythema Grade 1) response to the light treatment 
5-10 minutes post-treatment or a dose of 25 J/cm2 is reached, whichever occurs first. The

Vital signs will be obtained by site personnel at baseline, Week 8, Session 2 Light 
Session visit prior to the light session and during the Week 10/End of Study follow-up 
visit. Vital signs obtained will consist of:
•Resting Blood Pressure

6.6 Quality of Life Assessments
The Skindex-29, a self-administered survey instrument to measure the effects of skin 
disease on patients’ quality of life will be administered at baseline and at Week 8 Session 
2 Light Session visit (Appendix III). Patients will complete the form on their own and site 
personnel will review and assure that the form is complete.
6.7 VAS Itch Assessment
The Visual Analog Score for Itch (VAS itch) is a patient reported outcome measurement of 
the degree of itchiness that the patient has experienced over the preceding 24 hours and 
will be administered at baseline, each light treatment, and the Week 10/End of Study 
visit. Patients will be instructed to place a vertical mark on a 10 cm line with a 0 (none) at 
the right side and a 10 (the worst itch you can imagine) at the left indicating the amount 
of itch that they have experienced over the preceding day. The score will be recorded as 
the distance in centimeters (to 1 decimal place) between the 0 mark and the vertical line 
that the patient drew. 
6.8 Composite Assessment of Index Lesions Severity (CAILS) Score
The CAILS score will be assessed for the prospectively identified representative lesions 
at baseline and at the Week 10/End of Study visit. CAILS score will be calculated by 
assessing the erythema (Table 5), scaling (Table 6), plaque elevation (Table 7) and 
involved surface area (Table 8) for each of the index lesions. Each of the assessments and 
the total score for each evaluated lesion will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). 
The total CAILS score will be calculated by adding the scores of all evaluated lesions 
together.

Amendment 1: 20 April 20228 ADVERSE EVENTS
Timely, accurate and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from trials is 
crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators and the Sponsor, and is mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide. Soligenix has established standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) in conformity with regulatory requirements to ensure appropriate reporting of 
safety information. All trials that are the responsibility of Soligenix must be conducted in 
accordance with the procedures as provided below.
8.1 Definitions
8.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)
Any noxious or unintended event that occurs in association with the use of an 
investigational agent in humans, whether considered related to the investigational agent 
or not. This definition encompasses symptoms or signs reported by the subject or 
detected by the investigator or other competent observer, as well as medically important 
deviations from normality in the results of ancillary investigations. If present at time of 
first dose of study drug, such AEs must be recorded as part of the medical history.
8.1.2 Treatment-Emergent AE 
An AE that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency following entry into the 
study. In addition, any pathological finding on physical examination or diagnostic 
procedure that is new in occurrence or exacerbated in comparison with the subject's status 
at study entry is considered a treatment-emergent AE if it requires any medical or 
surgical intervention whatsoever (including, but not limited to, additional diagnostic 
procedures or alteration of prescribed therapy).
8.1.3 Potentially Serious AE
Any AE that is sufficiently severe or alarming as to require any form of significant 
medical intervention. Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition.
8.2 Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE to the assigned study drug is assessed using the following 
definitions:
•Not Related: The drug experience is clearly related to other factors such as 
the patient’s/subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
drugs.
•Possibly Related: The drug experience follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the

patient’s/subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
drugs.
•Related: The drug experience follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration and follows a known response pattern to the 
study drug, and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
patient’s/subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
drugs.
8.3 Severity of Adverse Event
A clinical determination of the intensity of an AE should be done for all reported AEs. 
The severity assessment for AEs should be completed using the following definitions as 
guidelines:
•Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated.
•Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.
•Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity.
•Not applicable:  In some cases, an AE may be an “all or nothing” finding, 
which cannot be graded.
8.4 Recording Adverse Events
All AEs, whether judged to be related or not to the study drug, should be recorded in both 
the medical record and the CRF. The start and resolution dates, the judgment of the 
severity of the AE, the judgment of the relationship of the AE to the study drug, the 
action taken for subsequent dose of study drug, and the outcome should be noted.

Amendment 1: 20 April 20229 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT
9.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:
Death
Life-threatening
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received HyBryte
Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
events are:
a. Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
b. Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization
c. Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Definition of Terms
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a 
more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that 
resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening 
even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal.
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of 
an AE (eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not 
be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that 
occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the 
usual criteria.
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient

should be considered serious.
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in 
a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life 
functions.
9.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
When the investigator, or trained designee, becomes aware that a serious or potentially 
serious AE (as defined above) has occurred, the site monitor or Medical Monitor must be 
notified immediately (and no later than 24 hours after notification) by telephone, 
regardless of the relationship (or lack thereof) of the AE to study therapy.
All reports of serious or potentially serious AEs must be followed within 24 hours (or 
sooner at the request of the Soligenix Medical Monitor) by the completion of a serious 
AE form signed by the investigator. This should be faxed to the site monitor and/or 
Medical Monitor.
In accordance with Soligenix SOPs and Health Authority regulations, investigators may 
be notified from time to time of the occurrence of serious, unexpected AEs. If such AEs 
are associated with the use of the study drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the 
AE may have been caused by the drug) and are thus deemed significant new AEs or risks 
with respect to the drug, the investigator must promptly inform the relevant Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), in accordance with the ICH Guidance on Good Clinical Practices 
(E6, April 1996).

Amendment 1: 20 April 202211 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
11.1 Institutional Review Board
The final study protocol, including the final version of the Subject Information and 
Consent Forms, must be approved in writing by an IRB that meets the minimum FDA 
standards before enrolment of any subject into the study. The PI or their designee is 
responsible for informing the IRB of any SAE and amendment(s) to the protocol as per 
regulatory requirements.
11.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be performed in accordance with the ethical principles in the Declaration 
of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practices and applicable regulatory requirements. 
11.3 Written Informed Consent
The Investigator will ensure that the subject or a legally authorized representative of the 
subject are given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, 
purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. Subjects must also be notified that they 
are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The subject should be given the 
opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The 
subject’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any 
study specific procedure . The consent form that is used must meet the requirements as 
outlined in the ICH Guidance on GCPs (E6) and must be approved by both the reviewing 
IRB and by Soligenix.
11.4 Subject Data Protection
The Subject Information and Consent Form will explain that study data will be stored in a 
computer database, maintaining confidentiality. Subjects in this database will be 
identified by initials or enrollment code/subject number only. Authorized representatives 
of a regulatory authority (e.g., MCC) may require direct access to parts of the trial site 
records relevant to the study, including subjects’ medical history for data verification 
purposes.
11.5 Financial Disclosure
The FDA has issued regulations (21 CFR Part 54) that require Sponsors (in this case 
Soligenix) to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements to 
certify the absence of certain financial interests of clinical investigators and/or disclose 
those financial interests, as required, when clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in 
support of marketing approval of a new drug application (NDA). These regulations are 
intended to ensure that financial interests and arrangements of clinical investigators, that 
could affect reliability of data submitted to the FDA in support of marketing approval, are 
identified and disclosed by the Sponsor.

Amendment 1: 20 April 2022Clinical investigators shall be asked to disclose proprietary (e.g., patent, licensing 
agreement) and financial (e.g., stock options, royalty) interests as they pertain to 
Soligenix, prior to participating in the study. In addition, clinical investigators will be 
required to consult with Soligenix before acquiring any financial interest in the company 
and must disclose any change in their proprietary or financial interests if it occurs during 
the course of the study and for one year following study completion. Clinical Investigator 
is defined under Title 21 CFR Part 54 as an investigator or sub-investigator listed on the 
FDA Form 1572 that is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research 
subjects. The requirement for proprietary and financial disclosure also includes any 
ownership by the spouse or any dependent child of the investigator.
If the FDA determines that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious 
question about the integrity of the data, the FDA will take any action it deems necessary 
to ensure the reliability of the data, including:
•Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in 
question;
•Requesting that the Sponsor submit further analyses of data, e.g., to evaluate the 
effect of the clinical investigator’s data on overall study outcome;
•Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm 
the results of the questioned study; and/or
•Refusing to treat the covered clinical study as providing data that can be the basis 
for an agency action.
If the Sponsor does not include certification or disclosure, or both, if required, or does not 
certify that it was not possible to obtain the information, the FDA may refuse to file the 
NDA.

informed consent, enrollment criteria, all subject assessments, all AEs and all 
concomitant medications. In addition, study drug and supporting records will be 
reviewed. Additionally, they assure that all serious, life-threatening or fatal AEs are being 
reported immediately [and in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours after the event] to 
the Medical Monitor or designee at Soligenix.
Findings from these reviews will be discussed with the investigator and staff. Completed 
pages of the CRFs will be evaluated at each visit. The dates of the monitoring visits will 
be recorded in a sign-in log that will be kept at the site. The study coordinator and 
investigator are expected to be available for questions, the source documentation readily 
available, and a suitable environment provided for review of study-related documents.
13.1.4 Close-out Visit
The clinical research monitor(s) will perform an end of trial visit to ensure that:
All drug reconciliation forms are accurate and complete.
All unused study drug is returned to the appropriate location.
All data issues are resolved and CRFs are completed and verified.
The IRB has been notified that the study has been completed.
The investigator at each site is aware that the study has been completed and no further 
subjects are enrolled.
13.2 Audits and Inspections
Health Authorities (e.g., FDA), in the person of a trained and properly authorized 
employee, may request access to all study records, including source documents, for

Amendment 1: 20 April 202214 AMENDMENTS
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, 
may be made only by Soligenix, Inc. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is 
notified within 5 days.
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The 
written amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await 
approval before implementing the changes. Soligenix, Inc., will submit protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval.
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Soligenix, Inc., the 
amendment to the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the 
potential risk to the subject and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study 
participant, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar 
modification. In such cases, informed consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the 
study before continued participation.

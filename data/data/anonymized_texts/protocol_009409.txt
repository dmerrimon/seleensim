CONFIDENTIAL  5. INTRODUCTION 
 
It is estimated that dry eye disease affects approximately 33 million people in the United States 
based on an estimated prevalence of 14.5% described in The Beaver Dam Offspring Study, a 
major epidemiological study published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology 
(Paulsen, 2014). Dry eye disease, also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is  characterized by 
several symptoms of ocular discomfort, including but not limited to dry eye sensation, foreign 
body sensation, irritation, burning, tearing, ocular pain, and itching. Subject s with dry eye 
disease may experience significant ocular  discomfort and reduced visual function, thus resulting 
in a decreased quality of life or work productivity.  Current treatment of dry eye disease generally begins with artificial tear replacement and then  expands to include topical anti-
inflammatory thera py and punctal occlusion.  Three anti -inflammatory therapies for dry eye 
disease are currently approved by the FDA, and all are intended to be long- term treatments for 
dry eye disease: cyclosporine ophthalmic solution (Restasis
®, Allergan ; CequaTM, Sun 
Ophthalmics) and lifitegrast (Xiidra®; Shire). Cyclosporine has shown effectiveness in increasing 
tear volume in dry eye patients; however, it is not effective in subjects with punctal plugs or those already being treated with anti -inflammatory ophthalmic solutions ( DEWS Report, 2007), 
it produces adverse reactions in a significant percentage of patients (eg, ocular irritation upon instillation, slow onset of response, and limited efficacy), and it may take several weeks to produce a therapeutic effect and up to 6 months for maximal effectiveness ( Pflugfelder, 2004). 
Lifitegrast inhibits an integrin, lymphocyte function- associated antigen 1 (LFA -1) from binding 
to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM -1), which down- regulates inflammation mediated by 
T lymphocytes; however, the exact mechanism of action of lifitegrast in dry eye disease is not 
known. The most common side effects of lifitegrast reported in 5% to 25% of subjects are 
instillation site irritation, dysgeusia (unusual taste sensation), and reduced visual acuity ( Xiidra 
package insert, 2016).  
Inflammation has a prominent role in the development and proliferation of dry eye disease.  Factors adversely affecting tear film stability and osmolarity can initiate an inflammatory  
cascade that leads to the development of a self -perpetuating inflammatory cycle. Topical 
corticost eroids are used to treat an array of ocular conditions that have an inflammatory 
component and are generally indicated for treatment of steroid -responsive inflammatory 
conditions of the conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment. 
LE is an ester corticostero id that is rapidly metabolized to inactive metabolites  and has been 
reported to have fewer side effects than traditional glucocorticosteroids. LE was approved by 
FDA in 1998 under New Drug Application (NDA) 20-583 (Lotemax®; Bausch & Lomb). 
Lotemax has gai ned wide acceptance by ophthalmologists for use in the treatment of ocular 
inflammation.  
27Mar2019 KPI-121-C-011 (STRIDE 3) 
19 
CONFIDENTIAL  Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KPI) has developed an improved formulation of LE, designated KPI -
121, using a proprietary technology known as Mucus Penetrating Particles ( MPP). MPP 
technology utilizes submicron drug particles formulated to enhance penetration through the 
mucous layer of the tear film. KPI-121 is an aqueous suspension of submicron particles of LE formulated with excipients present in other FDA-approved ophthalmic drug products. Preclinical 
studies have shown improved pharmacokinetics for KPI-121 compared to Lotemax, with 
prolonged drug presence on the ocular surface and increased drug penetration into ocular tissues. This improved pharmacokinetic profile has the potential to reduce dosing strength of LE as 
compared to Lotemax. 
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. intends to develop KPI-121 for the treatment of dry eye disease. In 
previously conducted clinical trials (one phase 2 and two phase 3), the safety profile of K PI-121 
in subjects with dry eye disease was shown to be favorable.  Study KPI-121-C-011 will evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension in subjects with dry eye 
disease. Additional information about KPI-121, including nonclinical pharmacology study 
results, and potential risks and benefits to human subjects, are found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.

CONFIDENTIAL  6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
6.1. Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% 
ophthalmic suspension compared to vehicle in subjects who have a documented clinical 
diagnosis of dry eye disease. 
27Mar2019 KPI-121-C-011 (STRIDE 3)

CONFIDENTIAL  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group 
study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension in 
treating the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.   
This study will include up to 4 clinic visits, including 2 weeks of single-masked vehicle in  Stage 
1 followed by approximately 14 days of investigational product dosing (KPI-121 0.25% 
ophthalmic suspension or vehicle in Stage 2 ).   
Approximately 3200 subjects at approxim ately 80 centers located in the United States (US) will 
be screened at Visit 1 (Screening).  Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at this visit will enter a 14-day Stage 1 period of QID dosing with single masked vehicle.  At Visit 2 (Day 1/Randomization), approximately 900 subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be 
randomized in an approximate 1:1 ratio to either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or 
vehicle dosed QID.  Subjects will be allocated in a n approximate 1:1 ratio at each site.  
Study qualification criteria will be entered into the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for 
stratification at randomization.  Other randomization and stratification allocation criteria will be applied as elaborated in the data management plan.  Randomization numbers will be 
automatically assigned to each subject as they are entered into the IWRS based on stratification 
criteria .  
To minimize bias, investigational product allocation (KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
versus vehicle) will be randomized and masked to the Sponsor, subjects, and the investigative staff with the exception of a dosing coordinator.  The dosing coordinator will be responsible for 
dispensing and retrieving investigational product to/from subjects, instructing subjects regarding dosing of the investigational product, addressing study subjects’ questions regarding 
investigational product, . As a consequence of these 
interactions, the dosing coordinator has the potential for being unmasked to the study treatment 
for each subject.  The randomization schedule will be generated by the randomization statistician 
(who is not on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and limited- access 
location separate from the study Investigator and mem bers of the project team.  
The “study eye” that is used for analyses will be determined according to the algorithm detailed in the final Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Subject s will return at Visit 3 (Days 8 ± 1 day) to  
evaluate ocular discomfort and assess concomitant medication use and adverse events.  Subjects

CONFIDENTIAL  10. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  MATERIALS AND 
MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Investigational product  
KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension contains submicron particles of LE suspended in 
a formulation consisting of excipients that have been used in other FDA-approved 
ophthalmic products.   
KPI-121 0.25% drug product will be supplied as a suspension in opaque dropper bottles.  
KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension is a sterile, aqueous, submicron suspension of LE 
and will be supplied in a 10 mL, white, low-density polyethylene dropper bottle with a 
translucent, controlled-drop linear low-density polyethylene tip, a pink high-density polyethylene cap, and a white, low-density polyethylene, tamper- evident overcap. Each 
bottle contains 8.2 mL (nominal fill) of drug product. 
Subjects randomized to the vehicle control arm will receive the same bottles containing 
all components at the concentration s used in the KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
with the exception of the active component, LE.  
10.2. Investigational product  Packaging and Labeling  
The Stage 1 investigational product will be 1 bottle of single-masked, investigational product (vehicle) from a common site level supply which will be provided to the subject after qualifying for Stage  1.  The bottle labels for the single-masked period contain the 
following information:  Sponsor name, protocol number, lot number, unique identifying number, storage temperature, and required statement(s) per the FDA requirements . 
The randomized investigational product kit will consist of a box containing 2 dropper 
bottles of investigational product. At Day 1, eligible subjects will receive 1 bottle of 
investigational product. The second bottle will be retained at the site and provided to the 
subject in the event the subject needs  additional investigational product during the 
treatment period. The box label and dropper bottle label s will contain  the following 
information: Sponsor name, protocol and kit number, storage temperature, and required statement(s) per the FDA requirements . 
10.3. Investigational product  Storage  
All investigational products will be stored at the site upright in a secure area, with limited 
access , at 15 -25°C/59 - 77°F.

40 
CONFIDENTIAL  10.5. Administration  
At Visits 1 and 2, when subjects receive the first dose in the clinic, that dose will count as 
1 of their 4 (QID) daily doses. Subjects will then self- administer at most 3 additional 
doses of investigational product during the remainder of that day to complete QID 
dosing.  All visits should be scheduled in the morning to allow subjects to receive a full 
day of QID dosing.  Any Stage 1 doses taken on the morning of Visit 2 should be counted 
into the total 4 doses for the day. 
Subjects will be asked to instill 1 dose upon awakening and then 3 subsequent doses 
approximately 4 hours after their previous dose.  The 4 doses will be described as 
“Morning Dose,” “Mid-Morning Dose,” “Afternoon Dose,” and “Evening Dose.”  
10.6. Investigational product  Accountability  
Sponsor study monitors or designees will conduct accountability of investigational product (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  Accountability will be 
ascertained by performing reconciliation between the amount of investigational product 
sent to the site and the amount used and unused at the time of reconciliation.  
Clinical trial materials will be shipped to the investigational sites under sealed conditions.  
Investigational product shipment records will be verified by comparing the shipment 
inventory sheet to the actual quantity of investigational product received at the site.  Accurate records of receipt and disposition of the investigational product (e.g., dates, 
quantity, subject number, dose dispensed, returned) must be maintained by the 
Investigator or his/her designee.   
10.7. Investigati onal product  Handling and Disposal  
At the end of the study, all study materials, including any unused investigational products 
(KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle), as well as original containers (even if 
empty), will be returned to the drug-packaging vendor in accordance with Sponsor or designee’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), following approval by the Sponsor. 
All returns of investigational product will be documented.  The study monitor or designee 
will verify investigational product accountability.  All investigational product accounting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete.

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Adverse Reaction (AR): any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR):  

27Mar2019 KPI-121-C-011 (STRIDE 3) 
43 
CONFIDENTIAL  Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable pos sibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Unexpected:  An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.   
Life-threatening: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject  or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction 
occurring at any dose that:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening. 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Requires in  subject  hospitalization.  
• Prolongs in subject  hospitalization. 
• Is a con genital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
A NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE that does not meet the definitions for 
SAEs as described above.  
Each  AE will be classified as  SERIOUS or NON- SERIOUS using the definitions 
provided above. 
12.3. Relationship to Investigational product  
The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as  MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator  will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use of 
investigational product (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE will 
be assessed using the following definitions : 
27Mar2019 KPI-121-C-011 (STRIDE 3) 
44 
CONFIDENTIAL  Unrelated:   
• Event occurring before dosing. 
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational 
product use.  
Unlikely:   
• Poor temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Event easily explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
Possibly : 
• Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
• Event could be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
Probably: 
• Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
• Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known pharmacology. 
• Event cannot easily be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
Definitely : 
• Distinct temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known pharmacology. 
• Event cannot be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
AEs will be monitored throughout the study (from the time of ICF signature through Visit 
4) and will be recorded on the eCRF with the date and time of onset, date and time of 
resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of investigational product), 
treatment required, and the outcome.   
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used 
as the initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial.  For example: 
How have you felt since your last assessment? 
Have you had any health problems since your last assessment? 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by 
the Principal Investigator after careful medical consideration and categorized as unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite. 
27Mar2019 KPI-121-C-011 (STRIDE 3) 
45 
CONFIDENTIAL  If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
If a non -SAE is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made 
to follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is l ost to follow -up, or there 
is some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to 
follow SAEs to resolution. 
12.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
It is the responsibility of the Investigators or their designees to report any event of this 
nature to the Sponsor or a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or their staffs’ attention.  It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to 
report all SAEs reported at their site to their Institutional Review Board (IRB), as 
required.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow all SAEs to resolution.   
The following information should be provided when an SAE is reported to the Sponsor or 
designee:

9. Criteria for classifying the event as serious, including whether the SAE:   
o Resulted in death. 
o Was life- threatening  
o Required inpatient hospitalization.  
o Prolonged inpatient hospitalization.  
o Resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions . 
o Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
o Important medical events that may not result in death, were not life -
threatening, or did not require hospitalization may be considered serious 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject  or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in subject  hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.

 CONFIDENTIAL   APPENDIX 5: UNANESTHETIZED SCHIRMER TEST EVALUATION  
Unanesthetized Schirmer Test evaluation will be conducted at Visit 1 (Screening).  Identical 
Schirmer Test strips will be supplied to each site.  When conducting assessments room 
temperature and humidity should be relatively consistent throughout each visit and throughout 
the study.  Please make certain to allow at least 20 minutes between any corneal staining 
evaluations and the unanesthetiz ed Schirmer Test.  
Unanesthetized Schirmer Test  
• While still in the plastic sheath, fold the rounded end of the unanesthetized Schirmer Test strip at the first line on the strip (closest to the rounded end). Additionally, fold a partial 
second fold at the halfway point of the strip so that the strip does not lie directly in the subject’s line of sight.
 
• Remove the right eye strip from the sheath. 
• Ask the subject to look up and gently draw the right lower lid in a downward and temporal direction. 
 
• Place the ro unded end of the strip toward the temporal one-third of the lower eyelid.  
• Repeat this procedure in the left eye. 
• Darken the room, but ensure that the Large E or the ETDRS chart is visible. 
• Instruct the subject to relax and look at the chart while blinking normally or have subject gently close eyes.
 
• Strips are removed after 5 minutes. 
• After removing the strips, with a pen  draw a horizontal line across the leading edge of 
moisture and a second horizontal line across the lowest point of moisture. 
• Using a ruler and/or the millimeters recorded on the strips, measure a point halfway 
between the 2 lines and record this as the amount of wetting. 
• Retain Schirmer strips in source documentation.

 CONFIDENTIAL   APPENDIX 6: BEST-CORRECTED VISUAL ACUITY  
BCVA will be conducted at Vis its 1, 2, and 4.   
Visual acuity testing should precede any examination requiring contact with the eye or 
instillation of study dyes.  LogMAR visual acuity must be assessed using an ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart.  Visual acuity testing should be performed with best correction using subject’s 
own corrective lenses (spectacles only) or pinhole refraction.  
An ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart may be used.  If a Lighthouse chart is used (24.5” by 25”; 
either reflectance or retro -illuminated), the subject must view the chart from a distance of exactly 
4 meters (13.1 feet).  If smaller reproductions (18” by 18”, e.g., Prevent Blindness) are used, the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet.  Reflectance wall charts should be frontally illuminated (60 -watt bulb or a well- lit room).  
The subject should be positioned according to the elevation of the chart (either seated or standing) so that the chart is at a comfortable viewing angle.  The right eye should be tested first.  The subject should attempt to read each letter, line-by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 at 
the top of the chart.  The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers.  If the 
subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter instead of the number.  The subject should be asked to read 
slowly, about 1 letter per second, to achieve the best identification of each letter.  He/she is not to 
proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response.  If the subject changes a response before he has read aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted. 
Maxi mum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart encouraging the subject to 
guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, the examiner 
should stop the test.  The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. 
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during 
the study, consistently use the same lighting conditions during the entire study.  
Calculations : logMAR VA = Baseline value + (n X 0.02) 
where:  the baseline value is the logMAR number of the last line read (at least 1 letter read 
correctly in this line), and 
“n” is the total number of letters missed up to and including the last line read, and   
“0.02” is the value for each letter

 CONFIDENTIAL   APPENDIX 8:  CORNEAL FLUORESCEIN STAINING  
Corneal staining will be performed at Visit 1, 2, and 4.  Corneal staining assessment will be 
performed for both eyes using methods developed by the NEI Dry Eye Workshop5,6with separate 
strips used for each eye.  
Evaluation Technique  
1. Use a Wratten #12 barrier filter in the assessment of fluorescein staining to enhance the 
appearance of the fluorescein.  
2. Use sufficient unpreserved saline solution (study stock) to wet the entire area of fluorescein impregnation on a 1.0 mg strip.  If the strip becomes too saturated, please 
discard and begin again with a new strip. 
3. Within 15 seconds of wetting the strip, taking care not to touch the strip to the eye, instill 
the fluorescein sodium on the inferior palpebral conjunctiva. 
4. Instruct the subject to blink several times to distribute the fluorescein staining.  
5. Examine the cornea 2 minutes after instillation of fluorescein  
6. Use a cobalt blue illumination (465 nm to 490 nm) and a 3- mm-wide scanning beam in 
each eye.  
7. Compare corneal fluorescein staining in each eye with the standard by scoring each of the 5 corneal sections as described below:  
Scoring system  
1. Grade each of 5 sections of cornea (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal, central) 
2. Provide grades for each of the 5 sections: 
a. Grade by NEI scale (definition below) as 0, 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe)  
3. Total score is obtained by summing each of the 5 sections of the cornea 
a. NEI score will be from 0 -15 
4. Definitions  
a. NEI Scoring System (0, 1, 2, 3) 
i. Grade 0  
No visible staining within the section of cornea being evaluated 
ii. Grade 1  MILD  
Small amount of micropunctate staining within the section of cornea being 
evaluated  
iii. Grade 2  MODERATE  
Medium amount of micropunctate staining within the section of cornea 
being evaluated or mild amount of macropunctate stain

 CONFIDENTIAL   APPENDIX 10: DILATED OPHTHALMOSCOPY  
Dilated ophthalmoscopy will include assessment of the optic nerve head for pallor and cupping 
(cup to disc ratio) and will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 4 after the 
administration of all other study assessments (except for symptom assessments).  After the 
ophthalmoscopy procedure, the Investigator wil l determine if findings are within normal limits 
or are abnormal.  For abnormal findings at Visit 1 (Screening) , the Investigator will determine 
whether or not the abnormality would exclude subject from study participation.

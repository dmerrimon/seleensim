2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 HTLV -1 Infection  
 
Human T -cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV -1) is a delta retrovirus [1].  It is closely related to 
simian T -cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV -1) and phylogenetic trees show that STLV -1 and 
HTLV -1 strains are intermingled [2]. A somewhat more distantly related virus, with 60% 
nucleotide sequence homology to HTLV -1, is HTLV -2.  These infections can be distinguished by 
differences in antibody reactivity to recombinant proteins or by polymerase chain reaction assays.  
HTLV -1 infections are prevalent in southern Japan, the Caribbean, and many parts of Central and 
South America, the Middle East, and Africa, where 10 -15% of the population is infected [1, 3] .  In 
the United States, 0.25% of volunteer blood donors are infected with HTLV -1 or HTLV -2.  
Infections by both viru ses are not unusual among intravenous drug abusers.  HTLV -2 is endemic 
in native North, Central, and South American populations.  The HTLV -1 genome includes gag, 
pro, pol, and env genes, encoding the inner capsid of the virion, the viral protease, the vira l reverse 
transcriptase and integrase enzymes, and the glycoprotein on the virion surface necessary for viral 
entry [4]. Regulatory proteins include Tax, a potent transcriptional trans -activator, and Rex, a 
mediator of nuclear export of viral RNAs.  Accessory genes encode proteins designated, p12, p13, 
p27, p30, and HBZ whose functions remain to be fully characterized.   
 
There is considerable evidence that the Tax protein is critically important for the leukemogenic 
activity of the virus [5, 6] . Although most viral genes are not expressed in ATLL samples, Tax 
expression is usually detectable, although often at very low levels. Tax together with Ras is capable 
of transforming rodent fibroblasts, and when expressed in a retrovirus of Herpes samirii  vector is 
capable of immortalizing human lymphocytes. Constitutive Tax expression in transgenic mice 
results in several different types of malignancies, whereas expression in the lymphoid 
compartment of a transgenic mouse results in a lymphoproliferative malignancy. Tax  functions at 
transcriptional and post -transcriptional steps. Tax upregulates several transcriptional pathways to

 enhance the expression of the viral promoter as well as several interleukins and their receptors 
(e.g. IL2, IL2Rα, IL15, IL15Rα), cytokines (e .g. IFNγ, GM -CSF), adhesion molecules (e.g. 
ICAM -1, VCAM -1, VLA -4), growth promoting factors (e.g. c -myc, c -sis, c -fos, egr -1, cyclin D2, 
and E2F -1), and apoptosis inhibiting factors (e.g. bcl xL, A20). Moreover, Tax can directly bind 
and enhance or inhibi t the activity of several growth promoting (e.g. cyclins D2 and D3, E2F) or 
inhibiting factors (e.g. p15, p16, and p53 tumor suppressor proteins and cell cycle checkpoint 
protein MAD1), respectively. In addition Tax promotes the phosphorylation and inactiv ation of 
the p53 tumor suppressor protein.  
 
 
Figure 1. ATLL Classification  
 
 
 
 
Recent findings implicate HBZ as a maintenance factor in ATLL [7]. HBZ is ubiquitously 
expressed in ATLL cells and HTLV -1 infected cells in vivo . Moreover, HBZ promotes 
proliferation of HTLV -1 infected  cells. Interactions between Tax and HBZ on HTLV -1 infected 
cells are complex, and in some cases opposite. For example, Tax activates the AP -1, NFAT, and 

NCI Protocol #: 9925

8 
 CREB pathways, whereas HBZ suppresses them. Conversely, Tax inhibits TGFbeta signaling, 
whereas HBZ ac tivates it. Tax activates both the canonical and non -canonical NFkB pathways, 
whereas HBZ inhibits only the canonical NFkB pathway. Tax promotes cell proliferation but also 
induces cellular senescence by induction of p21 and p27, whereas HBZ prevents senes cence by 
inhibiting p65. Lastly, HBZ suppresses the canonical Wnt pathway, but enhances the non -
canonical pathway, suggesting that HBZ modulates the intra -cellular environment of peripheral T 
cells targeted by the virus.  
 
2.1.1 HTLV -1 Associated Adult T -Cell Leu kemia Lymphoma  
 
Although HTLV -2 is not clearly associated with a clinical disorder, HTLV -1 is closely associated 
with two clinical disorders [1]. About 5% of HTLV -1 infected individuals eventually develop a 
form of myelopathy known as HTLV -1 myelopathy (HAM) or tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). 
It is characterized by lower limb spasticity, bowel and bladder disturbances, and slow but steady 
progression over several years. HTLV -1 has also been associated with other inflammatory clinical 
conditions, including uveitis, arthropathy, myopathy, pneumopathy, and a Sjogren’s disease -like 
syndrome [8]. Some investigators have suggested that these disorders are related to high virus load, 
overstimulation of dendritic cells , resulting in chronic production of high levels of type 1 
interferons and interferon -stimulated gene expression.  
 
About 5% of HTLV -1 infected individuals develop a T -cell non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma designated 
adult T -cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL). It occurs almost exclusively in individuals who acquired 
HTLV -1 as a result of breast feeding, although four or five decades are generally required before 
development of disease. ATLL is characterized by frequent blood and bone marrow involvement, 
hypercalcemia, and  lytic bone lesions. It is most commonly a CD4+ leukemia/lymphoma, although 
occasional examples of CD8+ lymphoma have been described. ATLL may fit into a variety of 
pathological subtypes as classified by the International Working Party Formulation. Clinica l 
classifications of ATLL have included a “smoldering” disorder characterized by rash and minimal 
blood involvement, as well as a chronic form of ATLL, which have median survivals of two years 
or more ( Fig 1) [9]. In contrast, a “lymphomatous” form of ATLL and an “acute” form of ATLL 
have median survivals of 3 -6 months.  
 
2.1.2 HTLV -1 Proviral DNA and Cell -Associated and Virion RNA Load and Protein 
Expression  
 
Assays of HTLV -1 proviral DNA load using PCR techniques have been developed and applied to 
clinical samples. These studies demonstrated levels of about 0.02 copies/PBMC in asymptomatic 
individuals and 0.08 copies/PBMC in HAM patients [10]. RT-PCR assays of cell -associated viral 
and virion RNA have been developed and used to demonstrate that the majority of infected cells 
do not express viral products [11]. However, quantitative data on transcript levels has not been 
obtained with clinical samples.  
 
2.1.3 HTLV -1 Clonality  
 
In ATLL, there is a clonal expansion of T cells with clonal T -cell receptor gene rearrangements 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
9 
 and clonal sites of provirus integration into chromosomal DNA, as determined by Southern blot 
hybridization [12]. More recently, a ligation mediated PCR technique has been utilized as a more 
sensitive way to detect different clonal populations in asymptomatic infected individuals, HAM 
patients , and ATLL patients [13]. These studies have demonstrated that the expanded clone of 
malignant ATLL has arisen from an oligoclonal expansion of HTLV -1 infected cells. These studies 
suggest that HTLV -1 dissemination can occur by viral replication and clonal expans ion of infected 
cells.  
 
A recent study examined the genomic characteristics of the integration sites in 197 ATL cases 
[14]. In 91% of cases, a single predominant provirus was present; in 11% of the total 2 proviruses 
were present in a single tumor clone. In 9% of cases, no significant difference in the abun dance of 
two integration sites was seen. A complete provirus was present in 46% of cases, 39% of cases 
contained a defective provirus, 7% contained a nonsense mutation of the tax gene, and 8% 
contained a hypermethylated promoter in the 5’LTR. The host geno mic characteristics of the 
integration site in the large ATL clones closely resembled those of low -abundance clones present 
in subjects with nonmalignant HTLV -1 infection. These authors concluded that the major 
determinant of the risk of ATL is the absolut e number of clones, i.e. the larger the number, the 
greater the chance of malignant transformation. They also suggested that the number of HTLV -1 
infected clones present in an individual during chronic infection is determined chiefly by the 
efficiency of t he host’s CTL response to the virus.  
 
Recently, whole genome/exome and RNA seq was performed on 50 paired ATL samples [15]. The 
mutation rate of 89 (44 -227) per samples was found, significantly higher than in acute myeloid 
leukemia (7.3 -13) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (11.5). In addition to previously reported 
targets of  mutation (p53, TCF8, and Fas), and known targets frequently mutated in other lymphoid 
malignancies (CARD11, GATA3, IRF4,  POT1, and RHOA), they identified recurrent mutations 
in genes involved in T -cell development, activation and migration, VEGF and WNT s ignaling, 
immunosurveillance, and transcriptional regulation. Although Tax itself underwent gene silencing 
in most cases, alternative oncogenic mechanisms result in acquisition of somatic mutations or copy 
number alterations in Tax -related pathways.   
 
2.1.4 Apoptosis Markers in HTLV -1 Infected Cells  
 
HTLV -1 infected cells are resistant to inducers of apoptosis. This may be a result of Tax 
inactivation of the p53 gene, or up -regulation of apoptosis inhibitor A20 or bcl -XL [5, 6] . Arsenic 
trioxide and Interferon Alpha -2a have been used to induce apoptosis in HTLV -1 infected T -cell 
lines [16]. 
 
2.1.5 Treatment of HTLV -1 Associated non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  
 
Various chemotherapy regimens have been utilized to treat patients with ATLL with complete 
response rates of only about 30%, which are not durable [17-20]. In a large cooperative study in 
Japan, 4 -year survival of patients with acute or lymphomatous forms of ATLL was only 4%. There 
is no standard therapy recommendation for smoldering or chronic  forms of ATLL, and generally 
no therapy is recommended. Therapy recommendations are provided in Table 1 of ref 19, provided

Two reports describe major response rates of 58% and 100%, respectively, in the acute form of 
ATLL, with the use of a combination of zidovudine and Interferon Alpha -2a [21, 22] . However, 
other investigators reported lower response rates with this approach [23]. One group reported an 
81% response rate with the use of interferon and zidovudine with concurrent chemotherapy in 73 
patients with aggressive ATLL [24]. Other approaches have included the use of antibodies to 
IL2Rα with or without conjugates to radioisotopes, or the use of an IL2 -diptheria toxin product 
[25].

 A phase II trial of aurora kinase inhibitor MLN8237 (alisert ib) is underway in PTCL, including 
ATLL. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) Also, a randomized phase 3 study of alisertib in patients with 
relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is underway.  
 
Mogamulizumab, or KW -0761, is a defucosylated humanized monoclonal antibody against CCR4. 
A phase II study of Mogamulizumab in CCR4 -positive relapsed ATLL, given at 1.0 mg/kg/wk x 
8, showed a response rate of 50% [26]. The most common adverse reactions were lymphopenia 
(96%), neutropenia (52%), thrombocytopenia (52%), acute infusion reaction (89%), and skin 
eruption (63%). A phase I/II trial in relapsed or refractory PTCL showed a response rate of 42%. 
Global phase I I trials of mogamulizumab are underway for relapsed/refractory ATLL and PTCL. 
A randomized phase II study of mogamulizumab plus VCAP -AMP -VECP (mLSG15) versus 
mLSG15 alone for newly diagnosed aggressive ATLL was recently presented [27]. Patients 
received 4 courses of chemotherapy with 8 courses of mogamulizumab. Complete response rates 
were 52% in patients treated with mogamulizumab plus chemotherapy compared to 33% in those 
treated with chemotherapy a lone. Median overall survival was not reached, although length of 
follow up was not described. The most common treatment -related toxicities were neutropenia 
(100% vs 96%), thrombocytopenia (100% vs 90%), leukopenia (100% vs 92%), and febrile 
neutropenia (9 0% vs 88%).    
 
Experience with mLSG15 is limited outside of Japan as several components are unavailable.  
Additionally, the rates of myelosuppression and febrile neutropenia are very high [28]. Moreover, 
it is not clear that LSG15 is superio r to other combination chemotherapy regimens used for 
lymphoma treatment. Experience with DA -EPOCH infusional chemotherapy in two US multi -
investigator trials of ATLL, as well as its use in HIV -associated lymphomas, Burkitt lymphomas, 
and relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphomas suggests this is an appropriate chemotherapy regimen 
for use in aggressive ATLL. In a study of 19 patients treated with EPOCH (not dose -adjusted, 
using 750mg/m2 cyclophosphamide) followed by zidovudine, lamivudine, and alpha interfer on 2a, 
4 patients came off study before completion of 2 cycles of therapy due to toxicity, 3 patients had 
progressive disease, and 12 patients had responses (including 2 CRs; 67% ORR; 11% CR) [29]. 
In our ongoing trial of aggressive ATLL, treated with DA -EPOCH (375 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide 
starting dose, all myelosuppressive drugs dose increased or decreased each cycle) combined with 
bortezomib and r altegravir, two subjects achieved complete remission lasting for >12 mos, 10 
subjects had a partial remission, and 3 subjects had stable disease as their best response.  
 
2.1.6 Antiviral Therapy for HTLV -1 Infection  
 
Although the AZT/Interferon Alpha -2a combinat ion was used in ATLL patients, it is unclear 
whether this combination had antiviral, antitumor, and/or immunomodulatory activity towards 
HTLV -1. A report of the use of lamivudine in 5 HAM patients suggested antiviral activity, as 
demonstrated by a 1 log me dian decrease in virus load [30]. This was associated with clinical 
improvement in one patient. Use of anti -retroviral agents has recently been shown to decrease 
HTLV -1 provira l DNA [31].  Our studies have examined various diketone integrase inhibitors for 
HTLV -1 infection [32]. We foun d that raltegravir inhibited HTLV -1 replication with IC50 of 35 
nM.

Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
12 
 In addition to direct anti -viral effects, viral suppression may be necessary in the treatment of 
cancer.  We demonstrated this in our recent phase II clinical trial of infusional chemoth erapy with 
etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, daily prednisone, and bolus cyclophosphamide (EPOCH) 
given for two to six cycles until maximal clinical response, and followed by antiviral therapy with 
daily zidovudine, lamivudine, and alpha interferon -2a for up to one year. Seven patients were on 
study for less than one month due to progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity. Eleven patients 
achieved an objective response with median duration of response of thirteen months, and two 
complete remissions . During chemotherapy induction, viral RNA expression increased (median 
190-fold), and virus replication occurred, coincident with development of disease progression.  
Thus, while EPOCH chemotherapy followed by antiretroviral therapy is an active therapeut ic 
regimen for adult T -cell leukemia -lymphoma, viral reactivation during induction chemotherapy 
may contribute to treatment failure. Alternative therapies are sorely needed in this disease that 
simultaneously prevent virus expression, and are cytocidal for  malignant cells.  
 
2.1.7 HTLV -1 Immune Responses  
 
Although the HTLV -I-specific antibody titer is high in infected individuals, antibody surveillance 
is thought to be largely ineffective [33]. Similarly, there is little evidence that natural killer cells 
play an important role in controlling HTLV -1 infection. CD56+CD3 - NK cells have no detectable 
lytic activity against HTLV -1 infected target cells. This is consistent with the finding that HTLV -
1, unlike other viruses, does not down -modulate inhibitory NK li gands or upregulate activating 
ligands. In addition, MHC class I expression is not down regulated in primary HTLV -1-infected 
cells. Lastly, ligands for NK cell activating receptors are not expressed by HTLV -1 infected cells.  
 
In contrast, there is compell ing evidence that the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response 
is an important determinant of the outcome of HTLV -1 infection [33]. There is a strong association 
between certain human leukocyte antigens alleles and the outcome of infections. HTLV -1 is 
genetically stable, and while viral variants that can escape CTLs do oc cur, there is little evidence 
that these variants have a net selective advantage in patients. It has been possible to rank HTLV -1 
proteins by whether binding their peptides was associated with a reduced viral load. Thus, protein 
targets associated with red uced proviral load include Gag, Pol, and HBZ, whereas, Env, is least 
associated. The Tax protein is intermediate in this rank order list.  
 
Although, CTLs are frequently chronically activated and have immediate effector function ex vivo, 
HTLV -1 is rarely, if ever, cleared. Several explanations have been offered for the lack of 
immunogenicity of infected cells. First, HBZ interacts with cellular factors to suppress Tax -
mediated transactivation, thereby inhibiting expression of HTLV -1 genes. In addition, HBZ has 
been shown to inhibit IFN -gamma production, enhance sensitivity to TGFbeta, and enhance the 
expression of the regulatory transcription factor Fox P3, critical for Treg cells. Second, the HTLV -
1 provirus acquires mutations which prevent expression of vi ral proteins. Third, ATL cells often 
have a hypermethylated or deleted 5’LTR, thus preventing transcription of genes on the forward 
strand.  
 
Histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproate, activates Tax and Gag expression, enhances CTL activity, 
and results in reduced proviral load [33]. Other recent data suggest that HTLV -1 spe cific CTLs 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
13 
 can be induced in patients with aggressive types of ATLL, and that these CTLs can contribute to 
treatment and inhibit relapse [34].  
 
2.1.8 Immune Check Poi nt Blockade  
 
Tumors are able to evade detection and destruction by the immune system, despite the fact that 
many tumors appear to elicit a strong immune response that is evident in lymphocyte infiltrates of 
the primary lesion. Tumor immune evasion can be d ivided into 2 main mechanisms: 1) the 
induction of immune tolerance and 2) resistance to killing by activated immune effector cells [35]. 
The concept of ‘‘immunoediting’’ relates to the manner in which tumors manipulate their 
microenvironment through tumor -derived cytokines, chemokines, and other soluble factors [36]. 
By the time tumors have become clinically detectable, they have already evolved mechanisms to 
evade immune response m ounted by the host that must be overcome to create effective and durable 
antitumor immunity.  
 
Antigen -induced activation and proliferation of T cells are regulated by the temporal expression 
and binding of both co -stimulatory and co -inhibitory receptors. T he signaling through these 
receptors in adaptive cellular immunity modulates the initiation, escalation, and subsequent 
resolution of host immune responses. In the absence of co -inhibitory signaling, persistent T cell 
activation can lead to excessive tissu e damage in the setting of infection as well as autoimmunity. 
In the context of cancer immunology, in which immune responses are directed against antigens 
specifically or selectively expressed by cancer cells, these immune checkpoints can represent 
major o bstacles to overcoming tumor -specific tolerance and generating clinically meaningful 
tumor control. Therefore, efforts have been made in the clinical arena to investigate blockade of 
immune checkpoints as novel therapeutic approaches to tumors which may ex ploit several distinct 
pathways to actively evade immune destruction, including endogenous “immune checkpoints” that 
normally terminate immune responses after antigen activation.  
 
These observations have resulted in intensive efforts to develop immunothera peutic approaches 
for cancer, including immune -checkpoint -pathway inhibitors such as anti –CTLA -4 antibody 
(ipilimumab) and anti -PD1 antibody (nivolumab).  
 
2.2 Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab (BMS -936558, MDX -1106, and ONO -4538) is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody (HuMAb) that is specific for human programmed death -1 
(PD-1, cluster of differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor (Investigator 
Brochure, 2014). PD -1 is a negative regulatory molecule that is expressed transiently follo wing T -
cell activation and on chronically stimulated T cells characterized by an “exhausted” phenotype. 
Nivolumab binds to cynomolgus monkey PD -1 but not mouse, rat, or rabbit molecules. Clinical 
activity of nivolumab has been observed in patients with mel anoma, non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  
 
The clinical use of monoclonal antibodies to T -cell inhibitory receptors has provided 
transformative information on the nature of the immune system and cancer. An emerging picture 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
14 
 suggests that endogenous immune responses can mediate effective tumor regres sion and/or 
improved survival even in patients with large volume tumors resistant to other forms of therapy. 
Some of the unique features of this type of therapy, based largely on experience in advanced 
melanoma, include: improved overall survival (OS) with  or without radiographic responses or 
improved progression -free survival (PFS); responses that may be delayed or occur after 
radiographic disease progression; combinations of immune modulators with enhanced or novel 
activities (in the example of ipilimumab  and nivolumab); and toxicity that is almost exclusively 
immune or inflammatory in nature. It is not yet clear what factors determine responses and which 
components of the immune system are needed for this to occur. It seems likely that both memory 
helper and effector cells would be needed to sustain long -term responses. Increasing emphasis has 
been placed on understanding the relationships of the tumor, cellular infiltrate, and immunologic 
milieu surrounding each tumor.  
 
PD-1, a 55 -kDa type 1 transmembrane  protein, is a member of the CD28 family of T -cell co -
stimulatory receptors that include Ig super family member CD28, CTLA -4, inducible co -stimulator 
(ICOS), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) (Investigator Brochure, 2014). PD -1 is 
transiently but hi ghly expressed on activated T cells functioning to limit immune effectors at the 
site of activation. Chronic stimulation may prevent methylation of the PD -1 gene leading to 
continuous expression and characterizes a state of “exhausted” T cells that lose fu nction and 
proliferative capacity while enhancing a suppressive tumor microenvironment. PD -1 may act 
together with other T -cell modulating molecules, including CTLA -4, TIM -3, lymphocyte -
activation gene 3 (LAG -3) as well as indoleamine -pyrrole 2,3 -dioxygena se 1 (IDO -1), cytokines, 
and transforming growth factor beta (TGF -beta).  
 
Two ligands specific for PD -1 have been identified: PD -ligand 1 (PD -L1, also known as B7 -H1 
or CD274, expressed on tumor, antigen -presenting cells [APCs], and dendritic cells [DCs]) and 
PD-L2 (also known as B7 -DC or CD273, expressed on endothelial cells). The interaction of PD -1 
with PD -L1 and PD -L2 results in negative regulatory stimuli that down -modulate the activated T -
cell immune response through SHP -1 phosphatase.  
 
PD-1 knockout mice develop strain -specific lupus -like glomerulonephritis (C57BL/6) and 
cardiomyopathy (BALB/c). In transplantable tumor models that expressed PD -1 and LAG -3 on 
tumor -infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells dual anti -LAG -3/anti -PD-1 antibody treatment cured 
most mice of established tumors that were largely resistant to single antibody treatment (Woo et 
al., 2012). Despite minimal immunopathologic sequelae in PD -1 and LAG -3 single knockout 
mice, dual knockout mice abrogated self -tolerance with resultant autoimmune infiltrates in 
multiple organs, leading to eventual lethality.  
 
PD-L1 expression is found on a number of tumors, and is associated with poor prognoses based 
on survival in many tumors, includ ing melanoma [37], renal [37], esophageal [38], gastric [39] 
2006), ovarian [40], pancreatic [41], lung [42], and other cancers (Investigator Brochure, 2014).  
 
The PD -1/PD -L1 axi s plays a role in human infections, particularly in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In these cases, high expression levels of PD -1 were found 
in viral -specific CD8+ T cells that also display a non -responsive or exhausted phe notype. Non -
NCI Protocol #: 9925

15 
 responsive PD -1-high T cells were observed in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in 
rhesus macaques. Treatment of SIV -infected macaques with an anti -PD-1 mAb (3 mg/kg x4) 
resulted in decreased viral loads and increased survival along  with expanded T cells with increased 
T-cell functionality. Recent work suggests that PD1 expression on infected T cells contributes to 
the impairment or exhaustion of CTL function in HTLV -1 infected individuals [43]. 
 
2.2.1 Pre-Clinical Development  
 
In intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab alone was 
well tolerated (Investigator Brochure, 2014). Nivolumab bound specifically to PD -1 (and not to 
related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4, and BTL A) with a K d = 3.06 
nM. A surrogate rat anti -mouse PD -1 antibody (4H2) was derived and expressed as chimeric IgG1 
murine antibody. Antitumor activity was seen for several tumor models, including colon 
carcinoma and fibrosarcoma.  
 
2.2.2 Clinical Development  
 
Nivolumab is being evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
other immunotherapy (such as ipilimumab), anti -angiogenesis therapy, and targeted therapies in 
completed and ongoing BMS -sponsored clinical trials in NSCLC, melanom a, RCC, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies including microsatellite instability (MSI) in 
colorectal cancer, and triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) with an expanding group of 
indications (Investigator Brochure, 2014). In ad dition, two investigator -sponsored trials (ISTs) of 
nivolumab in combination with a peptide vaccine in melanoma are being conducted in the adjuvant 
setting and advanced disease. Seven nivolumab studies were conducted in Japan, including six 
studies in adva nced solid tumors and recurrent or unresectable stage III/IV melanoma sponsored 
by Ono Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., and one IST in recurrent or advanced platinum -refractory 
ovarian cancer.  
 
2.2.3 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab were linear in t he range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, with dose -
proportional increases in maximum serum concentration (C max) and area under the concentration -
time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), with low to moderate inter -subject variability 
observed at each dose level (Investigator Brochure, 2014). Clearance of nivolumab is independent 
of dose in the dose range (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) and tumor types studied. Body weight normalized 
dosing showed approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide range of body weights. 
The mean terminal elimination half -life of BMS -936558 is 17 to 25 days consistent with the half -
life of endogenous IgG4.  
 
2.2.4 Efficacy  
 
In a phase 1 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg nivolumab doses) dose -escalation study the 3 mg/kg dose was 
chosen for expanded cohorts. Among 236 patients, objective responses (ORs) (complete or partial 
responses [CR or PR]) were seen in NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC. ORs we re observed at all doses 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
16 
 [44]. Median OS was 16.8 mo nths across doses and 20.3 months at the 3 mg/kg dose. Median OS 
across all dose cohorts was 9.2 months and 9.6 months for squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, 
respectively [45]. In the RCC cohort, median duration of response was 12.9 months for both doses 
with 5 of the 10 responses lasting ≥1 year (Drake  et al., 2013).  
 
In a phase 1 study of nivolumab plus platinum -based doublet chemotherapy (PT -doublet) in 
chemotherapy -naïve NSCLC patients, 43 patients were treated with nivolumab + PT -doublet [46]. 
No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and total/confirmed ORRs were 43/33%, 
40/33%, and 31/31% in nivolumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin, nivolumab/pemetrexed/cisplatin, and 
nivolumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel arms, respectively.  
 
2.2.4.1  Activity in  Lymphomas  
 
In a phase 1 study of 23 heavily treated patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
were treated with 3 mg/kg nivolumab every 2 wks [47]. This resulted in an objective response in 
20 subjects, including 4 subjects with a complete response, and progression -free survival of 86% 
at 24 wks. Copy -number gains in PDL1 and  PDL2 gene resul ted in enhanced JAK -STAT activity, 
which may explain the activity seen.  
 
A phase I study of nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies 
include d 29 subjects with B -NHL and 23 patients with T -NHL, resulting in ove rall response rates 
of 28% and 17%, respectively [48]. This study, as well as two previous studies with pidilizumab 
in subjects with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma confirm the safety of this 
approach [49, 50] . 
 
2.2.5 Toxicology  
 
A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nivolumab was not defined [51]. Serious adverse events 
(SAEs) occurred in 32 of 296 patients (11%) similar to the immune -related inflammatory events 
seen with ipilimumab: pneumonitis, vitiligo, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, and thyroiditi s (with 
noted pulmonary toxicity resulting in 3 deaths. Renal failure, symptomatic pancreatic and DM, 
neurologic events, and vasculitis have also been reported.).  
 
It is recognized that HTLV -1 is associated with inflammatory diseases, whose etiology is un clear. 
These include forms of myelopathy, uveitis, arthropathy, pneumonitis, and Sjogren’s disease -like 
manifestations. Aberrant immune responses resulting in cross -reaction between virus -induced 
antigens and cellular antigens may be at least partially res ponsible. Thus, there is a theoretical risk 
that immune checkpoint inhibitors may promote these disorders, to which there will be careful 
attention.  
 
2.2.6 Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers  
 
Tumor -cell expression (melanoma) of PD -L1 was characterized with the use of IHC staining and 
pharmacodynamics changes in the peripheral -blood absolute lymphocyte count (Wolchok et al., 
2013). With PD -L1 positivity defined as expression in at least 5% of tumor cells, biopsy specimens 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
17 
 from 21 of 56 patients (38%) were PD -L1–positive . Among patients treated with the concurrent 
regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab, ORs were observed in patients with either PD -L1–positive 
tumor samples (6 of 13 patients) or PD -L1–negative tumor samples (9 of 22). In the sequenced 
regimen cohorts, a highe r number of overall responses was seen among patients with PD -L1–
positive tumor samples (4 of 8 patients) than among patients with PD -L1–negative tumor samples 
(1 of 13) suggesting the possibility that these tumors have higher response rates to the combina tion. 
Tissue expression of PDL -2, interferon -γ (IFN - γ), IDO, and T cell CD8+ are of current interest. 
Until more reliable data based on standardized procedures for tissue collection and assays are 
available, PD -L1 status cannot be used to select patients for treatment at this time. Recent findings 
suggest a possible correlation to higher mutational load and expression of a subset of mutant 
tetrapeptide motifs in tumor antigens [52]. 
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
The rationale for the use of nivolumab in HTLV -1 associated ATLL is to enhance immune 
clearance of infected malignant cells.

years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin 
cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of any site or any other cancer.  
 
16. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because  nivolumab is an agent with the 
potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential 
risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with  
nivolumab , breastfeeding should be discontinue d if the mother is treated with  nivolumab.

4.2 Site Registration  
 
This study is supported by the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit (CT SU). 
 
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) approval for this protocol and submit all required regulatory documents (including any 
protocol specific documents) to the CTSU Regulatory Off ice before they can be approved to enroll 
patients.  
 
The CTSU Regulatory Office tracks receipt of these documents in the CTSU Regulatory Support 
System (RSS), reviews for compliance, and transmits site approval data to C TEP.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI Central IRB ( CIRB )-Early Phase  initiative and accepting CIRB 
approval for the study are not required to submit separate IRB approval documentation to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office for initial, continuing , or amendment review.  However, sites must 
submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB (via IRBManager) to 
indicate their intention to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then 
communicated to  the CTSU Regulatory Office for complian ce in the RSS.   The Signatory 
Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the Signatory 
Institution are participating in the study so that the study approval can be applied to those 
institutions.   Other site registration requirements ( e.g., laboratory certifications, protocol -specific 
training certifications, or modality credentialing) must be submitted to the CTSU Regulatory 
Office or compliance communicated per protocol instructions.

 4.3 Patient Registratio n 
 
In cooperation with the Corresponding Organization (Duke Cancer Institute LAO), the Lead 
Protocol Organization or LPO ( Washington University School of Medicine ) is utilizing an online 
‘study portal’ for key study communication from participating sites t o the Lead Principal 
Investigator and Study Coordinator. The study portal operates through REDCap, a secure, web -
based application, managed by the Duke Cancer Institute LAO. Participating sites will not 
require REDCap user accounts or passwords to access t he study portal for this study.  
 
The 9925 Study Portal may be accessed through the following link: http://j.mp/2g4kpUG  .  
 
Prior to registering patients into Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN), participating 
sites a re instructed to access the 9925  Study Portal for the following:  
 
• Subject Consent – Within 24 business hours of subject signing consent for the study, the 
Site Coordinator accesses the study portal to upload consents and notify the Study 
Coordinato r of subject consent. Upon receipt of consent notification, the Study 
Coordinator will email the Site Coordinator with a subject screening ID number.  
 
• Eligibility Confirmation – After completion of all screening evaluations and if possible, 
within at least 48 business hours of anticipated study treatment start, the Site Coordinator 
accesses the study portal to upload completed eligibility checklist and de -identified 
supporting s ource documentation including sufficient tumor tissue pathology 
confirmation documentation. After review of eligibility documents by the Lead Principal 
Investigator or designee(s), the Study Coordinator will email the Site Coordinator with 
confirmation or questions/comments regarding subject eligibility. If eligibility is 
confirmed, the Site Coordinator will be instructed by the Study Coordinator via email to 
proceed to patient registration in OPEN.  
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated usin g the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN).  
OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis .  It is integrated with 
the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interchange  and with  the Theradex 
Interactive We b Response System (IWRS)  for retrieval of patient registration/randomization 
assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by Registrars in OPEN / IWRS will automatically 
transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, Medidata Rave.  
 
The OPEN  system  will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registrati on and treatment 
information.  Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username and password).  
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017

https://www.ctsu.org  or at https://open.ctsu.org .  For any additional questions contact the CTSU 
Help Desk at 1 -888-823-5923 or ctsucontact@westat.com .  
 
4.4 General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within  7 days. Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed w ith the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registratio n on the study may be 
canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possib le. 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse events and potential ri sks 
are described in Section 7 . Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6 .  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.  
 
Regimen Description  
Agent  Premedications; 
Precautions  Dose  Route  Schedule  Cycle 
Length  
Nivolumab  None  in 100 ml 
NS IV over 60 
minutes (+/ - 10 
minutes)  Every  2 
weeks 14 days  
 
**Doses as appropriate for assigned dose level.  
 
A flat dose of 240 mg will be administered.   There will be no dose modifications allowed.  
 
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 60 -minute (+/- 10 minutes) IV infusion, using a volumetric 
pump with a 0.2/ 1.2 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose. The drug can be diluted 
with 0.9% normal saline for  delivery but the total drug concentration of the solution cannot be 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
25 
 below 1.0 mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. At the end of the 
infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  
 
5.2 General Concomitan t Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.2.1 Supportive Care  
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study.  
 
See Section 5.1  for supportive care considerations for nivolumab  administration.  
 
Patients requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the study will be taken off study 
treatment. Any exceptions must be discussed with the Principal Investigator . 
 
5.2.2 Other Medications  
 
Recommended prophylaxis for opportunis tic infections  includes Bactrim DS every other day.  
Subjects must be instructed to inform the investigators of the current or  planned use or all other 
medications during the study (including  prescription medications, over -the-counter medications, 
vitamins and herbal and nutritional supplements). It is the responsibility of the  investigator to 
ensure that details regarding all medications are  documented.  Bisphosphonates started prior to 
screening activities or initiated during the  course of the study to cont rol bone  pain may be used 
with caution.  
 
Prophylactic growth factor (G -CSF)  administration is not recommended. Based on observed 
toxicities,  protocol -specified dose modification guidelines should be followed for  subsequent 
therapy cycles. Management of ane mia will be at the  discretion of the treating physician,  No 
concurrent investigational agents are permitted.  
 
5.2.3 Prohibited Therapies  
 
Patients in this study may not use vaccines for the treatment of cancer for up to one month pre  and 
post dosing with niv olumab. Concomitant systemic or local anti -cancer medications including 
biologics, or radiation therapy treatments are prohibited in this study while receiving nivolumab . 
 
Patients may not use any of the following therapies during the study:  
• Any non -study anti -cancer agent (investigational or non -investigational)  
• Any other investigational agents  
• CTLA4 antagonists, CD137 agonists, PD -1 inhibitors  
• Immunosuppressive agents, unless indicated to manage study therapy induced immune - 
related adver se events ( irAEs )  
• Chronic systemic corticosteroids, unless indicated to manage study therapy induced irAEs 
or chronic graft -versus -host disease ( GVHD ) at a stable dose prior to study entry  
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
26 
 • Any non -oncology vaccine therapies used for the prevention of infectious diseases (for up 
to 30 days prior to or after any dose of study drug, however it is suggested that routine 
vaccinations, including seasonal influenza, be given at least 2 weeks prior to study 
treatment).  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue for  the 4 starting 
doses plus  42 cycles  (approximately 23 months)  or until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progres sion,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,   
• Patient decides to withd raw from the study,  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the i nvestigator , or 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) which include the following (see also Section 6  for dosing 
delays/dose modifications and Appendix E  for specific al gorithms):  
o Any toxicity requiring high dose corticosteroids except patients with grade 2 or 3 
skin lesions, pruritis, thyroiditis, or n. VII palsy can be restarted after a tapered 
dose of corticosteroids.  
o Any dosing interruption lasting more than 6 weeks,  with the following exceptions:  
• Patients being tapered after high dose corticosteroids over one month 
followed by a two -week observation period will be allowed an additional 
two weeks to restart treatment ( a maximum eight week interruption).  
 
• Dosing interruptions more than 6 weeks that occur for non -drug-related 
reasons may be allowed if approved by the Principal Investigator. Prior 
to re -initiating treatment in a subject with  a dosing interruption lasting 
more than 6 weeks, the Principal Inves tigator must be consulted.  
 
o Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or interc urrent illness which, in the 
judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with 
continued study drug dosing  
 
o Requiring additional immune suppressive treatment beyond steroids  
 
Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted.  
 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
27 
 Patients will be followed for 1 year after removal from study or until  death, whichever occurs first.  
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until resolution 
or sta bilization of the adverse event  
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of th e criteria listed in Section 5.3  applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the Case 
Report Form.  
 
 
5.6 Criteria to Resume Treatment  
 
Some patients may continue to benefit from treatment, maintaining or improving  responses after 
progression including those treated with steroids.  
 
Restarting applies only to Grade 2 events and some Grade 3 events (skin rash and thyroiditis).  
 
For non -autoimmune or non -inflammatory events , patients may resume treatment with study dr ug 
when the drug -related AE(s) resolve to Grade  ≤ 1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
• Patients may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue . 
• Evaluation to exclude any additional immune mediated events endocrine, GI, and liver / 
pancreas function as clinically indicated must be made prior to restarting.  
• Non-drug-related toxicity including hepatic, pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must 
have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed.  
 
If the criteria to resume treatm ent are met, the patient should restart treatment no sooner than the 
next scheduled time point per protocol. However, if the treatment is delayed past the next 
scheduled time point per protocol the treatment should resume at the earliest convenient point t hat 
is within the 6 week delay period.  
 
If treatment is delayed for >  6 weeks, (>  8 weeks for patients on a steroid taper), the patient must 
be permanently discontinued from study therapy, except as specified in Section  5.3. 
 
For patients treated with corticosteroids :   
• Grade 2 events must resolve to ≤ Grade 1 before considering retreatment.  
• Grade ≥  2 events should have nivolumab held until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 for at least 2 
weeks following complete removal f rom steroid treatment except for maintenance 
replacement doses for adrenal insufficiency (preferably no greater than 10mg prednisone 
equivalent daily).  
• Grade ≥  3 events should have nivolumab discontinued. Patients with Grade 3 thyroiditis 
and skin rash may  continue therapy as for Grade 2 events with resolution and stable 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
28 
 replacement treatment.  
 
Patients with hepatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, and colitis are at risk for exacerbation with 
retreatment if there is residual inflammation and should resolve to  Grade 0 or baseline before 
retreatment. Baseline can mean the initial grade i.e. Grade <1 where permitted on study.  
 
Patients with thyroiditis or hypopituitarism who are stable as above may be restarted with 
replacement hormones including thyroid hormone and physiologic doses only of corticosteroids.  
Please note that grading  for hypophysitis with symptoms of headache, visual or neurologic changes 
or radiologic evidence of pituitary enlargement and other CNS events such as aseptic meningitis 
or encephalitis  should be considered Grade 3 events.  
 
New immune related events or exacerbation of existing events during steroid treatment or taper 
suggest the presence of ongoing immune activation and should require permanent discontinuation 
of nivolumab.  
 
A patient who is treated with steroids, evaluated, and found to not have an autoimmune or 
inflammatory event requiring steroid treatment, may be restarted if asymptomatic off steroids for 
2 weeks and other restarting criteria are met.  
 
Prior to starting corticoster oids or hormone replacement for any reason, appropriate endocrine 
testing including cortisol, ACTH, TSH and T4 must be drawn if clinically feasible to document 
baseline function and distinguish the pituitary from peripheral organ dysfunction and later from  
steroid (or thyroid) treatment associated ACTH (or TSH) suppression. Steroids should be started 
prior to obtaining results based on clinical indications.  
 
5.7 Treatment of Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions  
 
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobul in protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, urticaria, angioedema, 
pruritus, arthralgia, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 guidelines.  
 
Treatment recommendations ar e provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as medically appropriate:  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms:  
(Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated)  
 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. Infusion rate may be 
slowed. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate 
when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 3 0 minutes, the rate may be 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
29 
 increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor patient closely.  
 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (a cetaminophen) at 
least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations, slowing infusion rate as above.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms:  
(Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment [ e.g., antihis tamines, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, narcotics, 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; close observation for recurrence and treatment 
medications may need to be continued for 24 -48 hours).  
 
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen); 
remain at bedside and monitor patient until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy m ay also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then 
restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further 
complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the origi nal infusion 
rate. Monitor patient closely. If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab will be administered 
at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the patient 
until resolution of symptoms. The amount of stud y drug infused must be recorded on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF).  
 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and (acetaminophen) (or paracetamol) 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) 
may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms:  (Severe reaction)  
(Grade 3  symptom s: prolonged [ i.e., not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or 
brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [ e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary 
infiltrates]).  
(Grade 4  symptoms: life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated. ) 
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 t o 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution 
for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or 
equivalent), as needed. Patient should be mon itored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued.  
 
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain 
at bedside and monitor patient until recovery from symptoms.  
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
30 
  
In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms ( e.g., appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given ( e.g., 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroid s). 
 
Please note that late occurring events including isolated fever and fatigue may represent the 
presentation of systemic inflammation. Please evaluate accordingly.  
 
 
5.8 Treatment Beyond Progression  
 
Patients are allowed to continue treatment for 4 -6 weeks and reassessed. Treatment may continue 
up to an additional 30% total single diameter increased over baseline , if no change in performance 
status, no new serious adverse event, and no need for intervention . New measureable lesions are 
not permitted with thi s schema.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
There will be no dose adjustments allowed. Subjects with infusion delays > 49 days (i .e., 2 missed 
doses + 7 days) should  discontinue the study drugs . 
 
Please refer to Appendix  E to the protocol for toxicity management algorithms which include 
specific treatment guidelines . These algorithms should be followed unless there are specific 
clinical circumstances which the treating physician indicates variations or alternative  treatment is 
needed.  
 
Generally,  we strongly encourage early evaluation, withholding drug, and appropriate treatment 
as indicated in the management tables and following event specific guidelines.

Continued t reatment of active immune mediated hepatitis may exacerbate ongoing inflammation. Holding 
drug to evaluate LFT changes and early treatment are recommended.  
LFT changes may occur during steroid tapers from other events and may occur together with other GI 
events including cholecystitis/pancreatitis.  
For individuals who are hepatitis B or C positive,  viral DNA or RNA load, respectively, should be 
measured to determine if worsening LFTs are due to immune -mediated hepatitis or infectious hepatitis.

bladder disease or new onset diabetes, may continue on treatment at investigator’s 
discretion. Patients who develop symptomatic pancreatitis or DM should be taken off 
protocol t herapy.  
Patients may develop symptomatic and radiologic evidence of pancreatitis as well as DM and DKA. 
Lipase elevation may occur during the period of steroid withdrawal and with other immune mediated 
events or associated with colitis, hepatitis, and patients who  have asymptomatic lipase elevation typically 
have self -limited course and may be retreated.  
Recommended management:  See Appendix E  for the Hepatic AE management a lgorithm for treatment

consultation if lymphocytic pneumonitis is excluded. Off st udy if steroids are 
required.  
Grade 3  Hold dose pending evaluation. Resume no change in dose after pulmonary and/or ID 
consu ltation only if lymphocytic pneumonitis is excluded. Off protocol therapy .  
Grade 4  Off protocol therapy . 
Distinguishing inflammatory pneumonitis is often a diagnosis of exclusion for patients who do not 
respond to antibio tics and have no causal organism  identified including influenza. Most patients with 
respiratory failure or hypoxia will be treated with steroids. Bronchoscopy may be required and analysis 
of lavage fluid for lymphocytic predominance may be helpful. Patients with new lung nodules should b e 
evaluated for sarcoid like granuloma. Please consider recommending seasonal influenza killed vaccine

If treatment is delayed >  6 weeks (> 8 weeks for patients on high dose  steroids with recommended 
4 weeks taper and 2 week observation ), the patient must be permanently discontinued from study 
therapy, except as specified in Section  5.7 (Criteria to Resume Treatment.)  
 
Patients requiring  > 2 dose delays for the same event should go off protocol therapy.  
 
Prior to starting corticosteroids or hormone replacement for any reason, appropriate endocrine 
testing including cortisol, ACTH, TSH and T4 must be obtained to document baseline.  
 
Patients may be dose -delayed for evaluation and restarted depending on results.  
 
Any patient started on corticosteroids initially who is determined to not require steroids treatment 
for an autoimmune adverse event may resume therapy after a 2 week observation period without 
further symptoms at the discretion of the PI or investigator.  
 
For subjects who are HIV co -infected and compliant with antiviral medications, nivolumab will 
be held if viral load increases to >500 copies/ml or CD4 count falls to <100 cells/mL. CD4 and 
virus load will be repeat 2 -4 weeks later, and if the above parameters are still found, then 
nivolumab will be permanently discontinued.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following 
list of AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2 ) will determine 
whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System 
(CTEP -AERS ) in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List (CAEPR)  
 
BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106, NSC 748726)  
 
The Compreh ensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NC I (except as noted below). Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 2069 patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106).  **Patients with evidence of myositis without myocarditis may be treated according as “other event”   
Note:  The optimal treatment regimen for immune mediated myocarditis has not been established.  
Since this toxicity has caused patient deaths, an aggressive approach is recommended.   
NCI Protocol #: 9925

 NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses 
next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades 
to determine if expedited reporting is required.

5BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106) being a member of class of agents involved in the inhibition of 
“immune checkpoints”, may result in severe and possibly fatal immune -mediated adverse events probably 
due to T -cell activation and proliferation.  This may result in autoimmune disorders that can include (but 
are not limited to) autoimmune hemolytic anemia, acquired anti -factor VIII immune response, autoimmune 
aseptic meningitis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune nephrit is, autoimmune neuropathy, autoimmune 
thyroiditis, bullous pemphigoid, exacerbation of Churg -Strauss Syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia 
systemic symptoms [DRESS] syndrome, facial nerve disorder (facial nerve paralysis), limbic encephalitis, 
hepatic fail ure, pure red cell aplasia, pancreatitis, ulcerative and hemorrhagic colitis, endocrine disorders 
(e.g., autoimmune thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, 
thyrotoxicosis, and adrenal insufficiency), sarcoid g ranuloma, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, and 
Guillain -Barre syndrome.  
 
6Cytokine release syndrome may manifest as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with accompanying 
fever and pancytopenia.  
 
7Complications including hyperacute graft -versus -host disease (GVHD), some fatal, have occurred in 
patients receiving allo stem cell transplant (SCT) after receiving BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106).  
These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between receiving BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, 
MDX -1106) and allo -SCT.  
 
Adverse events reported on BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106) trials, but for which there is

Note : BMS -936558 (Nivolumab, MDX -1106) in combination with other agents could cause an 
exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination 
may result in events never previously associated with either agent.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
web site : 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
• AEs for the agent  that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the SPEER 
column, Section 7.1.1)  should be reported through CTEP -AERS only if the grade is above 
the grade provided in the SPEER . 
• Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in Sectio n 
7.3.4.  
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
o Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
o Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
o Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
o Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
o Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event Reporting 
System), accessed via the CTEP Web site  (https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reporting 
procedures to be followed are presented in the “ NCI G uidelines  for Investigators:  Adverse  Event 
Reporting  Requirements  for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs ” which can be 
downloaded from the CTEP Web site : 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm . 
 
These requirements are briefly outlined in the table s below (Section 7.3.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be made to 
CTEP by telephone at 301 -897-7497 .  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 24-hour 
notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the original submitter 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
41 
 at the site.  
 
7.3.1 Distribution of Adverse Event Reports  
 
CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the following 
individ uals:  Principal Investigator and Adverse Event Coordinator (s) (if applicable) of the 
Corresponding  Organization  or Lead Organization , the local treating physician, and the Reporter 
and Submitter .  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for other e -mail recipie nts.  
The Coordinating Center of the Corresponding  Organization is responsible for submitting to the 
CTSU documentation of AEs that they deem reportable for posting on the CTSU protocol web 
page and inclusion on the CTSU bi -monthly broadcast.  
 
7.3.2 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial registration 
on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting , regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant 
and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive Disease)”  under t he system organ 
class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease 
(e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration 
associated with a disease process) should be submitt ed.

that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration of the 
Investigational Agent/Intervention1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalizati on 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via  electronic 
submission wi thin the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initiall y be submitted electronically within 24 h ours of learning 
of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submit ted electronically within 10 
calendar days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
a) Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
a) Grade 3 adverse events  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
7.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in  a routine manner at scheduled times during 
the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the  Adverse Event CRF  is used for  routine AE

A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignan cy (e.g., treatment 
with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is 
not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent u nder an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported  expeditiously  via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to describe 
the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
43 
 • Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE reporting 
unless otherwise specified . 
 
7.7 Adverse Event Monitoring  
 
Safety and tole rability will be monitored by AEs determined every 2 w eeks while on treatment. It 
is expect that about 10% of subjects will have intolerable toxicity, requiring discontinuation of 
therapy. If the number of subjects discontinuing therapy is greater than 10%  (p<0.05), this therapy 
will be considered intolerable in this population.  
 
Participating sites  will enter data every two weeks at a minimum. Participating sites will also  
notify the coordinating center of Grade 3 and higher adverse events and serious adv erse events 
within 24 hours of occurrence or notification. The study chair (PI) will be notified of such events 
by the coordinating center team at Washington  University, the Lead Protocol Organization (LPO) 
and Duke University, the Lead Academic Organizati on (LAO). The coordinating center team and 
LAO and LPO investigators will have a weekly conference call to review subject enrollment, study 
progress, and available safety data including those generated from the study database. In addition, 
there will be mo nthly conference calls with the coordinating center, study chair, and participating 
sites (study nurses/  coordinators/  investigators) to review study progress and safety data.

 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative regulatory receptor expressed by 
activated T and B lymphocytes.  Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, programmed death –ligand 1 (PD -
L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of lymphocyte activation. Nivoluma b inhibits 
the binding of PD -1 to PD -L1 and PD -L2.  Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its 
ligands promotes immune responses and antigen -specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens 
as well as self -antigens.

Nivolumab is provided to the N CI under a Collaborative Agreement between the Pharmaceutical 
Collaborator and the DCTD, NCI ( see Section  12.2). 
 
8.2 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
 
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their authorized designee) 
at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that 
agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit 
the tr ansfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The 
CTEP -assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational 
agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be  registered with CTEP, 
DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum 
Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there 
are several participating investigators at one  institution, CTEP -supplied investigational agents for 
the study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution.  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping designees and ordering 
designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) 
application ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ). Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account ( https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” account status and a “current” password.  
For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability, call (240) 276 -6575 Monday 
through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm (ET) or email PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  
anytime.  
 
8.2.1 Agent Inventory Records  
 
The Investigator, or a responsible party designated by the Investigator, must maintain a careful 
record of the inventory and disposition of all drugs received using the NCI Drug Accountability 
Record Form (DARF) (available on the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ) or by calling 
the Pharmaceutical Management Branch at 301 -496-5725). The DARFs document the drug 
delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by each study participant, a nd disposal of the 
drug (if applicable). A site -specific accountability record, either manual or electronic, may be used 
if it includes all the information required on the NCI Investigational Drug Accountability Record 
and if the paper printout is identica l to the NCI accountability record. A separate DARF is required 
for each protocol using the same agent. The investigator will ensure that the drugs are used only 
in accordance with this protocol.

9.4.1 HTLV -1 Studies - Biological Marker s of Anti -Tumor Response  
 
A.  HTLV -1 DNA Proviral Load  
 
Hypothesis : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses and result in a decrease 
in HTLV -1 proviral load . 
 
Rationale : An effective immune response against HTLV -1 should decrease the number of 
HTLV -1 infected cells . 
 
Preclinical and Clinical Results : See Section 2.1  for HTLV -1 Proviral DNA and Cell -
Associated and Virion RNA Load and Protein Expression (2.1.2).   
 
Assay Methodology : Genomic DNA will be extracted from PBMCs isolated from whole 
blood obtained at baseline, Day 1 of  Cycle 3 , Day 1 of Cycle 5, every 12 weeks thereafter, 
and at the end of study time point, and tumor tissue at baseline and end of study time point  (if 
available) . The HTLV -1 DNA assay is performed with PBMCs, prepared in a BSL3 facility, 
measuring the num ber of copies of integrated or unintegrated viral genome with a Biorad 
digital drop PCR assay [53]. PCR is performed with tax primers that amplify a 154 bp region, 
and a FAM/MGB probe. Additionally, in a duplex PCR, a cellular housekeeping gene, 
ribonuclease P protein subunit P30 is amplified and detected with VIC/MGB probe. DNA will 
be digested with BamHI, mixed with the primers and probes and Bio -Rad 2× Supermix, and 
then emulsified using a QX -200 droplet generator, and PCR performed in a 96 well plate, and 
analyzed on the QX200 droplet reader. QuantaSoftware version 1.3.2.0 is used to quantify the 
copies/μl. Thresholds are determined manually for each experiment, according to the negative 
controls, which include a no template control and DNA from a healthy volunteer. Droplet 
positivity is determined by fluorescence intensity; only droplets above a minimum amplitude 
threshold are counted as positive. The PVL is calculated as the percentage of infected cells  
Data normalization is accomplished by app lying the log (base 2) transformation, calculating 
the mean and standard deviation (SD), and defining the lower (mean -2SD) and upper 
(mean+2SD) values of the expected range for each assay type. These values are used to 
convert the log transformed values to  a percentage of the expected range for each assay type, 
by subtracting the lower range value for the assay first then dividing by the difference of the 
upper and lower values of the expected range for the assay. Linear relationship of the post -

 normalized values is assessed using Pearson correlation.  
 
Investigator’s Experienc e and Competence with the Assay : Dr. Lee Ratner , the Principal 
Investigator,  used this assay in previous publications [29, 54, 55] , and has funding for these 
studies PO1 100730, R01 CA63417, and P50 CA094056  
 
Justification for Number of Patients and Specimens : Blood samples will be obtained at 
baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 3, Day 1 of Cycle 5, and every 12 weeks thereafter, and at the end 
of study treatment, in order to examine the correlation betw een proviral load, clinical 
response, and other correlative studies. Tumor tissue sample is obtained at baseline and off -
study time point (if available) to determine proviral load in the tumor.  
 
B.  HTLV -1 RNA Levels  
 
Hypothesis : Nivolumab will enhance ant i-ATLL immune responses and result in a decrease 
in HTLV -1 RNA levels  in PBMCs and tumors.  
 
Rationale : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses and result in a more 
dramatic decrease in HTLV -1 RNA levels than HTLV -1 DNA levels, since not all infec ted 
cells will  be expressing viral antigens . 
 
Preclinical and Clinical Results : See Section 2.1  for HTLV -1 Proviral DNA and Cell -
Associated and Virion RNA Load and Protein Expression (2.1.2).   
 
Assay Methodology : RNA  will be extracted from PBMCs isolated from whole blood obtained 
at baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 3 , Day 1 of Cycle 5,  every 12 weeks thereafter, and at the end of 
study, and tumor tissue at baseline and end of study time point  (if available) . The HTLV -1 
RNA as say is performed with PBMCs. RNA extraction, complementary DNA (cDNA) 
synthesis, and then digital drop PCR is performed . The extracted RNA i s converted to cDNA 
using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) 
accordi ng to the manufacturer’s instructions.  The conversion i s performed using a GeneAmp 
9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY) with the following param eters: 
10 min at 25°C, 120 min at 37°C, 5 min at 85°C, and a hold at 4°C.  HTLV -1 tax and HB Z 
primers and FAM/MGB probes were designed for ddPCR using NC BI Primer Blast and 
Primer3Plus.   Additionally, we amplify  a housekeeping gene, Hypoxanthine -guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), using a commercially available mix (Life Technologies, 
Frede rick, MD).  The final concent rations in the ddPCR reaction a re 900 nM of each primer 
and 250 nM of each probe.  
 
Digital droplet PCR i s performed as described in assay methodology noted above for HTLV -
1 DNA proviral load. Briefly, the cDNA i s mixed with the  HTLV -1 tax (or HBZ) and HPRT1 
primers and probes a nd Bio -Rad 2x Supermix, which i s then emulsified with droplet generator 
oil (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA) using a QX -200 droplet generator according to the 
manufactuter’ s instructions.  The droplets a re transfer red to a 96 -well reaction plate 
(Eppendorf, Hauppage, NY) and heat -sealed with pierceable sealing foil sheets (Thermo

 Fisher Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL.) .  PCR amplification i s performed using a GeneAmp 
9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Grand Isl and, NY) with the following cycling 
parameters: 10  min at 95°C, 40  cycles consisting of a 30 -s denaturation at 94°C and a 60 -s 
extension at 59°C, followed by 10  min at 98°C and a hold at 12°C.  Following PCR 
amplification, the 96 -well plate was transferred to a QX100 droplet reader (Bio -Rad, 
Hercules, CA).  Each well was queried for fluorescence to determine the quantity of positive 
events.  
 
QuantaSoft software version # 1.7.4.0917 (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA) i s used to quantify the 
copies/μl of each queried tar get per well. Droplet positivity was determined by fluore scence 
intensity.  Thresholds a re determined manually for each experiment, according to negative 
controls, which included a no template control and cDNA from a HTLV -I seronegative 
healthy volunteer.  All samples a re run in duplicate and the gene expression is the average of 
the two measurements.  The gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene 
expression using the following formula:  Gene expression = ((quantity of HTLV -1 tax or HBZ) 
/ (qua ntity of housekeeping gene))*100 .

Preclinical and Clinical Results : See  Section 2.1  for HTLV -1 Clonality (2.1.3).  
 
Assay Methodology : Genomic DNA will be extracted from PBMCs isolated from whole 
blood obtained at baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 3 , Day 1 of Cycle 5, every 12 weeks thereafter, 
and at the end of study time point and with tumor tissue at baseline and end of study time 
point  (if available) . Clonality is determined from deep sequencing of integration sites [56]. 
Ten micrograms of DNA from uncu ltured PBMCs or tumor cells is sheared by sonication. 
DNA ends are then end -repaired using T4 DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase I Klenow 
fragment, T4 polynucleotide kinase. Addition of an adenosine at the 3’ ends of the DNA is 
performed with Klenow Fragment 3’ to 5’ exo. One hundred pmol of a partially double 
stranded DNA linker is ligated to the DNA ends. Twenty six dif ferent linkers are constructed, 
each one with a specific 6bp tag to allow multiplexing of DNA samples during the sequencing. 
The ligated product is then split into 3 aliquots and each aliquot used in a separate PCR 
reaction. For each PCR reaction, ligated product is 50 pmol of B3 primer (binds HTLV -1 
LTR), 10  pmol of B4 primer (which anneals to the strand of the linker generated by the 
amplification from Bio3), Phusion DNA polymerase. The 3 PCR1 products, derived from the 
same sample are then pooled, and PC R2 performed with PCR1 product using 25pmol of P5B5 
primer (binds HTLV -1 LTR), 25  pmol of P7 primer (binds the linker), Phusion DNA 
polymerase. A library is constructed by pooling the different PCR2 products (each one 
possessing a specific tag). Quantifica tion of the libraries is made by QPCR using primers P5 
and P7 libraries are diluted to 0.5 pM and clustered on the Illumina flow cell. Paired -end reads 
(read1 and read2 each 50bp) plus a 6 bp tag read (read 3) are acquired on a GA II. The library 
construct ion pipeline is split into four steps: 1. DNA isolation and shearing; 2. Pre -PCR 
manipulations (ends repair and ligation); 3. PCR1 and PCR2 and library QPCR; 4. Library 
sequencing. Each step is carried out in a specific room and the sample flow is unidirec tional, 
to minimize the risk of PCR contamination.  
 
Read 1 and read 2 are mapped against the HTLV -1 and the human genome. First, overlapping 
clusters are exclude and then the following quality control filters: i) the single -read alignment 
scores of read 1  and read 2 must be higher than 10, ii) the strand orientation of the 2 reads 
must be opposite; iii) the length of the amplicons must be smaller than 1kb. Because the PCR 
is not specific to the 3’LTR, we discard the amplicons generated from the 5’LTR that 
contained only HTLV -1 sequences. We identify read 1 sequences that start with ACACA (the 
five bases at the 3’ terminus of the HTLV -1 LTR). Read 1 and read 2 sequences are used to 
map the insertion site and the shear site. Read 3 is used to allocate the ins ertion site to a 
particular sample. Together with the mapping of a large number of UISs, the goal of our 
approach is to quantify the abundance of each unique integration site (UIS). Because PCR 
preferentially amplifies short products, the number of amplico ns cannot be used to quantify 
the abundance of a given UIS. Random DNA fragmentation by sonication is a key feature to 
allow the quantification of the UIS abundance because, it is not biased to particular nucleotide 
sequences. For each UIS, we count the nu mber of amplicons of different length. Additionally, 
misreading of the tag index during the sequencing could lead to the attribution of a particular 
insertion site to different samples. We solve this issue by taking into account not only the 6bp 
tag inform ation but also the total number of distinct shear sites and the total number of reads 
NCI Protocol #: 9925

50 
 for a given insertion site to attribute the insertion site to the correct sample. Finally, control 
DNA (from a human T -cell line (Jurkat) uninfected by HTLV -1) is run on every lane of each 
flow cell to assess the effectiveness of our quality control procedures. Clonality is then 
determined from the oligoclonality index.  
 
Investigator’s Experienc e and Competence with the Assay : Dr. Lee  Ratner , the Principal 
Investigator,  used this assay in a previous report [55], and has funding for these studies PO1 
100730, R01 CA63417, and P50 CA094056 . 
 
Justification for N umber of Patients and Specimens : Blood samples will be obtained at 
baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 3, Day 1 of Cycle 5, and every 12 weeks ther eafter, and at the end 
of study treatment, in order to examine the correlation between clonality, clinical response, 
and other correlative studies. Tum or tissue samples are obtained at baseline and off -study time 
point (if available) to determine clonality in the tumor.  
 
D.  HTLV -1 Specific CTL Analysis  
 
Hypothesis : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses, including Tax -specific 
CTL numbers.  
 
Rationale : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses, as measured by HTLV -1 
specific CTL numbers.  
 
Preclinical and Clinical Results : See Section 2.1  for HTLV -1 Immune Responses (2.1.7).    
 
Assay Methodology : Tax-specific CTLs are determined wi th PBMCs obtained at baseline, 
Day 1 of Cycle 3 , and end of study endpoint. To stimulate IFN -γ+ HTLV -1 Tax -specific CD8+ 
T cells, we use two pools of overlapping 20 mer peptides (offset by 6 amino acids) spanning 
the full  length of the Tax protein. One hundred thousand CD4 -depleted PBMCs are incubated 
at 37°C for 6 h in the presence a range of concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5 and 10 μM) of the 
Tax peptide pools in duplicate wells. IFN -γ production by Tax -specific CTLs is  quantified by 
ELISpot. Spot -forming cells (SFCs) were counted using an automated ELISpot reader. For 
each peptide pool concentration, the frequency of IFN -γ+Tax-specific CTLs is calculated as 
follows: (SFCpoolA + SFCpoolB − 2 · SFCno peptide)/(total numbe r of CD8+ T cells). Log 10[peptide] 
is then plotted against the number of IFN -γ+ Tax-specific CTLs. Using Graphpad Prism 
software, the following equation was fitted to the data: y = (max)/(1 + 10((LogEC50 -x) · Hillslope)); 
where x = log 10 (peptide concentra tion); y = % CD8+ cells producing IFN -γ at a given peptide 
concentration; Hillslope = gradient of fitted curve; and max = predicted maximum SFC (i.e., 
where peptide concentration is not a limiting factor in IFN -γ production by Ag specific cells). 
The effec tive concentration of peptide that induced IFN -γ production by half the maximum 
number of Tax -specific cells (EC 50) is estimated using this equation, and CD8+ T cell avidity 
was defined as the reciprocal of this value (1/EC 50). Avidity is expressed in unit s of 106 M−1.  
 
Investigator’s Experienc e and Competence with the Assay : Dr. Lee  Ratner , the Principal 
Investigator,  has unpublished experience in this assay.

B. Blood Separa tion  
1. Fractionate the whole blood by centrifuging at 1500 -2000 X g for 10 -15 min at room 
temperature. This will separate the blood into an upper plasma layer, a lower red blood 
cell (RBC) layer, and a thin interface containing the white blood cells (WBCs) / buffy 
coat.  Fractionate the blood as soon as possible after collection.  
NOTE:  In a typical clinical centrifuge 1500 -2000 X g is ~3000 -3400 rpm. Check the 
appropriate settings for your centrifuge using the nomogram in your user’s manual.  
2. Use a disposable, plastic transfer pipet or Pasteur pipet to slowly and carefully aspirate off 
the plasma (upper layer) down to about 1 mm above the buffy coat.   Do not disturb the 
buffy coat.   Discard the plasma into a 250 mL flask containing bleach.  
3. Gently recover the buffy coat (WBCs) with a fresh disposable pipet, Pasteur pipet, or 
1000 ul micropipettor with a sterile tip.   Try not to uptake the RBC layer below the buffy 
coat.  
4. Place the recovered buffy coat into the WBC labeled cryovial cooled on ice from step 2.  
5. Screw on the cryovial cap tightly to prevent isopentane from seeping into the vial.  
6. Visually estimate the volume of WBCs recovered using the volume lines on the cryovial  
and write the information on the cryovial label.   Buffy coat volume is g reater in samples 
with high WBC counts.   Usually you can expect < 0.5 mL total.  
7. Proceed to section C, “Freezing Collected Cells”.  
  
C. Freezing Collected Cells  
1. Set Up Freezing Station  
• Do not perform snap freezing with bare hands.   Wear gloves at all times  and heavy 
duty gloves when working with liquid nitrogen or cooled isopentane.  
• Use extreme caution when dispensing liquid nitrogen.  
• Fill a small 100 ml metal beaker about 1/4 full with isopentane  
• Fill the Dewar thermo -flask about 1/3 full with liquid nitr ogen.  
  
2. Freezing Blood Cells in Cryovial  
1. Lower the 100 ml metal beaker containing isopentane half -way into the liquid 
nitrogen for cooling. The liquid nitrogen will boil as the beaker is lowered, when the 
isopentane is reaching its freezing point the ton e of the boiling will increase for 2 -3 
seconds.

53 
 2. Lift the beaker out of the liquid nitrogen once more than you see beads of solid 
isopentane at the bottom of the beaker (about 2 minutes).  
3. Use long forceps to hold the cryovial down into the cooled isopenta ne. Hold for at 
least 1 minute.  
4. Use the long forceps to take out the cryovial(s).  
5. Store vial(s) in -80ºC freezer.

9.4.2 Immune Cell Numbers  - Biomarker of Anti -Tumor Activity  
 
Hypothesis : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses and will decrease the 
number of CD3+CD4+CD25+ cells carrying HTLV -1 provirus, while increasing the number 
of CD3+CD8+ cells without affecting CD56+ or CD19+ cell numbers  
 
Rationale : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses and decrease infected 
immune responses and increase anti -ATLL immune effectors, which are likely primarily 
CD8+ cells  
 
Preclinical and Clinical Results : See Section 2.1  for HTLV -1 Immune Responses (2.1.7).   
 
Assay Methodology : Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS ) assay to be run at each 
institution .   
 
Investigator’s Experienc e and Competence with the Assay : N/A 
 
Justification for Number of Patients and Specimens : Blood samples will be obtained at 
baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 3, Day 1 of Cycle 5, and every 12 weeks thereafter, and at the end 
of study treatment, in order to examine the correlation between immune cell nu mbers, clinical 
response, and other correlative studies. Tumor tissue sample is obtained at baseline and off -
study time point (if available) to determine immune cell numbers in the tumor.

9.4.4 Tumor Antigen Analysis  - Biomarker for Correlation with Responses  
 
Hypothesis : Nivolumab will enhance anti -ATLL immune responses directed against tumor 
antigens . 
 
Rationale : Responses to nivolumab in solid tumors correlate with the level of mutant tumor 
antigens . 
 
Preclinical and Clinical Results : See Section 2.2  for Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers (2.2.6).   
 
Assay Methodology : Primary tumor or leukemic blood samples and matched normal 
specimens (skin or CD19+ peripheral blood B cells) are obtained. Only specimens with high 
tumor cellularity (>75%) will be used. Tumor and skin specimens are snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen after su rgical resection or biopsy and stored at −80 °C. Sections of tumor are stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin. DNA is extracted and exon capture is performed using a human 
All Exon 50MB kit (Agilent) with the addition of capture probes corresponding to the ent ire 
HTLV -1 genome. Enriched exome libraries will be sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 platform 
(llumina) to >100X coverage. Alignment, base -quality score recalibration and duplicate -read 
removal are performed, germline variants excluded, mutations annotated and indels evaluated. 
Samples with tumor coverage ≤10X were excluded. Medium -confidence reads (11 -34X) are 
manually reviewed using the Integrated Genomics Viewer for sequencing of candidate 
mutations. Mutations between clinical groups were compared using the M ann-Whitney test.  
 
HLA typing is performed by either low to intermediate resolution polymerase chain reaction -
sequence -specific primer (PCR -SSP) method or by high –resolution SeCore HLA sequence -
based typing method (HLA -SBT) (Invitrogen). ATHLATES 
(http:// www.broadinstitute.org/scientificcommunity/science/projects/viral -
genomics/athlates)3 is also used for HLA typing and confirmation.

The bioinformatic tool NAseek is used which performs two functions: translation of stretches 
surrounding each mutation, and  comparison between the resulting peptides for homology. 
First, NASeek translates all mutations in exomes so strings of 17 amino acids are generated 
for the predicted wild type and mutant, with the amino acid resulting from the mutation is 
situated central ly. Next, to evaluate MHC Class I binding, wild type and mutant nonamers 
containing the tetrapeptides common to the complete responders are input into NetMHC v3.4 
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/) or RANKPEP 
(http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/rankpep.htm l) for patient -specific HLA types, using a sliding 
window method. These programs generate a predicted MHC Class I binding strength. Finally, 
NAseek assesses for similarity between nonamers that are predicted to be presented by 
patient -specific MHC Class I.  The logo plot of the amino acid frequencies is executed using 
Weblogo ( http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi ) with default parameters. In order to further 
narrow down the predicted nonamers for testing in vitro , nonamers were also evaluated for 
putative binding to the T cell receptor using the IEDB immunogenicity predictor with patient -
specific HLA types (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/immunogenicity/) and CTLPred 
(http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/ctlpred/ ). To evaluate homology to known pathogens’ 
antigens, conserved tetrapeptides are analyzed using Immune Epitope Database 
(www.iedb.org) and assessed as substrings of immunogens in the database for a positive T 
cell response in Homo sapiens host. The “neoantigen signature” is generated from the 
nonamers containing the peptides common to patients with long -term benefit. Standard 
methods for signature derivation using unsupervised hierarchical  clusteri ng followed by 
logistic regression are used to determine predictive models based solely on the discovery set 
data. We will perform simulation/permutation testing to demonstrate that the neoantigen 
signature is highly unlikely to result from chance. To asse ss the null hypothesis that the 
signature is due to chance, 5 distinct simulation models are evaluated, three with new datasets 
and two using permutations of our dataset. The simulations are executed using (a) nonamers 
drawn from the SwissProt database (b)  mutations from the TCGA T -cell lymphoma dataset 
(c) randomly generated nonamers (d) redistribution of the mutations found in our data and (e) 
reordering of the 9 amino acids within each nonamer predicted to be presented in our dataset. 
In each simulation,  the nonamers are distributed randomly, and in proportion to our data (for 
example, if an actual sample harbored 150 nonamers predicted to bind MHC Class I, then the 
“virtual” sample is assigned 150 nonamers). Simulation testing is then conducted by applyi ng 
the same iterative model used on the actual data applied to this virtual dataset, and repeating 
this process 1,000 times, recording the frequency of signatures greater than the actual 
signature to determine the p value. P value was calculated as the pro portion of iterations with 
a signature greater that correctly classified segregation of the clinical cohorts, divided by the 
1,000 iterations.  
  
Mann-Whitney test is used to compare non -synonymous exonic mutational burden  between 
clinical groups. Log -Rank test was used to compare the Kaplan -Meier curves for overall 
survival in the discovery and validation sets. As described above, simulation testing was used 
with the null hypothesis that all tetrapeptides contribute equally to clinical benefit to determine 
if a signature of the size we found happened by chance.

Studies will be performed at the Ratner  Laboratory  at Washington University.  
 
9.4.5 Protein Markers Associated with Sensitivity or Resistance to Nivolumab  
 
Multiplex ELISA assays have been developed to analyze over 25 angiogenic, inflammatory 
and immune -related markers in less than 0.5 ml of plasma.  Coefficients of variation for 
most analytes are <10%.  This platform has been successfully applied to several in-house 
phase I and II studies, as well as several phase III, Alliance -conducted studies with 
bevacizumab in colorectal and other cancers at Duke University. Markers of inflammation 
will be analyzed in the Duke Phase I Biomarker Lab, which serves as a cor e lab for these 
analyses for the US Cooperative Group, the Alliance.  
 
Analyses will be performed on pre -treatment and on -treatment plasma samples. Analyte 
levels, and changes in analyte levels, will be correlated with clinical outcome (PFS, OS).  
Plasma w ill also be evaluated for protein markers that may be associated with sensitivity or 
resistance to ibrutinib. These may include CRP and other markers of inflammation, 
including but not limited to IFNγ, IL1β, IL6, sILR6R, sGP130, IL4, IL7, IL10, IL12, IL17A , 
IL17E, and IL23. Additional markers of proteins regulated by the PD -1/PD -L1 interaction 
and the IL6/JAK -STAT axis will also be assessed, including but not limited to VEGF, HER 
and TGFβ family members.

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 12 weeks.  In 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
65 
 addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained  12 weeks  following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progressi on will be evaluated in this study using criteria suggested by Tsukasaki et 
al [19].   
 
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluabl e for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with nivolumab . 
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evalua ted will 
be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered ev aluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 c m) by chest x -ray or as 
≥10 mm  (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measure ments must 
be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥15 mm  (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm  [0.5 cm] ).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short  
axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm  [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm  [≥1 to <1 .5 cm] short 
axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
66 
 Note:  Cysti c lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic meta stases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measura ble lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l esions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to repro ducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and rep orted as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurab le dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurement s of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric n otation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique s hould be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clini cal exam.  
 
Clinical lesions  will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( e.g., skin nodules 
and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm  (≥1 cm)  diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin 
nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
All subjects with skin disease and/or erythema using the SWAT and will  have photographs taken 
using a digital camera. Special care shou ld be taken to shield the patient’s identi ty 
 
Photos must be provided labeled with patient’s protocol number and initials and date.

 The body is divided into 12 regions with preassigned percentage total body surfa ce area (%TBSA) 
based on method ology used to assess burns: head is 7%  BSA, neck 2%, ant trunk 13%, post trunk 
13%, buttocks 5%, genitals 1%, upper arms 8%, forearms 6%, hands 5%, thighs 19%, lower leg 
14%, feet 7%.  
 
Biopsies at baselines and subsequent times can be performed to confirm a CR at the discretion of 
the investi gator.  
 
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI :  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm  (0.5 cm)  or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain  situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspic uity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Fur thermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequenc e parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed 
with breath -hold scannin g techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed  as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cance r lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound  is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a  method of 
measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent 
review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the 
same technique and measurements will be taken from one  assessment to the next.  If new lesions 
are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If 
there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected 
instances.  
 
Endoscopy, La paroscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
68 
 advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence fo llowing complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers  alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical res ponse.   
 
Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as lymphoma , 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an e ffusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that 
site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, thi s is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  
The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively  described in the protocol 
and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the indication.  However, it must 
be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of 
FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:   A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

11.1.4.1  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the tr eatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confir mation criteria.  
 
11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.

 Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first.  
 
11.1.7  Response Review  
 
Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images will be reviewed by an 
independent expert.  
 
11.2 Other Response Parameters  
 
Skin involvement will be assessed by the severity -weighted assessment tool (SWAT) scores 
obtained for patients at eac h tumor assessment visit. This score represents the product of the 
percentage total surface area (%TBSA) involvement of each lesions type (patch, plaque, and tumor 
or ulceration), multipled by a weight factor: SWAT = (patch%TBSA x1) + (plaque %TBSA x 2) 
+ (tumor or ulcer %TBSA x 3). In addition, the standard measurements of TBSA involvement and 
physician global assessments are recorded for comparison.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine safety, tolerability, and efficacy of nivolumab  
for pati ents with HTLV -associated ATLL . The safety and tolerability will be measured by the 
frequency of adverse events ( AEs) and the number of patients who discontinue therapy due to 
intolerable toxicity, while the efficacy will be measured as overall response (C omplete 
Response/C R+Partial Response/ PR) rate.  
 
The secondary objectives include  
• To determine effects of nivolumab  on HTLV -1 proviral DNA and RNA loads ; 
• To determine the effects of nivolumab  on anti -HTLV -1 and anti -ATLL immune responses ; 
• To determine effects of nivolumab  on HTLV -1 integration site clonality.  
 
13.2 Study Design  
 
At least 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled for this study. Evaluable patients will be those 
patients who received study medication. The sample size of 20 patients i s based on Simon’s 
Optimal 2 -stage design, with the assumption that a n overall response rate of 40% is the minimum 
response rate that would be considered for further analysis of this approach, compared to a rate of 
10% under null hypothesis . Thus, 20 subje cts are required to with a one -side type 1 error rate of 
5% and a power of 90%. If 1 or fewer responses are seen among the first 9 subjects enrolled, the 
trial is stopped early for futility. In contrast, i f 2 or more responders are observed out of the 9 
patients in the first stage, additional 11 patients will be enrolled in the 2nd stage. In a multicenter 
study such as this, however, it is difficult for a trial to reach the planned sample exactly.  The 
investigators would not turn away patients who have alr eady been approached for participation 
just because the number of patients needed has been met.  Therefore, we adopted a flexible Phase 
II design (Chen and Ng 1998) to allow the actual number at final stage to deviate slightly from 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
75 
 what is planned. Due to the expected relatively low accrual rate, we expect that the interim analysis 
could be performed at the designed sample size. Only the decision boundaries at the 2nd-stage are 
determined following Chen and Ng’s flexible design and programed by the study st atistician [57].  
That is, if 5 or more responders are observed out of 20 -23 patients, or 6 or more responders are 
observed out of 24 -25 patients, we would conclude that preliminary evidence for efficacy exists 
and that further investigation of the treatme nt is warranted.   
 
The interim analysis will be based upon independent review of response, with a minimum time 
frame of 2 months for the interim analysis. Accrual will not be halted during the interim analysis.  
 
13.3 Data Analysis  
 
Data analysis of the study will be descriptive in nature. Demographic and clinical characteristics 
of the sample, toxicity by grade, as well as tumor response, duration of response, and length of 
follow -up will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Binomial proportions and the ir 90% 
confidence intervals will be used to estimate the response rates of therapy. Binomial proportions 
and their 9 0% confidence intervals will  also be calculated for the efficacy based on immune 
response criteria (Appendix D ). The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to evaluate the response 
duration. Analysis of variance methods will be used to evaluate the effects of treatment and time 
on the viral load measurements, as well as measurements of viral transcripts. The incidence of 
toxicities will be estima ted using the binomial proportion and its 9 0% confidence interval. A 
proportional hazards analysis with viral load measures as time dependent covariates will be used 
to evaluate the effects of these measures on duration of response.  Detailed analysis of co rrelative 
studies and biomarkers are listed in Section 9.  
 
The safety and tolerability will be monitored every 2 weeks. All patients who receive treatment 
with nivolumab  will be eligible for safety and tolerability analysis.  A Bayesian sequential 
monitori ng method [58] will be used for safety analysis and the stopping rule is defined as 
Pr(θ>0.10 |data)>0.90, where θ denotes the proportion of patients who discontinue therapy due to 
intolerable toxicity. That is, enrollment will be stopped early whenever, g iven the accumulated 
observed data, there is >90% probability that the discontinuation of therapy is greater than 10%. 
Specifically, e nrollment will be stopped early if 3 patients discontinue therapy  in the first 12 
patients, or 4 patients discontinue ther apy in the first 19 patients, or 5 patients discontinue therapy  
before the last patient enrolled. These boundaries were obtained using the free -download software 
Multc99 (version 2.1) from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. We assume that the parameter θ 
follows  a prior distribution of beta (α, β), with α and β representing the number of patients 
discontinuing and continuing therapy respectively.

13.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.4.1  Evaluation of Toxicity  
 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with nivolumab.  
 
 
13.4.2  Evaluation of Response  
 
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of 
the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partia l response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early 
death because of other cause, or 8) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
arbitrary convention, category  8 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a 
clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who 
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of  the response rate.  
Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a treatment failure (disease 
progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in 
exclusion from the analysis of the response ra te.  Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be 
protocol specific.  
 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Sub group analyses may then be performed 
on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviat ions have been 
identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol 
violations, etc.).  However, these sub group analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and  the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis 
should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.

 APPENDIX  C IMAGING METHODOLOGIE S   
 
Contrast enhanced CT or enhanced MRI are the preferred imaging modalities to be used. Chest x -
rays performed during the screening phase (and repeated at anytime during th e study if clinically 
indicated) may be used as supportive data, as an accessory to the CT chest scans.  
 
The same imaging techniques used at screening MUST be used at all subsequent time points to 
permit accurate, comparable measurement of lesions. All ima ging data are to be collected on film 
or in digital format.  
 
CT/MRI of the Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis  
 
CT/MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required at Screening and at each tumor 
assessment visit as indicated in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, rega rdless of the location of known 
metastases. In addition, CT/MRI scans must be obtained of anatomic regions not covered by the 
chest, abdomen and pelvic scans, in subjects where there is clinical suspicion of deep soft tissue 
metastases (eg, lesions in the thigh). Such additional CT/MRIs will be required at Screening only 
when deep soft tissue disease is known/suspected and must be consistently repeated at all 
subsequent tumor assessment visits.  
 
 
Non-radiographic Assessments/Digital Photography  
 
These shoul d be made at the sites and recorded in the source documents. Visible skin lesions 
should be measured clinically and documented digitally using standardized photographic images, 
including a ruler for scale as part of the image.  
 
Image Acquisition Guidelines  
 
Similar methods of tumor assessment and similar techniques must be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at Screening and during the Induction and Maintenance Phases. All 
measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at Screen ing and at the defined tumor 
assessment time points (see Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). Additional assessments may be 
performed, as clinically indicated, if there is a suspicion of progression or for confirmation of 
response. The Investigator will base re sponse to treatment on the irRC (see Appendix  D). Imaging -
based evaluation is preferred to physical examination. Helical (spiral) CT scans of chest, abdomen 
and pelvis are preferred. If not available, conventional (non -helical, non -spiral CT) should be used.  
 
IV contrast should be used for all CT scans. If i.v. contrast is contraindicated, CT may be 
performed without contrast. Alternatively, MRI can be used to assess lesions in the subject. 
Subjects who develop contrast allergy after study enrollment may be followed by MRI for 
subsequent tumor measurements. Sections should be contiguous, similarly sized and consistent 
from visit -to-visit. Section thickness must be based on institutional standards (eg, from 5 to 8 mm; 
10 m m cuts are not recommended). Chest x -ray, ultrasound, and PET scans are not acceptable 
methods to measure disease for the purposes of this study.

 APPENDIX  D IMMUNE -RELATED RESPO NSE CRITERIA   
 
Immune -related  Response  Criteria  (irRC)  are derived from  modifi ed World Healt h Organization 
(mWHO) conventions.  Assess ments of  lymph nodes  are derived  from current  RECIST 
guidelines.1 
 
1.1.1.1.1  Definitions  of Measur able/non -Measurable Lesions  
All measur able and non-measurable  lesions should be assesse d at Scree ning and at the defined  
tumor assess ment time points  (see Table  1). Additional  assess ments may be perfor med, as 
clinically  indicated  for suspicion  of progression.  The Investigator  will base response  to treatment 
using  the irRC.  
 
1.1.1.1.2  Measurable Lesions  
Measura ble lesions  are lesions  that can be accurately measured  in 2 perpendicular  diameters,  
with at least 1 diameter ≥ 20 mm and the other dimension ≥ 10 mm (10 mm x 10 mm for 
spiral  CT with cuts of 5 mm).  The area will be defined  as the product  of the largest  diameter with 
its perpendicular.  
 
Lymph nod es may also be considered  measurable. To  be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and 
measurable,  a lymph node  must be at least 15 mm in short  axis when  assessed  by CT scan (CT 
scan slice thickness  recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm). 
 
1.1.1.1.3  Non-Measurable Lesi ons 
Non-measurable  (evaluable)  lesions  are all other  lesions,  including  unidi mensional  measurable  
disease  and small lesions  (lesions  without  at least 1 diameter ≥ 20 mm, or pathological  lymph 
nodes  with short  axis ≤ 15 mm), and any of the following:  lesions  occurring  in a previously  
irradiated  area (unless  they are docu mented  as new lesions  since  the completion  of radiation  
therapy),  bone  lesions,  lepto meningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural or pericardial  effusion,  
lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonis,  abdo minal masses that are not pathologic ally/cytolo gically  
confir med and followed  by imaging  techniques  and cystic  lesions.  Lymph  nodes  that have  a 
short  axis < 10 mm are considered  non-patholog ical and should  not be recorded  or followed.  
 
1.1.1.1.4  Definitions  of Index/non -Index  Lesions  
Measurable  lesions,  up to a maximum of 5 lesions  per organ  and ten lesions  in total,  must be 
identified  as index  lesions  to be measured  at Screening.  The index  lesions  should  be 
representative  of all involved  organs.  In addit ion, index  lesions  must be selected  based  on their 
size (eg, lesions  with the longest  diameters),  their suita bility for accurate  repeat  assess ment by 
imaging  techniques,  and how representative  they are of the subject’s  tumor burden.  At 
Screening,  a Sum of the Product  Diameters  (SPD)  for all index lesions will be calculated  and 
conside red the baseline  SPD.  The baseline  sum will be used as the reference point to deter mine

 the objective  tumor response  of the index  lesions  at tumor assess ment. 
 
1.1.1.1.5  Non Index Lesions  
Measura ble lesions,  other than index  lesions,  and all sites of non-measurable  disease,  will be 
identified  as non-index  lesions.  Non-index  lesions will be evaluated  at the same assess ment time 
points  as the index  lesions.  In subsequent  assessments, changes  in non-index  lesions  will 
contribute  only in the assess ment of complete response.  
 
1.1.1.1.6  Calculation  of Sum of Product of Diameters (SPD)  
Sum of Product  of Diameters  is an estimate of tumor burden.  The 2 greatest  perpendicular  
diameters are  used to estimate the  size of  each tumor lesion. The  SPD is  calculated  as the sum  of 
the product  of the diameters for index  tumor lesions. Severa l variation s of the SPD are identified 
for the purpose  of classification  of tumor responses.  
 
SPD at Baseline : The sum of the product  of the diameters for all index lesion s identifie d at 
baseline  prior  to treatment on Day 1. 
 
SPD  at tumor  asses sment: For every  on-study  tumor assess ment collected  per protocol  or as 
clinically  indicated,  the SPD at tumor  assessment will be calculated using tumor imaging  scans. 
All index  lesions  and all new measurable  lesions  that have  emerged  after baseline  will contribute  
to the SPD at tumor assessment (irSPD).  
 
SPD  at NADIR:  For tumors  that are assessed  more  than 1 time after baseline,  the lowest  value  
of the SPD (SPD  Baseline  or SPD at tumor assessment) is used to classify subseq uent tumor 
assess ments for each subject.  The SPD at tumor asses sment using  the irRC  for progressi ve 
disease  incorporates  the contribu tion of new measurabl e lesions . Each  net perce ntage change  in 
tumor burden per assess ment using  irRC  accounts  for the size and growth  kinetics  of both old 
and new lesions  as they appear.  In this study  the irRC  as defined  by the Investi gator will serve  as 
the basis  of key endpoints  for efficacy  analyses  and guide  clinical  care.  
 
1.1.1.1.7  Definition  of Index  Lesion  Respon se 
Immune -related  Complete  Response  (irCR),  which  is defined  as complete disappearance  of all 
index  lesions.  Lymph nodes  that shrink  to < 10 mm short  axis are considered  normal. 
 
Immune -relate d Partia l Respons e (irPR) , whic h is define d as a decre ase, relative  to baseline,  
of 50%  or greater  in the  sum of the  products of  the 2 largest  perpendicular  diameters  of all index  
and all new measurable  lesions (ie, Perce ntage Change  in Tumor Burden),  in the absence  of 
irCR.  
 
Note:  the appearance  of new measurable  lesions  is factored into the overall  tumor burden,  but 
does not automatically  qualify  as progr essive disease  until the SPD increases  by ≥ 25% when 
compared to SPD at nadir  
 
Immune -related  Stable  Disease  (irSD) , which  is defined  as not meeting  the criteria  for irCR  or 
NCI Protocol #: 9925  
Version Date:  October 27, 2017  
 
 
86 
 irPR,  in the absence  of immune -related progressiv e diseas e (irPD)  
 
Immune -related  Progressive  Disease (irPD),  which  is defined  as at least a 25% increase  in 
Tumor Burden  (ie, taking  sum of the products  of all index  lesions  and any new measurable  
lesions)  when  compared  to SPD at nadir.  
 
1.1.1.1.8  Definition of Non -Index Lesion Response  
Immune -related  Complete  Response  (irCR),  which  is defined  as complete disappearance  of all 
non-index  lesions.  Lymph nodes  that shrink  to < 10 mm short  axis are considered  normal. 
 
Immune -related  Parti al Response  (irPR),  non-index  lesion(s)  are not considere d in the 
definition  of PR, this term does not apply.  
 
Immune -related  Stable  Disease  (irSD),  non-index lesio n(s) are not considered  in the definition  
of SD, this term does not apply.  
 
Immune -related  Progressive  Disease  (irPD),  increases  in number or size of non-index  lesion(s)  
does not constitute progressive  disease unless/until Tumor Burden  increases by 25% (ie, the SPD 
at nadir  of index  lesions  and any new measurable  lesions  increases  by the required  amount).  
 
1.1.1.1.9  Impact of New Lesions on irRC  
New  lesions  alone  do not qualify  as progressive  disea se. However  their contribution to total 
tumor burden  is included  in the SPD which  in turn feeds  into the irRC for tumor response. 
Therefore,  new non-measurable  lesions will not discontinue  any subject  from  the study. 
 
1.1.1.1.10  Defini tion of Over all Response Using irRC Will Be Based on the Foll owing Crite ria: 
• Immune -related  Complete Resp onse (irCR): Complete disappe arance of all tu mor 
lesions  (index  and non-index),  together  with no new measurab le or unmeasurabl e lesions,  
for at least 4 weeks  from  the date of docu mentation  of irCR.  All lymph nodes  short  axes 
must be < 10 mm. 
• Immune -related  Parti al Response  (irPR):  The sum of the products of the 2 large st 
perpendicular  diameters  of all index  lesions  is measured  and captured  as the SPD baseline.  
At  each subsequent  tumor assess ment, the sum of the products of the 2 largest  
perpendicular  diameters  of all index  lesions  and of new measura ble lesions  are added  
together  to provide  the Immune  Response  Sum of the Product  of the Diameters  (irSPD). 
A decre ase, relative  to baseline  of the irSPD  of 50% or greater is considered an irPR,  in 
the absence  of irCR.  Must  be confir med no less than 4 weeks  from the first irPR. 
• Immune -related  Stable  Disease  (irSD):  irSD is define d as the failure  to meet criteria  
for immune  complete  response  or immune  partial  response,  in the absenc e of 
progressive  disease.  
• Immune -related  Progressive  Disease  (irPD):  It is recommended  in difficult  cases (eg, 
increas e in SPD or irSPD accompanie d with significa nt individ ual lesion  regression,  
“mixed response”,  or in presence  of stable or improving  perfor mance status/clinical  
condition)  to confirm  PD at the following  tumor assess ment. Any of the following  will

87 
 constitute progressive  disease:  
• At least 25% increase in the SPD of all index lesions  over nadir  SPD calculated  
for these  lesio ns. 
• At least a 25% increase in the SPD of all index  lesions and new measurable  
lesions (irSPD)  over the nadir  SPD calculated  for the index  lesions.

1.Objectives
1.1. Purpose, specific aims, or objectives:
Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk for elevated distress related to their 
diabetes.1-3 This is of critical concern as high diabetes distress is strongly associated with poor 
glycemic control, adherence, and other psychological disorders.1,4-11 Given that intensive 
treatment is required  to adequately  manage diabetes,  adolescents with T1D face unique 
challenges at their developmental stage, which universally is a period of increased risk.12,13 
Integrated psychosocial  care is suboptimal despite national  and international 
recommendations14,15 due to high costs, limited availability of proven interventions,  and a lack of 
trained clinicians  to deliver those  interventions.16 
One barrier to improving  the experiences  and outcomes for adolescents  with T1D may be the 
lack of opportunities for them to develop “resilience resources,” or skills to help manage 
challenges, such as stress-management,  goal-setting, positive reframing,  and meaning-making. 
Promoting resilience resources may mitigate  negative outcomes such  as diabetes distress, 
facilitate adherence,  and help adolescents  better navigate the challenges of T1D, particularly as 
they begin to become more independent  from their caregivers in all facets of their life.17-21  
Our research  program is built on the premise that promoting resilience resources will reduce 
distress and improve outcomes.  We have  developed conceptual frameworks of resilience in 
pediatric illness,20,22,23 affirmed  associations between resilience  resources and outcomes,21,24-28 
and developed  and piloted a novel resilience  resources intervention (Promoting  Resilience in 
Stress Management, PRISM).29 PRISM is a skills-based, one-on-one training  program consisting 
of two, 45-60 minute sessions followed by a family-meeting and supported by booster sessions  
and a digital  app designed  specifically for the adolescent population. Feasibility has been tested 
in adolescents with diabetes,29 cancer,29 cystic fibrosis,30 and currently in patients  with craniofacial 
disorder and end-stage  renal  disease.  We recently completed a pilot Randomized Controlled  
Trial (RCT)  comparing PRISM  to usual care among  adolescents with cancer. Results suggest 
PRISM is feasible,  highly acceptable, and associated with higher patient-reported  resilience and 
quality of life, and lower risk of psychological distress  6 months following enrollment.31 While  initial 
findings for PRISM are promising  in multiple  groups, its efficacy  among adolescents with T1D has 
not been tested.
Improving diabetes distress and health outcomes for adolescents with T1D requires 
innovative, developmentally-targeted, cost-feasible interventions designed  to help patients 
effectively manage the stressors and challenges of T1D management in the context of everyday 
adolescent life. We propose a multi-site  RCT comparing  PRISM to usual care among youth  with 
T1D (13-18  years with suboptimal glycemic control (elevated A1C)  and diabetes distress as 
measured with a validated scale).
  
1.2. Hypotheses to be tested:
  
1.Evaluate PRISM’s efficacy in reducing  A1C. The primary outcome  will be A1C at 6-months 
post-enrollment. Hypothesis: PRISM will be associated with lower  A1C compared to usual 
care at 6-months  post-enrollment. As an exploratory aim, for the subset of participants on 
continuous glucose monitors (approx. 30% of expected population), we will also examine 
PRISM’s effect on sensor glucose time in range. A1C and time in range will be assessed for 
a total duration  of 12 months post-intervention.
2.Evaluate PRISM’s efficacy in improving diabetes distress.  Self-reported adherence and 
other Patient-Reported Outcomes  (PROs), including resilience and quality of life will also be

assessed by adolescents and their caregivers. Hypothesis: PRISM will be associated  with

life,benefit-findingand self-reported  adherence 6-months  post-intervention compared to usual 
care.
  
2.Background
2.1. Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge:
  
Over a third of adolescents with T1D face elevated diabetes-specific distress.1-3 
Diabetes distress, or negative  emotional response  to the burden of diabetes, is concerning  given  
its strong and established association  with poor glycemic  control.1,9-11 A potential explanation  
for elevated diabetes distress  is that adolescents lack skills to manage their  stressors. 
Several personal  resources  and skills are consistently associated  with resilience to stress, which 
may mitigate  negative  and facilitate positive  outcomes.28,32,33 These  include stress-management,  
problem-solving and goal-setting  skills, cognitive  reframing, and the ability to make  meaning  from 
adversity.17-21,34 We term this group of variables “resilience resources.”   Previous work in youth  
with T1D has shown  resilience  resources relate  to glycemic control, diabetes distress, and other 
important outcomes;17-21 hence,  skills-based  interventions bolstering resilience resources may 
improve both diabetes distress  and A1C.35-38 
The Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) Intervention has the potential 
to reduce distress in a feasible, age-appropriate intervention while improving health 
outcomes in adolescents  with T1D.  PRISM was developed based  on stress  and coping theory 
to be a brief, disease non-specific, skills-based intervention  targeting  adolescent resilience 
resources (Table  1). PRISM  teaches 4 pillars  of resilience including  stress management, goal 
setting, cognitive restructuring  and benefit-finding in a one-on-one  training program consisting  of 
two, 45-60 minute sessions  and supported by 6-months of booster  sessions and a fully developed 
digital app for practice and tracking. A family session  follows the individual  sessions and was 
designed for the adolescent to communicate  to his/her caregiver(s) the skills learned, and how 
the caregiver(s) could best support  ongoing practice. Results from a pilot randomized  controlled 
trial (RCT) in cancer suggest PRISM is associated  with improved adolescent distress and 
resilience scores.31 Despite  differences in illness acuity, these themes  are also relevant to 
adolescents with T1D and have been  reported  to be desirable in this population.29

2.2. Relevant preliminary data:1
  
 Preliminary  studies. Our central  hypothesis  is that promoting resilience resources will improve  
outcomes for adolescents  with T1D.  We define  “resilience  resources”  as several modifiable 
factors of cognitive,  emotional and physical well-being, including individual  perceptions of stress, 
and abilities to set goals and find meaning  from adversity.39  We have followed a step-wise 
approach to investigate our hypothesis.   
Concept development. First, we conducted  cross-sectional, mixed-methods studies across 
diverse populations of chronic/serious  illness to explore the construct  of resilience in association  
with distress  and health  outcomes. Our research group consistently  confirmed associations 
between lower  resilience resources,  higher distress,  and worse health outcomes.21,23,25,40 
In adolescents with diabetes specifically, low resilience was associated with higher distress, lower 
quality of life, and poorer glycemic  control.21 Prospective, longitudinal  studies established 
evidence for resilience  resources buffering the effect of stress  on worsening glycemic control, 
thereby serving as a protective factor.25,26,28,41 Subsequent  thematic analyses in adolescents with 
cancer suggested  that adolescents endorse the need  for strong resilience resources, but that they 
lack the skills.22  
 Intervention Development.  These studies provided rationale for the design  of a novel 
intervention to promote resilience  resources,  “Promoting Resilience in Stress 
Management” (PRISM, Table 1).29 PRISM  is based on stress  and coping theory,42 our prior 
research, and successful  interventions  described in other  populations.43-45 It is disease non-
specific and manualized (i.e., it has been standardized  via comprehensive protocols). The initial 
design was refined  with expert  opinion and interviews with adolescent patients, psychologists, 
and social workers.  PRISM’s overall objective  is to increase  resilience  resources  at times of high 
stress, thereby giving adolescents skills to alleviate distress, and improve health  outcomes.  
Feasibility and Acceptability of PRISM. We completed a formative  study  of PRISM among 
adolescents with T1D and cancer  to determine  the optimal  content and timing of PRISM 
sessions.29 We found it to be feasible  and highly valuable to adolescent patients and 
parents. Eighty percent of participants  completed  the intervention and feedback was universally 
positive. One primary disease-specific difference emerged: participants with diabetes preferred 
fewer but longer sessions whereas  those with cancer  preferred more frequent, shorter  sessions.

Thus, the four PRISM  intervention pillars were combined into two sessions for the diabetes 
participants. We successfully trained 3 interventionists (all research associates (RAs) with 
undergraduate degrees). Each underwent at least 8 hours of training, and tracking of per-patient 
intervention delivery time suggested  4 hours  of face-to-face time, 2 hours tracking/scheduling, 
and up to 2 hours of fidelity  review (total ~8 hours per patient).
PRISM Pilot RCT (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 02340884).  Next, in a pilot RCT of PRISM in 
adolescents and young adults (AYA)  with cancer, we refined processes of enrollment,  
randomization, implementation,  and data collection. We completed our target enrollment of 100 
AYAs with cancer ahead  of schedule, with a 78% enrollment rate. Final  pilot results suggest the 
intervention was associated with improved patient-reported resilience  and distress with 
moderate effect sizes.31 
 PRISM App Development. Finally,  a digital app has been  designed, developed and beta-
tested specifically  for adolescents, providing  supplemented practice and resources throughout 
the intervention. The app was designed and built by two Seattle-based companies  [Artefact 
(artefactgroup.com) and General  UI (generalui.com)], prior PRISM recipients, and the SCH Digital 
Health team.   The current  platform  is available for iOS and Android programs  and includes the 
same practice opportunities  (e.g., directed practice with goal-setting,  journaling of gratitudes, etc.) 
as paper-pencil worksheets.  The digital  interface also allows  study staff to track how frequently  
users open each  practice page, how long they stay on it, and how they use it over time. The app 
is not available on the app store,  so the study  team can closely  monitor  how and when it is 
disseminated.
  
2.3. Scientific  or scholarly background:
  
Practical challenges limit the success and generalizability of traditional behavioral 
interventions. Time commitments  associated with traditional psychological interventions like 
cognitive behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  can be prohibitive for adolescents. The average refusal rate 
for CBT in adolescent chronic disease  settings is 37%;  subsequent attrition  is up to 32%, meaning  
over half of patients  offered  CBT fail to initiate or complete the intervention.46 While  many  
interventions designed for adolescents with T1D have been reported,37,38,47,48 most  fall within  the 
traditional CBT model  requiring  in-person sessions spanning several  weeks, and facilitation by a 
mental health professional  with an advanced  degree. These limit the generalizability  of who is 
able to enroll and complete  all sessions, and also impacts the overall cost-effectiveness. Shorter 
skills-based interventions  with booster content  delivered remotely  may be more successful in 
adolescents.49,50 
Stress and coping  theory42 provides an excellent model for intervention development . 
The stress  and coping theory suggests three categories of resources to reduce distress and 
maintain well-being  during  illness:  1) dispositional factors, 2) situational  factors  such as stress  
management and goal-setting,  and 3) coping process to create positive meaning (i.e., cognitive 
reframing).44 Each of these  impacts appraisals  of stressors and the means to cope effectively with 
stress. While  dispositional  factors  may be difficult to change, the Promoting Resilience in Stress  
Management (PRISM)  intervention will teach  the skills  aligned  with situational factors and coping  
processes which will help participants  appraise disease-related stressors  in a more  adaptive way 
and use more  effective coping strategies which we hypothesize will lead to improved disease  
outcomes. “Disease outcomes”  in our case  includes  both A1C and diabetes distress and the

original figure should not have included the arrows  leading from one to another.  
In addition  to stress  and coping theory, the proposed intervention  aligns with the Diabetes 
Resilience Model.20 Developed  by co-I Hilliard,  this diabetes-specific model of resilience 
for adolescents with T1D posits that enhancing  individual  strengths (referred  to in this 
proposal as “resilience  resources”)  helps  adolescents manage  stressors  and risk factors 
(diabetes-specific and general sources  of stress) in order to achieve positive outcomes. 
The positive outcomes include psychological/behavioral outcomes (e.g., diabetes  
distress) and clinical outcomes (e.g.,  A1C). This diabetes-specific model  complements the 
stress and coping  theory as outlined in the revised Figure 1. Our analytic  strategy reflects 
this figure.

A1C was selected as the primary  outcome as it is the gold standard  of overall diabetes-related  
health status and for its known  association  with diabetes  distress.1,9,11 Given  the known limitations 
of A1C as a clinically meaningful  outcome, however, we will also evaluate participant time in range 
(70-180 mg/dl) for those  using CGM as it is more specific and sensitive than traditional  A1C testing 
(i.e. an intervention  that addresses  acute  instances  of hypo- or hyperglycemia  may be detected  
in a time in range  assessment  but not in an A1C assessment).51 Additionally,  time in range may 
be more likely to associate with PROs compared  with A1C given its overall representation  of 
patient experience.51 Diabetes distress  was selected  given strong evidence  that distress is linked

5.Procedures Involved
5.1. Study  design:8
  
This is a 4-year, multi-site RCT of PRISM compared to usual care among adolescents with 
T1D and clinically  elevated  distress scores (PAID-T≥307,52). We intend to enroll 250 adolescents 
and after ensuring they meet the rest of the eligibility  criteria, expect to randomize 160-176 people.  
We will use a stratified randomization scheme  with 1:1 allocation  to PRISM or usual care (n=80-
88 each).  Randomization will be stratified by sitePRISM-assigned adolescents will be scheduled 
for two PRISM standard  sessions  (one-on-one skills-based sessions directed at stress-
management, goal-setting,  positive reframing,  and meaning-making), followed by one “Coming 
Together” session (facilitated  family-meeting during which the adolescent may share what  was 
learned). All sessions will be offered  in-person,  by web-based  video chat, or over the phone at a 
time interval of every 2 weeks. Boosters (1:1 check-in sessions with the interventionist probing 
about progress and roadblocks)  will be delivered every 2 weeks until 3-months post enrollment,  
at which  point they will be offered monthly  until the end of month 6. The digital app (and/or  paper 
worksheets) will be available  throughout the intervention, but will not include individualized 
communication through the app. Surveys will be collected from adolescents in both arms upon

enrollment and every 3 months  for 12 months.   Finally, A1C will be collected at each clinic visit 
and continuous  glucose monitor (CGM) data (where applicable) will be collected.  
  
5.2. Research procedures:9
  
Intervention Protocol and Procedures. Upon  enrollment, participants will complete  baseline  
questionnaires and an Hba1c dried  blood  spot at-home test kit (if A1c is not available  in the chart 
in the prior 4 weeks) and then will be randomized 1:1 to PRISM or usual care.  Patients will receive 
a study schedule that outlines study  procedures based on whether they are assigned to PRISM 
or usual  care. Standard  psychosocial  support  (usual care) will be offered regardless of 
randomization. In order to provide the blood spot,  the participant or their parent will need to do a 
finger poke using  the lancet provided  within the test kit. The blood collection lancet is an FDA 
510K cleared device,  which is what the patient  will use to poke their finger  and collect the blood 
on the paper. The test itself is cleared  by the FDA as a moderately complex test (under lab test 
regulations). The blood spot cards we will be utilizing (Whatman  903 cards)  are approved  by the 
FDA as Class II devices. 
PRISM Intervention.  The total intervention consists of two, approx. 45-90 minute, one-on-one 
sessions approximately 2-4 weeks apart. The goal of the intervention is to teach resilience 
resource skills for use in current or future stressful situations. Each session covers two topics  as 
described in Table  1. A 3rd session follows, which includes both the adolescent  and participating 
caregiver(s) (“Coming  Together”).  Although the intervention framework  is not disease-specific,  
diabetes-specific examples  will be provided  for each topic  to enhance the relevance of the skills 
to participants’  daily diabetes-related stressors. A trained research associate  (RA) conducts the 
intervention, as described in previous models and our pilot studies.29,53 The 1st session occurs  
within 2 weeks of enrollment,  ideally in-person (alternative  formats listed below) and in conjunction 
with the enrollment  visit. The 2nd and 3rd sessions are scheduled approximately  every 2-4 weeks 
around the participant’s preferences. There can be flexibility with combining or separating PRISM  
skills based on patient preference (e.g., participant  becomes fatigued after stress management 
component, goal-setting can occur during a separate scheduled time). When visits cannot  be 
conducted in-person, alternatives include web-based video chat (i.e., webex, skype, zoom, 
whatsapp), or by phone/conference  call. Following the 3rd session through  week  12, participants 
receive bi-weekly “booster”  contacts (1:1 check-in  sessions by telephone with the interventionist)  
to practice/refresh skills  and check-ins  on how skills have  been utilized. These boosters will then 
be delivered monthly  in months 4-6. In addition, all AYA PRISM  participants have access  to the 
digital PRISM app, which  offers  an interactive practice and tracking  interface  to continue  
enhancing skills.  While the app provides additional opportunities  to practice the skills they have 
learned in-person, there is no personalized communication provided in the app between  the 
interventionist and participant.  The participant  is not required to use the app (paper-pencil  
worksheets are also available  for those who do not want to use an app).
Interventionist Training  and Fidelity.  PRISM has been standardized through the creation  of 
comprehensive interventionist  protocols. All interventionists  undergo at least 4 hours  of in-person 
training including role-playing, dynamic  feedback, and mock sessions. The fidelity  of sessions will 
be systematically assessed  via audio-recording.  Any session can be audio-recorded with the 
participant’s permission.   A PI or lead interventionist will review the first 3, and then 1 in 6 randomly 
selected sessions conducted  by each interventionist  throughout the course  of the interventions.  
Recordings will be scored  for fidelity with a standardized tool. Interventionists will receive

feedback regarding adherence to protocol and approach will be refined as needed. A lead 
interventionist will provide  debriefing counsel  to all interventionists. The lead interventionist will 
also supervise cross-site  calls on a monthly basis to problem-solve and discuss  fidelity  challenges 
to help standardize  interventionist  responses  to the unexpected.
Usual Care.  Families in both randomization  arms will receive usual medical  care for diabetes,  
including access  to psychosocial care provided by the mental health professionals  affiliated with 
the diabetes clinic  if needed.  At SCH, screening  for diabetes  distress and depression  using 
standardized tools is performed  for all patients  13 years  old and above and social work is offered 
on an annual basis. TCH standard care includes  routine depression symptom screening by 
diabetes care providers,  as well as at least annual social work assessments including interview-
based screening for psychosocial  stressors  and diabetes-related distress.  For both sites, every  
diabetes patient is cared for by a team of diabetes specialists which includes a provider (MD,  
Physician Assistant and/or  Nurse  Practitioner), diabetes educator,  and social worker. 
Subspecialty referrals  for additional mental  health,  nutritional or other support are made  at the 
discretion of the primary diabetes  provider. 
Upon completion of the study, all participants  in the usual care arm will be given access  to the 
PRISM app. The app contains  self-directed teachings of the 4 pillars but there  is no personal  
teaching or check-ins from an interventionist. The app can be used indefinitely.
  
5.3. Data sources that will be used  to collect data about subjects:10
  
Instruments. The objective of this proposal is to determine the clinical  value of the PRISM  
intervention among adolescents with T1D and their families. Specifics  for the proposed measures, 
by Aim, are below  and in Table 2a and 2b.
Aim 1 Measures. HbA1C is collected  at every in-person  clinic visit as standard  of care across  
both sites from trained medical staff drawing blood  samples using the fingerstick  method. Blood 
assays are analyzed immediately using  the DCA 2000 Hemoglobin HbA1C system  (Siemens-
Bayer). Patients with virtual  clinic visits and/or no Hba1c recorded  within the prior 4 weeks  will 
collect a dried blood spot sample  and mail to the central in advance of their appointment.  The 
HbA1c on filter paper is extracted  and measured  on the Vitros 4600 HbA1c  assay.  This assay  is 
correlated with the DCA 2000.  Although we will not have a central lab, both sites are using the 
same point-of-care machines  and lab tests which alleviates  the cost-burden  of a central lab and 
also mimics other large, multisite studies (e.g., T1D Exchange and SEARCH for Diabetes in 
Youth).HbA1C will be tracked  at each visit after enrollment  from their medical  record  or an at-
home A1c blood spot test kit will be provided for the patient, which  has been  routinely incorporated  
into care at Seattle  Children’s  since May of 2020.  Given  recent consensus reports  recommending 
attention to additional glycemic metrics beyond HbA1c,  for those patients using CGMs,  we will 
also collect time in range  (percentage of readings in the range of 70–180 mg/dL).51 All CGM data 
will be downloaded using standard CGM  device-reading  software available.Patients  will be asked 
to share  their CGM code with us the same way they do with their providers, which is part of usual 
clinical care.

Aim 2 Measures. Diabetes distress  will be assessed with the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale 
(Teen Version) (PAID-T), a 14-item scale assessing  the perceived  emotional burden of living with 
diabetes.7,52 Clinically meaningful cut-points have been reported52 and this tool is used  as part of 
clinical care in the SCH Diabetes Clinic. It is the only measure of diabetes  distress developed and 
validated purposely for use with adolescents  and measures emotional  distress  related to the 
challenges of living with type 1 diabetes more specifically than measures of general distress  or 
depressive symptoms. The parent-version  will be administered to assess  parental distress  about 
his/her child’s  diabetes.  Self-reported  resilience will be measured with the 10-item version of the 
Connor-Davidson Resilience  Scale  (CD-RISC).54,55 This instrument has excellent psychometric 
properties and has been validated and used in adolescent  populations,56 including  in diabetes.29  
Adolescent and parent  participants will each complete  this scale  assessing their own resilience. 
Adolescents’ diabetes-specific “strengths” (i.e., positive behaviors and attitudes related to the 
challenges of living with T1D)  will be assessed with the Diabetes  Strengths and Resilience 
measure (DSTAR),  a 12-item self-report  measure  with strong psychometric properties.41 Only 
adolescents will complete  the DSTAR, and there are two versions (one for 13-17  and one for 
18+). Adolescent benefit-finding  will be measured with the Benefit Finding Scale For Children 
(BFSC),57 which is a 10-item  instrument with good psychometric properties, which  has been 
utilized to assess benefit-finding in pediatric patients,  including adolescents with type 1 diabetes.58 
Adolescents will complete  the BFSC. Adolescent depressive symptoms  will be measured with the 
8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), a widely  used instrument among general 
populations and patients with chronic  illness.59-61This instrument has excellent psychometric

properties.60,62 The adolescents will fill out the PHQ-8. Diabetes-specific quality of life will be 
assessed using the adolescent self-report version of the Type 1 Diabetes and Life (T1DAL) 
Measures which assesses diabetes-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for people  with 
type 1 diabetes (T1D). Parents will complete the parent-version  which assesses their own 
HRQOL.63 The Self-Care Inventory-Short Form (SCI-SF)  and the Diabetes  Self Management 
Questionnaire (DSMQ)  will be used  to assess self-reported adherence. The SCI-R is a 14-item 
measure assessing perceptions of adherence to diabetes  self-care recommendations over the 
previous 1–2 weeks, which has been  adapted to a 9-item shorter  form to include only the aspects  
of adherence that relate to diabetes  control64,65 SCI-R assesses four domains of adherence 
behaviors (monitoring,  insulin, diet, and exercise) and has been consistently reported as a 
meaningful measure of self-reported adherence.65-67 In collaboration with the authors  of the SCI-
R, this measure has been abbreviated  and slightly modified to reflect current diabetes technology.  
Adolescents will complete a self-report version of the modified SCI-R (i.e., the SCI-SF), and 
parents will complete a parent-report version to assess parent’s perspectives of their child’s 
adherence. The DSMQ is a validated  9-item questionnaire which  assesses adherence to diabetes  
self-management tasks.68 Adolescents  will complete a self-report version of the DSMQ, and 
parents will complete a parent-report  version. The DSMQ has been used as a brief measure of 
self-management in studies of pediatric  patients  with type 1 diabetes.69 Family conflict  and family  
impact will be used to assess the burden of diabetes  on family dynamics  using validated  tools. 
Family conflict (Diabetes Family Conflict Scale, Revised, DFCS-R) is assessed from both the 
parent and adolescent perspective, and family impact (Diabetes Family Impact  Scale, DFIS)  is 
assessed only from the parent perspective.70,71 Transition-readiness  is relevant to this age group 
and will be assessed with the READDY, a tool that is used in the diabetes clinics  to assess 
readiness to transition to adult care.72 Adolescents only (not parents) will complete the READDY.  
The COVID-19 Impact Questionnaire is a 21-item, self-report questionnaire developed for this 
study to assess perceived impact  of the COVID-19 on adolescents and parents. Items assess 
worry/anxiety related to COVID-19, life events  as a result of COVID-19 (e.g.,  loss of job, missed 
school), lifestyle changes (e.g., social distancing), known  COVID-19  
symptoms/diagnoses/treatment of self and family  members, and perceived impact of COVID-19 
on diabetes management.  
Additional covariates. Demographic and clinical characteristics as well as information about 
healthcare utilization  and medical  technology  updates  will be assessed by chart  review and/or 
self-report including the participant’s diagnosis  date,  insulin  regimen, use of CGM,  comorbidities, 
insurance coverage, medications, and other patient demographics. We will assess family size, 
parent employment, education, race/ethnicity, insurance coverage,  and other socio-economic  
indices through the baseline  questionnaire.  Patient and parent demographics  will be collected at 
baseline only, and medical technology changes relevant to diabetes  management  will be 
assessed every 3 months.

5.4. Data to be collected,  including long–term follow– up data:11
  
Data collection and management. Systematic data collection,  quality control, and data-
management procedures will be implemented including: (1) protocols for data collection; (2) 
rigorous training and oversight  of study staff with ongoing monitoring of adherence to protocols; 
(3) regular  review  of questionnaire  response  rates and missing items  to identify and correct 
problems; (4) verification  of all data through computerized data entry systems restricting 
invalid/out-of-range responses; and, (5) weekly team meetings and progress reports to provide  
feedback to study staff concerning  difficulties  and follow-up to ensure problems are resolved 
quickly. 
A1C and CGM data: Study staff will take extra steps to ensure primary outcome data is 
obtained. This will include careful  tracking of all participants to ensure regular clinic visits are 
scheduled and attended, and reminder  phone  calls and texts prior to the appointment. In cases  
where the 3-month  window  is passed,  participants  will be reminded to schedule their Standard of 
Care appointment  and/or  transferred to Seattle Children’s  scheduling department.  If patients  are 
not scheduled for a standard care appointment and/or the clinic is not offering  labs due to COVID-
19, an at-home A1c test kit will be mailed  to the families to ensure collection of A1c data. Families 
will return  mailed kits  to the CLIA-Certified  laboratory  at each respective institution  (i.e., Seattle 
Children’s or Texas Children’s).

Survey data: To optimize collection, all participant surveys will be available  by paper  or online 
via the REDCap system,  a secure  HIPAA-compliant,  high-quality  data collection tool. To ensure 
data quality,  a RA will review  surveys for their completion for missing fields or this will be set up 
for automation within RedCap.  
Medical record data:  RAs will collect  and upload  CRF data quarterly during the 12 months the 
patient is on study and will include a CRF for the previous diabetes-related visit in closest proximity  
to the date of enrollment  (in instances  in which the patient is not seen  by a provider during the 
enrollment period).  To ensure  reliability and validity of abstracted  medical  record data, we will use 
our current methods for training and quality control, including guided practice  abstraction and 
independent abstraction with reconciliation by a medical Co-I (DeSalvo/Malik). A 10% random 
sample will be dual abstracted.  
  
6.Data and Biospecimen Banking12
6.1. Complete  list of the data and/or biospecimens to be included in the bank:13
  
Surveys, CRFs (e.g., medical record data), a1c results, and audio transcriptions  will be 
coded and labelled with study  ID numbers by the study team. 
  
6.2. Location of data and/or  biospecimen storage:14
  
All will be stored in original (hard copy) forms in locked  cabinets (where relevant) and/or
password-protected secure databases  (for all electronic survey data). At-home test kit 
A1c data will be stored per laboratory protocols at each respective institution.  
  
6.3. List of those with direct access to data and/or  biospecimens in the bank:
  
Data will not be shared  outside the group of investigators conducting the study at SCH 
and BCM/TCH. When other investigators are interested in new analyses, the PIs will 
verify they have IRB approval to conduct additional  analyses and will be added  to the 
study team. Coded study data will be banked indefinitely for future use by the group of 
investigators conducting the study  and access will be controlled by the PI’s. Future  
studies will formally test the dissemination and implementation potential  of the 
intervention once its efficacy is confirmed.
  
6.4. Length of time data and/or biospecimens will be stored in the bank:
  
Original surveys will be saved for 10 years or until final analyses  are completed, 
whichever occurs last, in order to ensure data quality. Coded electronically saved study 
data will be banked indefinitely for future  use by the group of investigators conducting 
the study and access  will be controlled  by the PIs.
  
6.5. Procedures for protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the subjects from whom the data 
and/or biospecimens were collected:15
  
Per 6.1, all banked  data will be coded and labelled with only study ID numbers, not 
identifying information.  
  
6.6. How the data and/or  biospecimens will be made available for future use:

Investigators interested in conducting analyses  will need to contact 
the PI and have  IRB approval to conduct  analyses.
  
6.6.2. Format in which  data and/or biospecimens will be provided: 
  
Deidentified/coded study database.
  
6.6.3. Process for investigators to request data and/or biospecimens:16

6.6.4. Restrictions on future use:17
  
There are no restrictions  on future use of de-identified, banked data.
  
6.6.5. Plan for providing data results from banked data/biospecimens:
  
Results of initial analyses will be shared with participants if participants 
request on the consent form that they would like a summary of study results. 
A1C data will be placed in patient’s  chart at Seattle Children’s and sent to 
individual providers  at BCM/TCH with oversight from study site 
endocrinologists Malik  and DeSalvo for each  respective institution.There is 
no plan for results from banked data to be shared with participants.
  
7.Sharing of Results 
7.1. Plan to share  results with subjects/others:18
  
For Phase  1 (Screening),  data will not be shared outside the group of investigators 
conducting the study at SCH  and BCM/TCH. If other investigators are interested  in analyses 
with screening  data,  the PIs will verify  they have IRB approval to conduct analyses. Coded  
screening data will be banked indefinitely for future use by the group of investigators conducting 
the study and access  will be controlled  by the PIs. Participants will not be informed of their 
specific PAID-T results  in Phase  1, however, participants will be immediately made aware if they 
are eligible  for Phase  2 based  on their survey results. 
For Phase  2 (Full Study), at SCH, data collected from at-home A1c test kits will be 
entered into the patient’s chart as a lab that was performed and will be available to clinical  
providers (as this same test is standard of care for tele-health visits  at SCH). At BCM/TCH,  
data collected  from at-home A1c test kits will be sent to individual providers via EPIC with a 
description of the A1C test, how it was collected, and BCM/TCH laboratory validation  (since this 
test is not standard  of care at BCM/TCHPatients and parents will be notified of this during the 
consent conference.  Other  data will not be shared outside the group of investigators conducting 
the study at SCH and BCM/TCH.When other  investigators are interested  in new analyses, the 
PIs will verify  they have  IRB approval to conduct additional analyses. Coded study data will be 
banked indefinitely for future  use by the group of investigators conducting the study and access  
will be controlled by the PI’s.   Future  studies will formally test the dissemination  and 
implementation potential  of the intervention once its efficacy is confirmed.  If indicated  by 
participants, a summary of the primary analyses  will be shared at the study closure.

9.Study Population19
9.1. Inclusion criteria for each  subject  population (e.g., patients, parents,  providers):
  
We will recruit  adolescents and their caregivers from diabetes clinics  at SCH and BCM/TCH. 
Adolescents will be eligible if:
They are 13-18 years old
Diagnosed with T1D >=12 months
Elevated distress  score (PAID-T>=30)***** (within the prior 12 months)
Speak  English fluently
Cognitively able to participate in intervention sessions and complete written  surveys.
*****Please note that at BCM/TCH, screening for distress is not Standard of Care.  Therefore, we 
will complete a screening informed consent  (if patient is present in clinic) or an information  sheet 
(if patient is not present in clinic) for patients at BCM/TCH that meet all other  criteria  and then

proceed with the PAID-T screener (via paper/pencil,  verbally,  or REDCap). We call this “Phase 
1” of the consenting process. In Phase 1, PAID-T will only be completed  by adolescents.
If interested,  those with an elevated distress score  (PAID-T>=30) will move onto the full informed 
consent process,  will be enrolled on the full study (i.e., “Phase 2” of the consenting process), and 
will go on to complete  baseline questionnaires and be randomized.  Those  who complete the 
screening informed  consent, take the screener (i.e., the PAID-T) and are not eligible for “Phase 
2” of the consent processes (i.e., PAID-T < 30) will be given a $5 gift card.  They will not complete 
the baseline  questionnaires  or be randomized.  At SCH, this process will be followed if a current  
PAID-T (i.e., administered within the prior 12 months) is not available  at the time of consent. For 
all who complete the PAID-T screener as part of “Phase 1” consenting process, PAID-T score  will 
be used as the baseline value. 
Caregivers  will be eligible  for the survey completion if: 
Adolescent of parent or guardian  agrees to participate  in study
Adolescent participant provides verbal  assent or verbal consent  if 18 or 
over for parent or guardian to complete  surveys.
Parent/Guardian is cognitively  and physically  able to participate
Parent/Guardian is able to speak and read English or Spanish  language
Parent/Guardian participant has signed  informed  consent  for study  
participation
Caregivers will be eligible  for the “Coming together” session if: 
Adolescent of parent or guardian  agrees to participate  in study
Adolescent of parent or guardian  has been  randomized to the PRISM 
intervention arm of the study
Adolescent participant provides verbal  assent or verbal consent  if 18 or 
over for parent or guardian to complete  ‘Coming  together’ session 
Parent/Guardian is cognitively  and physically  able to participate
Parent/Guardian is able to speak English or Spanish language
Parent/Guardian participant has signed  informed  consent  for study  
participation

9.3. Populations with special considerations, involved in the study:20
☒ Children/Teenagers21
Risk assessment specific to this vulnerable  population  and additional safeguards:22
Individuals who are not yet adults (children,  teenagers): Pediatric patients with serious 
illness are at risk for poor outcomes and may benefit  from resilience-enhancing 
interventions in the future. We justify the inclusion  of children in this project  because  the 
implementation of those interventions requires feasibility information  and patient 
feedback. This study will provide those crucial  data.  Patients enrolling in this study  may, 
in fact, benefit from the intervention; however, at the time of consent, we will ensure  that 
all patients and families  understand  the objective  of this study are to test the feasibility of 
this intervention such that it may be used prospectively in the future (see risks/benefits 
above).

10.Number of Subjects
10.1. Total  number  of subjects to be enrolled locally:29
  
N=90
  
10.2. Total  number  of subjects to be enrolled across all participating sites:30
  
N=250
  
10.3. Number of screened subjects versus the actual number enrolled in the research:31
  
Using the eligibility criteria age, A1C, and language against our existing databases at 
SCH, we estimate over 200 eligible adolescents  will be screened at each of the two 
sites.
  
10.4. Power analysis:
  
Our focus  for sample size 
estimation is the primary 
outcome (Aim 1): A1C at 6-
months. Sample size is 
based on data from the T1D 
population relevant to age 
and distress levels, suggesting A1C scores  are normally distributed with a mean of 
9.11.9.7,52 Assuming 20% attrition based  on prior trials,29,31 we will randomize 160-
176 adolescents  (80-88 per arm) to obtain  an evaluable total sample size of 100 
participants (50 per arm). This sample  size achieves 80% power to detect a minimum 
difference of 1.1 in the mean 6-month A1C,  based on two independent samples  t-test. 
Minimally detectable differences for A1C and diabetes distress  (PAID-T)  based on 50 
subjects per arm are shown in Table  3. Table 3. Detectable  differences in select  outcomes between

11.Withdrawal of Subjects
11.1. Anticipated circumstances  under which subjects will be withdrawn  from the research without 
their consent:
  
In this intention-to-treat analysis plan, all participants who fill out a baseline  
survey and have a baseline A1c (either collected through medical  record or A1c 
at-home test kit) will be included  in analyses.   As above, withdrawal will be 
determined by study staff only in the event of medical complications  or death. We 
may also withdraw patients  who do not complete surveys or an A1c within six 
weeks of enrollment.  In rare instances in which the patient/family  encounters a 
mailing issue, we will extend  a 2-week grace  period.  Subjects who withdraw will 
be asked to complete  a short survey  which will simply be a question  as to why 
they have decided to withdraw from the study.
  
11.2. Procedures for orderly termination:
  
We will inform  the family  with a phone  call from an RA or investigator (followed up by 
a written letter or email  from the PI) that they are no longer on study.
  
11.3. Procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including  partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection and withdrawal from 
data/biospecimen banking:
  
Response to the intervention will be determined upon study completion (not in “real-
time,”).  All participants, including those on the intervention arm, will continue  to receive 
usual care, including as-needed referrals  for professional psychology services.  
All participants may choose to withdraw from the study at any time.  We will track date 
of discontinuation  and request a brief reason to be recorded for tracking  purposes.    To 
ensure primary outcome  data, we will offer an abbreviated survey  with only the PAID  
and CD-RISC for those who do not complete  all assessments or who request to drop 
out.
In the event of serious medical complications (or death) precluding participation,  
participants will be censored after 2 months  of missing data. In all other cases (non-
completion of surveys without serious  medical complications or death), staff will 
continue to request  surveys or at-home  A1c test kits until 6 weeks following each  
timepoint.
Unless explicitly indicated by participants who withdraw their consent, data collected 
from participants up to the time of withdrawal  will be maintained and utilized in analyses,  
and study staff will continue to request follow-up surveys as determined  by the protocol. 
For participants who request abbreviated survey  packets, we will oblige (see section  
14.2).

12.Risks  to Subjects
12.1. Reasonably foreseeable risks to subjects (include each study population, each arm, and 
optional procedures): 
  
Adolescents with high distress and/or depressive symptoms. Patients who screen 
for high distress and/or high depressive  symptoms regardless of their decision to enroll 
in the study may have their scores shared with a member  of their local diabetes team 
per departmental standard operating procedures. The diabetes  provider  will use relevant 
clinic-specific procedures and his/her discretion  to determine what next steps,  if any, are 
indicated (e.g., social work consult, referral to psychology) with the family. We may also 
reach out to the patient and/or parent to check in and/or provide community/hospital 
resources.
Adolescents with high A1c. The study endocrinologist (Malik (SCH) & DeSalvo 
(BCM/TCH)) will be alerted if a patient  takes an at-home A1c test for research purposes  
and score >14%. The study endocrinologist  will then contact the patient’s primary 
diabetes provider to alert the provider of this patient’s score,  and the diabetes provider 
will use relevant clinic-specific procedures and his/her discretion to determine next 
steps. 
A1c At-Home Test Kit. Patients  would  be asked to do a self needle poke on three 
occasions (Baseline, 6 months,  12 months) in order to complete their A1c at home test 
kits. When doing a needle poke, some people  may get a small bruise that will go away  in 
a day or two. Some people may feel dizzy or faint.  There is also a very small chance that 
the patient could get an infection  where the needle pokes  the skin.These risks will be 
outlined in the consent documents  and potential participants would be made aware of 
these risks during  the consent conference. 
PRISM. The intervention (“Promoting Resilience in Stress  Management”, PRISM) and 
our surveys may address sensitive matters  in that it they patients to identify stressors 
and negative thoughts.  Adolescent participants  may be prompted  to think  about the 
threat to their future  posed  by their diabetes.  During  the coming together  session and/or 
while completing surveys, parent(s)/caregiver(s)  may be prompted  to think about  the 
threat to their child’s future by diabetes.  The topics to be covered may provoke sadness, 
anxiety, depression, fear or doubt  for adolescents  and/or  their parent(s)/caregiver(s).  
Administrators of the intervention will be trained to immediately inform  the patient’s  
primary social work and/or medical  teams if the patient and/or parents/guardians 
endorses thoughts  of self-harm or harm to others, per the clinic policy for responding to 
suicidal ideation. As part of their informed consent process, participants will be made 
aware of this policy, as well as the fact that confidentiality may be broken in the case that 
providers see an immediate threat to the patient’s or another’s safety. No physical risks 
are expected to arise  from the study.
The primary risk to participants will be concerns  about confidentiality,  and stress of 
discussing the topic of their or their child’s diabetes experience. While the potential risks 
to participants are low, we will take steps to ensure that all potential  risks are handled 
appropriately as described below.
Due to the nature of the PRISM intervention, all staff and participants will be unblinded 
from the time of randomization.

We recognize the unique risks of data collection for an adolescent population. The major 
risk is compromise of personal data. Thus, confidentiality procedures  for all data will be a 
priority for this study.  All  data will be maintained on secure servers accessed by secure  
computers or in locked  offices at Seattle Children’s Research  Institute (data collection 
center) or in CLIA-Certified laboratories at SCH and BCM/TCH (for A1c data). Data  and 
paper materials will be stored locally at BCM/TCH as well. The study results will be kept 
for at least ten years or until final analyses  are completed,  whichever occurs  last, in 
order to ensure data quality.  The  subject’s  consent  to use or share PHI does not expire.  
Access to the buildings  where the study  data will be kept at Seattle Children’s  Research  
Institute and BCM/TCH are limited  to authorized personnel.  The  Lead  RA and other  
researchers involved  in this project  have years of experience and has received ongoing 
training at Seattle Children’s Research Institute or BCM/TCH on confidentiality as well as 
HIPAA confidentiality standards.  Our and other previous trials have kept their data at 
Seattle Children’s Research Institute and BCM/TCH  in the recent  past, and the security 
and confidentiality  of the data have never  been  compromised.
  
12.2. Procedures with unforeseeable risks:
  
Although this study is considered low risk, the study  team has extensive 
experience running  the PRISM  intervention, and we have  not experienced 
unforeseeable risks. IF unanticipated  risks come to the attention  of study  staff,  
the DSMC will be alerted  and if concurrent  with federal law, IRB rules,  and/or 
the investigator manual/SOPs, will be reported as needed to the appropriate 
group(s) (i.e., IRB, DSMC, PI, etc.).
  
12.3. Procedures with risks to an embryo or fetus  should the subject be or become 
pregnant:
  
n/a
  
12.4. Risks to others  who are not subjects:
  
n/a
  
12.5. Procedures performed  to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks:
  
To mitigate  these risks, we will emphasize the voluntary nature of the study to 
adolescents and parents  and that the study will in no way impact or influence  clinical 
care.  We will let adolescents know that their information will be kept confidential and 
that transcripts will be de-identified and audio  recordings destroyed after transcribing. 
We will let patients know that their A1c data may be available to their providers. We will 
let adolescents  know that they can change their mind about participating and may 
decide to withdraw  from the study at any time.  
Each of the participating sites has significant  experience with clinic recruitment  for 
studies and has developed processes to ensure best practices  with each study  
participant recruitment. These procedures and scripts also emphasize that any potential  
coercion on the part of parents should  not take place, and that adolescents’  decision for 
or against participation in the study does not affect  the clinical care they receive.

The investigators and staff will be available to answer any questions  from potential 
participants via phone or email throughout the study. We will emphasize that the 
decision of whether or not to be part of this study  does not affect their ongoing care at 
their respective institutions.
 
13.Potential Benefits to Subjects
13.1. Potential benefits that individual  subjects may experience from taking part in the research:32
  
We hypothesize that patients who receive the intervention will have better clinical  and 
psychosocial/behavioral outcomes. However, there may be no direct benefit for 
participating in this study if our hypotheses are wrong.  More  broadly, information gained 
from this study may heighten the understanding of the adolescent diabetes  experience  
and elucidate strategies that foster resilience and promote better outcomes in this group 
of high risk patients.   These strategies could be extended to the care of other adolescent 
patients facing  other  chronic diseases. This research has the potential  to contribute to 
the research base concerning the promotion of optimal quality of life and mental  
wellness for all adolescent patients.   
  
14.Data Analysis/Management
14.1. Data analysis plan, including statistical procedures:
  
 Randomization.  The randomization algorithm will be constructed  by the study statisticians (Zhou 
and Bradford) using  a permuted blocks scheme with varying block sizes; randomization will be 
stratified by site. Study  staff will be blinded  to allocation until after enrollment.  
Analysis plan overview.  The primary statistical analyses will be intention-to-treat to avoid 
confounding by non-random  participant attrition. Clinical  characteristics including  A1C and time 
in range and items within the surveys will all be summarized at time of enrollment and at 3, 6, 9 
and 12-month  time points using descriptive  statistics:  frequencies and proportions  for categorical 
variables, means and standard deviations for continuous variables, or median and inter-quartile  
range if distribution is skewed.Demographic  characteristics will be collected and summarized  at 
baseline. All analyses  will be adjusted  for site and baseline  A1C,  as randomization is stratified by 
these variables.  In addition,  we will assess for confounding by a priori identified  variables 
associated with distress and A1C including age, gender, race, primary language spoken at home, 
parental education, insurance  status.  If any of these analyses suggest  confounding  or are clearly  
imbalanced between  groups,  subsequent  analyses  will be adjusted accordingly.
 Aim 1 primary  outcome is A1C at 6 months. Because the amount of change depends strongly 
on the initial  value  at baseline  we will control for baseline A1C as a covariate in the regression.  
We will treat A1C as a continuous  outcome and apply  linear regression model to estimate  the 
mean between-arm difference and 95% confidence interval.  The regression models will be 
specified as follows:
 where A1C is the outcome  𝐴1𝐶 ~ 𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆𝑀 +𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝐴1𝐶 +𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 +𝐶𝐺𝑀 +𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠,
at 6 months, PRISM is the intervention  indicator, baseline A1C, site, CGM status and other 
unbalanced confounders are the adjusted  covariates.  The coefficient of PRISM captures the 
adjusted mean differences  in A1C between intervention and control arms, and will be tested using 
Wald t-test. In addition to the cross-sectional analysis of A1C at 6 months,  we will also conduct 
repeated measures analysis using linear mixed effects models to examine the trajectories of A1C.  
This allows us a closer  inspection of how participants respond to PRISM over time and examine

Page 25 of 59
whether the intervention benefits persist over time.  The linear mixed  regression models will be 
specified as follows:  where  is 𝐴1𝐶𝑖𝑗~𝑏0𝑖+𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆 𝑀𝑖+𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗+𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆 𝑀𝑖×𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗+𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠, 𝐴1𝐶𝑖𝑗
the A1C level for subject i at time j,  is the subject specific random intercept to account for 𝑏0𝑖
within-subject correlation due to repeated  measures, and  is the group-by-time 𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆 𝑀𝑖×𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗
interaction term. When  is modelled as a discrete variable and baseline  is the reference time 𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗
point, the coefficients of the group-by-time interaction estimate the amount of differences  in 
changes at later time points relative to baseline. Significance of these coefficients will be assessed 
using confidence intervals, and p-values from F-tests based on ANOVA and Kenward-Roger 
method.73 
For time-in-range  (CGM  data), we will use a 2 group comparison of the change  from baseline 
in the percentage of sensor  values  in the target range (70-180  mg/dL)  using  a linear model  
adjusted for the baseline  value and factors used to stratify randomization.  All subjects with any 
CGM data will be included.   Residual values  will be exam ined for an appro ximate normal  
distribution. If values  are highly skewed then transform ation or non-param etric methods will be 
used instead.
 Aim 2. Secondary outcomes include mean scores at 6-months for the PAID-T, CD-RISC, D-
STAR, T1DAL , PHQ-8, BFSC, and SCI-R. We will model each outcome separately  following a 
similar approach  to the primary  analysis for Aim 1. 
Additional analyses and considerations.  We will conduct a thorough process  evaluation that 
includes: (a) intervention  fidelity; and, (b) satisfaction queries. Multiple comparisons are a concern 
since we are collecting multiple  measures  from participants and are interested  in several 
hypotheses. We minimize this problem  by specifying a limited  number of main  hypotheses  for 
each aim.  The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure will be used  to control the False Discovery Rate 
criterion at α=0.05  to correct  for multiple  testing in analyses that are not pre-specified.74 Likewise, 
in manuscripts  and presentations, we will report the number of tests performed and interpret 
results within  this context.   
Heterogeneity of treatment effects  (HTE) analysis.  We will conduct exploratory  analyses for 
additional heterogeneity  of treatment  effects.  This refers  to the non-random, explainable variability 
in the direction and magnitude of treatment effects  for individuals  within a population as we may 
be interested in identifying  subgroups that the intervention works  particularly well or poorly.  We 
plan to conduct  HTE analyses  mostly  through subgroup analysis. Examples of factors, alone or 
in combination,  that potentially could modify the intervention effects include baseline A1C,  CGM, 
language at home, or engagement with the intervention. Regression models similar to those 
outlined for Aims 1 and 2 will be applied to subgroups defined  by these factors. Note  these  
analyses are confirmatory and should  be interpreted with caution.
 Considerations regarding missing data.   Data  may be missing due to patients/families skipping 
individual survey  items, omissions  in medical records,  lack of follow-up, medical complications,  
or death.   We will quantify the amount of missing  data, evaluate the association of participant  
characteristics with missing  data, and minimize bias and increase efficiency in the associations 
of interest by applying  appropriate  methods to account for missing  data.75-77 For example, for 
outcomes where missing at random (MAR) is a plausible assumption, we will use multiple 
imputation or inverse probability  weighting, depending  on the statistical model being considered. 
For missing  not at random  (MNAR) data,  we will use sensitivity analyses. In all cases,  we will 
assess the robustness of estimates due to assumptions.

14.2. Quality control procedures  for collected data:33
  
For survey data, all participant surveys  will be available by paper or online via the 
REDCap system, a secure HIPAA-compliant, high-quality data collection tool. The 
rationale for offering both paper-pencil and electronic versions is based on our prior 
experience where  participants preferred the former,78 which  in turn facilitated  more 
complete data collection.  To ensure data quality, a RA will review for missing fields 
and call participants to clarify  and query/complete  individual missing items verbally.  
Data will be quality controlled by a double-checking mechanism (i.e., data double-
entry via REDCap  or double-entry/checking of manually entered  data).  
For medical record data, RA’s  will collect and upload CRF data at a frequency varying 
between 2 weeks and 6 months.To ensure reliability and validity of abstracted 
medical record data, we will use our current methods for training and quality control,  
including guided practice abstraction and independent abstraction  with reconciliation 
by a trainer.  A 10% random sample  will be dual abstracted.  A  RA assignment will 
monitor and reconcile case report forms with RedCap  data once  monthly.
 
15.Confidentiality34
15.1. Procedures to secure  the data and/or biospecimens during storage, use, and transmission:
  
All medical  record, health care utilization,  survey  data, and audio  transcriptions will be 
coded and labeled with study  identification  numbers.  All  will be stored in original (hard  
copy) forms  in locked cabinets (where relevant) and/or  password-protected secure 
databases (for all electronic survey data). A1c data will be entered  into the medical 
record (SCH) or sent to individual providers (BCM/TCH)  and stored in compliance  with 
each institutition’s  laboratory’s protocols  and procedures.  At SCH, samples for HbA1c 
(DBS) are stored for 1-2 months at -20 C. The SCH lab keeps current  and previous  
month samples, and  samples are discarded  at the first of the month.  The storage 
locations are in the clinical  lab in OC.10. Badge access is required to access  this floor. 
At BCM/TCH, samples will be discarded seven days after receipt and processing. 
Storage location is WT.BB1.100 and badge access is required for this space. Original 
surveys will be saved for 10 years or until final analyses are completed,  whichever 
occurs last, in order to ensure data quality.  No  identifiable patient information will be 
labeled on the surveys; all will be identified with a study-specific identifier with assigned  
identifier kept on a password protected  encrypted server. Coded electronically  saved  
study data will be banked  indefinitely  for future use by the group of investigators 
conducting the study and access  will be controlled by the PI’s.  PIs  will verify  that 
additional analyses have IRB approval.  Only study  staff with human subjects training will 
have access,  subject to approval by the PI.  No data will be withdrawn from the study  
database. Results of initial  analyses  will be shared with participants if participants  
request on the consent form that they would like a summary of study results.  When 
using web-based video chats for participant  interaction, we will not store  patient  data/PHI 
within the web based applications.  
Data will be stored in an electronic database  (REDCap -Research Electronic Data  
Capture) using the participant’s study  identifier. REDCap data collection projects rely on

a thorough study-specific data dictionary defined as an iterative self-documenting 
process by all members of the research team. We have conducted the iterative 
development and testing  process previously, resulting in well-planned data collection. 
REDCap servers are housed in a data center and all web-based information 
transmission is encrypted.  For the present study, we will use the REDCap system 
managed by the University of Washington Institute  for Translational Health Sciences 
(ITHS).  REDCap  was developed specifically around HIPAA-Security guidelines and is 
recommended to researchers at various institutions  by both Privacy Officers and 
Institutional Review  Boards. REDCap has been  disseminated for use locally  and at other  
institutions and currently supports over 300 academic/non-profit consortium partners on 
six continents  and over 20,000 research end-users  (www.project-redcap.org). The 
REDCap data record  may contain  some identifying information. Subjects will be tracked 
using their study identifier. The identifiable  data will be designated as “PHI” in the 
REDCap database which will allow us to exclude  access to the identifiable information 
as necessary.
When Zoom is used,  the following actions will be taken  to protect confidentiality  and 
privacy:
1.The latest version of Zoom that is available will be used.
2.The meeting  room will be set to private.
3.A password/passcode will be required for meeting entry. 
Note: The chat function will be utilized (as needed)  for individual  1:1 communication  
between coach and participant,  including sharing approved resources (e.g.,  PRISM 
cheatsheets), logistical  information about  PRISM  (e.g., PRISM app code), and 
communicating if there  are technical  difficulties. Chat may also be considered for use for 
session content  by patient request to accommodate specific needs (e.g., patient is 
unable to communicate verbally). No PHI would be communicated via chat at any time. 
  
15.2. Location where the data and/or  biospecimens will be stored:  
All will be stored in original (hard copy) forms in locked  cabinets (at local sites) and/or 
password-protected secure databases  (for all electronic survey data). A1c data will be 
stored in compliance  with each institution’s CLIA-certified laboratory policies and 
procedures. 
  
15.3. Length of time data and/or biospecimens will be stored:
  
10 years  or until final analyses  are completed, whichever occurs last.
  
15.4. Individuals with access to data and/or  biospecimens:
  
Only members of the study-team will have access.
  
15.5. Process for the transmission of data and/or biospecimens outside Seattle Children’s:
15.5.1. List of data and/or  biospecimens that will be transmitted:
  
Site RAs will maintain original copies of all consent forms and fax/email copies to 
the coordinating center for secure  storage and tracking purposes. Upon study

16.Provisions to Monitor Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects35
16.1. Plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms  and benefits to 
determine whether  subjects remain safe:36
  
This is a small multisite  clinical  trial of a supportive  care intervention  that presents no 
more than minimal risk. As such, data monitoring will be primarily carried  out by the Lead 
RA and a small Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). 
Safety monitoring will be the responsibility  of a 3-member  Data  Safety and Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC)  composed of professionals  representing different disciplines and 
expertise (see table  below). All members are independent of the protocol.  The  
committee will be convened at the beginning of the study and then twice  annually via 
conference calls, to provide input and guidance on the study evaluation and intervention  
protocols, including quality assurance  and safety issues  related to the protocols, as well 
as data handling activities. As above, in the event of an unanticipated patient death,  the 
committee may convene an ad-hoc session and/or suspend the study to assess  patient  
risk and/or necessary revisions  to the protocol.

16.2. Data reviewed  to ensure safety  of subjects:
  
DSMC members  will provide input and feedback  to the PI and Co-investigators,  via e-mail and 
conference calls, related to (a) accrual  rate, (b) study eligibility  determination  issues,  (c) data 
completion rates including  conformance with informed consent  requirements, (d) intervention 
fidelity indicators,  (e) adverse events, and (f) compliance with data management procedures.  Dr. 
Zhou (lead statistician) will oversee the summarization of online data to evaluate  data 
completeness and protocol  adherence. The Lead CRA  will also send semi-annual reports 
summarizing recruitment and other site specific data (such as indicators of intervention  delivery, 
occurrence of adverse  events, and conformance with IRB requirements).  
The committee will also receive information  on questionnaire data, presented  for the participants 
overall rather than by study  group. This study will not have pre-set stopping  rules,  but the DSMB 
will have the option of requesting  the data be unblinded and considering altering  the study or

stopping the study  early.   Although the full committee will meet  twice-yearly,  the PI or any member  
of the DSMB will be free to request to assemble the full committee at any time. Because  
committee members may be located  at various  sites, the committee meetings may be conducted 
by phone. 
Data safety  monitoring for the intervention will focus on assuring that subjects are not 
experiencing any significant or unexpected  distress and that they are satisfied  with the 
intervention components; we will monitor all complaints  about the study.   We do not anticipate 
stopping the study  early  for efficacy  or harm, but the DSMB will have the option  to consider such 
action in the event of a highly unexpected result. The DSMB will review the draft questionnaires 
to be sent to subjects  and review  any complaints that may be received from patients, family  
members, clinicians, or others.   We do not anticipate any external factors such as findings from 
ongoing trials that will affect the safety  of participants or the ethics of this research study.  
  
16.3. Safety information  collection procedures:
  
The DSMB, Lead RA and study team will regularly assess  confidentiality  of study  participants.  
The following  will be assessed and verified: All data will be maintained on secure computers in 
locked offices  at Seattle Children’s Research Institute (data collection center);  the participant 
(and caregiver) has signed informed consent  and HIPAA  forms; all standard 
confidentiality/privacy rules and guidelines  set by the Seattle Children’s Research Institute are in 
compliance. A Certificate  of Confidentiality  will be obtained.
  
16.4. Frequency of cumulative data review:
  
The committee will be convened at the beginning of the study and then twice annually  
via conference calls,  to provide input  and guidance  on the study  evaluation and 
intervention protocols, including quality assurance and safety issues related to the 
protocols, as well as data handling activities. 
  
16.5. Conditions that trigger an immediate suspension  of the research:
  
Given the non-invasive nature of our proposed  behavioral intervention and based on prior pilot 
studies,30,32 we expect minimal side effects  and safety concerns as a result of the PRISM 
intervention. Thus, there are no pre-planned stopping  rules for adverse events since these  are 
not anticipated.

There is no compensation for research-related injury.
  
19.Recruitment Methods40
19.1. When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:
  
Recruitment and retention will be promoted through a combination  of clinic-based approaches 
and strategies we have  successfully used previously. 
Research staff at both sites will screen  patients via review of clinic schedules and existing 
databases as well as via communication with clinicians,  followed by a medical chart review to 
verify all eligibility except  for diabetes distress  to inform the in-clinic recruitment. At SCH, diabetes  
distress is typically screened  at every  in-person visit (standard of care) for all patients  13+ using 
the PAID-T. Clinic infrastructure provides  instantaneous e-mail alerts to providers upon elevated 
scores. Our research team will be included in the e-mail notification  of all patients with elevated 
scores (≥30 per published guidelines  and mean  clinic data).7,52 Research staff will screen  these 
patients for other eligibility criteria and if eligible, will work with the provider team in clinic  (as 
available) or contact  the family by phone/video  conference call (WebEx,  Zoom,  or Skype)  to 
conduct a consent conference if the patient/family is interested. 
Both sites may also use a mail approach to aid in in-clinic screening and recruitment. Upon 
reviewing clinic schedules and databases and screening patients for eligibility  on criteria noted 
in the medical  record or clinic databases  (e.g., age, diagnosis, duration),  patients will be mailed 
a letter  in advance  of their clinic visit or sent a letter via myChart in EPIC introducing  them to the 
study and giving them the opportunity to “opt out” of future contacts if desired. If potentially 
eligible patients  who receive the mailing do not opt-out  of being approached about the study, we 
may call them to assess their interest and arrange to discuss  the study  by phone/video or meet 
them in-person at their upcoming clinic visit. 
Both sites may post the approved flyer in clinic areas. The flyer may also be distributed to 
potential participants  from clinical or research staff via myChart in EPIC or by e-mail if patients 
and families request  more  information.
At SCH, the screening visit will include verification of the PAID-T measure, and if all criteria are 
met,  the full consent conference will take place (i.e., Phase 2 of Consenting; see Figure  2 below). 
At BCM and SCH, if a PAID-T  is not available in the medical record,  the screening visit will include 
verification of all criteria except for the PAID-T. If the patient is approached in clinic  or by 
phone/video and expresses interest in participating in the study, the screening consent 
conference will take place  (i.e., Phase 1 of Consenting; see Figure  2 in Consent/Assent Section 
below). If the patient is available in clinic,  research staff will obtain written consent/assent for 
Phase 1/Screening prior to administering the PAID-T to the adolescent. If the patient is not in

clinic and research  staff is following up by phone/video,  verbal consent/assent for Phase 
1/Screening will be obtained via the information sheet prior to PAID-T administration.  The patient 
will only be eligible  for Phase 2 of Consenting and to be enrolled if the PAID-T is elevated (>=30). 
The same two-phase  consenting  process will occur at SCH if a PAID-T is unavailable at the time 
of consent (e.g., patient has opted  out of taking standard  of care measures in clinic, has not 
received the PAID-T as part of a tele-health visit or in-person visit or contacts the study  team  after 
receiving the recruitment letter but does not have a PAID-T  in chart within the prior 12 months). 
In cases where the PAID-T is elevated upon screening and the patient/family  subsequently 
decides not to participate, the provider will be notified (if not already notified). 
  
19.2. Steps that will be taken to protect potential  subjects’ privacy interests:41
  
A variety of measures will be utilized to ensure participant privacy. We will follow  
standard processes for approach by using letters and/or working with the diabetes 
provider team to approach in person. Minimal paper records, such as consent forms, will 
be kept in a locked drawer in the site PIs’ research offices.Surveys will be done either  
electronically via RedCap  or mailed  to participants based on their preferences. A1c at-
home test kits will follow  clinic and laboratory  protocols as defined  by each institution 
and overseen by laboratory directors at each respective institution (Dickerson  & 
Devaraj).  
  
19.3. Sources of subjects:42  
We will recruit  from the diabetes clinics at Seattle Children’s Hospital and Texas  
Children’s Hospital.
  
19.4. Methods  that will be used to identify potential subjects:
  
RAs at each  site will screen  patients  via review of the clinic  lists, communication with 
clinicians, and review  of internal databases,  followed by a medical chart  review  to verify 
eligibility. 
  
19.5. Materials that will be used to recruit  subjects:43 
Recruitment letter and flyer are included in the submission materials. 
  
19.6. Recruitment methods  not controlled by Seattle Children’s:
  
There are no study wide recruitment  methods (e.g., call centers or national 
advertisements). 
  
20.Consent/Assent Process
20.1. Consent process overview:44
RAs will conduct in-person  recruitment in clinic waiting rooms,  at clinic visits and/or inpatient  
hospital rooms.  Consent discussions may also occur by phone/video. Phone/video (via

WebEx, Zoom, or Skype) consents will be used in instances where  patients  are coming to 
main hospital clinics infrequently (e.g., every  6 months; not coming in for clinic visits due to 
COVID-19 clinic restrictions). In sum, allowing phone/video consents is necessary for 
maximizing recruitment and accommodating all diabetes patients,  especially in the era of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Some  patients  come to clinic  once every  3-6 months, and clinic  visits 
have become less frequent due to increased  infection risk as a result of COVID-19. In these 
instances and in the current circumstances,  it is sometimes impossible to ensure that an in 
person consent  conference occurs if a study  team member is not allowed to be in clinic due 
to institutional safety protocols (e.g., COVID-19 restructions), out for the day or if our team 
has a scheduled  meeting.  Even  if a study  team member is able to be at the hospital,  there  
are a number of factors that may preclude  an approach in person, especially in the era of 
COVID-19. Providers may interrupt the consent  conference, staff may advise us that the day 
is not “good” for the family to be approached, illness status may preclude  the patient  from 
being cognitively able to provide consent/assent that day, or patients/families  may not be 
presenting in person in clinic due to COVID-19.  
The RA will contact families and ask if they are interested  in learning about a research 
study. The consent meeting between the RA and eligible participants (with parents if 
applicable) will include an explanation of the study in developmentally appropriate lay-
language.  
For Phase  1 (Screening),  participants will provide  either written informed consent (if aged 18 
years) or assent (if <18 years-old) if seen  in-person  or verbal consent (if aged 18 years) or 
assent (if <18 years-old) if screened  by phone/video. Parents of teens (<18 years-old) will 
provide written informed  consent if the patient  is seen in clinic or verbal consent if screened 
by phone/video. 
For Phase  2 (Full Study), all participants  approached in-person will provide either  written  
informed consent  (if aged 18 years) or assent  (if <18 years-old). Parents  of teens (<18 
years-old) approached  in-person will provide  written  informed consent. When the consent  
conference is conducted  by phone/video,  those  who agree to participate will complete an 
electronic consent  form via the REDcap database using the REDCAP e-consent  framework.  
Study staff may also e-mail a copy of the consent form to subjects if requested. The body of 
the consent form will be identical, whether on paper or in REDCap. A link to the electronic 
consent form will be e-mailed to participants prior to the phone/video  consent conference.  A 
short code will be generated  through REDCap to confirm  and verify the identity of the 
person consenting  at BCM/TCH. Study staff will answer any questions about  the study, and 
those who agree to participate will provide an electronic signature, date, and time on the 
REDCap form to indicate their consent. The REDCap e-consent framework allows 
participants to create an electronic signature using their cursor  and provides a timestamp. 
This framework also automatically  generates an extra certification page for participants  to 
confirm the correctness of their responses before submitting and stores a static copy  of their 
responses as a PDF in the study file’s repository. Subjects will also be prompted to 
download a copy  of their signed consent form from  REDCap or study staff can e-mail  the 
signed form. 
After conducting  the consent conference either  in person or by phone/video, RAs will create 
a consent process  note for REDCap and the EMR. Included in this note will be the date of

the consent conference, the names of the patient  and parent (if applicable), the name of the 
person obtaining consent,  the fact that the subject agreed to participate and that all risks 
and opportunities  of the study  were explained, and that the subject had adequate 
opportunity to have  their questions answered. If an interpreter  is used, the name of the 
interpreter will be documented. 
Consent conferences  will not be recorded. Study  staff will use a guide for consent  
discussions over phone/video. 
After fully enrolled participants turn 18, they will complete a new informed consent form to 
continue participation in the study either in-person (as is possible) or via REDCap. 
As described  in the inclusion/exclusion criteria above, adolescents must speak English 
fluently; however, they are eligible if English is not their primary language spoken  at home 
(or if it is not their first language). In cases where  parent  consent  is required and parents do 
not speak English fluently (or prefer another language),  all conferences  will be held with a 
trained phone or in-person  medical  interpreter.  All participants and parents will be provided 
an opportunity to read the consent/assent forms in their preferred language (English or 
Spanish), to ask questions about  the study and have those questions answered by the 
research team member  before deciding about  study  participation and signing the 
consent/assent form.  Parental  permission for study participation will be obtained first then 
patient assent  will be obtained for all patients 13-17 years of age.  If a patient indicates that 
they do not want to participate in any phase of the study that non-assent  will override the 
parent’s permission and the patient will be recorded  as a refusal.  The  research team 
member will redirect  any parent  who attempts  to convince their child to participate in the 
study and remind  them of their child’s right as a potential research participant  to refuse 
participation without coercion.  Consent to study participation will be obtained from patients 
18 years  of age and above. The RA will emphasize to all patients and parents in 
developmentally appropriate lay-language that being in the study is their choice that they 
may choose not to participate or may change their mind at any time and it will not affect  how 
their nurses or doctors care for them.  
Parent/guardian separate consent will be obtained  because parents will be completing their 
own study activities and will be disclosing their own financial information in surveys. At the 
time of consent, the study activities associated  with each arm of the study  (surveys  for both 
groups and ‘Coming Together’ for parents/guardians whose child is randomized  to PRISM) 
will be presented, and parents can indicate  on the consent which component(s) they are 
interested in participating in (with the knowledge  that they will not be offered the ‘Coming 
Together’ session  should their child be randomized  to control/usual  care).  Again, 
parents/guardians whose child is randomized to control/usual  care arm will be eligible to 
take surveys but will not have the option of the ‘Coming Together’ visit (as it is a part of the 
PRISM intervention). Parents/guardians whose child is randomized  to the PRISM arm of the 
intervention may choose to be involved in the ‘Coming Together’ portion of the study and not 
want to complete questionnaires and visa versa, they may choose to complete  
questionnaires and not participate in the ‘Coming Together’ portion of the study either by 
their or the patient’s choice. It is clearly  delineated  on the parent consent forms both a) that 
the parent  should indicate which component(s) they are choosing  to participate in (if eligible)

and b) that the ‘Coming Together’ session is only offered if the adolescent is randomized to 
PRISM.
Screening Procedures  (Phase 1): 
During each consent  conference at BCM/TCH,  where distress  screening (PAID-T) is not 
standard of care, and for consent  conferences  at SCH in which the patient  has not been 
administered a PAID-T, we will emphasize that they will need  to complete a screening  
consent form or information  sheet (Phase 1) and a brief measure (PAID-T) in order  to 
determine eligibility (see Figure 2 below). If they meet eligibility criteria, they will proceed to 
Phase 2 of Consenting and will subsequently  complete the baseline  instruments and will not 
be given the PAID-T  again (i.e., the PAID-T score  from screening will count as their baseline  
PAID-T value). If they do not meet eligibility criteria, we will thank them for their time and 
confirm they are not eligible  for the study. If they are eligible and interested  in the study, we 
will ask them to complete  the full consenting process (Phase 2; see Figure  2 below) and the 
rest of the baseline  surveys prior to being randomized. The same processes will occur at 
SCH if the potentially eligible patient  does not have  a current  PAID-T available  in their chart 
(i.e., within 12 months of the time of consent).
All potential  participants  who complete the PAID-T as part of the Phase 1 screening process 
(outside of their standard of care PAID-T)  with the intention of enrolling in the study who do 
not subsequently meet the cut-off for enrollment will be given a $5 gift card for their time. 
They will complete the PAID-T in the run in period via REDCap, verbally, or paper/pencil.

20.3. Steps that will be taken to protect prospective subjects’  privacy interests:45
  
The study team will use a private room or private  part of the waiting room to discuss  
potential participation and the use of an intermediary (as needed) if the subject does not 
know the researcher.  If consenting by phone/video, we will request that potential 
participants find a quiet, private  location to meet. Emphasis will be made to ensure that 
subjects know that not participating will not impact patient care.
The study team will warn the participant of the possibility of sensitive subject matter 
before the PRISM session (if applicable per randomization).  The study team  will be sure 
to emphasize to the participant that this study is completely optional and the participant 
has the right to not answer any questions that they feel uncomfortable with, that they can 
withdraw their participation at any time, and that their refusal  to participate in this 
research will not impact  their care.
  
20.4. Waiting period  available between approaching  a prospective subject and obtaining consent:
  
n/a – they can consent at time of approach.
  
20.5. Process to ensure ongoing consent:
  
If a minor patient turns 18 while still on study,  we will reconsent them as an adult. We 
will also continue  to emphasize  that research participation is optional and does not 
affect care at SCH/BCM  throughout the study.

box(es):
☐ Per section 5.5.1
☐  Per section 5.5.2
☒  Appendix A-10 of the Investigator Manual will not be followed.   Explanation  of 
procedures not following Appendix  A-10:
Although Spanish  speaking families will be eligible for the study only if the 
adolescent can speak  fluently in English, adolescents who do not speak 
English will be ineligible  for the study  as PRISM is a manualized 
intervention only available and iteratively developed  in English. In cases  
where parent consent is required and parents do not speak English 
fluently (or prefer another  language), all conferences will be done with a 
trained medical  interpreter. All participants  and parents will be provided 
an opportunity to read the consent/assent form in their preferred language 
(English or Spanish),  to ask questions about the study and have those 
questions answered  by the research team member before deciding about 
study participation  and signing  the consent/assent form.  All surveys  and 
consent documents for parents will also be available  in Spanish.
  
20.8.3. Justification if non-English speaking  subjects will be excluded from the research:49
The PRISM intervention  and materials  are not manualized  in non-English 
languages and were not iterively developed through rigorous feasibility 
testing in any other language.
   
20.9. Subjects Who Are Not Yet Adults (Infants,  Children, Teenagers) 
20.9.1. Process used to determine whether an individual has not attained the legal age of 
consent under  the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which  the research will be 
conducted (e.g.,  individuals under the age of 18 years):50
  
Age will be verified via medical record.
  
20.9.2. Parental permission will be obtained from:51
☐  Both parents  unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not 
reasonably available,  or when only one parent has legal  responsibility for the 
care and custody of the child.
☒ One parent  even  if the other parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably 
available, and shares  legal  responsibility  for the care and custody  of the child.
☐ Neither parent.52
  
20.9.3. Process used to determine an individual’s authority to consent to each child’s 
general medical care if permission will be obtained from someone other than 
parents:53
  
The medical record indicates legal guardianship (i.e., who can give consent 
for their child to be enrolled on research studies).  As such, we will only 
obtain consent for AYAs under 18 when  a legal guardian, as indicated by the 
medical record, is present  for the consent  conference.

20.9.5. Procedures for obtaining and documenting assent:
  
Phase 1 (Screening): Written assent will be obtained for patients 13-17 (Screening  
Consent/Assent/Parental Permission), unless it is not possible for research  staff to 
meet patient/family in person. If patient/family is not able to be seen in person, verbal  
assent will be obtained (Information Sheet). 
Phase 2 (Full Consent): Written assent will be obtained for all patients 13-17 if 
approached in clinic. REDCap e-assent will be obtained  for all patients who are 
approached by phone/video These consent conferences will be documented in the 
patient’s medical record. A copy of the consent/assent/parental permission form will 
be e-mailed/mailed prior to the phone/video  consent conference, upon request.  
If a patient indicates that he or she does  not want to participate in the study  during 
any phase, that non-assent will override the parent’s permission and the parent will 
be recorded as a refusal. The research  team member  will redirect any parent who 
attempts to convince their child to participate in the study and remind them of their 
child’s right as a potential research participant to refuse participation without 
coercion. The CRA  or PI will emphasize to all patients and parents in 
developmentally appropriate lay-language that being in the study is their choice, that 
they may choose  not to participate or may change their mind at any time and it will 
not affect how their nurses or doctors care for them.
  
20.9.6. Plan for re-approaching  children  who have  reached the age of majority to obtain 
consent:55
  
We will re-approach and consent the children  of participants if they turn 18 while  
they are still actively participating in Phase 2 of the study. Reapproach will be 
conducted after the participant  turns 18 and before  completing surveys or 
interventions. However, we request  the waiver of consent for patients that turn 18 if 
no further data collection and study related activities are occurring, their data is 
limited to the continued use of existing data.

assent from eligible patients.
  
20.11. Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process
20.11.1. Reasons  for requesting a waiver  or alteration of informed consent:59
  
1)We are requesting a waiver of consent  for patients that turn 18 if no 
further data collection  and study  related activities are occurring (see 
Section 20.9.6) as their data is limited to the continued use of existing 
data. It would not be practical  to seek consent after study activities are 
complete because of the potential difficulty locating subjects. It may be 
inappropriate or unnecessarily burdensome  to patients to re-approach  
them after study activities are complete.
  
20.11.2. Consent  Waiver/Alteration Criteria justifications:60
20.11.2.1. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects 
because: The waiver  includes  continued use of existing data.  
20.11.2.2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely  affect the rights or welfare 
of the subjects  because:61 Participants  assented to participate  in 
the study.  All publication or presentation of research results will 
be done in a manner that would not reveal an individual’s 
identity. 
  
  
20.11.2.3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver 
or alteration because:62
  
We may be unable to locate patients  because of the lengthy 
time period  over which the records will be collected
All eligible  patients (especially those who have  completed 
study activities) must be included  in the study for the results 
to be meaningful

If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable  
biospecimens,  the research  could not practicably be carried  out without using  
such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format  because:  Identifiers 
are necessary so that researchers can link data from multiple sources for 
data analysis.
  
20.11.2.4. Whenever  appropriate,  the subjects  will be provided with additional  
pertinent information after participation:
  
If indicated by participants, a summary of the primary analyses 
will be shared at the study closure.

21.Process to Document Consent in Writing
21.1. If consent  will be documented in writing  (check  one):
☒ “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091)” will be followed.
☒ “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091)” will not be followed.  
Process of documenting consent:64
 
HRP-091 will be followed  for  Phase 1 (Screening) if patient/family  are available  in clinic  
to provide signatures. Due to the relative infrequency of clinic visits, for instances in 
which the patient/family are NOT available to meet in-person, we are requesting an 
alteration of consent,  which allows the patient/family to verbally consent and assent 
(e.g., by telephone/video)  to the screening procedures  in Phase 1. 
HRP-091 will be followed for Phase 2 (Full Study)  when  patient can be approached in 
person. We will obtain  written assent/consent  from all participants.  Upon enrollment and 
randomization in Phase 2, the PI or Co-Is  will place a research note in the medical 
record to document  the discussion and participants. HRP-091 will not be followed for 
Phase 2 (Full Study) when patient  is approached remotely. We are requesting a waiver  
of documentation  of written consent  when approach and consenting are performed via 
telephone or video  conference. Identical REDCap consent forms are drafted for remote 
consenting, which include signature  fields for assent  and consent. 
We will obtain written assent/consent  from participants whenever possible as a wet ink 
of signature. When this is not possible,  we will obtain a digital signature  to indicate 
willingness to participate. 
Consent documents, including the identical REDCap  consent forms for remote 
consenting, are attached  in the appropriate  section of the Click smart form.

22.2. HIPAA  Waiver/Alteration Criteria: Explain why:
22.2.1. The use or disclosure of PHI involves  no more  than a minimal risk to privacy  of 
individuals, based on, at least  the presence of the following elements:
22.2.1.1. An adequate plan to protect the identifiers  from improper use and 
disclosure: 
  
Access PHI for Screening: All screening  will take place using 
secure login  credentials  and databases/medical records  limited to 
access only by study staff. All study  staff and investigators are 
highly trained in HIPAA  compliance, human subjects protection, 
and good clinical  practice.
Remove Signature  Requirement for Phase  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Consent (if not seen in-person): We are requesting an 
alteration of HIPAA  authorization to remove the signature 
requirement for Phase 1 Screening  if screening  is done by phone  
(and a signature  cannot be obtained in-person)  and for Phase 2 
Enrollment if done by phone/video (and a signature  cannot be 
obtained in person). All study materials will be filed in locked 
cabinets and study staff and investigators  are highly trained in 
HIPAA compliance, human subjects protection, and good clinical 
practice. 
  
22.2.1.2. An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct  of research:
  
Access PHI For Screening: All information  collected for research 
purposes will be coded. Identifying information  (names, addresses

and phone numbers) will be used  initially  only to identify  potential 
patients to approach. The only link between the participant 
identifiers and their study identifier will be kept on a password 
protected database and in a locked filing cabinet.  There are no 
patient identifiers  collected and retained  for research purposes. 
Feasibility data will represent  only frequencies  and percentages. 
Any remaining  identified information  (i.e., databases) will be 
destroyed at 10 years  or after final analyses are completed, 
whichever occurs last, in order to ensure data quality.
Remove Signature  Requirement for Phase  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  All information 
collected will be coded. The only links between the participant 
identifiers and their study identifiers will be kept on a password 
protected database and in a locked filing cabinet.  There are no 
patient identifiers  collected and retained  for research purposes. 
  
22.2.1.3. Assurances that PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other party or 
entity, except  as required by law or for authorized oversight of the 
research:
  
Access PHI for Screening: PHI will not be reused or disclosed to 
any other party or entity, except as required by law or for 
authorized oversight of research.
Remove Signature  Requirement for Phase  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  PHI will not be reused  
or disclosed to any other party or entity,  except  as required by law 
or for authorized oversight of research.
  
22.2.2. The research  could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration of 
authorization:
  
Access PHI for Screening: We need  to have the alteration in order 
to determine potentially eligible participants  for this study. If we did 
not confirm eligibility  with the clinicians  giving care, confirmation of 
eligibility would  be dependent upon the patient and parents.  It is 
likely that they would be able to confirm  the eligibility criteria but 
there is the possibility that some may not be able to do so for all of 
the study criteria.  It is also possible that they may be 
uncomfortable being asked to confirm  the eligibility criteria or 
wonder why it is that they are being  asked to do so.
Remove Signature  Requirement for Phase  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  Due to the relative 
infrequency of clinic visits, it may not be possible to screen all 
potentially eligible patients  in person. If the signature requirement

was not removed for potentially eligible parties,  it would not be 
practicable to be able to screen these patients appropriately. 
Patients may be interested in participating in the study, and it is 
not reasonable to ask interested parties  to wait months until their 
next clinic  visit to engage in minimal risk, brief screening 
processes (<5 minutes) to assess eligbility. 
We also need this alteration to be able to recruit participants 
in cases where in-person  consent conferences may pose 
risk to the patients, particularly within this 
immunosuppressed, higher-risk population. For example, as 
of Spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly  
impacted our ability to approach  patients and conduct 
consent conferences  in person;  therefore,  this has led us to 
revisit our previous practices  for in-person consenting and 
determine that, in order to protect patient safety while  still 
giving all eligible  patients  the opportunity to participate in 
this potentially beneficial research, we need  the options to 
enroll patients remotely. 
In addition, both of our previous procedures for remote 
consent conferences  are no longer  feasible in this 
circumstance, as follows: a) when a remote consent 
conference was requested by patients or families, we had 
previously mailed  consent forms prior to a phone consent 
conference and requested that families  sign the forms and 
return via mail.  Based  on early  pilot data, patients  and 
families who were  interested  in the study  found this to be 
particularly burdensome exacerbated  now by families 
execising extreme caution to protect their child’s health, 
meaning many may prefer to avoid sharing of physical 
documents via mail. Furthermore,  requiring  families to 
return documents via mail may pose additional risk and 
burden as they will need  to leave their homes  to locate 
mailboxes or visit the post office;  b) we had previously  e-
mailed consent forms to families and requested that they 
print, sign, scan, and return to us via email.  However, we 
have found that this is not doable for this population as it 
requires them to have  access to a printer and scanner,  
which the majority do not. Therefore,  in order to recruit for 
this study whilst ensuring patient safety  and minimizing any 
burden or stress  on families, providing  an electronic  means 
for families to review  consent forms and indicate  willingness 
to participate (via digital  signature) is necessary.

22.2.3. The research  could not practicably be conducted without access  to and use of the 
PHI:71
  
Access PHI for Screening: The alteration of HIPAA Authorization 
is being requested  for preliminary screening purposes only.  
Preliminary screening procedures are minimal risk; they include a 
basic review of the patient’s medical records to identify whether or 
not the patient meet basic eligibility  requirements.  No study 
activities occur prior to the documentation  of informed 
consent/authorization by patient and/or parent participants.
Remove Signature  Requirement for Phase  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  The nature of the 
research is specific to individuals’ health  and requires access  to 
individuals’ health records. 
  
23.Payments/Costs to Subjects72
23.1. Amount, method,  and timing of payments  to subjects:73
  
Patients in both arms will receive a $20 gift card upon completion of baseline surveys,  
and a $30 gift card following the completion of the 6-month and also 12-month  
surveys. Because the 3-month and 9-month surveys  are abbreviated, patients will 
receive a $10 gift card for those. At SCH, Clincards will be used for gift card 
distribution. At BCM/TCH,  Clincards will we used for gift card distribution, unless they 
are not available, in which  case, cash or check will be used. Parents  will not be 
compensated.  Subjects will not be compensated for participating in any intervention  
sessions, including  the Coming Together session.
In addition, all participants who contact the research  team and “opt in” via the 
recruitment letter, resulting in a screening  visit and/or  a chart  review  will  be entered 
into a lottery to win a bonus $50 gift card. We will complete the lottery every 3 months 
or each  time after 20 families enroll,  whichever  occurs  first. We will use existing clinic 
data to mail letters to participants  who have met inclusion criteria in the past. This is a 
process that has worked well for other researchers
in the diabetes clinic. 
Finally, if the patient completes Phase 1 but does not qualify for the study due to the 
PAID-T score not being elevated, they will be offered a $5 gift card as a thank you. 
Please note that Phase 1 will be somewhat rare at SCH because  the PAID-T and 
A1C are standard of care. Phase 1 screening  for elevated PAID-T will occur for every 
participant at BCM/TCH because the PAID-T is not standard of care (A1C  draws are 
standard of care at BCM/TCH). Those  who do not qualify for the study based on their 
PAID-T scores  or are eligible, but do not want to participate in Phase 2 will receive  the 
$5 incentive for completing the screener. Those who do qualify  for the study based on 
their PAID-T  scores  and decide to enroll in Phase 2 will not receive the $5 incentive 
because they will receive the full $20 incentive for completing baseline  
questionnaires.

and supervise the research:77
  
This investigative team has the qualifications  and collaborative experience  to 
complete a RCT to evaluate the clinical impact and value of a psychosocial 
intervention for adolescents with T1D.  PI  Dr. Joyce Yi-Frazier is a research 
psychologist with over 15 years of experience in behavioral diabetes research and 
stress resilience.14,49-53 With Co-I Dr. Abby  Rosenberg , head  of Adolescent and Young 
Adult (AYA) Oncology  at Seattle Children’s (SCH), they developed the PRISM 
intervention and completed  feasibility trials  in adolescents with diabetes, cancer, and 
cystic fibrosis  (craniofacial and end-stage renal  disease feasibility trials are in-
progress), as well as in parents of adolescents with cancer and diabetes.29,30,79 They 
have refined processes of intervention training, fidelity,  enrollment, study 
implementation and data collection.  Dr.  Rosenberg  has served  as Yi-Frazier’s 
research mentor for the last 5 years as PI of two pilot RCTs exploring PRISM efficacy 
in the AYA cancer  population31 and for caregivers of AYAs with cancer (in progress). 
Rosenberg is currently  leading an R01 multi-site trial for PRISM in one AYA cancer 
population, with a second awaiting SRC  review with a fundable score. For this

proposal, they are supported by Co-I Dr. Marisa  Hilliard (Baylor College of Medicine, 
BCM and Texas Children’s Hospital,  TCH),  a pediatric psychologist  with extensive 
experience in stress,  resilience, strengths-based interventions,  and PROs in 
adolescents with diabetes.20,80-89 Hilliard co-led the organization  of the PRO 
conference in November 2017, which served  as the basis of this RFA. BCM/TCH is 
also one of the sites engaged in the multisite PRISM R01 for cancer. Other key 
contributors include consultant Dr. Barbara Anderson (BCM/TCH),  a leading 
behavioral scientist  in pediatric diabetes with many  years of experience running 
clinical trials,90-93 and Drs. Cate Pihoker, Faisal  Malik (SCH)  and Dan DeSalvo 
(BCM/TCH), pediatric endocrinologists  with extensive clinical and research expertise 
in pediatric diabetes management.94-96 Senior biostatisticians at SCH will lead a 
biostatistics support team to conduct randomization, design implementation and 
statistical analysis as have been done for previous PRISM studies. Finally, students 
will be performing administrative tasks  for the study.
  
25.2. Other  resources available to conduct the research:78
  
Fidelity. PRISM has been standardized through the creation of comprehensive 
protocols for those  who implement it.  Session-by-Session  details are provided in the 
PRISM manual; on outline of each section  is listed in Table 1.  All interventionists  
undergo at least 4 hours of in person training including role-playing  and progressive 
mastery of intervention  materials.  The fidelity of sessions will be systematically 
assessed via audio-recording. 
Access to Diabetes Clinics. The research team will work closely with the Diabetes 
Clinics to ensure screening/enrollment is feasible.  Using the eligibility  criteria  age, 
A1C, and language against our existing databases at SCH, we estimate  over 400 
eligible adolescents  per year,  40% of whom  report using  a CGM. At TCH, there  are 
over 500 eligible  adolescents per year, 26% of whom report  using a CGM. Assuming 
an enrollment rate of 50% (based  on pilot data), we expect it to be feasible to enroll,  
randomize, and conduct the intervention  for at least 80 eligible adolescents at each  
site in 18 months. Appropriate FTE is designated in the budget  for this work. We will 
use the Seattle  Children’s  Hospital Main Campus Diabetes Clinic  and all regional 
clinics  to conduct this research protocol. BCM/TCH will also use their Main Campus 
Diabetes Clinic and regional sites.

SCH will be the primary administrative/data coordinating site and provide the following 
additional oversight and responsibilities:
Administrative oversight: 
oSCH staff will set-up all tracking databases.
oSCH staff will set-up all REDCap databases.
oSCH will oversee the budget.
Intervention-specific oversight:
oSCH staff will provide all training for PRISM in an in-person training session
oLead interventionist will monitor training,  fidelity, and supervision of 
interventionists, including an in-house development program  designed to monitor  
interventionist engagement and potential  for burnout.
Biostatistical oversight:
oRandomization scheme  to be created by SCH biostatisticians  and disseminated  
to BCM/TCH  via REDCap.
oData from BCM/TCH  will be sent to SCH  after baseline, 6-month, and 12-month 
data is collected.  
oCombined data analysis for both PRISM  efficacy (Aims 1 and 2) will be 
conducted by SCH  biostatisticians.
  
26.2.2. Process to ensure all site investigators conduct the study according to the IRB 
approved protocol  and report all non-compliance:
    
All site investigators will conduct the study  according  to the IRB approved  
protocol and report all non-compliance.  Staff at SCH will have both internal 
meetings to discuss and report  any non-compliance and with external sites.  
The study will also be monitored  by the DSMC. All study staff,  investigators, 
and students will be required to review  the protocol, have GCP/HSP  training,  
and submit financial disclosures. The process  for reporting reportable new 
information (RNI) will be reviewed with all staff and investigators, as outlined 
in the investigator’s  manual.     
  
26.2.3. Process to ensure all required approvals are obtained at each site:
    
We will hold a protocol  implementation meeting prior to study  launch  at both 
sites to ensure  all required approvals are obtained.
  
26.2.4. Process to ensure all sites are informed of any problems  and/or interim results:
  
The lead study RA and/or  PI will hold monthly meetings with each site to 
review problems and/or interim results. Additionally, problems  and interim  
results will be brought  to the attention  of the DSMC. If problems and/or 
interim results are urgent  and require  immediate review, the lead study  RA 
and/or PI will contact BCM/TCH,  the DSMC, and/or the IRB, as needed and 
consistent with IRB rules,  federal  law, and Good Clinical Practice.

19 If your population will differ from the representative population where the study  will take place (e.g., race, ethnic 
group, or gender), provide a rationale for the differences.
20 If you check a box below, be sure to include the additional  safeguards associated with the population.
21 Refer to HRP-416 CHECKLIST: Children.   
22 If the study is minimal risk, explain why. Must  also include,  as applicable: (1) why direct benefits are anticipated, (2) 
why risks are justified by anticipated benefit and/or the relationship between risk and prospective benefit compared to 
available alternatives,  (3) why risk represents  only minor increase over minimal risk, (4) how study procedures are 
reasonably commensurate  with those inherent to the child’s actual or expected conditions,  (5) whether the 
interventions/procedures are likely  to yield generalizable knowledge about the participant’s  condition and why it is of 
“vital importance”  to understanding or amelioration  of the participant’s underlying  disorder  or condition,  and (6) an 
explanation of what alternative methods/approaches were considered to make the above assessments (as 
applicable).
23 This population may be wards of the state or any other agency, institution, or entity. Refer  to HRP-416  
CHECKLIST: Children,  Section 6, for additional  guidance on required considerations for this population.
24 This refers to both cognitive  impairments and adults  who are incapacitated for any other reason.  As applicable, 
refer to HRP-417 CHECKLIST: Cognitively Impaired Adults.
25 Refer to HRP-413 CHECKLIST: Neonates and HRP-414 CHECKLIST:  Neonates of Uncertain Viability.
26 Refer to HRP-412 CHECKLIST: Pregnant Women.

28 Indicate how you will ensure  that there  is no coercion or undue influence
29 A subject is considered “enrolled” when they consent  to be in the study.
30 Only applicable for multisite studies.
31 i.e., numbers of subjects excluding screen failures.
32 Payment  for participation is not considered a benefit.
33 For example, data will be double entered,  data will be reviewed by another study  team member to ensure 
accuracy, etc.
34 If your study is multisite  and there are differences in how confidentiality will be maintained by the coordination 
center and our local site, this should be explained  in this section  (e.g. local site will have samples that are linked to a 
person’s name, but the coordination center  will only receive coded samples without any links).  Confidentiality  
regarding use of Social Media will be explained  in a protocol section below.
35 Applicable for studies that present more than minimal  risk.
36 Include information about  who (describe in terms of role or group) will review the data.
37 This should be specific to the social media you are using for the research.

38 All communications that are directed towards subjects  and specific to a particular  study  will require prior IRB review 
and approval.  All non-IRB reviewable communications can be described in general  terms by category – news  stories, 
relevant publications – and representative examples of each can be provided.  
39 Applicable if the research involves  more  than minimal  risk to subjects.  If  minimal  risk, this section  is N/A.
40 If this is a multicenter  study and subjects  will be recruited  by methods not under the control  of the local site (e.g., 
call centers,  national advertisements) those  methods should also be described here.
41 “Privacy interest” refers  to a person’s  desire to place  limits on whom they interact or whom they provide personal  
information.
42 For example: medical records, CIS, clinical databases, other study  records. If the study  will access  PHI for 
recruitment purposes without prior authorization  from subjects, please address  this in the HIPAA  Authorization 
section below.
43 Attach copies of these documents to the Recruitment Materials section of the study SmartForm. For printed 
advertisements, attach the final copy. For online advertisements, attach the final screen shots  (including any images).  
When advertisements are taped  for broadcast,  send the final audio/video  tape to IRB@seattlechildrens.org. You may 
attach the wording of the advertisement to the SmartForm prior to taping to preclude  re-taping because of 
inappropriate wording, provided the IRB reviews the final audio/video  tape.
44Include how you will ensure  that subjects  and/or their parent/legally authorized  representative  have sufficient 
opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate in the research.   .
45 “Privacy interest” refers  to a person’s  desire to place  limits on whom they interact or whom they provide personal  
information.
46 This section describes  the way(s) in which the processes for this study will not follow Seattle Children’s SOP.
47 See HRP-090,  HRP-091, and Investigator  Manual HRP-103 for more information.  
48 Note the Short Form Consent  may only be used when  certain conditions are met.  See HRP-091 for requirements  
for Short Form consent  form use.
49 Seattle Children’s IRB prohibits the exclusion  of non-English speaking populations  from research unless there is 
sufficient justification  for the exclusion.  See  Investigator Manual  HRP-103 for more information.  
50 For research conducted in the state,  review  “SOP: Legally  Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  
(HRP-013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “children.”  The age of majority in 
Washington is 18; however,  sometimes younger children  have ability to consent for certain types  of care (e.g. sexual 
reproduction/health; mental health; drug/alcohol treatment).  For research conducted outside  of the state, provide 
information that describes  which persons have  not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures 
involved the research,  under  the applicable  law of the jurisdiction in which  research  will be conducted. One method of 
obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol  along the definition of “children”  
in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and Guardians (HRP-013).”   If the sites in other states in the 
study are conducting their own IRB review,  you do not need to worry about this--type  N/A.  If you are conducting  
research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT coming to SCH  to give consent  
and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol.
51 For minimal  risk studies and greater than minimal risk studies that offer a prospect  of benefit, the IRB generally  
requires one parent  to provide permission  for the child to participate.

52 If parental  permission  will not be obtained, please address  this in the Waiver  or Alteration of Consent Process 
below.
53 See HRP-013 for more information.
54 The IRB generally follows the following  guidelines for written assent: children  7-12 should provide written assent  on 
the “simple” assent form (HRP-502G); children 13-17 should provide written assent  by co-signing the parental  
permission form (HRP-502A).  The IRB will consider other assent scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all 
children; not requiring  assent for some or all children; or waiving assent):  please  provide  details  about the plan for 
your study.   See HRP-090 and HRP-416 for more information on waiving assent  and when assent is not necessary.
55 See Appendix  A-13  of the Investigator Manual  HRP-103 for requirements for re-consent at age 18.  If you think  you 
meet the conditions for a waiver at 18, please  address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.
56 See “HRP-417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.  
57 For example: durable power  of attorney for health  care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, 
and adult child.  If you are following  HRP-013  in order  to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For 
research conducted  in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  (HRP-
013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “legally authorized representative.” For 
research conducted  outside  of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject  to their participation in the procedure(s)  involved in this 
research. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal  counsel or authority review your protocol  along 
the definition  of “legally authorized representative” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and 
Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states  in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need 
to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research  and are actively recruiting participants  outside of 
Washington who are NOT coming to Washington  to give consent  and who will be covered under SCH  IRB approval,  
this section should be addressed in your protocol.
58 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document  assent on the consent document.
59 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed,  the 
research involves deception,  waiver for participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non-present 
parent, or other waivers as necessary.
60 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not 
practicable to do the research without  a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to 
consider whether the waiver  criteria are met. See “HRP-410: Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further  
information.  
61 Possible reasons might  include: a) you are not collecting information that could  put subjects or their families at 
harm, e.g., affect eligibility for insurance,  employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting  information that would  
alter or affect the subject’s  care;  c) any publication  or presentation of research results would  be done in a manner that 
would never reveal an individual’s identity  either directly or indirectly.
62 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate  families because of the lengthy time period  over which  the 
records/samples were created; b) many of the subjects  whose  records, data, or biospecimens will be used may have 
died and contacting  the families  about the research could  cause harm and anguish to families; c) all eligible  patients  
must be included in the study for the results  to be meaningful.

65 See “HRP-411:  Waiver  or Written  Documentation of Informed  Consent” for further  information.
66 An information sheet template can be found in the Click IRB Library and should be attached  to the consent form of 
the study SmartForm.  For internet research,  the information sheet can be translated  to an on-line  format, if desired.
67 The IRB sometimes requires a script if you are having  the consent conversation over the phone  rather  than in 
person.  Templates  for a consent script are available  on the IRB website on the Participant Recruitment page and 
should be attached to the study  SmartForm.
68 PHI is health  information that is also identifiable because  it includes one or more  of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.   See 
Investigator Manual HRP-103 for the list of HIPAA identifiers.  
69 If your study involves using or creating PHI and your only contact  with participants  is online, you can request  an 
alteration of HIPAA authorization to remove the signature requirement.  As  an alternative to a waiver of 
documentation of consent and an alteration of HIPAA  authorization,  you must demonstrate that the electronic consent  
signatures are compliant with applicable state/international  law (in Washington, see RCW  19.34.300).  
70 For example: altering HIPAA elements for international research.
71 Possible reason could be: the nature  of the research is specific to individuals’  health and requires access to 
individuals’ health records.
72 See “HRP-316:  Payments” for further information.
73 Methods of payment include check, ClinCard, gift cards, etc.  Provide details on who will be the recipient of the 
payment (parent or child).
74 Reimbursement is used when the subject  is paid back for travel expenses such as transportation, food, childcare, 
or lodging.  Reimbursement is generally distributed to person who incurred cost (usually parent)  and requires receipts 
to be submitted.  
75 This could include things like fuel/transportation  costs,  parking, and/or childcare.
76 Type N/A if this section does not apply.
77 Provide  enough information to convince  the IRB that  the principal and/or  co-investigator(s) are appropriately 
qualified to conduct and supervise the proposed  research.  When applicable, describe their prior clinical experience 
with the test article or study-related procedures,  or describe  their knowledge of the local study  sites,  culture, and 
society. 
78 For example, as appropriate:  (1) Justify the feasibility of recruiting  the required number of suitable subjects within 
the agreed recruitment  period.  For example, how many  potential  subjects do you have access  to? What percentage  
of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? (2) Describe the time that you will devote to conducting  and 
completing the research. (3) Describe  the facilities in which  the research will be conducted. (4) Describe the 
availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects  might  need  as a result of an anticipated consequences 
of the human research. (5) Describe your process to ensure that all persons  assisting  with the research are 
adequately informed about  the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties  and functions.
79 Including communication between  sites of current  study document versions and modifications.

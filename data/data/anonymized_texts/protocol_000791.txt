  6 5 PRÉCIS   
Systemi c lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unclear cause that affects 
primarily women of childbearing age. Patients with lupus have a significant ly increased risk of 
developing complications of their blood vessels due to accelerated har dening of the arteries 
(atherosclerosis). These complications include heart attacks and stroke.  No drug to date has 
proven to prevent this type of complication in lupus and premature vascular disease significantly 
impacts the quality of life of these pati ents and enhances their risk of death.  
The thiazolidinediones (TZD) are a class of drugs approved for the treatment of patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) ; they belong to the family of drugs that activate the peroxisome 
proliferator -activated rece ptor- (PPAR -). They have been proposed to have strong anti -
atherogenic and anti -inflammatory effects1 even in patients without diabetes. Recent work from 
our group and others indicates that TZDs significantly improve vascular damage, dysfunction of 
blood vessels and disease activity in mouse models of lupus and abrogate atherosclerosis2-4.  We 
recently identified the TZD pioglitazone as an effective drug in modulation of vascular function 
and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis5. In addition, we have found in mouse 
model s of lupus and in in vitro experiments with human lupus cells, that pioglitazone has 
important roles in modulating immune function and vascular manifestations3, 6. Furthermore, this 
drug is not immunosuppressive, adding an  additional advantage when compared to other 
medications used in this disease.  
We propose that TZDs could significantly improve blood vessel function and play a role in 
atherosclerosis prevention in human SLE, in addition to modifying lupus disease activit y.  The 
major goal of the proposed r esearch is to assess the effects  of the PPAR - agonist pioglitazone in 
SLE on vascular function and inflammation and on SLE disease activity. The results of the study 
may lead to the characterization of a new therapeutic  target with dual effects on lupus and its 
associated blood vessel damage  
6 BACKGROUND  INFORMATION, SCIENT IFIC RATIONALE AND 
SIGNIFICANCE  
6.1 Pathogenesis of SLE  and unmet needs in the treatment of this disease  
SLE is a systemic autoimmune syndrome with pleiotro pic clinical manifestations that primarily 
affects women of childbearing  age. SLE is highly heterogeneous in its clinical presentation, 
which renders therapeutic interventions particularly challenging. The current management of 
patients with SLE is usually  stratified by the degree of internal organ involvement; however, 
most treatment strategies include a variety of immunosuppressive medications that are limited 
both in their efficacy and by their potential toxicities. FDA -approved treatments for SLE includ e 
only hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, aspirin, and most recently, belimumab. Potentially 
devastating side effects of corticosteroids are well known  and include infection, avascular 
necrosis, weight gain, osteoporosis, cataracts and development of dia betes. Although often 
  7 beneficial for treatment of active disease, other immunosuppressive medications commonly used 
in SLE  (azathioprine, mycophenolic acid  (MMF) , cyclophosphamide, etc.) are associated with 
multiple toxicities. Furthermore, despite the add ition of these potentially toxic agents, SLE 
patients usually require continued treatment with corticosteroids. Thus, lupus patients are 
typically dependent indefinitely on corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents for disease 
control even while deve loping cumulative toxicities from exposure to these drugs.  Clearly there 
is an unmet need for improved treatment of inflammation in this patient population7.  
Both innate and adaptive aberrant immune responses appear to p lay key roles in the loss of 
tolerance and the development of subclinical and clinical manifestations8. In SLE, genetic, 
environmental, hormonal, and various epigenetic and immunoregulatory factors act either 
sequentially or simultaneously on the immune system. This results in the generation of 
autoantibodies, immune complexes, autoreactive and inflammatory T cells, and inflammatory 
cytokines that initiate and amplify inflammation and damage to various organs9. Various 
cytokines have been proposed to play important pathogenic roles in SLE, including type I 
Interferons (IFNs), IL-6, IL -17, BLyS, IL -10 and TNF10. Various abnormalities in innate 
immune responses have been the focus of intense research in the last few years, including the 
role of aberrant cell death, neutrophil extracellular trap  (NET)  formation, and the interplay 
between lupus neutrophils and type I IFNs11, 12. Abnormalities in various subsets of T cells have 
been reported in SLE (including Teffector and Treg subsets), although the mechanism and 
functional consequences of such changes remain unclear. Th17 cells have  been reported at 
increased frequency and detected at the site of end -organ damage in SLE, while serum levels of 
IL-17 are increased in SLE and correlate with disease activity10, 13. Treg cells are also  altered in 
patients  with SLE. Both human and murine studies have reported a deficiency in number and/or 
function of these cells, which act to suppress the activation of both T -helper cells and B cells. 
Treg cells isolated from patients with active SLE appear less effective a t suppressing T cell 
proliferation and IFN -γ production in comparison with cells from healthy controls or patients 
with in active lupus14.  
6.2 Vascular damage and premature atherosclerosis in SLE  
While the life expectancy in l upus has significantly improved1, 2, the disease is associated with 
significant morbidity and increased mortality in significant part due to accelerated atherosclerotic 
vascular disease16, 17, 23.The risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially in young 
women with SLE, is striking, and may be as high as 50 -fold when compared to matched controls, 
depending on the study and outcome measure18. Atherosclerotic CVD develops or progresses in 
~10% of SLE patients/year during short -term follow -up19 and is one of the most common causes 
of death16, 20. As we now recognize SLE as an independent risk factor for premature CVD, the 
progressive nature of lupus vascular injury makes this population ideal for the study of 
mechanisms involved in endothelial dysfunction, a state wherein the vasodilator y, anticoa gulant 
or anti -inflammatory properties of the endothelium are impaired and which predisposes to 
atherosclerosis development21. SLE patients without overt CVD display subclinical vascular 
  8 disease (endothelial dysfunction22, 23, arterial stiffness24 and coronary perfusion disturbances25) 
and increased subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid plaque and coronary calcification)26, 27. Many 
of these findings are not explained by traditional risk factors28. Further, while all -cause mortality 
in SLE has improved significantly with improved monitoring and immunosuppress ive 
treatments, CVD remains a leading cause of death29. Indeed, advances in immunosuppression 
have decreased organ damage in lupus, but no drug to this date has proven to abrogate 
atherosclerosis development in SLE, and hi gh uncertainty on how to reduce the enhanced CV 
risk remains. For example, steroids can induce hypertension, insulin resistance, and 
dyslipidemias30, but are anti -inflammatory and therefore may decrease CV complications26, 31. 
Antimalarials and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may have vasculoprotective effects32, 33, but 
their role in atherosclerosis prevention is unclear. These observations indicate that novel  
adjuvant therapies that target inflammation, immune dysregulation and metabolic abnormalities 
without significant side effects are a significant priority in SLE.  
6.3 Mechanisms of premature CVD in SLE  
Although T and B cells are indispensable for lupus pathogenesis, it is still unclear if they play a 
major role in  lupus CVD. In contrast, links between innate immunity, SLE, and CVD are 
myriad12, with proposed significant roles for type I IFNs , platelets and neutrophil NETs among 
others. We have proposed that type  I IFNs promote an imbalance of vascular damage and repair, 
triggered in part by impairment in the phenotype and function of cells crucial for vasculogenesis 
inclu ding endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Furthermore, type I IFNs promote atherogenesis, 
recruit macrophages to plaque and induce platelet activation34, 35. In addition, there is a high 
prevalence of metabolic syndrome, i nsulin resistance and dyslipidemia in human and murine 
SLE36 and in murine lupus these metabolic abnormalities may precede the development of overt 
autoimmunity37.  
High -density  lipoprotein (HDL)  function is not always ac curately predicted by HDL cholesterol 
levels. The functions of HDL include reverse cholesterol transport and modulation of 
inflammation. In healthy individuals, in the absence of systemic oxidative stress and 
inflammation, HDL is anti -inflammatory. However , in those with chronic illnesses such as SLE 
characterized by systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, HDL may actually promote the 
inflammatory response38. Indeed, work from various groups including ours has shown that 
human and murine lupus are chara cterized by enhanced HDL oxidation and perturbed function 
and this has been associated with enhanced atherogenesis34. 
6.4 Current treatments and CVD in SLE  
Corticosteroids, widely used as adjuvant treatment in SLE, likely have  mixed effects on CVD. 
While there has long been evidence that duration of prednisone use can independently predict 
risk of CVD events, there is also evidence that, over time, more aggressive treatment with drugs 
like cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids, will correlate with reduced CVD burden19. In terms 
of drugs with a specific role in the treatment of the disease manifestations of SLE, two —the 
  9 antimalarials and MMF —have received the most attention for their potential cardioprotective 
benefits. It is stil l unclear the role that novel and potential biologics may have in modulating 
CVD in SLE.  
In recent years, there has also been increasing interest in whether drugs with defined roles in 
diseases like hypercholesterolemia and diabetes might have particular b enefit in patients with 
SLE.  
6.5 PPAR -γ agonists as potential therapeutic targets in SLE  
PPAR -γ agonists are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand -dependent 
transcription factors, expressed in various cells including adipocytes, vascular cells , antigen 
presenting cells and lymphocytes. PPAR - activation by agonists determines modulatory effects 
on different crucial cellular events such as growth factor release, cytokine production, cell 
proliferation and migration, extracellular matrix remodeli ng and cell cycle progression/ 
differentiation. In addition, PPAR - agonists have potent antioxidant effects39. PPAR - regulates 
gene expression by binding as a heterodimer to the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The PPAR -
/RXR heterodimer binds to sequence -specific PPAR response elements in the promoter region 
of target genes, acting as a transcriptional regulator40. PPAR - also functions in a DNA -binding -
independent manner to trans -repress vari ous target genes. PPAR - activation by agonists 
determines modulatory effects on crucial cellular events: growth factor and cytokine production, 
cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell cycle 
progression. In addition, PPAR -/RXR complexes may cause functional inhibition by directly 
binding to transcription factors, preventing them from inducing gene transcription and may also 
inhibit phosphorylation and activation of several members of the MAPK family1. 
There are 2 isoforms of PPAR -: PPAR -1 and PPAR -2. Differential promoter usage and 
alternate splicing of the gene generates 3 mRNA isoforms. PPAR -1 and PPAR -3 mRNA both 
encode the PPAR -1 protein, which is expressed in mo st tissues, whereas PPAR -2 mRNA 
encodes PPAR -2 protein, which contains an additional 28 amino acids at the amino terminus 
and is specific to adipocytes40.  Once tissue injury and inflammatory responses ensue, there is 
upregulation of PPAR -. Activation of PPAR - (by endogenous or exogenous ligands) inhibits 
the activation of the transcription factors NF -κB, AP -1, NFAT, and STAT41.  This attenuates the 
formation of cytokines, chemokines, a nd adhesion molecules, reducing excessive inflammation 
and tissue injury. Ligands of PPAR - inhibit the expression of the pro -inflammatory cytokines 
IL-1β, IL -6, TNF -α and interferon (IFN) -; the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 
(MCP -1); and th e adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM -1) and vascular 
cell adhesion molecule -1 (VCAM -1). In addition, other important mediators of inflammatory 
responses and/or pro -thrombotic cascades such as inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iN OS), 
COX -2, CD40 ligand, plasminogen activator -I (PAI -I), and MMPs 9 and 1 are inhibited by these 
compounds1, 42-46.  Furthermore, within a week of treatment with exogenous PPAR - agonists , 
CRP levels decrease by 30% in patient groups, whereas the reduction produced by statins is only 
  10 14%47, 48. There are a number of endogenous ligands of PPAR -, including eicoisanoids (such as 
the PGD2 metabolite 15 -deoxy -delta prostaglandin J2 (15d -PGJ2))  and long -chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, various synthetic PPAR - agonists have been developed 
or are under development. The most widely used belong to the TZD or glitazone class of anti -
diabetic drugs. The 2 currently available TZDs, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are used alone or 
in combination with other oral anti -diabetic agents for type 2 DM1. While PPAR - agonists have 
potent insulin -sensitizing effects, numerous reports indicate that the therapeutic benefits these 
drugs may go far beyond their use in DM.  
Emerging evidence indicates that the PPAR signaling pathways play critical roles in the 
regulation of a variety of biological processes within the CV system49 and that PPAR -  agonists 
inhibit t he expression of genes that contribute to atherogenesis.  PPAR - isoforms have been 
characterized in multiple vascular cell types and prevent in vitro vascular smooth muscle cell 
growth50-52 and inflammatory responses, sug gesting a role in vascular remodeling and 
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, TZDs can improve many atherosclerosis risk factors by lowering 
triglycerides, elevating HDL cholesterol and decreasing levels of biomarkers that are crucial in 
atherosclerosis developm ent53. The positive lipid effects are significantly more prominent for 
pioglitazone than for rosiglitazone and rosiglitazone can have deleterious lipid effects; therefore, 
pioglitazone might be a better drug for atheroscle rosis prevention54.  
With regards to vasculogenesis, TZDs upregulate both number and functional capacity of EPCs 
and prevent apoptosis of these cells in mice and humans55. Reduction of EPC  apoptosis by TZD 
may be a potentially beneficial mechanism for patients with vascular diseases. TZDs can restore 
vasodilator  responses, improve endothelial function and suppress atherosclerosis progression in 
various animal models of vascular injury56,57. These compounds also have potent antioxidant 
activity and an ability to inhibit LDL oxidation, further decreasing atherosclerotic risk58.  In 
clinical studies, TZDs can inhibit CIMT59 ameliorate endothelial dysfunction, and inhibit 
restenosis after cardiac stent60 in patients with DM independent of glucose control61. 
Pioglitazone decreases  visceral and abdominal fat content and blood pressure, and reduces 
systemic vascular resistance in diabetics62. TZDs also ameliorate markers of endothelial 
activation and improve endothelial function in non -diabetic patie nts with coronary artery 
disease63, 64; in non -diabetics with the metabolic syndrome64 in patients with HIV65, RA5, and 
hypertension66; and in renal transplant recipients67. In nondiabetic patients with CV risk factors, 
pioglitazone treatment enhances insulin sensitivity, decreases C -reactive protein (CRP), and 
improves endothelial vasodilator function68. Therefore, TZDs might also be effective anti -
atherogenic strategies in non -diabetics with other increased risk factors for atherosclerosis.  
Current evidence suggests that atherosclerosi s prevention induced by these compounds is not 
only due to the amelioration of systemic metabolic risk factors for atherogenesis but also to 
downmodulation of inflammatory events that occur within the artery wall69, 70.  Indeed, in a 
recent study, pioglitazone was found to counteract the deleterious effects of TNF -α on the 
  11 vascular endothelium, further supporting its putative role in inflammatory conditions associated 
with increased CV risk71. Studies suggest that short -term (3 weeks) treatment with TZDs can 
promote significant improvement in endothelial function in healthy subjects72. Regarding lipid 
control, data on file from Takeda Pharmaceuticals shows t hat a 30 mg dose of pioglitazone for 
26 weeks results in triglyceride lowering of 9.6%, HDL increase of 12%, and a neutral effect on 
LDL and total cholesterol (www.takeda.com). Low HDL cholesterol is increasingly recognized 
as a CV risk factor at any given  level of total cholesterol or LDL73. Thus the HDL elevating 
properties of TZD therapy may further add to their putative CV benefits. Importantly, a report of 
5238 diabetic patients with macrovascular disease has shown tha t pioglitazone significantly 
reduces CV morbidity and mortality74. Also, treatment of type 2 DM with 45 mg daily 
pioglitazone exerts powerful effects on endothelial function beyond metabolic control75. This 
was the dose we used in our RA cohort, where we found significant improvements in arterial 
stiffness, metabolic parameters and disease activity5. 
6.6 Safety of PPAR agonists  
Regarding safety, recent meta -analyses and observational studies have indicated that 
rosiglitazone may increase the risk of ischemic CV events and heart failure in DM and the 
elderly, whereas the association of pioglitazone  with these complications is less clear76. Ongoing 
studies are assessing rosiglitazone’s effect in CV event prevention in patients with CVD 
history77. There is significant debate regarding the role of rosiglitazone or other TZDs in CV 
complications, particularly in insulin -dependent DM, heart failure and morbid obesity78. Overall, 
MI and stroke in DM have been significantly reduced by pioglitazone.  However, TZDs are 
contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class  III or IV heart failure . 
Pioglitazone can cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 2 -4%.  These reductions may 
be due to an increase in plasma volume and  usually pose only minor risk. While p ioglitazone is 
typically not associated with hepatic toxi city or liver function test ( LFT) elevations , the 
pioglitazone package insert states there are post marketing reports of hepatic failure and that 
causality cannot be excluded; Medwatch report states there is an association with hepatitis, 
hepatic enzyme el evations to 3 or more times the upper limit of normal.   Pioglitazone is  
structurally related to troglitazone (no longer marketed), which has been associated with 
idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and rare cases of liver failure, liver transplants, and death. In  a 
recent study of non -diabetics treated with pioglitazone for similar periods of time to what is 
proposed for our study, no changes in LFTs were observed68.  
Similarly in diabetics with a mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, an increased incidence of 
bone fracture was noted in female patients taking TZDs. There is significant debate regarding 
which patients on PPAR -gamma agonists are at increased risk for fracture. For example, a recent 
study reported that over 1 year, treatment with pioglitazone 30   mg/day did not produce 
consistent effects on either bone mineral density or bone turnover in people with type 2 DM 
(T2DM ) or glucose intolerance79 while another study showed decreases in bon e density at 
around 33 months of similar treatment80 . The majority of fractures observed in female patients 
  12 have been nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb.  In diabetics, 
postmenopausal women taking TZDs and the subset of men taking both loop diuretics and TZDs 
were at increased risk for fractures. In postmenopausal women, risk was associated with higher 
TZD dose. No difference between rosiglitazone and piogl itazone was apparent81. The effects of 
TZDs on bone appear related, in part, to induction of osteocyte apoptosis82.  
Preclinical and clinical trial data, and results from observational stu dies suggest an increased risk 
of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users. The observational data further suggest that the risk 
increases with duration of use83. It has been suggested that patients with bladder cancer (curren t 
or previous) should not use pioglitazone. No studies have been published regarding cancer risk 
with pioglitazone in nondiabetics. A recent meta -analysis of 215,142 of patients with T2DM  on 
pioglitazone revealed a hazard ratio of 1.03(95% CI 0.84 -1.26) fo r patients treated with 
pioglitazone for less than 12 months. The hazard ratio increased to 1.44(95% CI 1.19 -1.74) for 
patients using pioglitazone for more than 24 months.  The p -value for interaction was 0.04, 
suggesting a significant interaction between duration of pioglitazone use and incidence of 
bladder cancer. However there was no interaction between cumulative dosage of pioglitazone 
and incidence of bladder cancer (p -value for interaction=0.19). The number needed to harm 
(NNH) was 20903 suggesting th at more than 20,000 patients needed to be treated for one case of 
bladder cancer to develop.  Use of pioglitazone in patients with SLE and those with history of 
treatment with cyclophosphamide has not been studied extensively. In their report of 30 SLE 
patients treated with pioglitazone for 3 months Posadas -Romero et. al. have not reported any 
increased incidence of bladder cancer98. Of note, diabetes may increase the risk of bladder 
cancer, with varying risk ratios across different duration of diabetes, and glycemic control may 
also have an impact on the development of cancer through mechanisms related to metabolic 
changes, accumulation of advanced glycation end -products and increased oxidative stress. As 
PPAR agonists are usually used as second - or third -line drugs for glycemic control, their use may 
indicate a poor glycemic condition for a long duration before their use. Many of the previous 
observational studies could not adequately address the potential confounding effec ts of diabetes 
duration and glycemic control in data collection and analyses. As such, randomized clinical trials 
are needed to assess if there is truly an increased risk in diabetics exposed to long -term 
pioglitazone and whether this applies to other pati ent populations.  
Over 8500 patients with DM have been treated with pioglitazone in controlled clinical trials. 
Over 6000 patients have been treated for 6 months or longer and over 3000 patients have 
received the drug for at least 2 years. The overall incid ence and adverse events reported in 
placebo controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. The incidence of withdrawals was 
similar for patients treated with placebo (2.8%) or pioglitazone (3.3%).

As mentioned above, our group recently completed a randomized, placebo -controlled, crossover 
trial on the effect of pioglitazone on endothelial function and disease activity in RA, another 
inflammatory disease associated to enhanced CV risk. One hundred forty -three non -diabetic 
adult RA patients (76.2% female, age 55.2 ± 12.1 [mean ± SD]) on stable RA standard of care 
treatment were enrolled in a randomized, double -blind placebo controlled cro ssover trial of 
45 mg daily pioglitazone versus placebo, with a 3 -month duration/arm and a 2 -month washout 
period. Pulse wave velocity of the aorta (PWV), brachial artery flow mediated dilatation, 
nitroglycerin mediated dilatation, microvascular endothelia l function (reactive hyperemia index 
[RHI]), and circulating biomarkers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis risk 
all were quantified. RA disease activity was assessed with the 28 -Joint Count Disease Activity 
Score (DAS -28), CRP and the  Short Form (36) Health Survey quality of life questionnaire. 
When added to standard of care RA treatment, pioglitazone significantly decreased aortic 
stiffness, while conduit and small vessel function  remai ned unchanged when compared to  
placebo. Further, pioglitazone significantly reduced RA disease activity and CRP levels while 
improving lipid profiles. The drug was well-tolerated5. In this cohort of patients with overall low 
Framingham risk factors and preserved heart function, markers of target organ function, 
including LFTs and CBC , were not different between treatment versus placebo groups at the end 
of the study. There were more ad verse events while on the active treatment group, and these 
consisted primarily of expected side effects related to this drug class such as weight gain, lower 
extremity edema, and dyspnea ( see table below ). Of the 16 serious adverse events (SAEs) in the 
trial, only one was probably related to the study drug. This was a case of lower  extremity edema 
and chest pain that resolved with discontinuation of the study drug. There were 5 other SAEs 
considered to be not related to the study drug (dyspnea and chest pain, tachycardia and elevated 
blood pressure, low potassium and sodium, hip fracture, and intracranial bleed ; n=1 each) . The 
study drug was discontinued only for the case of dy spnea with chest pain, and all resolved. The 
remainder of the SAEs were considered “definitely not” related to the study drug.

6.7  PPAR agonists in SLE  
As mentioned above, both murine and human studies in SLE support the notion that PPAR -γ 
agonists may be beneficial in this disease and represent an important potential molecular target 
for vascular dysfunction improvement in SLE ( Figure 1). Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone 
improve disease activity in the MRL/lpr land gld/ApoE -/-lupus mouse model2 with decreases in 
autoAbs and renal inflammation and spleen size2. Rosiglitazone also decreases hypertension and 
renal injury in lupus -prone NZB/W  F1 mice4. A beneficial effect of TZDs in renal injury in other 
conditions has been well-documented  84, 85. We have reported that pioglitazone decreases renal 
inflammation in NZB/W  F1 mice86. Kidneys from pioglitazone -treated mice showed significant 
decreases in immune complex (IC) deposition and in  mesangial expansion, endocap illary 
hypercellularity, renal T cell infilt ration and renal expression of proinflammatory molecules 
including TNF and IL -17. While renal function did not differ between treatment groups in the 
NZB/W mice, our results indicate that further exploring piogli tazone as adjuvant therapy when 
combined with other treatments targeting SLE activity is warranted, given the potential positive 
effects on organ damage prevention. These results indicate that TZDs significantly modulate 
inflammatory responses in SLE and m ay decrease tissue damage. There is also recent evidence 
that pioglitazone can downmodulate the proinflammatory effects of type I IFNs on myeloid cells 
and this may be particularly relevant in SLE pathogenesis , given ev idence from our group and 
others that  aberrant neutrophils may play key roles in lupus pathogenesis and its associated 
vascular disease as mentioned above89 
Similar to what we reported in murine EPCs3, when human EPCs are tre ated with pioglitazone, 
there is a significant improvement in their capacity to differentiate into mature ECs after 2 weeks 
  15 in culture. In contrast, rosiglitazone -treated lupus EPCs   do not show improvement in their 
differentiation capacity (unpublished ob servations). This further supports testing pioglitazone as 
the TZD of choice in SLE due to its beneficial effects on vasculogenesis. IFN -α is known to be 
antiangiogenic and we recently begun to characterize the pathways by which it suppresses EPC 
different iation and function90.  We have performed gene array expression studies on control and 
lupus circulating EPCs exposed to proangiogenic stimuli for 72 h ours, then left untreated or 
treated for 6 h ours with recombinant IFN -α90. We identified that IFN -α induces a strong 
antiangiogenic signature in control and lupus EPCs. One of the most significant changes 
included repression of various genes involved in PPAR -γ signaling in  both SLE and contro l 
EPCs . This indicates a potential mechanism by which type I IFNs may interfere with vascular 
repair, through downregulation of pathways crucial in endothelial health , and further support s 
testing PPAR agonists in CV prevention in S LE. Interestingly, the l evel of  PPAR -γ repression by 
IFN-α was significantly more pronounced in SLE EPCs than in control cells, suggesting that the 
former may be more sensitive to the effects of type I IFNs91.  
In a recent small clinical trial in  30 young female lupus patients, pioglitazone administration over 
three months improved HDL levels, insulin resistance, and HDL size, while decreasing markers 
of inflammation such as CRP and serum amyloid A; specific markers of endothelial function 
were no t considered, neither was the effect on SLE disease activity92. 
We therefore propose that these agonists may particularly benefit SLE patients by suppressing 
inflammatory and immunologic pathways that promote premature ath erosclerosis and internal 
organ damage. Identifying pioglitazone’s role in SLE may support an eventual paradigm shift in 
standard of care for these patients to include therapy with PPAR -γ agonists for treatment and 
prevention of endothelial injury, atheros clerosis and CV events in this disease and, potentially, in 
individuals with other systemic autoimmune diseases associated with premature CVD.  
  16  
Figure 1: Mechanisms of vascular damage/ atherosclerosis in SLE and potential role of  
PPAR - agonists in atherosclerosis prevention  
Predisposition to vascular damage in SLE is likely mediated by multiple pathways including abnormal vascular 
repair; enhanced endothelial apoptosis through a variety of mechanisms (cytokines such as type I IFN s, 
autoAbs, cell -mediated cytotoxicity,  NETs, traditional risk factors); prothrombotic and metabolic 
abnormalities including increased piHDL. This leads to blood vessel damage,  NO, increased platelet 
aggregation and smooth muscle proliferation, all of wh ich can lead to endothelial dysfunction and premature 
atherosclerosis. Further, inflammation triggers insulin resistance that also contributes to endothelial 
dysfunction. PPAR - agonists may prevent this complication by blocking the majority of these harmful 
pathways.  
 
7 OBJECTIVES   
The major goal of the proposed research is to assess the effect of a targeted pharmacotherapeutic 
intervention  – the administration of the PPAR - agonist pioglitazone  – in SLE on : 
a) vascular endothelial function (primary endpoint), a predictor of CV risk  
b)  SLE disease activity (secondary endpoint).  
This randomized clinical trial, with a modest sample size, can both s erve as a “proof of concept” 
study for the potential utility of TZDs in SLE, and inform us on which surrogate outcomes or 
biomarkers may be useful in future lupus studies aimed at CV/immunomodulatory outcomes.  
Aim 1 :  To conduct a randomized, double -blind,  placebo controlled, crossover, proof -of-concept 
clinical trial in adult SLE patients comparing the effects of pioglitazone vs. placebo on vascular 
endothelial function  and blood vessel inflammation . Primary outcome measures will be large

  17 vessel arterial s tiffness, measured either by cardio -ankle vascular index (CAVI ) or pulse wave 
velocity (PWV, assessed by Sphygmocor)  (both tests to assess large vessel arterial stiffness ), and 
assessment of microvascular peripheral arterial tone (PAT). Secondary outcome m easures of 
atherosclerosis risk and metabolic disturbances will include proinflammatory HDL (piHDL) 
levels and HDL cargo, lipoprotein function, lipid profile and insulin resistance and EPC 
phenotype and function. In addition, modulation of arterial inflamm ation will be assessed in a 
subset of patients by neck to groin fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT (FDG 
PET/ CT). 
Hypothesis 1 : Endothelial function and arterial compliance will significantly improve in 
SLE patients treated with pioglitazone  when compared to placebo, while arterial 
inflammation will decrease.  
Hypothesis 2 : Pioglitazone will alter HDL cargo function, decrease proinflammatory 
HDL levels and insulin resistance, and improve markers of vascular repair in SLE.  
Aim 2 :  To assess the  ability of pioglitazone to reduce SLE disease activity, when added to 
standard lupus care, as assessed by the SLEDAI -2K disease activity index (SLEDAI -2K), lack of 
A or B flares on the British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG  2004 ) score, and physician’s  
global assessment (PGA)  (See Appendix section s 2,3,7 ). Serological markers of SLE activity and 
various cytokines considered important in lupus pathogenesis will also be quantified.  
Hypothesis 3 : SLE Disease activity will decrease in SLE patients when trea ted with  
pioglitazone vs. placebo.  
Aim 3 :  To investigate the role of in vivo administration of PPAR -γ agonists in modulating 
aberrant immune responses in SLE. These will include lymphocyte phenotype and function, 
autoantibody and cytokine production and m yeloid cell phenotype and functional abnormalities.  
Hypothesis 4 : Pioglitazone will normalize innate and adaptive immune responses in SLE.  
8 STUDY DESIGN AND MET HODS   
This will be a single -center, randomized, double -blind, p lacebo -controlled, crossover, proof -of-
concept treatment trial enrolling  100 SLE patients  including replacements  due to screen failures 
and withdrawals .  If a patient drops out of the study before completion  both arms , another patient 
may be enrolled so that up to 75  patients complete the study. They will be treated for 3 months 
with 45 mg daily pioglitazone or placebo, undergo an 8 week washout period, then undergo 
crossover to the other arm for 3 additional months. Throughout  the study , functional, anatomical 
and blood biomarkers of vascular damage, atherosclerosis risk and SLE activity will be 
collected.  Pioglitazone has been chosen over rosiglitazone because it appears to have a 
significantly better safety profile regarding CV effects  and lipid profile alterations93, based on 
our experience in the rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) trial5 and  the small pilot study  published by 
  18 another group  that showed improvement in some meta bolic parameters in SLE92, as well as  our 
preliminary data which indicate improvement of vasculogenesis by pioglitazone but no t 
rosiglitazone94 in human SLE.  We also have significant expe rience using this drug due to the 
recently completed clinical trial in RA3. The dose and study time period have been selected based 
on pioglitazone’s macrovascular protective effects74 and to allow detection of meaningful 
changes in endothelial function and disease activity, respectively. This is also based on the dose 
and study time period used in the RA trial, which showed significant effects on arter ial stiffness, 
metabolic parameters, inflammatory markers and RA disease activity5.  
TZD studies indicate improvements on endothelial function from within a few weeks to a couple 
of months. Previous crossover studies asses sing pioglitazone’s role in endothelial function, 
insulin resistance and inflammation have used treatments from 6 -12 weeks with washout periods 
of 4-6 weeks68, 72, 95. In our studies in RA, 3 months was sufficient to obser ve significant 
improvements in arterial compliance and disease activity5. These washout periods appeared 
sufficient to avoid carryover effects and, indeed, in the RA trial we found no evidence of 
carryover effect after the  same washout period5. Carryover issues will also be addressed by 
randomizing the sequence of placebo and pioglitazone treatment. Previous studies did not reveal 
that the sequence (i.e. placebo followed by pioglitazone vs.  pioglitazone followed by placebo) 
had any effect on the observations68. The study will take approximately 5 years to complete. 
Figure 2 represents the study sequence.

8.1 Proposed Surrogate Outcomes and Biomarkers  
 Specific Aim 1: Effect of Pioglitazone on vascular function and cardiometabolic risk.  
a) Vascular function and vascular inflammation.  
SLE patients demonstrate endothelial dysfunction independent of Framingham risk factors 
and in the setting of subclinical CVD 22, 23. Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in 
atheroma development and a tr igger of CV events96. PPAR - agonists reverse endothelial 
dysfunction in other diseases61, 64, 98, and pioglitazone improves endothelial function in 
murine lupus99. 
Arterial compliance/CAVI  and PWV : Arterial stiffening is caused by structural and/or 
functional changes within the major conduit artery walls, resulting in increases in pulse 
wave velocity, with important hemodynamic consequences100.  SLE patients without overt 
atherosclerosis have increased arterial stiffness24, 101 -103, indicating it may be a sensitive 
marker of early CV dysfunction and increased risk and a target  of treatment efficacy. In

  20 RA, arterial compliance can improve after 12 weeks of etanercept104, suggesting that short -
term treatment of inflammatory processes may improve vascular compliance. In animal 
models and humans wi th other disease states, PPAR - agonists significantly improve 
arterial compliance during short duration trials 105-108.  In our pioglitazone trial in RA, 
arterial stiffness  as assessed by PWV was significantly improved in patients on the 
pioglitazone arm when compared to placebo arm5. CAVI is an index reflecting the stiffness 
of the artery from the heart to ankles ; it increases with atherosclerosis progression108.  An 
advantage of CAVI over other tests that assess vascular stiffness is that it is not 
significantly affected by changes in blood pressure. CAVI has been widely applied 
clinically to assess arterial stiffness in subjects with known CVD, as well a s those at risk  
(hypertensi ve patients , diabet ics, the elderly, and the obese ). CAVI has also been utilized in 
studying normal individuals to assess their potential risks of developing CVD109. Changes 
in CAVI have been obs erved when measures to decrease CVD risk factors have been 
implemented110-112.  Specifically for SLE, a small study recently showed that CAVI is 
increased in SLE patients when compared to age - and sex -matched controls113. Similarly, 
PWV assessment using a Sphygmocor device is a non -invasive, reliable measurement to 
assess vascular compliance and was used in our RA trial5. Either of these two tests will b e 
used in this trial, d epending on which machine will be me more readily available once 
these studies are initiated.  
Pulse wave analysis (SphygmoCor): SphygmoCor is a set of non -invasive tools used to 
determine central blood pressures and arterial stiffnes s. It (1) derives the pressure wave 
from the ascending aorta to the carotid artery and (2) gives an accurate measurement of 
pressure at the heart, brain, and kidneys. However, it cannot be used on patients who may 
suffer from heart arrhythmias or arterial stenosis.  
The SphygmoCor consists of the following:  
SphygmoCor Px Pulse Wave Analysis System – a diagnostic tool to measure central blood 
pressure  
SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Analysis System – an algorithm used to determine central aortic 
pressure and visualiz e ventricular - vascular interactions  
SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Velocity System - a tool that derives a pressure pulse waveform 
using the pressure tonometer and an ECG signal simultaneously. Arterial tonometry uses a 
pressure sensor to detect the speed of a pul se wave and may indicate a problem in the 
arteries.    
SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Monitoring System – a tool that provides an estimated pressure 
waveform from the ascending aorta.  
  21 PAT:  The Endopat2000 device measures finger microvascular endothelial function in a 
fully -automated fashion before and after reactive hyperemia (RH -PAT). RH -PAT response 
is independently predicted by traditional and novel CV risk factors114. PAT test is operator -
independent, with higher inter -day reprod ucibility than US conduit studies115. PAT 
dysfunction occurs in SLE in association with IFN signatures116. While pioglitazone did not 
modulate PAT in RA patients5, it will be important to establish the role of this drug in 
microvascular function in SLE. Finger PAT signal is recorded by non -invasive, modified 
plethysmography -based probes, then to digital media. PAT software calculates various 
outcomes, the main one being the RH -PAT index=rat io of average RH -PAT PWA in a 
finger of the occluded arm for a 60 sec ond period beginning 1 min ute after blood pressure 
cuff-release, compared to average PWA during the 210 sec ond-long baseline pre -occluded 
period. The r atio is normalized to the PAT index in the control arm . 
To simplify, we will refer to the CAVI, PW V and EndoPAT tests as “vascular function 
studies”.  
Assessment of vascular inflammation using [18F] -2-fluoro -2-deoxy -D-glucose (FDG) 
imaging using positron -emission tomography (PET)/computed tom ography (CT)):  FDG -
PET/CT enables highly precise, novel measurements of inflammatory activity including 
vascular, visceral, and whole body inflammation in vivo. The range of applications for 
FDG -PET imaging has been expanded to include the evaluation of ac tivity of 
atherosclerotic plaque.   Importantly, in diabetics or patients with glucose intolerance, 
pioglitazone attenuated left main trunk inflammation in a glucose -lowering independent 
manner when examined after 4 months of treatment s_9_References4. This will be 
performed in a subset of 30 patien ts given the logistics of scheduling imaging studies at the 
Clinical Center.  
b) Metabolic parameters  and vasculogenesis pro file 
Insulin resistance : This is an important CV risk factor117-119 and a significant proportion of 
SLE patients exhibit this abnormality120, 121. Homeostatic measurements like the HOMA 
calculation allow for an easy assessment of insulin resistance122, 123.  In lupus -prone mice, 
pioglitazone induced significant changes in insulin resistance. Furthermore, in the RA trial, 
3 months of pioglitazone changes led  to substantial improvements in this parameter, as 
assessed by HOMA2 calculations5. 
piHDL and lipids : Patients with active SLE exhibit a proatherogenic lipid profile with low 
HDL, high triglycerides and dysfunctional HDL124. Pioglitazone improves lipid profiles 
l125, 126  in DM, in non -diabetics and in murine SLE86. We will monitor lipid profile, 
oxidized HDL and cholesterol efflux activity of HDL from all subjects ex vivo before and 
after therapy. HDL oxidation and proteome profiles will be determined by MS in a subset 
of patients in the trial, NMR to assess lipopr otein particles will also be performed. These 
  22 studies will identify whether pioglitazone treatment improves HDL oxidation, remodels 
HDL proteome and renders the lipoprotein more functional.  
EPC numbers and function : As SLE EPCs are decreased in number and  display decreased 
function, and pioglitazone has been shown to have positive effects on vasculogenesis, we 
will quantify EPC numbers and function as previously described by our group, at various 
time-points35. 
 Spec ific Aim 2 :  Effect of pioglitazone on SLE disease activity  
In clinical trials, the main methods to assess SLE activity are the  SLEDAI -2K and the 
BILAG  2004 . The investigators on this study  have significant expertise in the use of these 
tools and have participa ted in clinical trials that used both methods to score disease activity.  
a) –SLEDAI  2K: This validated scoring system  is a modification of the original SLEDAI -
2K  system to reflect persistent, active disease in those descriptors that had previously only 
considered new or recurrent occurrences5, The score can be between 0 -105.  It is based on 
the presence of 24 descriptors in nine organ systems over the preceding 30 days. 
Descriptors are doc umented as present or absent. Each descriptor has a weighted score. 
Higher scores rep resent higher disease activity. (see Appendix).  
b) Lack of A or B flares on BILAG  2004 : The BILAG  2004  assesses SLE activity based 
upon the premise of “intention to treat”129, 130. It has been widely used and is well 
validated (sensitivity 87%, specificity 99%, and positive predictive value of at least 80%). 
Within each organ/system, a combination of answers provides an activity score from A 
(very active) to E (not or never active)  (see Appendix  3). Recent trials have modified 
BILAG  2004 ’s use to only the presence or absence of an A or B flare during the 
observation period as an outcome measure, thus incorporating BILAG’s sensitivity to 
flares in individual organ systems with the SLEDAI -2K. For the proposed study, the 
clinical disease activity endpoints will be patients achieving SLEDAI -2K improvement + 
absence of a BILAG  2004  A or B flare +improvement in PGA (see Appendix  3 and 7 ). 
There  are eight systems: general, mucocutaneous, neurological, musculoskeletal, 
cardiorespiratory, vasculitis, renal and hematological . A score is calculated for each 
system depending on the clinical features present and whether they are new, worse, the 
same or  improving in the last 4 weeks compared with previously. The most severe features 
in each system, which are deemed to require high dose steroids (prednisolone > 20 m g 
daily or equivalent) and/or cytotoxic agents, characterize an A score. One or more feature s 
may have to be present to score an A, depending on the system .  More moderate disease 
  23 items that would be considered appropriate to treat with lower dose steroids, antimalarials 
or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contribute to a B score. M ild 
symptomatic features that require just symptomatic therapy, for example with analgesics 
and NSAIDs, can only contribute to a C score. If there are no current symptoms but the 
system has previously been involved then a D is recorded. If the system has n ever been 
involved, it is scored E  
c)  Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (HRQOL) (SF -36) and physician global 
assessment (PGA) : This is a widely used tool to assess HRQOL with prior successful 
application in SLE131, 132. SF-36 assesses physical wellness, social and emotional well 
being  and overall sense of mental health131. Completion takes 5 -15 min utes (see Appendix  
5). 
d)  Other : At each visit, C3, C4, anti -dsDNA, CRP and sedimentation rate will be 
quantified.  
 Specific Aim 3 : Assess the immunoregulatory role of pioglitazone in lymphoid and 
myeloid cell subsets in SLE  
We propose to investigate the effects of pioglitazone on intrace llular signaling molecules, 
serum cytokines and peripheral blood gene expression as a measure of biological effects 
that can potentially  be used as outcome measures to power for larger trials. At each visit, 
serum and plasma will be saved for quantificatio n of putative biomarkers of disease activity 
and vascular damage in  all patients .  We will assess the effects of oral pioglitazone on 
immune cell phenotype and function.  Some of the proposed studies include:  
• Alteration in the “interferon signature”, “T c ell signature” and the “granulocyte 
signature” in PBMCs using RNA seq  or Affymetrix ( to be performed by Center for 
Human Immunology) ;  
• Alteration in peripheral blood immune cell populations with special attention to 
CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+ regulatory subsets a nd Th17 cells, monocyte subsets and a 
subset of aberrant neutrophils present in lupus patients (low -density granulocytes).  
• Measures of serum cytokines and chemokines: this will include Th1, Th2 and Th17 
markers, type I IFNs and myeloid cell -relevant cytok ines such as IL -6, Il-8, MCP -1, 
IL-1beta.  
• Levels of autoantibodies (anti -dsDNA, ENA -Abs, APL Abs) and total IgG  
Some of the studies will be performed by the Center for Human Immunology (NIH) and others 
will be performed by Dr. Kaplan’s laboratory.

will be recruited from the Outpatient Rheumatology Clinic of the Clinical Center at the NIH or 
the NIAMS Community Health Center, from referr als for treatment and/or second opinion, by 
advertising the study to rheumatologists  within th e larger DC area,  and by direct advertising 
through publications of patient advocate organizations, such as the Arthritis Foundation, the 
Lupus Foundation, Lupus Research Institute, Alliance for Lupus Research, the American 
College of Rheumatology meeting , and in the news outlets.  These documents will be sent to 
IRB for approval before being used.  
Patients will be considered enrolled once they have signed consent . 
9.2 Inclusion Criteria  
1. For females and males 18 years old or older : females should be on adequate 
contraception if they are of child -bearing potential, which should be documented by a 
clinician, unless patients or their spouse/partner(s) have previously undergone a 
sterilization procedure. Adequate contraception will be c onsidered:  
• Intrauterine device (IUD),  
• Hormone implants,  
• Injectable contraceptives,  
• Oral contraceptives plus a barrier method (male condom, female condom or 
diaphragm),  
• Abstinence, or  
•  A vasectomized partner.  
2. Meet revised ACR criteria and 2012 SLICC cri teria for SLE and have: a) a baseline 
SLEDAI -2K ≥  4 and <20 or a clinical SLEDAI -2K ≥  2 (not considering anti -dsDNA or 
complement levels) and b) lack of BILAG A flare at baseline (See Appendix 3).  
3. Stable doses of immunosuppressants and/or antimalarials for at least 3 months, and/or 
corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks .  The prednisone dose may be increased after 
screening visit as long as the total dose is less than 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent  per 
day and the subject is on stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to their Day  1 visit.   If on 
statins, should have been on stable doses for at least 6 months.  
4. Allowed concomitant lupus -related medications  
Antimalarials,  
Prednisone  ≤ 20mg daily or equ ivalent doses of other corticosteroids;  
Immunosuppressants :  
  25 Mycophenolate mofetil , up to  3000 mg/d ay,  
Methotrexat e, up to  30 mg/w eek,  
Azathioprine , up to  3 mg/kg /day,  
Leflunomide , up to  20 mg/d ay,  
Cyclosporine , up to  5 mg/kg/day  
Tacrolimus, up  to 0.1 mg/kg/day  
NSAIDS  and aspirin  
 
Note: While it would be highly desirable to maintain corticosteroid dosage at constant 
level for trial duration, it is impractical to anticipate that all patients with active SLE can 
be maintained without therapy modification for an 8-month  period. Because  
corticosteroids are acceptable agents for treatment of the vast majority of minor lupus 
flares, and patients with major flares (BILAG 2004 A or recent change in medications) 
will be excluded, this will provide standardized treatment across study populatio n that 
can be easily analyzed. An increase in prednisone dose of less than or equal  to 10 mg/day  
from their prednisone dose at study entry will be permitted during the trial for increased 
disease activity with a standardized taper allowable in small month ly decrements to the 
patient’s baseline dose or 5 mg/day, whichever is less.  
 
9.3 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Pregnant  or lactating women  
2. Expected need for major surgery during trial.  
3. Current or previous diagnosis of malignant disease, except for basal cell or squam ous cell 
carcinoma of the skin with complete excision and clear borders  or adequately treated in 
situ carcinoma of the cervix.  
4. Acute infections identified during screening  that require antibiotics . These subjects would 
be eligible to participate following resolution  of infection  before Day 1 visit within the 
allowed 46 days  screening period .   The subject will re -screen  if it extend s beyond  the 
allowed 46 days screening period.  See more details of information about the 46 days 
screening window period in section 9.4 Screening and Randomization, line 9 -10.   
5. Chronic infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or Tuberculosis.  
6. Current use of  cyclophosphamide or having received cyclophosphamide within the last 
year.  
7. Prior history of hemorrhagic cystitis or hematuria while receiving cyclophosphamide that 
could not be explained by other causes.   
8. Current use  (within 3 months)  of tocilizumab, rituximab, belimumab , intravenous 
gammag lobulin  or other biologic.  
9. History of poor compliance  with medical care, study visits and/or medication use.   
  26 10. Receipt of any investigational new drug or device within 30 days prior to screening or 5 
half-lives  of the agent (whichever is longer), or any inv estigational new drug with known 
long-term effect s. 
11. Pioglitazone is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Patients with 
current heart failure (NYHA class II, III or IV) and/or a left ventricular ejection fraction 
of <45% by echocardiogram at screening will be excluded.  
12. Significant impairment of major organ function (lung, heart, liver, kidney) or any 
condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the subject’s safety 
followin g exposure to the study drug.  
13. Known hypersensitivity to TZDs  
14. Serum hepatic transaminase levels  > 2 times upper normal limit , or clinical evidence of 
active liver disease  at screening . The only exception is patients with confirmed non -
alcohol ic fatty liver  disease (NAFLD) where pioglitazone has been reported to have a 
therapeutic role.  
15. Diagnosis of DM or meeting DM criteria at screening visit, as established by new 
classification criteria96: Patients with diabetes are excluded because diabetes by itself will 
induce profound changes in endothelial function  and we want to assess the effects of 
PPAR agonists in vascular risk beyond changes in insulin resistance.  
16. Known latex allergy for EndoPAT t est 
17. Patients with severe Raynaud's  phenomenon , history of finger ulcers or finger gangrene  
will not undergo Endopat testing.    
18.  Patients with severe SLE at baseline, as quantified as SLEDAI -2K >20. 
19. Patients  with active lupus nephritis or active CNS lupus at baseline even  if SLEDAI -2K   
<20.   Active disease will be considered as CNS or renal disease that require aggressive 
immunosuppression. Active CNS disease will be diagnosed based on clinical presentation 
and physical exam, exclusion of  other conditions that could explain symptomatology and, 
when warranted, ancillary tests (imaging) that support the diagnosis.  
Patients that are not on induction therapy for lupus nephritis and have chronic (more than 6 
months), stable proteinuria <750 mg/ gram in protein:  creatinine  ratio but otherwise 
considered to have no evidence of active lupus nephritis  (e.g. no cellular casts and stable 
serum creatinine  <   2  mg/dL ) over the last 6 months, will be included in the study.  
In selected patients with pote ntially confounding clinical factors, consults will be requested 
to help clarify the nature of any underlying renal disease that may affect inclusion.  
20. Postmenopausal women who have not undergone a DEXA scan over the last year will   
undergo a DEXA scan  at screening. Patients with a better than  -2.5 will be included.  
Postmenopausal women who have undergone a DEXA scan during the last year and have a T 
score better than  -2.5 will be included without repeating the DEXA scan prior to enrollment.  
If the T score is worse than  -2.5, they will be excluded from participating unless the subject 
is willing to begin appropriate treatment  for osteoporosis  by Visit Day 1. Postmenopausal 
  27 women who have undergone a DEXA scan during the last year, have a T sco re worse than  -
2.5 and are not on bisphosphonates or other appropriate therapy will be excluded.

9.4 Screening  and R andomization  
Subjects will review and sign informed consent  document , and medical history, physical exam, 
disease activity (SLEDAI -2K), screening labs  and echocardiogram will be performed .  
Echocardiogram will not be performed if patient is rescreened within 6 months and previous 
result is normal or if patient had normal Echocardiogram within 6 months prior to screening. 
Routine laboratory data obtained within 30 days of the screening visi t under the natural history 
protocol 94 -AR-0066 can be used for screening.  Screening labs will include infectious disease 
testing for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Tuberculosis if they have not been obtained within 
the last 6 months.  As mentioned abo ve, pos tmenopausal women without a D EXA scan in the 
last year will undergo a D EXA scan to assess eligibility.   The window between screening and 
baseline must  be less than 46 days, otherwise subjects will need to be rescreen ed regarding labs .   
Inclusion/Ex clusion Criteria will be signed off based on screening labs and assessment.  Patients 
who meet these criteria will be randomized to a sequence of active drug followed by placebo, or 
placebo followed by active drug in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization a nd drug/placebo 
allocation will be done by the NIH clinical center research pharmacy  after screening visit .   
We will test Urinalysis (includes microscopic)  on Screening and Month 8 visits on all patients .   
If patients have evidence of mi croscopic hematuria  > 20 RBCs/uL (excluding normal 
menstruation cycle)  it will be repea ted twice at one month  ( +/- 7 days) intervals and if RBCs 
  29 are consistently more than 20  RBCs/uL  then Urology consult will be placed.  The following 
algorithm will  be put in place , per recommendations by the Urology service at NCI:  
1. Question patient about macroscopic hematuria  > 20 RBCs/uL  times 3 results.    
a. If YES → Urology consult → Cytology  
i. If abnormal cytology → Cystoscopy → FISH @ Mayo  Labs for  genetic 
changes for bladder cancer detection  
ii. If normal cytology → Nothing  
9.5 Study Visits  
 Baseline visit and 5 -month  +/- 7 days  (post -washout) visit  
a. Baseline visit will include medical history. The baseline and 5 -month (post -washout) visits will 
consist of a physical exam, and blood draw for biomarkers ( Table 3). SF -36, PGA, disease 
activity (BILAG  2004 , SLEDAI -2K) and vascular measurements will be determined and 
subjects will be issued a 3 -month supply of blinded study drug or placebo with instructions. The 
first week of each treatment arm, patients will take two 15 mg capsules of pioglitazone daily (30 
mg total dai ly dose) and, if no significant side effects develop (primarily fluid retention) , will 
increase to three 15 mg capsules (45 mg total daily dose).  Subjects will be instructed to follow 
the same titration for the placebo arm.  Patients will be called prior to increasing the dose to 45 
mg to question patients about rapid weight gain (>5 pounds in a week), significant edema or 
other side effects.   Patients will be called 1 -2 weeks after increasing dose to 45 mg daily to 
assess tolerability. If 45 mg dose i s not well tolerated but the 30 mg dose is well tolerated, dose 
will be decreased back to 30 mg daily for duration of trial.  PET/CT exams will be performed in 
15 patients initially randomized to placebo and 15 patients initially randomized to pioglitazone 
and the investigators will be blinded to this. PET/CT studies will only be performed at baseline 
and month 3.   Subjects can opt out of the PET/CT scan and still participate in the study. Patients 
will be asked to participate at baseline until we reach 15 pati ents/group.   If a patient is found to 
have an acute infection at the baseline visit,  they will be given antibiotics and their next visit 
will be scheduled for no more than 4 weeks later, at which time they will start the study 
medication. We will repeat only baseline clinical labs at this extra visit; we will not repeat 
PET/CT, vascular function studies or research sample collection. If a patient has an abnormal 
lab result at the baseline visit that requires a repeat, the patients next visit will be scheduled no 
more than 4  weeks later, at which time if the abnormal lab has improved or normalized they will 
  30 start the study medication. We will not repeat PET/CT, vascular function  studies or research 
sample collection. If any subjects are enrolled in our Natural History of SLE Protocol (94 -AR-
0066) and have undergone a research -indicated PET/CT scan as part of that study within the 6 
months prior to their baseline visit, we will us e that data for their baseline values and will only 
perform the PET/CT scan at the month 3 visit.  
 Visits at months 1  (+/- 7 days)  and 6  (+/- 7 days)  
Visits at months 1 and 6  are safety visits after study drug initiation. Only liver function tests 
(LFTS ), complete blood count ( CBC ) and pregnancy test (in women of child -bearing potential) 
will be obtained.  Adverse events will be assessed/reviewed.   Abbreviated me dical history and a 
physical exam will be performed  to assess any changes in medical conditions or  medications. If 
feasible, blood may be obtained at a local lab and results faxed to NIH  and a phone call from the 
research coordinator or investigators will assess adverse events . 
 Visits at 3 (+/- 7 days) and 8 months  (+/- 7 days)  
Subjects will undergo a physical exam and blood will be drawn for biomarkers and safety labs. 
SF-36, PGA, disease activity and vascular measurements will be obtained. Abbreviated me dical 
history will be performed  to assess any changes in medical conditions or medications. Any 
leftover  study drug will be collected and drug accountability performed. No additional study 
drug will be dispensed  at these visits. PET exams will be performed in 15 patients initially 
randomized to placebo and 15 patients initially randomized to pioglitazon e and the investigators 
will be blinded to this. PET studies will only be performed at baseline and month 3.  A urine 
analysis will be obtained at the end of the study to assess for hematuria.   
The minimum time between baseline and visit 3 -month and between  visit 5 month and visit 8 
month will be 75 days and the maximum 105 days.  Overall, total study duration will not exceed 
9 months  (+/- 1 month) . 
 
 Unscheduled Visits  
Subjects will undergo a physical exam and abbreviated medical history will be performed to assess any 
changes in medical conditions or medications.  Reason for the visit will be assessed related to AE, flare or 
study unrelated procedure/visit.  Blood may b e drawn for clinical and safety labs when deemed 
appropriate by the study investigator. We may also perform a urine test called urine analysis.   Research 
blood may also be drawn for biomarkers as needed.  
10 MONITORING SUBJEC TS AND CRITERIA FOR WITHDRAWAL  
10.1 Patient Withdrawal  and T ermination  Criteria.  
Subjects will be informed that they may withdraw or be excluded from the study at any time.  
Our intention is to maintain stable doses of immunosuppression and antimalarials for the 
  31 duration of the trial. On occasion, doses are adjusted to treat SLE activity. While not ideal, we 
anticipate that over the duration of 8 months, outside providers may want to adjust or add new 
immunosuppressive therapy. In the event of these changes, each of these instances will be 
reviewed by the Principal Investigator to determine continuation or withdrawal from the trial to 
maintain scientific integrity.  
The followi ng conditions will require the discontinuation of study agent : 
1. Subjects may voluntarily withdraw at any point  
2. Flares not responding to the treatment above or if, in the opinion of the responsible 
investigator, the subject needs immediate immunosuppressive therapy that is not 
allowed in the protocol  
3. Any Grade 4 adverse event that is unexpected and at least possibly , probably or 
definitely  related to study drug  
4. More than 1 “no -show” for a visit  
5. Becoming pregnant after baseline visit.  The subject will be foll owed for the outcome of 
the pregnancy.  
6. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the responsible investigator, poses unacceptable 
risk to the subject.  
7. Nevertheless, LFTs will be monitored on all patients at each study visit and those 
patients with LFTs >2x upper limit at  Screening visit will be excluded. If during the 
trial, LFTs increase to > than 3x fold the upper limit of normal (ULN), levels will be 
rechecked within 36 hours and if elevation >3 ULN persists and there are not alternative 
etiologies, thera py will be discontinued. If LFTs are elevated >2 but < 3x ULN (after 
confirming within 48 hours), we will investigate etiology of liver enzyme elevation and 
cautiously reinitiate therapy if alternative etiology is found. For patients with NAFLD 
that are en rolled, based on recent clinical trials that have been published (Cusi K et 
al.Annals of Internal Medicine 2016) assessing  the role of long -term pioglitazone 
treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, we will include only patients that have LFTs 
< 3 time s ULN. If there is an increase to >3 times ULN once study drug starts during 
monitoring (confirmed within 24 hours), drug will be stopped.  
 
10.2 Study Completion Criteria  
A subject is considered to have completed the study when he/she has completed 8 months in the 
trial and received both treatment arms of the study. Enrolled subjects who withdraw from the 
trial prior to receiving  study agent  or who only complete one arm  will be replaced ; however, 
patients who complete only one arm will still be included in analy sis. 
10.3 Results Given to Participants and Physicians  
Clinically relevant results will be transmitted to patients as part of this protocol.  Participants are 
encouraged to remain in contact with the responsible investigators   regarding advances in the 
field, and will be invited to enroll in pertinent future studies.  Participants may request research 
publications resulting from this protocol.  Medical care after study completion will occur with 
  32 the primary treating physician and rheumatologist. Results of test s will be shared with the 
medical provider and patient if consider medically/clinically relevant.  
10.4 Blinding, Packaging, Labeling and Storage  
Study agent ( 15 mg pioglitazone or placebo) will be packaged in identical vials each containing  
300 capsules. Both study agents will be blinded using identical -looking capsules prepared by a 
vetted vendor selected by the  NIH Pharmaceutical Development Service (PDS). Each vial will 
be labeled with a treatment number specific to the subject. A 300 capsule  (one vial) supply of 
study agent will be given to each subject at enrollment at the  baseline visit and at month 5.  The 
amount of study agent dispensed will be sufficient to last from baseline to month 3, and from 
month 5 to month 8.   The randomization co de will be provided by the Clinical Center Research 
Pharmacy, as mentioned above.  Emergency unblinding will occur in the case of a serious 
adverse event (SAE) that is considered potentially secondary to the drug. Unblinding will be 
performed by PDS. Only the pharmacists will be unblinded throughout the trial.  The subjects, 
the investigators, and the study site staff will remain blinded to study medication assignment 
during the entire study period. Compliance with study treatment and pill counts will be 
performed by the research nurse/study coordinator and this information will be provided to PDS 
as well.  
11 DATA ANALYSIS   
The study measures the primary and secondary outcome variables at 4 time periods in each 
subject. We will begin with a univariate investigation of the outcomes to check for outliers and 
distributional properties followed by an assessment for carryover effects. The analysis of the 
study will be conducted using a 2-period cr oss-over model by comparing matched pair 
differences for the subjects in the first sequence with those in the second sequence. We expect 
this analysis will indicate no difference between the groups. If we find no carry over effect the 
modeling will continu e without controlling for sequence. If we do find a sequence effect we will 
account for it in our models. The analysis will be based on a repeated measures analysis 
accounting for treatment and period effects and incorporating the two baseline measures. We  
will use a generalized linear model and a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) framework 
with two dummy variables, one indicating treatment condition and the other indicating the 
baseline condition (the omitted or the reference condition is Placebo). We  will use an 
unstructured covariance matrix and robust standard errors. The primary parameter of interest is 
the regression coefficient for the treatment condition (a contrast between the placebo and 
pioglitazone). This approach is attractive because it ca n handle non -normal and categorical 
outcomes. The analysis is robust to model mis -specification154. 
The approach used in testing the hypothesis under the three specific aims will be similar. For 
Specific Aim 1, we will per form a separate analysis for each outcome variable: 
CAVI /Sphygmocor,  PAT and FDG/CT. We will also perform secondary analysis using serum 
and cellular CV biomarkers. Our first analysis will be a randomization based analysis with no 
  33 covariates other than tre atment and period effects. There are several confounding variables, 
especially medications that could contribute towards the variation in the outcome. We will 
expand the regression models by including them as predictors. If the number of confounding 
variab les is large, we will use investigate a propensity score matching analysis. For Specific 
Aim 2, we will define a dichotomous clinical endpoint measuring lupus disease activity. 
Patients achieving an improvement of the SLEDAI -2K by 20%, a significant improv ement in 
PGA and the absence of a BILAG 2004 A or B flare will be considered to have improved. 
Others will be defined as not having improved. The analysis for this score will be similar to the 
one proposed for Specific Aim 1.  A GEE model will be used to a ssess treatment differences. 
We will also investigate the separate effects of each of these measures. The same approach used 
in Aim 1 will be taken for confounding variables using regression or propensity score 
adjustment. We will begin the investigation o f Aim 3, assessment of innate and adaptive 
immune abnormalities in SLE, with a graphical analysis of the variables. We use multivariate 
methods to determine good summary measures of the various factors and compare the two 
treatments using the same models a s defined for Aims 1 and 2.  
Our primary analysis will be performed as an intent -to-treat analysis. If the subjects providing 
complete data are systematically different from those who dropped out, then the estimates based 
only on completers will be biased.  We will investigate adjusting for differences in the 
populations who are completers and noncompleters and will consider multiple imputation to 
impute the missing values. Before the database is locked and final analysis performed, 
violations will be assess ed on a case -by-case basis by the PI to determine if the medication 
change was such that it would adversely affect the study results.  If changes may adversely 
affect data interpretation, subjects will be dropped from final analysis.  A post hoc analysis of  
disease activity, measured by SLEDAI -2K, will be adjusted for burst steroids in excess of that 
permitted by the protocol. Analysis  of prednisone doses, daily and cumulative will also be 
included.  
11.1 Power and Sample Size  
We arrived at sample size based on previous publications for arterial stiffness  and vascular 
dysfunction  observed in SLE92, 101 -103 as well as on our recently completed RA trial. To achieve 
this sample size, we will be recruiting 100 patients , assuming a 20%  or more dropout  rate (see 
below).  The actual analysis will be more powerful and will use data on all subjects including 
those who provide partial information. Based on our previous experience with the CV lupus 
cohort and on published lite rature on cross -over designs using pioglitazone to measure CV 
markers in other populations, we estimate our dropout rate to be between 3 -20%. We have then 
projected a 20% drop -out rate that includes both drop -outs, as well as the few people who are 
deemed protocol violators because of significant changes in immunosuppressive or vascular 
medications. This sample will give us power to detect moderate standardized differences for the 
other variables measured in this study. As this is a “proof of concept” study , we estimate it is 
  34 important to detect at least moderate differences in outcome for them to be clinically 
meaningful.  
11.2 Data Management  
The primary source data for the study will be maintained by NIH Clinical Research Information 
System  (CRIS ) and the NIH C linical Trials Database (CTDB), with subject surveys and interval 
questionnaires administered by the secure Clinical Trials Survey System (CTSS). Study data 
and outcomes will be monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) consisting of 
NIH staff not affiliated with the study who will meet every 6 months and review un -blinded 
data. Possible adverse outcomes of treatment will be as per NIH and GCP monitoring 
guidelines.  An IND waiver request was granted by FDA for  this study .

12 HUMAN SUBJECT PROTEC TION ISSUES  
12.1 Selection   
 
  35 
 Human Participants Involvement and Characteristics  
For the purposes of this study, human participants will undergo physical examination and  
questionnaire completion, CAVI, Endopat, FDG PET  CT and DXA scan  (a subset  of subjects ), 
blood draws,  Echocardiogram,  and exposure to study drug (pioglitazone and placebo).  There 
will be no involvement of fetuses, neonates, children, pregnant women, pris oners, or 
institutionalized individuals.  Women of childbearing potential will be included, but risk 
reduction measures  (including required contraception and pregnancy testing ) are in place to 
protect th em.  
 Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children:  
12.1.2.1  Women  
Women and men with SLE will be recruited into this study.  Research consistently shows that 
women are 7 -10 times more likely to develop SLE than men. For this reason, we expect 
approximately 80 -90% of participants to be female.  Based on the past rec ord of the 
investigative team and the SLE natural history protocol, we believe specialized outreach for the 
recruitment of women will not be necessary.  
12.1.2.2  Inclusion of Minorities  
No ethnic groups will be excluded from this protocol.  All participants must ha ve a diagnosis of 
SLE.  Research reviews indicate an increased risk for SLE development in African -Americans 
and Hispanics. Targeted enrollment rates will be based on data from the natural history protocol 
of SLE at NIH.   Based on the past record of the i nvestigative team, we expect that minorities 
will be recruited in adequate numbers.  However, the PI will monitor recruitment progress on an 
annual basis, and will implement outreach strategies if enrollment falls short of targets.  
Outreach strategies inc lude recruiting participants from physician offices in the area that service 
a predominance of minority patients.   
12.1.2.3 Inclusion of Children  
Children will be excluded from this study as pioglitazone is not approved in children and the 
proposed vascula r tests have not been validated in children.  
12.1.2.3  Inclusion of NIH employees  
NIH employees are allowed to participate if they fulfill criteria. NIH employees who become 
subjects will be protected, as specified in SOP14F  
12.2 Benefits  and Risks/Discomforts   
 Benefits  
The knowledge to be gained may result in better, more focused treatment approaches, 
implemented earlier in the course of disease, to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
associated with SLE and other inflammatory a utoimmune diseases. This would directly benefit 
future patients and greatly improve our understanding of these debilitating comorbidities.   
  36 This study will provide important preliminary information about the effect of PPAR pathways 
in SLE patients and may  contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of SLE. 
Patients will benefit from comprehensive clinical exam s and laboratory tests during the trial, as 
well as assessment of CV risk  and thorough evaluation by experts in SLE. Otherwise, t here may 
be no direct benefits to participants. Th e study agent is not expected to be associated with the 
most common toxicities of therapies commonly used in the treatment of SLE, such as severe 
immunosuppression, myelosuppression , or amenorrhea. This study i nvolves more than minimal 
risk.  
 Potential Risks  
12.2.2.1  Blood Draws  
The risks of venous puncture include the occurrence of discomfort and/or bruising at the site of 
puncture. Less commonly, there may be formation of a small blood clot or swelling of the 
surrounding area as well as bleeding from the puncture site. Syncope and local infection may 
occur. These are minor risks.  
12.2.2.2  Physical Exam and Questionnaire -based Data Collection  
Some participants may experience discomfort or frustration these procedures . However, the 
risks for the participants are felt to be similar to those encountered in a standard physical 
examination. Breach of confidentiality and the possible discomfort associated with being asked 
personal questions about health history and the completi on of questionnaires pose minimal 
risks.  Risks due to physical exam and questionnaire -based data collection are considered 
negligible.  
12.2.2.3  Vascular Function Studies  
No complications are expected from these  procedure s. Minor discomfort from the use of blood 
pressure cuffs may be experienced and is similar to having one’s blood pressure  checked.  
12.2.2.4  FDG/PET/CT  
The NIH Clinical Center PET department uses only commercially available FDG.  
The effective radiation dose from 10 mCi FDG is approximately 0.62 rem.  Thus th e total 
radiation from one FDG scan and a transmission CT scan is 1.3 2 rem. In addition to any 
radiation concern, there could be psychological distress caused by an incidental finding of 
asymmetric FDG uptake that would likely necessitate additional invest igation to exclude cancer 
or other lesions (see below).  
Additional minimal risks include bleeding or bruising at the venous site of FDG administration.  
We have provided radiation dosimetry at the end of this protocol. This procedure will not be 
performed  more often than twice  per patient  during the 8 month duration of this trial and will be 
performed in 30 out of the 70 patients. Overall, minimum exposure will be 0 rem/year (only 
  37 vascular function tests but no imaging) and maximum exposure will be 2.64 re m/year , which is 
within the annual exposure limits.  
Participants may experience mild claustrophobia from the PET CT.  The p articipant will be able 
to notify the technician throughout the scan if he/she needs to come out of the scanner.  
 
12.2.2.5  Incidental Finding s 
Incidental findings from imaging studies of coronary disease, obstructive or non -obstructive, 
will be reported to the subject’s referring physician.  This protocol will follow the NIH Clinical 
Center Guidelines for Management of Small Pulmonary Nodules Detected on CT Scans .  The 
literature has noted incidental findings on PET/CT scans to include neoplastic and non -
neoplastic lesions.  We have broadened our findings to include  non-neoplastic and also 
inflammatory lesions such as lymph nodes as well as solitary pulmonary nodules.  Neoplastic 
findings include cancer of the colon, lung and soft tissue (sarcoma); however, except for lung 
cancer, these other 2 cancer types have not been highly detected by PET/CT.  Information 
regarding incidental findings is explained in the informed consent to help the subjects 
understand that these findings will be included on their report, sent to their physician, and may 
require clinical testing as a follow up to define the abnormality.  Prior to sending report, the 
investigators will provide dedicated follow up time with subject s to inform them of findings and 
as needed, will provide consult with appropriate medical personne l. 
12.2.2.6  Study Drug  
Participants will be randomized to pioglitazone or placebo and all patients will at some point 
receive pioglitazone given the crossover  nature of trial.  Risks of pioglitazone use in this 
population (i.e. non -diabetic) are as follows:  
• Decre ases in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 2 -4%.  These reductions may be due to an 
increase in plasma volume and usually pose only minor risk. CBC will be monitored on 
all patients  at each study visit . 
• Mild to moderate edema.  Pioglitazone is contraindicated in  patients with NYHA Class 
III or IV cardiac failure .  In diabetics, concern over the use of rosiglitazone and 
worsening CV outcomes is still a matter of debate but a black box has been included in 
the medication guide describing  a risk for congestive heart  failure exacerbation  in 
individuals taking TZDs . For our study, all patients will undergo a baseline 
echocardiogram and will be excluded for an  ejection fraction <45% and/or evidence of 
NYHA class II -IV. 
• Hepatic effects.  Pioglitazone can cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 2 -
4%.  These reductions may be due to an increase in plasma volume and usually pose 
only minor risk. While pi oglitazone is  typically not associated with hepatic toxicity or 
liver function test (LFT) elevations, the pioglitaz one package insert states there are post 
marketing reports of hepatic failure and that causality cannot be excluded; Medwatch 
report states there is an association with hepatitis, hepatic enzyme elevations to 3 or 
more times the upper limit of normal.  Pio glitazone is structurally related to troglitazone 
  38 (no longer marketed), which has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and 
rare cases of liver failure, liver transplants, and death. In a recent study of non -diabetics 
treated with pioglitazone for similar periods of time to what is proposed for our study, 
no changes in LFTs were observed68.  Similarly, in our RA study, we did not detect  any 
significant LFT abnormalities, even in those patients concomitantly taki ng methotrexate. 
Nevertheless, LFT s will be monitored on all patients  at each study visit  and those 
patients with LFTs  >2x upper limit at Screening visit  will be excluded . If during the 
trial, LFTs increase to > than 3x fold the upper limit of normal  (ULN), levels will be 
rechecked within 36 hours and if elevation >3 ULN persists and there are not alternative 
etiologies, therapy will be discontinued. If LFTs are elevated  >2 but  < 3x ULN (after 
confirming within 48 hours), we will investigate etiology of liver enzyme elevation and 
cautiously reinitiate therapy if alternative etiology is found.  For patients with NAFLD 
that are enrolled,  based on recent clinical trials that have been published (Cusi K et 
al.Annals of Internal Medicine 2016) assessing  the  role of long -term pioglitazone 
treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, we will include only patients that have LFTs 
< 3 times ULN. If there is an increase to >3 times ULN once study drug starts during 
monitoring (confirmed within 24 hours), drug will be stopped.  
• Interaction with hormonal contraceptives may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraception. Patients will be required to also use a barrier method during the trial if 
they are taking  oral contraceptives.  
• The most common side effects report ed were upper respiratory trac t infection, sinusitis, 
pharyngitis, headache, myalgia, and tooth disorder.   
• Very rarely, pioglitazone may be associated with sporadic, transient elevations in CPK 
levels, which have been self-resolving . 
• Small weight gains (< 5 kg) are associated with pioglitazone use, usually with more 
prolonged use than the treatment course we are proposing.  Weight and edema will be 
monitored closely and patients will be instructed to notify investigators if weight is 
gained or  edema or dyspn ea develop.  
• An increased incidence of bone fracture was noted in female patients taking TZDs. 
During a mean follow -up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 
5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was 
noted after the first year of treatment and remained during the course of the study. No 
increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone 1.7% (30/1735) 
versus placebo 2.1% (37/1728). Given the short duration of the trial, we will not assess 
the effect of this drug on bone metabolism.  Given that the mechanism of bone fractures 
with TZDs is considered different than the one associated with corticosteroid use, we 
will not change inclusion/exclusion  criteria based on medication use. In female patients , 
attention will be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current 
standards of care  and in communication with treating rheumatologist.  As mentioned in 
the exclusion criteria, we wil l exclude pos tmenopausal women wh o have a DXA scan  
showing a T score worse than -2.5, unless they are willing to begin  a bisphosphonate by 
visit day 1.  
• As mentioned above, there ha ve been data suggestin g an increase in bladder cancer  in 
diabetics that have  been on TZD s for > 2 years. Given the short duration of this trial, no 
significant concerns are present. Nevertheless, we will exclude patients who have 
received cyclophosphamide over the last year, whoever  developed hemorrhagic cystitis , 
  39 or those with a previous history of bladder cancer, or with a history of hematuria not 
explained by another cause.  
 
Overall, g iven the short duration of exposure to pioglitazone (3 months), we do not expect 
repercussions on bone health, bladder or adverse CV outcomes.  
12.2.2.7  Echocardiogram:  
No side effects are associated with echocardiogram.  
12.2.2.8  DXA scan:  
The exposure to radiation is minimal from this procedure. No side effects are otherwise exp ected 
and this will only be performed in postmenopausal  subjects that have not undergone a DXA scan 
over the last year.  
12.3 ADVERSE EVENT AND UN ANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING:  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting AEs and 
SAEs in accordance with the protocol, IRB requirements, and federal regulations.  
12.3.1  Definitions:  
12.3.2  Adverse Event:  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome, or disease that either occurs during the study, having  
been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen.  All AEs will be graded for 
intensity (severity) and relationship to study drug.  
12.3.3  Unanticipated Problem:  
The Office for Human Research Protections considers unanticipated problems to be  any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given a) the research procedures 
that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent, and 
b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by the pro cedures involved in the research); and  
• Places subjects or others at a greater risk for physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm than was previously known or recognized.  
  40 An incident, experience, or outcome that meets the 3 criteria above will generally warrant 
consideration of substantive changes in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of subjects 
or others.  Examples of corrective actions or substantive changes that might need to be 
considered in response to an unanticipated problem  include the following:  
• Changes to the research protocol initiated by the investigator prior to obtaining IRB 
approval to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects.  
• Modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified ris ks. 
• Implementation of additional procedures for monitoring subjects.  
• Suspension of enrollment of new subjects.  
• Suspension of research procedures in currently enrolled subjects.  
• Modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly 
recognized risks.  
• Provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously enrolled 
subjects.  
Per the definition, only a subset of AEs would be further characterized as unanticipated 
problems.  Additionally, there are other sorts of eve nts that, while not AEs, would also be 
characterized as unanticipated problems (e.g., contaminated study drug).  
12.3.4  Serious Adverse Event:  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening ( defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not apply to an AE which hypothetically might have caused the death if it were 
more severe),  
• Requires or prolongs hospitalization (i.e. the AE required at least a 24 -hour inp atient 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay; 
hospitalizations for elective medical/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine 
check -ups are not SAEs by this criterion),  
• Results in a congenital anomaly  or birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or 
fetus of a patient exposed to the trial drug prior to conception or during pregnancy) , 
• Causes a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. the AE resulted in a 
substantial disruption of th e patient’s ability to carry out normal life functions) , or 
  41 • Is any other condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, represents a 
significant hazard or it does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may 
jeopardize the patient  and may requi re medical or surgical intervention  to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  
12.3.5  Medical Events Not Qualifying as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events:  
Signs and symptoms of pre -existing medical conditions will not be recorded or reported as AEs 
or SAE s, unless they represent a clinically significant change from the baseline disease status 
documented at the Pre -screening Visit.  In addition, hospitalization for elective procedures or 
surgeries will not be considered SAEs, nor will inpatient hospitalizat ions for convenience.  
12.3.6  Clinical Laboratory Test Results Not Qualifying as Adverse Events or Serious 
Adverse Events:  
A clinically significant laboratory result that is present at baseline and does not change 
significantly during the study will not be reporte d as an AE or SAE.  The clinical significance of 
a change in a laboratory result will be determined by the investigator.  
The Principal Investigator or designated AI will evaluate all clinical laboratory and imaging 
results for clinically significant abnormalities and document the evaluation in the medical record 
and case report form. A laboratory abnormality will be document ed as an adverse event using the 
following criteria:  
• The abnormality is not already encompassed by a reported adverse event (e.g., 
elevated AST need not be reported as an AE if Liver Failure has already been 
reported as an AE).  
• The abnormality is consider ed clinically significant by the Investigator.  
Clinically significant lab abnormality is defined as meeting the following:  
o Necessitates study drug dosing modification (i.e., dose reduction, 
interruption or discontinuation); and/or  
o Requires a therapeutic i ntervention (e.g., concomitant medication, blood 
transfusion or dialysis); and  
o Is unexplainable by the patient’s current and past medical conditions  
The Principal Investigator will follow significant abnormalities until they return to baseline or 
stabilize . 
 
  42 12.3.7  Lupus Flare:  
A lupus flare is any significant worsening of the signs, symptoms and laboratory test 
abnormalities associated with lupus. Any increase in the SLEDAI 2K index of 3 or more will be 
considered as a SLE flare.  
12.3.8  Reporting of Adverse Events, Unan ticipated Problems and Protocol Deviations:  
12.3.8.1  Intensity of Adverse Event:  
The intensity (severity) of AEs and SAEs will be graded according to a descriptive scale based 
on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),  
Version 4.0.   If AEs and SAEs is not available at CTCAE, it will be graded according to below 
chart.  
Severity Definitions  
Grade  Definition  
       1. Mild:  Causing no limitation of usual activity  
2. Moderate:  Causing some limitations of usual activities  
3. Severe:  Causing inability to carry out usual activities  
4. Life Threatening:  Patient was at immediate risk of death from the event  
 
For lupus flares, we will use the following criteria  based on validated activity scores: (changes 
are points increased compared to baseline visit)  
Increase in SLEDAI 2K: 2-4:  Mild  
Increase in SLEDAI2K: 5 -8: Moderate  
Increase in SLEDAI 2K: > 9: Severe  
  43 12.3.8.2  Relationship to Study Drug and Procedures:  
For all AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide his/her best estimate of the causal 
relationship between the event and study drug, and the causal relationship between the event and 
study procedures.  The degree of certainty about causality will be grad ed according to the criteria 
in Table. 5.  
 
 
Table 5.  Relatedness of Adverse Event to Intervention  
  44 Causality  Description  
Not Related Category  
Unknown  Not enough information exists for the assessment of causality at the time 
of occurrence.  
Unrelated  Adverse event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., underlying 
disease, environment)  
Related Category  
Unlikely  
(must have at least 2)  1) does not have temporal relationship to intervention  
2) could readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state  
3) could have been due to environmental or other interventions   
4) does not follow a known pattern of response to intervention  
5) does not reappear or worsen with reintroduction of inte rvention  
Possible  
(must have at least 2)  1) has a reasonable temporal relationship to intervention  
2) could not readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state  
3) could not readily have been due to environmental or other interventions  
4) follows a known pattern of response to intervention

2) could not readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or 
have been due to environmental or other interventions  
3) follows a known pattern of response to intervention  
4) disappears or decreases with reduction in dose or cessation of 
intervention  
Definite  
(must have all 4)  1) has a reasonable temporal relationship to intervention  
2) could not readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or 
have been due to environmental or other interventions  
3) follows a known pattern of response to intervention  
4) disappears or decreases with cessation of intervention and recurs with 
re-exposure  
 
  45 12.3.8.3  Expectedness of Adverse Events:  
For purposes of regulatory reporting, the medically responsible investigator will determine 
whether an AE or SAE is expected or unexpected.  Expected adverse events are those 
adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or in the P hysicians’ 
Desk Reference.  
Unexpected  adverse events are those not listed  in the Package Insert (P.I.) or Physicians’ 
Desk Reference (PDR), published medical literature, protocol, and informed consent 
document or not identified.   This includes adverse eve nts for which the specificity or 
severity is not consistent w ith the description in the P.I. , PDR , published medical literature, 
protocol and informed consent.   For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would 
be unexpected if the P.I. only refer red to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
For consistency of labeling and categorizing adverse events, the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0 
will be used in this study.    
12.3.9  Procedures for Reporting  
Serious adverse events, unexpected AEs, and unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB , 
NIAMS Clinical Director, and DSMC according to the NIH -OHSRP SOP  16, “Reporting  
Requirements  for Unanticipated  Problems,  Adverse  Events  and Protocol  Deviations.”  All patients 
who receive at least one dose or part of a dose of the trial me dication (pioglitazone) , whether 
withdrawn prematurely or not, will be included in the safety analyses. All data relating to safety 
will be listed and summarized separately for the treatment period and for the entire study. All 
safety reports w ill be reviewed by the Principal Investigator.  
12.3.10  Reporting Timeline :  
Adverse  events,  protocol  deviations,  unanticipated  problems  (UP),  Unanticipated  Adverse  
Device  Effects  (UADEs),  serious  adverse  events,  sponsor  and serious,  are defined  as described  
in NIH HRPP  SOP  16 (“Reporting  Requirements  for Unanticipated  Problems,  Adverse  Events  
and Protocol  Deviations.”).  All adverse  events  occurring  during  the study,  including  those  
observed by  or reported  to the research  team,  will be recorded.  Serious  unanticipated  problems 
and serious  protocol  deviations,  will be reported  to the IRB , DSMC  and Clinical Director  as 
soon  as possible  but not more  than 7 days  after  the PI first learns  of the event.  Not serious  
unanticipated  problems  will be reported  to the IRB, DSMC  and Clinical Director  as soon  as 
possible  but not more  than 14 days  after  the PI first learns  of the event.  Not serious  protocol  
  46 deviations  will be reported  to the IRB as soon  as possible  but not more  than 14 days  after  the 
PI first learns  of the  event.  
Deaths  will be reported  to the Clinical  Director , DSMC  and IRB within  7 days  after  the PI first 
learns  of the event.  
12.3.11   Reporting of Non -Serious Protocol Deviations:  
Non-serious protocol deviations will only be reported to the IRB (within 14 days after the PI first 
learns of the event) if they represent a departure from NIH policies for the conduct of human 
subjects research, adversely affect the health care of the subject(s) or compromise the 
interpretation or integrity of the research.  Non -serio us protocol deviations that result from normal 
subject scheduling variations or technical issues associated with sampling that does not impact the 
health of the subject or the interpretation of the study data will not be reported.  
12.3.12   Reporting of Adverse Ev ents: 
The PI is responsible for summarizing all serious adverse events and adverse events at least 
possibly related to the research procedure and interventions at the time of Continuing 
Review.    
12.3.13   Reporting of Deaths:  
All deaths that have occurred among study participants since the previous review will be 
summarized at the time of continuing review.    
12.3.14 Reporting Waivers:  
Waiver of Reporting to the IRB of anticipated minor protocol deviations, adverse events and 
deaths due to underlying disease or p opulation under study unless determined to be an 
Unanticipated Problem.  
• Non-unanticipated problems  (UP)/  adverse  events  will not be reported  to the IRB unless  
they occur  at a rate greater  than that known  to occur  in patients with SLE.  If events are 
occurring substantially more frequent that would be anticipated in typically treated 
patients with SLE, they will also be reported to IRB. The following  anticipated  adverse  
events  will not be reported  to the IRB unless  they occur  at a severity  greater  than that 
known  to occur  in patients taking pioglitazone: lower extremity edema, decrease in Hb 
which is less than 1.5 g/dl, weight gain <5 pounds/week.  Examples  of expected  adverse  
events  include  those events  detailed  in the Investigator’ s protocol for pioglitazone  and 
  47 in the pioglitazone drug insert .  No more than a total gain of 15% weight gain if 
associated with signs and symptoms of volume overload such as shortness of breath 
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or elevated jugula r venous pressure will be 
allowed for the total duration of the study.   If patient gained we ight during study due 
to other reason s such as lifestyle changes or increase in Prednisone dose or other 
specific reasons  and the patient is not at risk of health compromising condition, these 
reasons will be documented in CRIS and will not be reported as Unanticipated 
Problems. Patient will be advised to lose weight through NIH nutrition consults or 
exercising.  If the rate of these  events  exceeds  the rate specified  in the protocol  or 
investigator’s  brochure  the events  will be classified  and reported  as though  they are 
Unanticipated  Problems .  
12.3.15  Adverse  Event, Protocol deviation and Unanticipated Problem Assessment and 
Follow -up: 
In the event of an adverse event, protocol deviation and unanticipated problem the first concern 
will be for the safety of the patients.   Investigators are required to collect a nd document all adverse 
events (AEs), protocol deviations and unanticipated problems.  At each study visit, the Principal 
Investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit, and review any 
protocol deviations and unanticipated p roblems. Adverse events (including SAEs), protocol 
deviations, and unanticipated problems may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the subject.  
• Questioning the subject in an objective manner.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject.  
• Review of all source documentation related to study procedures; abnormal values or results 
from clinical or laboratory evaluations (including, but not limited to, radiographs, 
ultrasounds, or electrocardiograms) can also indicate adverse events.  
Events will be followed for outcome information until they return to baseline or stabilize.  Study -
related AEs will be followed and/or treated at the NIH until resolution or stabilization of the AE, 
after which the subject will be referred to a physician(s ) outside of the NIH for care and follow -
up. 
  48 12.3.16  Adverse Event Recording:  
Adverse events will be monitored throughout this study, and these events will be recorded on the 
appropriate AE eCRF at each visit  after starting study medication .  The record for each event 
will include the following information:  
• Description of the event.  
• Onset and stop dates of the event.  
• Seriousness of event.  
• Intensity (or severity) of the event.  
• Action taken because of the event.  
• Relationship of the event to study drug and/or study procedure.  
• Outcome of the event.  
• Expectedness of the event.  
12.3.17   Pregnancy Reporting and Follow -up: 
This study includes pregnancy information as safety data  and pregnancies will be recorded if 
they begin any time after enrollment. Information about any pregna ncy should be reported 
promptly to the NIH NIAMS/NIDDK IRB, NIAMS Clinical Director, and DSMC on the same 
timeline as a SAE. All pregnancies identified during the study must be followed to conclusion 
and the outcome of each must be reported. The investigat or should be informed immediately of 
any pregnancy in a study subject or a partner of a study subject. A pregnant subject should be 
instructed to stop taking study medication. The investigator  will refer patient to High -risk 
Obstetrics for counseling and f ollow -up.  Pioglitazone has a pregnancy risk factor Category C; 
there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.  Animal studies show 
increased rates of post -implantation loss, delayed development, reduced fetal weights, and 
delayed par turition at doses 10 to 40 times the maximum recommended human dose (Label, 
2013).  Monitoring of the pregnant subject should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy, 
and a follow -up Pregnancy Monitoring form detailing the outcome of the pregnancy s hould be 
submitted to the IRB. When possible, similar information should be obtained for a pregnancy 
occurring in a partner of a study subject. Information requested about the delivery will include:  
• Subject’s enrollment ID  
• Gestational age at delivery  
  49 • Birth weight, length, and head circumference  
• Gender  
• Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at 1 minute, 5 
minutes, and 24 hours after birth, if available   
• Any abnormalities.  
Should the pregnancy result in a congenital abnorma lity or birth defect, an SAE also must 
be submitted to the NIH NIAMS/NIDDK IRB using the SAE reporting procedures 
described above.  
12.3.18   Lost to follow up patient reporting:  
After three attempts to contact the patient via phone, a certified letter will be sent to notify him 
or her that they have been withdrawn from the study.  
12.3.19    Stopping Rules :  
If any of the involved entities believes there is any evidence of a pattern of unanticipated AEs 
(regardless of causality) or SAEs an unscheduled independent third party review by the DSMC 
will be requested.  Based on the conclusions of the review, the PI will either terminate the study 
or modify the protocol.  Additional stopping rules may be set at any time by the IRB or DSMC.  
Due to the interventional nature of t he protocol, we expect to work closely with an assigned 
DSMC.  
12.3 Compliance with Good Clinical Practices  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current GCPs recommended by the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and the app licable regulatory requirements 
for participating institutions. These include the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and review 
and approval by the appropriate ethics review committee or IRBs of participating organizations.  
12.4 Data Safety and Monitoring   
The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, the Manual 
of Procedures (MOP), U.S. 21 CFR Part 50 – Protection of Human Subjects, 21CFR312 subpart 
D and Part 56 – Institutional Review Boa rds.   
12.5 Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
The NIAMS DSMC will have safety oversight responsibilities for the study.  DSMC will be 
comprised of 3 members  after discussion with NIAMS Cl inical Director. The DSMC Chair  will 
not be affiliated to NIAMS.  
  50 Approximat ely twice  a year (as mentioned in section 11.2), the DSMC will review data related 
to enrollment progress, study implementation, subject safety, and protocol violations.  The 
CTDB will generate reports that compile all newly submitted and accumulated AEs, SAEs, 
toxicities, pregnancies, and concomitant medications. Subsequent review of periodic reports 
will be performed by the Principal Investigator.  
The DSMC will also consider current information from other sources on the biology of the 
disease and the sub ject population under study.  Based on these reviews, the DSMC will make 
recommendations to the Principal Investigator and the NIAMS Clinical Director concerning the 
continuation, modification, or termination of the study.  The DSMC will also meet ad hoc i f 
relevant issues arise that require committee review.  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for reporting incidents of non -compliance to the 
NIH IRB (in compliance with regulations on the protection of human subjects and institutional 
policy and  procedures) and responsible for securing compliance.  
Clinical monitoring for this study will be based on a clinical monitoring plan developed by 
Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Clinical Monitoring Research Program, Clinical Trials 
Management team in co llaboration with the principal investigator . The purposes of the clinical 
monitoring activities are:  
 1) To verify the existence of signed informed consent documents and documentation of the ICF 
process for each monitored subject;  
2) To verify the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt 
reporting of all SAEs;  
3) To compare abstracted information with individual subjects’ records and source documents 
(subjects’ charts, laboratory analyses and test results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, 
and any other relevant original subject information); and  
4) To help ensure investigators are in compliance with the protocol.  
The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory 
requirements (Office for Human Research Protections -OHRP) and applicable guidelines (ICH -
GCP) are being followed.  
During the monitoring visits, the investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will 
be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.  
The Clinical Monitoring Plan will specify the frequency, procedures, and levels of m onitoring 
activities. Some monitoring activities will be performed remotely (e.g., review of regulatory 
documents), while others will take place on site (e.g., verification of study databases against 
source documentation).  
  51 The staff from Leidos Biomedical Research Inc. CMRP/CTM will conduct the monitoring 
activities and provide the follow -up letters describing the findings.  The frequency of reporting 
for monitoring activities will be specified in the monitoring plan.  The Principal Investigator 
will receiv e copies of the final follow -up letters.  
12.6 Research Use, Storage, and Disposition of Human Samples If , Specimens, or Data   
 Data Collection  
Study staff will complete electronic case report forms (eCRFs) that will be compiled and stored 
in a computerized central database CTDB.  Security of the database system is maintained 
through an application firewall, military grade encryption and SSL certificates, removal of 
personal identifiers consistent with HIPAA requirements (45 C.F.R . 164.514(a),(b)&(c)).  
Research samples collected from subjects consenting to this protocol will be stored in locked 
secure freezers belonging to NIAMS.  The freezers are located in Building  10 at the NIH. 
Samples will be kept indefinitely unless there is a significant justification for destroying them.  
The Principal Investigator will report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) the loss or 
destruction of samples collected under this protocol.  
All samples will be coded and will not have personal identifi ers.  The codes for identifiers will 
be contained in a secure electronic database (CTDB) and a subject code log that is maintained in 
secure research files.  An electronic record log with identifiers of all collected research 
specimens will be kept.  These  will be stored in either research charts or on secure NIH 
computers.   
If coded samples are shared with collaborators within or outside the NIH in the future, tech 
transfer agreements, MTAS or CRADAS will be obtained and an amendment will be submitted 
to IRB to describe the nature of this collaboration. Currently, we do not have any planned 
collaborations.  Samples will be stored in the NIAMS and may be used by the investigators in 
this proposal for studies in the pathogenesis of SLE.  Approval from the IRB  will be obtained 
prior to any research use of stored samples beyond the scope of this study.  
All patient samples will be coded and used for research purposes without sharing identifying 
information and all collaborators will follow federal rules for clini cal research.  
The investigators will retain all study -related records for at least 3 years after discontinuation of 
the study.  Some of the research data might be maintained indefinitely for research purposes. 
Research records and all source documents will  be kept in locked cabinets or rooms, and 
computer research databases will be stored in a secure, password -protected environment, per 
standard NIH policies.  Only study investigators and participating research personnel will have 
access to the data.  
The si te investigators are required to keep accurate records to ensure the conduct of the study is 
fully documented. The period of record retention should be consistent with the record retention 
  52 policies of the sponsoring agency or applicable regulatory agencies . Medical and research 
records will be maintained in the strictest confidence. However, as a part of the quality 
assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, Principal investigator must permit 
authorized representatives of the IND sponsor (if applicable), Leidos, CTDB at the NIH and 
health authorities to examine (and when required by applicable law, to copy) clinical records for 
the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety and 
progress. Unless required b y the laws permitting copying of records, only the coded identity 
associated with documents or other subject data may be copied (obscuring any personally 
identifying information). Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the 
strict c onfidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified 
individuals. Participating sites will normally be notified in advance of auditing visits.  
Study staff will complete electronic case report forms (eCRFs) via a web -based el ectronic data 
capture (EDC) system (Clinical Trials Database, CTDB) that is compliant with Part 11 Title 21 
of the Code of Federal Regulations.  Subject’s electronic medical records in the Clinical 
Research Information System (CRIS) will be used as source documents for these eCRFs.  
CRFs and subject questionnaire data will be kept in the CTDB database.   
The data will be further validated via a series of manual edit checks, and all relevant data 
queries will be raised and resolved on an ongoing basis. Comple te, clean data will be frozen to 
prevent further inadvertent modifications. All discrepancies will be reviewed and any resulting 
queries will be resolved with the investigators and amended in the database. All elements of 
data entry (i.e., time, date, verb atim text, and the person performing the data entry) will be 
recorded in an electronic audit trail to allow all data changes in the database to be monitored and 
maintained in accordance with federal regulations.  
12.7 Remunerati on  
Patients will be offered remuneration as follows:  
$60/visit for screening, baseline, month 3, month 5 and month 8 visits.  
$30/visit for safety visits at months 1 and 6.  
$150/ FDG/PET CT scan.  
 
 Travel cost s may be covered as per the current NIH/NIAMS p olicy . 
12.8 Protocol Consent Processes and Documents   
The princip les of informed consent in the current edition of the Declaration of Helsinki, as well 
as compliance with all IRB requirements, will be implemented in the study, b efore any 
protocol -specified procedures are carried out. A standard consent form for subject participation 
will be provided with the protocol to the IRB and Office of Protocol Services (OPS) of the NIH. 
Any modifications to the standard information in the template will require review and approval 
by the IRB. All subjects will receive a consent form that will include the purposes, procedures, 
benefits, and potential hazards of the study.  This information will be reviewed with the subject 
  53 by either the princ ipal or a qualified associate investigator. All prospective subjects will be 
given ample time to read the consent form, and ask questions, before signing.  
The consent documents will be translated into Spanish. For Spanish speaking subjects the 
consent wil l be explained by the PI/AI through an interpreter. Subjects who are unable to read 
and/or understand English or Spanish will be given a short consent form in their native 
language, if available.  The short consent form will be explained to the subject thr ough an 
interpreter.  The NIH IRBs will review and approve the short consent form process for non -
English -speaking subjects.  If these approaches are not satisfactory, the subject will be excluded 
from the study because of an inability to understand the co nsent.  All subjects will be informed 
of their right to withdraw from the study. Translated documents must be certified to contain the 
complete descriptions provided in the English version of the document.  
Short Form Consent Process:  
 
We anticipate the enrollment of Spanish speaking subjects into this study for which English 
consents have been fully translated. If there is unexpected enrollment of a research participant 
for which there is no translated extant IRB -approved consent document, the Principal 
Investigator and/or those authorized to obtain informed consent will use the short form consent 
process as described in MAS Policy M77 -2, NIH SOP 12, and 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2). The 
summary that will be used is the English version of the extant IRB -approved  consent document. 
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form consent process for up to a 
maximum of 5 requests (either for individual participants or families of participants) in a given 
language, and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the use of 
the short form. Should we reach the threshold of 5 subjects and/or families speaking a single 
language, we will request an additional use of the short form from the IRB and will notify the 
Board that we p lan to have any consent documents frequently used with that population 
translated into the language(s) they speak.  
 
For inclusion in the study, each subject will be required to sign the consent form.  The original 
forms will become part of the permanent me dical record and kept on file in the subject’s study 
chart, available for inspection by regulatory authorities, both federal and institutional , as well as  
the monitoring entity, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc . Copies will be provided to the subjects. 
The fact that informed consent was obtained prior to the initiation of study procedures will be 
documented in the subject’s medical or research record.  
 
 
  54 13. Participation of NIH employees:  
We anticipate eligible NIH employees may participate in this study.  W e will follow the 
Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will give each employee 
a copy of the “NIH information sheet on Staff Research Participation” as per NIH SOP 14F, 
“Research Involving NIH Staff as Subjects.” If the emp loyee is within the same branch, section, 
or unit such that the individual obtaining consent is a supervisor then independent monitoring of 
the consent process through Clinical Center Department of Bioethics Consultation Service will 
be requested. Study st aff will be trained that communication of any personal or medical 
information about an NIH employee), including the fact that they are participating in this study, 
should be restricted to those investigators who need to know this information, and such 
information will not be discussed with anyone outside of the study without permission from the 
subject.  
We will discuss the following applicable safeguards to the eligible NIH employee :  
- Unbiased participation for protocol integrity and participant risk assess ment.  
- Ensure there is no perceived workplace pressure or expectation on either participation or 
deciding not to participate on the protocol in regards to a benefit or adverse effect on their 
NIH employment or staff position.   
- Protection of privacy and con fidentiality will be maintained, but also with acknowledgement 
of the limits due to sensitive information that may be in their NIH file.   
- Discussion of time commitments of the study and compensation in accordance with NIH 
policy 2300 -630-3, Leave Policy f or NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research 
Studies .

TOTAL SCORE :   ______________  
 
 
  72 3. BILAG SCORE.  
BILAG 2004 : The scoring system for the BILAG index of disease activity is based upon the principle of 
the physician's intention to treat. There are eight systems: general, mucocutaneous, neurological, 
musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory, vasculitis, renal and haematological. A score is calculated for each 
system depending on the clinical features present and whether they are new, worse, the same or 
improving in the last 4 weeks compared with previously. The most severe features in each system, which 
are deemed to require high dose steroids (prednisolone >20 mg daily or equivalent) and/or cytotoxic 
agents, characterize an A score. One or more features may have to be present to score an A, depending 
on the system  More moderate disease items that would be considered appropriate to treat with lower 
dose steroids, antimalarials or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contribute to a B score. 
Mild symptomatic features that require just symptomatic the rapy, for example with analgesics and 
NSAIDs, can only contribute to a C score. If there are no current symptoms but the system has previously 
been involved then a D is recorded. If the system has never been involved, it is scored E

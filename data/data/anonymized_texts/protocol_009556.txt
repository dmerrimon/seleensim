 Title:  Dosing requirements of Astagraf XL® in African American kidney transplant recipients converted from twice -daily 
tacrolimus  
I. Clinical Section  
a. Background and Rationale  
Pharmacokinetics from prospective clinical studies demonstrated similar drug exposure (AUC) and 
correlation between trough (C0) and AUC between twice daily tacrolimus and Astagraf XL, which led to 1mg:1mg dose -conversion recommendations;  however more recent studies have shown a decrease in 
tacrolimus exposure after conversion, necessitating increased dosing requirements in 25- 50% of patients (1 -
4).  Variability in results from studies may be, in part, due to the type of assay used (LC -MS vs. 
immunoassays), time after transplant, CYP3A5 alleles (expressers vs. non -expressers), and ethnicity (4 -6).  
In one study, Niioka, et.al. demonstrated that patients with the CYP3A5 expresser allele had a 25% lower 
dose -adjusted AUC in the daily tacrolimus group compared to the twice -daily tacrolimus group, while still 
maintaining good correlation between C0 and AUC (6).  These results are contradictory to Wehland, et.al.’s 
results that demonstrated a significant difference in CYP3A5 non- expressers after conversion, a stud y that 
was limited by small numbers of patients with the CYP3A5*1 allele  (5).   
In terms of ethnicity, African American kidney transplant recipients have shown decreased absorption of 
twice -daily tacrolimus, achieving lower peak concentrations (Cmax) and AUC  compared to Caucasian 
kidney transplant recipients, necessitating a higher total daily dose to achieve adequate C0 levels (7,8).  
Additionally, de novo dosing of the extended -release formulation Astagraf XL has revealed that African 
Americans require approximately 20- 30%  higher doses than Caucasians from 1month to 12months after 
transplant to achieve similar C0 levels(9).  
One of the reasons for the alterations of tacrolimus absorption in African Americans is believed to be the 
much higher incidence of  the CYP3A5*1 expresser allele compared to other ethnicities.  Because of the 
variability in conversion dosing based off of CYP3A5 alleles and the underrepresentation of African 
Americans in conversion studies, further study is needed so that appropriate conversion dosing can be provi ded to this at -risk population.  
b. Objective  
 
Compare the difference in dose -normalized trough and total daily dose necessary to reach the steady state 
therapeutic goal after conversion  from tacrolimus IR to Astagraf XL® in Africa n American kidney transplant 
recipients.  
 
c. Study Design

d. Sample Population  
Male or female adult (≥18 years old) African American patients with a history of solitary kidney transplant at

randomization .  Patients must be capable of understanding the purposes and risks of the study and have the 
ability to give written informed consent and be willing to participate and comply with the study.    
i. Sample size  
25 subjects from a single -center

Statistical analysis plan:   
Based off of preliminary data from 7 patients that underwent conversion from tacrolimus IR to 
Astagraf XL, we utilized no difference in dose -normalized trough as the null hypothesis and a 20% 
decrease in dose -normalized trough as the alternative hypothesis.  Assuming a starting dose -
normalized trough of 0.9 and a standard deviation in each group of 0.35, it was determined that 21 
patients would be necessary to reach 80% power with an alpha of 0.05, 1 -tailed.  This should also 
be sufficient patient data to present a c hange in mg/kg dosing, which will have a much smaller 
standard deviation, as well as a percent difference in TDD, assuming a 20% increase in dosage requirements with a standard deviation of 5mg, as evidenced in our preliminary data.  
 
ii. Inclusion criteria  
1. At least 18 years of age  
2. Signed  informed consent   
3. African American race  
4. History of a solitary renal transplant 
5. Stable tacrolimus dose  for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization  
 
iii. Exclusion criteria   
1. A condition or disorder that, in the opinion of the investig ator, may adversely affect the 
outcome of the study or the safety of the subject  
2. Currently enrolled in an investigational drug trial 
3. History of a non -renal organ transplant  
4. History of acute cellular rejection within 1 month prior to randomization  
5. An increase in serum creatinine by > 20% in the 2 weeks prior to randomization  
6. Maintenance immunosuppression that does not consist of tacrolimus IR given twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium, and prednisone ≥ 5mg daily  
 
e. Study intervention : 
i. Intervention, Admini stration, and Duration  
1. At the time of randomization, subjects will continue their tacrolimus IR orally BID for all 
scheduled doses that day.  The next morning, subjects will begin Astagraf XL® orally daily, with or without food, at a 1mg:1mg total daily dose conversion, with further dose adjustments based off of trough concentrations  (goal 5 -12ng/mL (using LC -MS)) according 
to the Sch edule of Evalu ations  (appendix I) .  The intervention will cont inue for 90 days 
post -randomization . 
2. Based on the mean daily dose of 11mg in our feasibility patients, we would expect to utilize at least 30,000mg of tacrolimus throughout the study.  
ii. Concomitant Interventions  
1. Mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium  must be active at the time of 
randomization.  Dose adjustments will be allowed based on side effects or toxicities, at the clinical judgement of the primary investigator.  Corticosteroids will be based on institutional protocol and will be continued in all patients at a minimum dose of 5mg daily of prednisone or equal potent exposure if a different corticosteroid is utilized.  Antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis will be administered based on institutional protocol.

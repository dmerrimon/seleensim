Study Design:  This open -label , dose-response study  will evaluate  the safety and eff icacy 
of CM4620- IE in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS  
or hypoxemia. The study will consist of two phase s. The first phase will 
consist of 2 cohorts that will be enrolled concurrently. Cohort 1 wi ll 
consist of 4 female patients  who will be random ized 3 :1 to receive 
CM4620- IE plus supportive care versus supportive care alone.  Cohort 2 
will consist of 4 male p atients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive 
CM4620- IE plus supportive care versus supportive care alone . Planned 
doses for patients in both cohorts who are randomized to receive CM4620-
IE are 1.0 mg/kg on Days 1 and 1.4 mg/kg on Days 2-4. The first infusion 
of CM4620- IE must  be started preferably within 6  (up to 8) hours of the 
patient or LAR  providing informed consent and should be administered IV 
over 4 hours. Subsequent infusions will be started every 24 hours (± 1 hour) from the start of the first infusion.  
 
The second phase will consist of 2 cohorts. Cohort 3 will consist of 8 femal e patients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620- IE plus 
supportive care versus supportive care alone. Cohort 4 will consist of 
8 male patients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620 -IE plus 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
7 supportive care  versus supportive care alone. P lanned doses for p atients in 
both cohorts who are randomized to receive CM4620- IE are 2.08 mg/kg of 
CM4620-IE on Days 1 and 2, and 1.6 mg/kg on Days 3 and 4. The first 
infusion of CM4620- IE must be started within 6  (up to 8) hours of the 
patient or LAR  providing informed consent and will be administered 
intravenously IV over 4 hours. Subsequent infusions will be started every 
24 hours (± 1 hour) from the start of the first infusion. 
 The decision to start Cohort 3 will be made after  CalciMedica reviews the 
available efficacy, safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1 and discusses 
with the Principal Investigators. The decision to start Cohort 4 in the second phase of the study will be made after  CalciMedica reviews the 
available efficacy, safety and tolerab ility data  from Cohort 2 and discusses 
with the Principal  Investigators.  
 For all 4 cohorts, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will 
perform all  assessments daily through Day 10, or until discharge 
if occur ring earlier. After Day 10, and starting on Day 12, s erious adverse 
events (SAEs) will be captured every 48 hours until Day 30 (± 2 days), or 
until discharge if occur ring earlier. Patients discharged prior to Day 30 will 
be contacted on Day 30 (± 2 days) to ca pture SAEs  and any re -admissions 
to the hospital. Patients will also be contacted on Day 90 (± 7 days) to assess mortality . 
 It is recommended that all  patients in the study should receive supportive 
care consistent with the 2013 International Association of Pancreatology 
(IAP)/American Pancreatic Association (APA) evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis, and local standard of care (SOC) 
for the management of other medical conditions. Fluid resuscitation should be provided to all patients as recommended in the guidelines; lactated Ringer’s solution may be the preferred replacement fluid  for patients with 
acute pancreatitis. Other than at Screening, and all venous and arterial blood gas testing, the blood samples for laboratories collected  as part of 
the protocol, will be tested at a central lab, and will not be available to assist the PI or treating physician in managing the patient. The PI or treating physician will order all laboratory testing necessary for the management of the patient and analysis of these samples will be performed 
at the local laboratory.  
 
All patients randomized in the study will undergo a CECT of the pancreas 
at Screening and on Day 5. The Day 5 CECT will be performed on Days 6 
or 7 if unable to be performed on Day 5. The Screening CECT may have 
been performed more than 18 hours prior to consent and not repeated after 
consent for patient -specific safety considerations.  The PI  or treating 
physician may elect to change the timing of the CECT to later than Day 7 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
8 due to patient -specific  safety considerations , but must inform the Medical 
Monitor of the decision to do so. The PI  or treating physician may elect 
not to perform the CECT because of futility considerations, e.g., the 
patient is unlikely to survive in the next 48 hours, but must discuss the 
decision with the Medical Monitor.  
Safety 
Assessments:  Safety assessments will include the following:  
• Physical examinations  
• Vital signs measurements  
• Clinical laboratory measurements  
• Concomitant medications  
• Incidence, intensity and relationship of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAE s) and SAE s. 
Efficacy 
Assessments:  Efficacy assessments will include the following:  
• SIRS score  
• APACHE II  score  
• CECT of the pancreas  
• Organ Failure  score  
• Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score  
• Biomarker measurements including, but not limited to, C- Reactive 
Protein (CRP), D -Dimer, Procalcitonin, urine NGAL , Il-6, and Il-8 
• Pain Numeric Rating  Scale (PNRS ) score  
• Critical -Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) score  
Pharmacokine tic 
Assessments:  Samples for pharmacokinetic assessment will be obtained prior to infusion 
of CM4620- IE and after completion of CM4620- IE administration  on 
selected days . 
Statistical 
Considerations  A full Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) detailing the primary and secondary 
efficacy analyses and the safety analyses, will be developed.  This study is 
not powered for analysis of study data with inferential statistics.  All data  
will be summarized using descripti ve statistics only. Continuous data will 
be summarized with number of patients (n), mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard of deviation, coefficient of variation and or geometric mean. Categorical data will be summarized with number and proportion of 
patients.

15 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Acute Pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis (AP)  is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas with varying involvement  
of local tissues and/or more remote organ systems. Due to the dynamic nature of the disease, it 
leads to wide-ranging outcomes that evolve rapidly in any given patient with little predictability. There is no prescribed order of events that the disease course follows, beyond the basic concept 
of an early (usually <1- 2 weeks) and a late (>1 -2 weeks) phase, with the former character ised by 
varying degrees of pancreatic, and potentially systemic, inflammation, and the latter by a 
compensatory immunosuppressive phase that can make patients susceptible to infection.  
Due to the evolving nature of AP , the severity may change during the course of the disease.  The 
Atlanta classification of 2012 defines three degrees of severit y: mild acute pancreatitis , moderately  
severe AP, and  severe acute pancreatitis ( Banks 2013). Terminology that is important in this 
classification includes transient organ failure, persistent organ failure, and local or systemic 
complications. Transient organ failure is organ failure that is present for < 48 hours. Persistent 
organ failure is defined as organ failure that persists for ≥ 48 hours. Local complications include peripancreatic fluid collections and acute necrotic collections, while systemic complications can 
be related to  exacerbations of underlying co- morbidities. A new international classification, 
referred to as the ‘determinant- based classification of severity’, has been proposed as an 
alternative to the Atlanta classification  (Dellinger 2012) . This classification is based on the actual 
local and systemic determinants of sev erity, rather than a description of events that are correlated 
with severity. The derivation of a classification based on the above principles results in four 
categories of severity: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The determinant -based classificatio n 
approach to severity has elicited a great deal of interest; nevertheless, the Atlanta classification remains the standard against which severity of AP is assessed.  
AP can be subdivided into two histopathological subtypes: interstitial oedematous pancreatitis 
and necrotising pancreatitis. In the majority of cases, AP comprises clinically of a mild transitory 
form of oedematous- interstitial inflammation, which is self -limiting and resolves spontaneously. 
However, 15–20% of patients with AP will develop the more severe form of the disease 
(Whitcomb 2006). Necrotising pancreatitis most commonly manifests as necrosis involving both 
the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues and, less commonly, as necrosis of only the peripancreatic 
tissue, and rarely of the pancreatic parenchyma alone.  Patients with peripancreatic necrosis alone 
have increased morbidity and intervention rates compared to patients with interstitial oedematous 
pancreatitis ( Singh 2011 ). Repeated attacks of AP can result in chronic pancreatitis, which  
increases the risk of developing pancreatic cancer by up to 100-fold ( Petersen 2006).  
Gallstones and alcohol misuse are long- established risk factors for AP . The next most common 
cause is thought to be endoscopic procedures, e.g. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Other causes include surgery or trauma, metabolic problems, infections, hereditary 
factors and drugs. A small residual group has no obvious cause and is labelled ‘‘idiopathic. ’’ 
However, many of these may be due to unidentified microlithiasis (cholesterol crystals, biliary 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
16 sludge, or small stones). Smoking is an independent risk factor, and its effects could be 
synergi stic with those of alcohol ( Lindkvist 2008; Tolstrup 2009).  
There are currently  two primary aims in the initial treatment of patients with AP. The first aim is 
to provide supportive therapy, and to treat specific complications that may occur. The second 
aim is to limit the severity of pancreatic inflammation, necrosis , and SIRS ( Werner 2005).  
There is currently no approved pharmaceutical treatment for AP, regardless of the severity of the 
disease ( Lankisch 2015). Fluid resuscitation is at the cornerstone of early treatment of AP 
(Lankisch 2015). Analgesics, usually opioids, are administered initially to manage the abdominal 
pain. Enteral feeding can also be used and is preferred over exclusive parenteral nutrition. Thus, patients are generally managed with supportive care, including fluid replacement, painkillers, 
oxygen, feeding via a tube or into a vein, and antibiotics. Severely ill patients with organ failure 
are managed aggressively using a variety of different treatment strategies.  
1.2 Pathophysiology of Acute Pancreatitis  
The exocrine pancreas is a highly specialised secretory organ capable of synthesising, storing and releasing large quantities of digestive enzyme precursors into the small intestine, essential 
for the breakdown of food. Homeostasis of the functional cellular unit, the acinar cell, is therefore paramount for the smooth running of physiological processes; disruption can lead to 
severe damage o f the pancreas, resulting in premature activation of zymogens, vacuolization and 
necrotic cell death, features typical of AP.  
The pancreatic acinar cells are responsible for synthesising digestive proenzymes such as 
trypsinogen, which, when secreted with pancreatic fluids, become activated in the gut to help 
digest food. This secretory process is regulated through cytosolic calcium levels in the pancreatic 
acinar cells. At physiological concentrations, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the hormone 
cholecystokinin (CCK) evoke repetitive short- lasting increases in cytosolic Ca
2+ in pancreatic 
acinar cells, provided by Ca2+ release from internal stores  such as the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)  (Petersen 2011). R epetitive release of Ca2+ from internal stores triggers activation of store 
operated calcium entry ( SOCE ) through Calciu m Release- Activated Calcium (CRAC) channels 
to replenish the stores from interstitial fluid and activates mitochondria to produce adenos ine 
triphosphate (ATP) ( Petersen 2011; Gerasimenko 2013). Both C a2+ and ATP are required for the 
secretion of the digestive proenzymes and the accompanying fluid needed to wash the secreted 
proteases out of the duct system and into the gut ( Petersen 2011).  
The triggers of AP, such as gallstones and alcohol, lead to  massive and sustained release of ER 
Ca2+ stores, resulting in maintenance of high cytosolic Ca2+ levels and a Ca2+ depleted state of 
the stores ( Muallem 1988).  The sustained  cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is due to excessive Ca2+ entry 
into the cells from the interstitial fluid following depletion of ER Ca2+ stores. Mechanistically, 
when the ER stores are depleted of Ca2+ the acinar cell attempts to refill the stores with Ca2+ 
entering through a plasma membrane CRAC channel, with Orai1 being the key Ca2+- conducting 
component of the channel complex ( Lur 2009). The opening of the Orai1 channel is activated by 
STIM1 in response to ER Ca2+ store depletion ( Gerasimenko 2013).  
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
17 The massive release of ER Ca2+ followed by the sustained elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ causes the 
digestive enzymes to be activated inappropriately within the acinar cells, resulting in autodigestion  
(i.e., digestion of the pancreas and surrounding tissue), necrosis ( Phillip 2014), and the  
characteristic features of AP.  Elevated cytosolic Ca2+ also results in lower product ion of ATP 
by mitochondria, which limits the cell’s ability to handle stress and further promotes necrosis 
(Criddle 2016).  Figure 1 shows the sequence of events leading to AP following activation of 
CRAC channels.

18 1.3 Overview of CM4620 
CM4620 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CRAC channels. CRAC channels are composed of 
the pore-forming plasma membrane protein Orai1 and the calcium -sensing ER gating-protein 
STIM1. Low levels of calcium within the ER cause the STIM1 protein to oligomerize and move to locations closely apposed to Orai1. When STIM1 binds to Orai1, the Orai1 Ca
2+ pore opens, 
permitting entry of extracellular calc ium into the cell through the CRAC channel. This process is 
referred to as SOCE and evidence suggests that SOCE through CRAC channels plays a critical role in the degradation and necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells in patients with AP.  
The potential for CM4620 to inhibit CRAC channels was investigated by measuring the electrophysiological current (I
CRAC) associated with calcium entry through CRAC channels in 
HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human Orai1 /STIM1 . Cellular recordings were 
performed using the whole- cell patch clamp method. Measurements of I CRAC were made after the 
addition of extracellular 10 mM calcium chloride and subsequent administration of CM4620 at 
concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 µM. CM4620 was able to inhibit I CRAC in a 
concentration -dependent manner, producing a mean 50% inhibition (IC 50) value of 119 nM. 
Rapid and complete inhibition was achieved at 1 µM of CM4620. Evaluations were performed to further elucidate the site of action of CM4620. A mutation in Orai1 (Orai1-V102C) is known to 
produce constitutively active CRAC channels without the need for STIM1. In this evaluation, successive concentrations of CM4620 produced nearly complete inhibition of the STIM1-
independent I
CRAC, indicating that Orai1 is a major site of  action of the compound.  
1.4 Pre-Clinical Development of CM4620  
1.4.1 Pre-Clinical Safety and Toxicology Studies  
Safety pharmacology studies conducted in rats indicated no CM4620- induced adverse effects on 
central nervous or respiratory systems. Dose- limiting advers e clinical and cardiovascular effects 
were noted in a single telemetered cynomolgus monkey dosed at 25 mg/kg IV with CM4620- IE. 
Cardiovascular data at lower doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) showed transient, non-dose- related, 
slight- to-moderate increases in systo lic/diastolic arterial blood pressures and negative 
chronotropic effects (mild and non- adverse) at all doses and in placebo treated animals.  
Repeat -dose toxicity studies conducted in both rats and monkeys showed no observable adverse 
effect levels (NOAELs) of 25 mg/kg/day and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively. In vitro genetic toxicity 
studies were negative in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay and weakly positive/equivocal  
in a micronucleus assay conducted in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. A subsequen t in 
vivo micronucleus study conducted in rats involving two different endpoints (bone marrow micronucleus and liver Comet assays) showed no evidence of DNA reactivity. Based on the 
results of the complete battery of genotoxicity testing, the weight of evi dence indicates that 
CM4620 is neither mutagenic nor clastogenic. Hemolysis testing concluded that CM4620 
placebo was compatible with human plasma and non-hemolytic in human blood. Specific local 
tolerance studies to examine irritation/inflammation at the injection site were not performed, but 
no evidence of compound- related or vehicle- related local irritation was observed in the repeat -
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
19 dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey. Finally, in vitro 3T3 results indicated that CM4620 is 
potentially phototoxic, so appropriate precautions are being taken in clinical trials.  
1.4.2 Preclinical Efficacy Studies  
Non-clinical studies conducted in murine and human pancreatic acinar cells to date have 
demonstrated that by acting on CRAC channels in pancreatic  acinar cells, CM462 0 can protect 
these cells from pancreatitis -induced cell death and can reduce biochemical, immunological and 
histopathologic consequences when administered early in the course of the disease. CM4620 
caused marked reductions in serum amylase activity, pancr eatic trypsin activity, myeloperoxidas e 
(MPO) activity (a marker of neutrophil infiltration) in the pancreas and lung, and led to a significant reduction in pancreatic histopathology scores. Importantly,  the non-clinical findings 
provide proof of concept that CM4620 has the potential to be effective in the treatment of AP regardless of the cause and support the administration of CM4620 as an IV infusion to humans. Additional non-clinical evidence supports the position that the effects of CM4620 on the 
pancreas are complimented by its ability to reduce inflammatory responses that can manifest 
clinically as SIRS.  
The protection offered by CM4620 in vitro has been confirmed in three diverse in vivo models representative of gallstone-, alcohol-, or hyper- stimulation –induced acute pancreatitis (TLCS -
induced, fatty acid ethyl ester [FAEE]- induced and caerulein -induced pancreatitis models, 
respectively). Trypsin activity within pancreatic tissue, myeloperoxidase activity within pancreatic and lung tissue, and histopathological indices of pancreatic damage, such as edema, 
inflammatory cell infiltration, vacuolization, and necrosis, were all markedly reduced following 
single 5-20 mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) doses of CM4620 in the mouse (caerulein- induced acute 
pancreatitis), two  5 or 20 mg/kg IP doses of CM4620 in the mouse (TLCS- induced and FAEE -
induced pancreatitis models) or one 4 -hour IV infusion of CM4620 Nano-emulsion (the intended 
clinical dosage form, route of administration and infusion duration) at doses of 5-20 mg/kg in the rat (caerulein -induced pancreatitis model). The timing of CM4620 administration relative to 
induction of pancreatitis was investigated in the TLCS-induced and FAEE-induced pancreatitis models and the results suggest that CM4620 may be more effective in minimizing pancreatic 
injury and subsequent downstream events if it is administered early in the course of disease, 
although later administration retains effectiveness in halting disease progression  (Wen 2015). 
The potential for CM4620 to reduce SIRS through an inhibitory effect on immune cells has been 
investigated in vitro, ex vivo and as part of in vivo pancr eatitis models.  In vitro, CM4620 
inhibited human neutrophil function and inhibited release of key inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, 
IFNγ and IL -17) in human lymphocytes (IC
50 4-138 nM).  Results from ex vivo pharmacodynamic  
analyses in blood demonstrated that CM4620 was able to significantly reduce stimulated IL -2 
secretion from T  cells, and presumably other lymphocytes, in a dose-dependent manner in 
Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys after 14 days of oral dosing. Further, the effects  
of CM4620 on myeloperoxidase activity in the lung of mice in TLCS-induced and FAEE-
induced pancreatitis models and rats in the caerulein -induced pancreatitis model were assessed. 
Myeloperoxidase activity is a measure of neutrophil infiltration and when seen in the lung in 
these models it is indicative of a systemic inflammatory process analogous to SIRS in humans.

20 Two IP doses of CM4620 at 20 mg/kg in mice or one 4- hour infusion of CM4620 Nano- emulsion 
at 5 mg/kg in rats were able to substantially reduce lung myeloperoxidase activity (80% reduction 
in the mouse TLCS model, 73% reduction in the rat caerulein model). Lastly, in the IV infusion 
study in rats, CM4620 significantly reduced IL-6 and TNFα mRNA levels in both pancreas and lung, as well as that of m yeloperoxidase.

1.5 Clinical Development of CM4620 -IE 
CalciMedica has conducted two Phase 1 studies of CM4620 -IE in healthy subjects: a single 
ascending dose (SAD) study (CM4620-101) and a multiple ascending dose ( MAD) study 
(CM4620- 102). In CM4620-101 ( Table 1 ), 32 healthy subjects were enrolled in five groups and 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of active versus placebo. The dose levels for 
each group are noted in Table 1 . The dose volume of the emulsion was fixed at 1.3 mL/kg for all 
subjects in the SAD study groups, and CM4620- IE or placebo was administered via a 4-hour IV 
infusion.

Of the 32 enrolled subjects, there were no serious adverse events (SAE) or adverse events (AE) 
classified as moderate or severe in intensity. There were three  clinical AEs that were all 
classified as mild in intensity. Two of the AEs were considered possib ly related and one was  
considered unlikely or unrelated to study treatment. In each case, no action was taken with respect to study treatment because of the AEs. No laboratory abnormalities were observed that were considered clinically significant. There were vehicle- related increases in serum triglyceride 
and cholesterol levels noted in some subjects that returned to baseline within 24 hours. There was no evidence of any sustained treatment related increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In addit ion, cardiac function, monitored by continuous electrocardiographic recording 
and serial biomarker testing, showed no evidence of any treatment related effect on heart rate, QTcF, cardiac troponin- T or B -type natriuretic pe ptide levels.  
In the SAD study ( CM4620-101), interim non-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis 
indicates that CM4620 likely distributes to three  compartments.  Plasma concentrations of 
comp ound rise steadily during the 4-hour infusion, with T
max achieved at the end of infusion 
(4 hours).  After the end of infusion, there is a rapid and prominent distribution phase followed by 
a prolonged period of residual drug levels. The terminal elimination phase has not yet been fully 
characterized as it appears to be much longer than was anticipated based on pre- clinical PK data 
in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. Plasma concentrations during the terminal phase are 
approximately 5% of C max values and, as indicated above, to date there have been no clinically 
significant AEs reported during this phase. Plasma exposures, defined by AUC 0-24h, appear to be 
dose-proportional and reached a maximum of 6710 ng*h/mL in Group 5, which is 4.3-fold below the mean AUC
24h in monkey at the NOAEL (29,000 ng*hr/ mL).  
In the MAD study ( Table 2 ) of CM4620- IE (CM4620-102), subjects in the first group were 
randomiz ed to receive a single dose of active treatmen t, 0.50 mg/kg, versus placebo for seven 
consecutive days. Eight healthy subjects were enrolled in the first group, with five receiving active treatment and three receiving placebo. One of the subjects received placebo at the 
maximum dose volume of emulsion, 1.3 mL/kg, for 7 days , whereas all others were dosed on a 
weight-based adjustment of dose volume . There were no SAEs and no AEs classified as 
moderate or severe in intensity. There were 15 clinical AEs that were all classified as mild. In 
each case, no action was taken with respect to study treatment because of the AEs. No laboratory 
abnormalities were observed that were con sidered clinically significant.

Subjects in the second group of CM4620-102 were randomized to receive a single dose of active 
treatment, 1.0 mg/kg, versus placebo for seven consecutive days. Eight healthy subjects were 
enrolled in the second group, with six receiving active treatment and two receiving placebo for 
seven consecutive days. There were no SAEs and no AEs classified as moderate or severe in intensity. There were three AEs that were all classified as mild in intensity. In each case, no 
action was taken with respect to study treatment because of the AEs. No laboratory abnormalities 
were observed that were considered clinically significant.  
There were vehicle- related increases in serum triglyceride noted in some subjects in both groups 
with levels returning to baseline within 24 hours. Cholesterol levels accumulated in som e 
subjects in both groups with daily dosing but the increases were not considered clinically 
significant and were related to the vehicle. Thus, the largest rise in cholesterol levels was in the subject who received placebo at the maximum dose volume of emulsion. The rise in 
cholesterol is believed to be due to the release of tissue cholesterol induced by the lecithin in 
the emulsion ( Byers 1962), was noted in the pre- clinical studies in monkeys, and was reversible 
with cessation of dosing. There was no evidence of any sustained treatment related increase in 
systo lic or diastolic blood pressure. In addition, cardiac function, monitored by continuous 
electrocardiographic recording and serial biomarker testing, showed no evidence of any sustained treatment related effect on heart rate, QTcF or B -type natriuretic pept ide levels. 
Non-compartmental PK analysis of Group 1 in CM4620-102 (0.5 mg/kg) indicates that CM4620 
accumulated in plasma, with a 2.6- fold increase in systemic exposure (AUC
24h) on Day 7 
compared to Day 1 of dosing, consistent with modeling simulations. C max accumulated 1.6-fold 
(geometric mean of 363 ng/mL on Day 7). The geometric mean of the AUC 24h on Day 7 was 
3190 ng*hr/mL, which is 9.1- fold below the NOAEL AUC 24h in monkey (29,000 ng*hr/mL). PK 
analysis of Group 2 in CM4620-102 (1.0 mg/kg) indicates that CM4620 accumulated in plasma, with a 2.6- fold increase in AUC
24h on Day 7 compared to Day 1 of dosing, consistent with 
modeling simulations. C max accumulated 1.4-fold (geometric mean 637 ng/mL on Day 7). The 
geometric mean of the AUC 24h on Day 7 was 6830 ng*hr/mL, which is 4.2-fold below the 
NOAEL AUC 24h in monkey (29,000 ng*hr/mL). After the end of 7 days of infusion, there 
remained a prolonged period of residual drug levels in both MAD groups that remained significant ly lower than the C
max on Day 7. 
Subjects in Groups 4 and 5 of the SAD study and Groups 1 and 2 of the MAD  study who received  
CM4620 were  followed for 1 year in a long- term extension study to assess for adverse events 
and serious adverse events. In additio n, PK levels were  drawn in all 4 groups on Day 270 to 
further characterize the terminal phase and the prolonged period of residual drug level. There 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
23 were no serious adverse events and no adverse events rated moderate or severe in intensity in 
subjects followed for 365 days. 
A population PK model was built using the data from the SAD and MAD studies. The model 
suggested three compartments for distribution as well as gender and body weight-dependent 
differences in exposures. The model showed that females have a higher volume of distribution 
compared to males, resulting in lower plasma AUC 24h values versus males, and that patients with 
higher body weights will have a lower AUC. The model was then used to identity the dosing 
regimens for the first and second phases of the study. 
1.6 Rationale for the Study and Selected Doses  
An open- label study in patients with acute pancreatitis will be performed to further characterize 
the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of a higher exposure of CM4620-IE than obtained on Day 7 in the 5
th group of the SAD and the 2nd group of the MAD. A 3rd group of healthy subjects 
in the MAD was n ot dosed, despite a benign safety profile, because of the prolonged period of 
residual drug levels noted in the previous groups of healthy subjects. CalciMedica believes, however, that a risk benefit analysis would support continued escalation of dosing in patients with acute pancreatitis given the potential for CM4620 to be efficacious in treating acute 
pancreatitis, especially with increasing exposures. The study will be open -label to provide 
investigators and CalciMedica the ability to immediately assess  any AEs or SAEs and their 
relationship to CM4620-IE. There will be three dose groups in the open-label study: patients who receive no drug, patients who receive dosing of drug that would result in a mean plasma AUC
24h 
after dosing on Day 4 similar to the mean AUC 24h on Day 7 in the 5th group of the SAD study 
and the 2nd group of the MAD study, and patients who receive dosing of drug that would result in 
a mean plasma AUC 24h on Day 4 that is 30% higher than that in Phase 1 of the open- label study. 
This desi gn will allow a dose -response analysis of both safety and efficacy assessments. An 
equal number of females and males will be enrolled in all three dose groups to allow further characterization of the gender differences in drug exposure as well as safety and efficacy .

25 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
This open-label, dose- response study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM4620- IE in 
patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS  or Hypoxemia. The study will consist of 
two phases. The first phase will consist of 2 cohorts that will be enrolled concurrently. Cohort 1 
will consist of 4 female patients  who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620- IE plus 
supportive care versus supportive care alone. Cohort 2 will consist of 4 male patients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620- IE plus supportive care versus supportive care alone. 
Planned doses for patients in both cohorts who are randomized to receive CM4620-IE are 1.0 
mg/kg on Day 1 and 1.4 mg/kg on Days 2-4. The first infusion of CM4620- IE must be started 
within 6  (up to 8) hours of the patient or LAR providing informed consent and should be 
administered IV over 4 hours. Subsequent infusions will be started every 24 hours (± 1 hour) from the start of the first infusion.  
The second phase will consist of 2 cohorts . Cohort 3 will consist of 8 female patients who will be 
randomized 3:1 to receive CM4 620-IE plus supportive care versus supportive care alone. Cohort 
4 will consist of 8 male patients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620- IE plus 
supportive care versus supportive care alone. Planned doses for patients in both cohorts who are 
randomized to receive CM4620-IE are 2.08 mg/kg of CM4620-IE on Days 1 and 2, and 1.6 mg/kg on Days 3 and 4. The first infusion of CM4620- IE must be started within 6  (up to 8) hours 
of the patient or LAR providing informed consent and will be administered intravenously IV over 4 hours. Subsequent infusions will be started every 24 hours (± 1 hour) from the start of the first infusion.  
The decision to start Cohort 3  will be made after  CalciMedica reviews the available efficacy, 
safety and tolerability data from C ohort 1 and discusses with the Principal Investigators. The 
decision to start Cohort 4 in the second phase of the study will be made after  CalciMedica 
reviews the available efficacy, safety and tolerability data  from Cohort 2 and discusses with the 
Principal Investigators.  
For all 4 cohorts, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform all assessments daily through Day 10, or until discharge if occurring earlier. After Day 10, and starting on Day 12, serious adverse events (SAEs) will be captured every 48 hours until Day 30 (±  2 days), or 
until discharge if occurring earlier. Patients discharged prior to Day 30 will be contacted on Day 30 (± 2 days) to capture SAEs and any re-admissions to the hospital. Patients will also be contacted on Day 90 (± 7 days) to assess mortality. 
CalciMedica may submit amendments to the protocol to modify the planned doses, the dosing 
schedule,  the infusion time, the number of sites in the study, the total number of patients 
randomized in the study, the number of patients randomized in each cohort, the number of 
cohorts in each phase of the study, and/or the number of phases in the study for safety and/or 
efficacy considerations.

29 5 TREATMENT OF PATIENT S 
5.1 Overview  
All patients in the study should receive supportive care consistent with the 2013 IAP/APA  
evidence- based guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis, and local SOC for the 
manageme nt of other medical conditions. Other than at Screening, and all venous and arterial 
blood gas testing, the blood samples for laboratories collected  as part of the protocol, will be 
tested at a central lab, and will not be available to assist the PI or treating physician in managing 
the patien t. The PI or treating physician will order all laboratory testing necessary for the 
management of the patient and analysis of these samples will be performed at the local 
laboratory . 
Fluid resuscitation should be provided to all patients as recommended in the guidelines; lactated Ringer’s solution may be the preferred replacement fluid for patients with acute pancreatitis.  
Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the pancreas will be performed once on 
Day 5  through Day 7 in  all patients. The CECTs pe rformed as part of the protocol will read by a 
blinded central reader; scans will also be read locally and used by the PI or treating physician for 
patient management.  
A summary of recommendations from the 2013 IAP/APA  evidence based guidelines for the 
management of acute pancreatitis is listed in Appendix 7. 
5.2 Discharge Criteria  
The patient randomized to receive CM4620-IE should remain in the hospital until all 4 doses of 
CM4620- IE have been administered , and a CECT of the pancreas has been performed. The 
suggested criteria for discharging patients from the hospital are : 
• Abdominal pain has resolved 
• Normal oral diet is tolerated  
• There is no clinical or laboratory evidence of an infection 
If the patient is ready to be discharged before all 4 doses of CM4620- IE have been administered  
or the CECT of the pancreas has been performed , the PI or treating physician should contact the 
Medical Monitor  prior to discharging the patient.

31 6 PROCEDURES 
6.1 Randomization Procedures  
Patients will be  randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620- IE in addition to supportive care consistent 
with the  2013 IAP/APA  evidence- based guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis 
versus supportive care alone.  Randomization will be stratified by sex. CalciMedica or its 
designee will prepare the randomization schedule prior to the start of the study. 
6.2 Discontinuation and Withdrawal  
Discontinuation refers to the patient or PI discontinuing the administration of CM4620-IE before 
all 4 doses are administered  despite the patient remaining in the hospital . Patients have the right 
to disc ontinue the administration  of CM4620- IE at any time for any reason, without prejudice to 
their medical care. The PI may discontinue the administration of  CM4620- IE because of an 
adverse event or change in medical status that raises a safety concern about the patient receiving  
additional doses of CM4620- IE. The PI must  discontinue the administration of CM4620- IE if 
the patient is diagnosed with a new or recurrent malignancy, or if the patient was concomitantly 
administered a prohibited medication . If possible, the PI should contact the Medical Monitor to 
review the reasons for a patient’ s discontinuation from study drug. The PI should also record the 
reason for the discontinuation in the eCRF and appropriate source documents at the site. Even if 
the patient discontinues receiving CM4620- IE, diligence should occur to ensure that all study 
visits and assessments are completed. 
Withdrawal refers only to the complete wi thdrawal of the patient from  the study because of the 
withdrawal of consent. The PI  should inform the Medical Monitor of the withdrawal of consent 
and record the withdrawal of consent in the eCRF and appropriate source documents at the site.

7.1 CM4620- IE Product Description  
CM4620-IE is to be administered as an IV infusion and is supplied as a translucent, white 
to yellowish colored, sterile, non-pyrogenic emulsion containing 1.6 mg/mL of the active 
pharmaceutical ingred ient CM4620. CM4620-IE is supplied as an 80 mL fill in a 100 mL, 
single-use glass vial. The drug product is formulated as an emulsion due to the low solubility 
of CM4620 in aqueous solution. CM4620-IE contains egg phospholipids, medium chain 
triglycerides,  glycerin, edetate disodium salt dehydrate (EDTA), sodium hydroxide (as needed 
to adjust pH), and sterile water for injection  (Table 3 )

7.2 CM4620- IE Storage 
CM4620- IE must  be maintained in a secure location with refrigerated temperature conditions 
of 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F). Precaution should be taken to ensure that the CM4620-IE does not 
freeze. Temperature logs should be maintained and available at  each monitoring visit. When a 
temperature is noted outside the temporary excursion range of 2 °C to 8°C fo r 24 hours or more, 
or if the temperature exceeds 20°C (68°F), or is below 0°C (32°F), CalciMedica or its designee 
must be notified. The stability of CM4620-IE has been demonstrated to 12 months and is being 
evaluated for longer periods in ongoing studies. 
7.3 CM4620- IE Preparation  
The study pharmacist and/or designee will be responsible for the preparation and dispensation of CM4620- IE. Prior to administration, CM4620- IE must be transferred to a sterile container a 
using sterile technique. Specific details on how to calculate and prepare CM4620 -IE, as well as 
the specific components that will be used to administer CM4620- IE, will be provided in a 
Pharmacy Manual. The Pharmacy Manual will also contain tables detailing the Volume to Be 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
33 Infused (VTBI) of CM4620- IE that is based upon the body weight of the patient, the selected 
dose level, and the concentration of CM4620-IE (1.6 mg/mL). 
7.4 CM4620- IE Administration  
CM4620- IE will be administered intravenously over 4 hours at a constant rate of infusion. 
CM4620- IE shall be administered every 24 hours (± 1 hours) for a total of 4 doses. The dose of 
CM4620- IE that will be administered will be calculated using the patient weight obtained at 
Screening. A line into a peripheral or central vein may be used for the infusion. The  peripheral 
IV should be 20 gauge in size or larger. The peripheral IV  or central line port should be 
dedicated , i.e., only for the administration of CM4620- IE and 0.9% normal saline. CM4620- IE is 
compatible with 0.9% normal saline. The IV tubing used to administer CM4620- IE must contain 
a 1.2 micron filter. The Pharmacy Manual will contain a recommended procedure to prime the 
IV tubing and flush the tubing, but this may be adapted to local nursing standards. 0.9% normal 
saline may be used to flush the line to ensure that the VTBI is completely administered. If the 
administration of CM4620- IE is stopped because of a technical reason, such as failure of the IV 
site, or IV pump mal function, the administration of CM4620- IE should be resumed when the 
technical r eason is resolved , and continued at the same rate until the infusion is co mpleted. The 
total amount of time for the start of infusion to end of infusion of CM4620-IE should be 
recorded.  
CalciMedica may modify at any time the administered doses of CM4620 -IE, the days of 
infusion, the timing of the infusion and the rate of infusion based on its review of the safety and tolerability data. CalciMedica will discuss with the PIs  before implement ation . If the 
administration of CM4620- IE is stopped  because of a serious adverse event that is considered  to 
be probably or definitely related to CM4620- IE, the Medical Monitor must be immediately 
contacted. 
7.5 Packaging and Labeling 
Preparation, packaging and labeling of CM4620- IE will be in accordance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice of Medicinal Products (GMP) guidelines. Medication labels will comply with legal requirements  for labeling of investigational products in the U nited States. 
7.6 Accountability, Handling and Disposal  
The PI or designee will ensure that deliveries of CM4620- IE from CalciMedica or its designee 
are received by a responsible person , and such deliveries are recorded; that CM4620- IE is 
handled and stored safely and properly; that CM4620- IE is only dispensed to study patients in 
accordance with th e protocol; and that unused CM4620- IE is returned to CalciMedica  or its 
designee or disposed of using standard procedures approved of in advance by CalciMedica or its designee. Appropriately trained s tudy staff will administer all doses of CM4620- IE. The 
pharmacy will maintain a record of CM4620- IE accountability.

8.11.1  Medical History  
To the extent possible given the patient’s medical condition, a complete medical hist ory will be 
collected at Screening. Demographic data will  be collected as the initial part of the medical 
history. Patients must be specifically questioned for whether they have had previous episodes of 
acute pancreatitis and whether they have been given a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. A family 
history of either acute or chronic pancreatitis will be obtained. Smoking and alcohol history will  
be noted as part of the social history. Medications that were being taken prior to enrollment in 
the study will be collected as part o f the medical history  as will, if available,  baseline 
laboratories . 
8.11.2  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be recorded from Day 1 through Day 10, or until discharge, 
whichever comes first . The name, dose and frequency of all medications that the patient s are 
taking will  be recorded , including vasopressor(s) and highest dose of vasopressors. Pain 
medications and anti-pyretic medications, the time of administration of the indiv idual doses, and 
the route of administration will also be recorded. G eneric names should be used when possible. 
8.11.3  Physical Examination  
A limited physical examination will  be performed  and recorded at Screening and Day 10, or at 
discharge if occur ring earlier . The physical examination will  evaluate the following systems: 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and skin. The examination must  
specifically assess if the patient has abdominal guarding or rebound tenderness. 
8.11.4  Glasgow Coma Scale Score  
A Glasgow coma scale score will be determined  at Day 1 and on Days 2 – 10. If possible, the 
Glasgow coma scale score should be d etermined prior to administration of sedatives.  Patients 
should also be free from the effects of paralysis or neuromuscular blocking agents. If the patient

8.11.5  Vital Signs  
The recorded vital signs must include the patient’s current temperature, heart rate (beats per 
minute), systolic and diastolic blood pressure s, respiratory rate (breaths per minute), and the total 
input and output of fluids . The highest and lowest temperatures, the highest heart rate, and the 
highest respiratory rate since the prior study- required assessment will also be recorded. The total 
input of fluids ( oral and intravenous ) and  the total output of fluids  (urine output and nasogastric 
output) since the prior study- required assessment  will be recorded.  
If the patient has been started on vasopressor therapy since the prior study -required assessm ent, 
the start time should be recorded. If the patient has been placed on renal replacement therapy since the prior study-required assessment, the type of therapy will be recorded. If the  patient  has 
been placed on mechanical ventilation since the prior study- required assessment , the type of 
ventilation will be recorded ( noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation). The current 
settings for fraction of inspired oxygen ( FiO
2), respiratory rate, tidal volume and positive end-
expiratory pressure ( PEEP) at the assessment  will be recorded. If intra-abdominal pressures are 
being monitored, the current pressure and the highest pressure since the prior study-required 
assessment  should be recorded. All solid food intake since the prior study- required assessment 
will be recorded including the time and date of the meal, the percent of the meal completed, if there were  nausea or vomiting with the meal, and if pain medications had to be given one hour 
prior to or after the meal to treat symptoms due to ingesting t he meal .

If an arterial blood gas (ABG)  has already been performed as part of supportive care on Days 1, 
5 and 10 the pH, PaO 2, PaCO 2, SaO 2 and FiO 2 will be recorded. 
8.11.7  Pulse Oximetry  
A pulse oximetry measurement of oxygen saturation, ( SpO 2), will be measured at Screening and  
on Days 1 – 10. The PI or appropriately trained study coordinator will review the pulse oximetry 
waveform to attest to its adequacy. The FiO 2 at the time of the pulse oximetry measurement will 
be recorded. For patients with assisted breathing, the FiO2 is read from th e controlled oxygen 
source e.g. Venturi masks, ventilator and CPAP systems with calibrated oxygen blenders. For 
patients breathing unassisted i.e. room air, the FiO2 is recorded as 0.21. If a patient is on an uncontrolled oxygen source, the table below allows for the conversion of oxygen flow in L/min

43 8.11.9  Laboratory Analyses  
At Screening, an a mylase or  lipase, CBC, differential, and platelets, will be performed at the 
local lab . The results of the CBC will be used to determine the presence of  SIRS . On Days 1 – 5, 
a CBC, differential, and platelet count will be drawn twice , and chemistry p rofile will be drawn 
once, and sent to the central lab. On Days 6  – 10, a CBC , differential,  platelet  count, and 
chemistry p rofile will be collected once  and sent to the central lab. The chemistry p rofile  sent to 
the central lab  will consist of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine , glucose, calcium , total protein , globulin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine 
transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin , lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) , 
total chole sterol  and triglycerides . The results from these laboratory samples will not be available 
to the PI or treating physician for the management of the patient with acute pancreatitis. 
The PI or treating physician will order all laboratory testing necessary fo r the management of the 
patient and analysis will be performed at the local laboratory. Other than at Screening, and all 
venous and arterial blood gas testing, the blood samples for laboratories ordered as part of the 
protocol, will be tested at a central lab, and will not be available to assist the PI or treating 
physician in managing the patient. 
8.11.10 PK analysis  
On Day 1, a PK sample will be obtained 30 minutes after and 8 hours after completing the 
administration of CM4620- IE; if necessary the 8 hour  sample may be obtained at 12 hours 
together with the 12-hour hematology blood draw. On Day 2 a PK sample will be obtained 30 minutes prior to  starting the administration  of CM4620- IE. On Day 4 a PK sample will be 
obtained 30 minutes after and 8 hours after completing the administration of CM4620- IE if 
necessary the 8 hour sample may be obtained at 84 hours together with the 84-hour hematology 
blood draw. A PK sample will be drawn on Day 5, and in those patients who remain in the 
hospital, on Day 10. The date and time of the PK blood sample (both the absolute time and the 
time before or after administration of CM4620- IE) should be recorded. All PK samples will be 
sent to the central lab.  
8.11.11 Biomarker Analysis  
For biomarker testing, serum  and urine samples will be collected on Days 1  – 10 and sent to the 
central lab . The date and time of the blood and urine samples should be recorded. Serum 
biomarkers planed for testing include C-Reactive Protein (CRP), D -Dimer, procalcitonin, Il -6 
and Il-8. Urine NGAL will also be tested.  Results will not be provided to the PI or treating 
physician. 
8.11.12 Numeric Pain Rating Scale  (PN RS) 
In patients who are able to self -report  their pain , the Pain Numeric Rating Scale (Appendix 8) 
will be used to grade the severity of the abdominal pain from Day 1  – 10, or until discharge if 
occurring earlier. The timing of the last dose of an analgesic prior to assessing the patient’s pain 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
44 should also be recorded.  The characteristic of the pain and the similarity to the presenting pain 
will also be recorded.  
8.11.13 Critical -Care Pain Observation Tool  
The Critical -Care  Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) will be employed by the PI or study designee 
to assess the patient’s pain  from Day 1 – 10, or until discharge if occurring earlier . The patient 
must be observed for one minute at rest. The timing of the last dose of an analgesic prior to 
assessing the patient’s pain should be recorded. The sum of the scores for facial expression, body 
movements, compliance with ventilator, or vocalization if extubated, and muscle tension will be 
determined using the CPOT ( Appendix 9). 
8.11.14 Contrast -Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the Pancreas  
All patients will undergo a CECT of the pancreas at Screening, and on Day 5. The Screening 
CECT may have been performed more than 18 hours prior to consent and not repeated after consent for patients -specific safety considerations. The Day 5 CECT will be performed on Days 
6 or 7 if unable to be performed on Day 5. The CECT will be performed prior to discharge if 
discharg e is planned sooner than Day 5. 
The recommended CECT  protocol: 
• A non-ionic contrast bolus of 100- 150cc will be administered  at 3-5cc/second  
• Slice thicknesses will be 5 mm  or less and will be obtained through the panc reas during 
the pancreatic phase (35 seconds after the start of the non-ionic contrast bolus) and 
through the entire abdomen during the portal venous phase (50 to 70 seconds after the start of the non-ionic contrast bolus) to visualize the pancreas and surrounding tissue 
The CECT protocol may be altered to local standard of care. If the patient has acute kidney 
injury or renal failure, the CECT may be done at the discretion of the local radiologist, treating 
physician or PI without the non-ionic contrast bolus or with a lower amount of non- ionic 
contrast. The PI or treating physician may also elect to change the timing of the Day 5 CECT due 
to patient- specific safety considerations to later than Day 7 , but must inform the Medical 
Monitor of the decision. The PI  or treating physician may also elect not to perform the CECT 
because of futility considerations, e.g., the patient is unlikely to survive in the next 48 hours, but 
must discuss the decision with the Medical Monitor. 
Patients with a history of acute pancreatitis who have SIRS or a SpO
2 <96% with a FiO2 of 21% 
(room air) to 27% or SpO 2 <97% with a FiO 2 ≥28% at Screening must have no evidence of 
pancreatic necrosis by CECT performed in the 18 hours prior to consent or after consen t and 
before Day 1. The Screening CECT may have been performed more than 18 hours prior to 
consent and not repeated after consent for patients -specific safety considerations.

45 The Day 5 CECT and the CECT performed at screening  will read by a blinded central reader; 
they will also be read locally and may be used by the PI or treating physician , as needed, for 
patient management.   
If the patient undergoes additional CECTs at the discretion of the PI or treating physician, the 
date of the CECT and the results of the CECT as read by the local radiologist will be recorded. 
Image  results from the additional CECT s will also be captured . 
8.11.15 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)  
The physician, or appropriately trained designee will determine the presence of SIRS at 
Screening . SIRS  is defined as the presence of at least 2 of the 4 criteria:  
• Temperature < 36°C or > 38°C 
• Heart rate > 90 beats/minute 
• Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/minute or arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) 
< 32 mmHg  
• White blood cell count (WBC) >12,000 mm3, or < 4,000 mm3, or > 10% immature

46 9 ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical event in a patient regardless of its 
causal relationship to study treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including any clinically significant medical test abnormality), symptom,  or disease temporally 
associated with the use of CM4620- IE, whether or not it is considered related to CM4620- IE 
administration. Included in this definition is any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency sin ce the administration of CM4620- IE. 
A medical test abnormality (e.g., laboratory test value, vital sign recording, ECG finding, physical examination finding) will be considered clinically significant and consequently recorded 
as an AE only if it meets one of the following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires active intervention  
• Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication 
9.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life function 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in an offspring of a patient receiving CM4620- IE 
• Is an important medical event  
The term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
Important medical events are those that may not need any of the criteria defined above; however, they may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the SAE definition.  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE; however, information will be collected for any pregnancies that occur during CM4620- IE administration or the thirty days thereafter. Certain pregnancy 
outcomes will require submission as an SAE.  
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
47 9.3 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
At every AE/SAE assessment , the patient must be asked a standard, non-directed question, such 
as, “how have you been feeling since your last visit?” to elicit any medically related changes in 
their well -being. In addition, the hospital chart and other documents relevant to patient safety 
must be reviewed when the patient is in the hospital. 
9.4 Record ing Adverse Events 
Recording of AEs must begin after randomization . All conditions present before randomization , 
including untoward medical events during Screening, should be documented as medical history. 
Documentation shall continue until the patient dies, the patient withdraws consent, or the patient’s participation in the study ends. Information to be collected includes: 
• Type of event 
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution  
• Investigator- specified relationship to CM4620- IE and assessment of severity  
• Seriousness 
• Any action taken 
While an AE is ongoing, changes in the severity (e.g., worsening and improving) should be noted in the source documents, but when documenting the AE, only the total duration and the 
greatest severity should be recorded in the case report form. AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration. 
All AEs reported or observed during the study must be followed to resolution. Or, if not fully 
resolved, until the condition has stabiliz ed, the patient dies , withdraws co nsent, or CalciMedica 
ends the trial whichever is first.  
Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. Pre-existing conditions (present before the start of t he AE collection period) are considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT 
be recorded as AEs. However, if the patient experiences a worsening or complication of such a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in condition (e.g., “worsening of…”).  
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory test values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded as an AE(s).  
Elective procedures (surgeries or therapies) performed to manage/treat conditions that existed prior to the patient enrolling in the trial should not be recorded as AEs but should be documented 
in the patient’s source documents. If a planned procedure is performed early (e.g., as an 
emergency) because the pre-existing condition worsens, the worsening condition should be captured as an AE.

Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
48 9.5 Assessment of Relationship to CM4620- IE 
The Investigator must use the following classification and criteria to characterize the relationship 
or association of CM4620- IE in causing or contributing to the AE: 
• Unrelated : This relationship sugges ts that there is no association between CM4620- IE 
and the reported event 
• Unlikely : This relationship suggests that there is an unlikely association between 
CM4620- IE and the reported event 
• Possible : This relationship suggests that treatment with CM4620- IE caused or 
contributed to the AE. That is, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
time of CM4620- IE administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the 
CM4620- IE, but could have been produced by other factors 
• Probable : This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with CM4620- IE administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological 
action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of 
drugs, or judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the 
event with CM4620- IE administration seems likely  
• Definite : This relationship suggests a definite causal relationship exists between 
CM4620- IE administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event 
9.6 Assessment of Severity 
The Investigator must use the following criteria to rate the intensity of the AE: 
• Mild : Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional 
activities  
• Moderate : Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
• Severe: Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities

49 9.7 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting to CalciMedica or designee within 24 hours from 
the time when site personnel learn about the event all SAEs that are observed or reported by the 
patient during the study (from randomization until the patient dies, the patient withdraws 
consent, or the patient’s participation in the study ends) regardless of the relationship to 
CM4620- IE or clinical significance. Any a dditional information that becomes available later 
should be submitted within 1 working day of receipt. All SAEs reported or observed during the study must be followed to resolution or until the Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the patient to be stable. CalciMedica  or its designee may contact the Investigator to obtain 
additional information on any SAE that has not resolved at the time the patient completes the study. SAEs ongoing at database lock will be noted as such.  
CalciMedica  or its designee will notify the regulatory authority of any fatal or life threatening 
unexpected related events associated with the use of CM4620- IE as soon as possible but no later 
than seven calendar days after the initial receipt of the information. Initial no tification will be 
followed by a written report within fifteen calendar days. For SAEs that do not meet the fatal or 
life threatening unexpected related criteria, CalciMedica or its designee will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agencies in writing within  fifteen calendar days. 
CalciMedica  or its designee will provide copies of any reports to regulatory agencies regarding 
unexpected SAEs to the Investigators for review and submission to the institutional review board 
(IRB), Ethics Committee (EC) or Researc h Ethics Board (REB). The PIs  are responsible for 
informing their IRB, EC, or REB of any SAEs at their site. SAE correspondence with regulatory authorities, IRBs, ECs or REBS must be submitted to CalciMedica or its designee for filing.  
In addition, the following adverse events that are commonly observed in this patient population will not be reported to the regulatory authorit y as individual expedited reports except in unusual 
circumstances:  
• Hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndr ome 
• Oliguria and acute kidney injury 
• Hypotension and shock 
• Bacteremia 
• Pneumonia 
• Obtundation 
• Splanchnic venous thrombosis  
• Abdominal compartment syndrome 
• Gastroparesis and ileus  
• Local complications of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissue 
• Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
• Abdominal surgery including but not limited to cholecystectomy, pancreatic 
necrosectomy, and placement of pancreatic drains

50 9.8 Suspected Pregnancy in a Woman of Childbearing Potential  
A female patient  of childbearing potential is a female who is not surgically sterile (no history of 
a bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal for at least 1 year. 
A female patient  of childbearing potential who receives CM4620- IE and is sexually active with a 
male partner , and a male patient who receives CM4620- IE and is sexually active with a female 
of childbearing potential, must be willing to use two highly effective methods of contraception 
(e.g., barrier methods, spermicidals, intrauterine devices, and/or hormonal contraception) for 
365 days after last dose of CM4620- IE. No contraception is required if a female patient or 
partner has undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Two of the following methods of birth control must be practiced unless a sexually active female 
patient or partner of childbearing potential has undergone a bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy: 
• Male partner has a vasectomy for at least six months duration 
• Use of an intrauterine device  
• Use of hormonal contraceptives (oral, parenteral, vaginal or transdermal) 
• Double barrier contraception with the male partner using a condom and the female  using 
a contraceptive sponge, spermicidal jelly or cream or diaphragm plus spermicidal jelly or 
cream  
The Investigator should be immediately informed if a female  patient  or partne r of childbearing 
potential suspects she is pregnant up to 365 days after last dose of CM4620- IE. If the female  
patient is receiving CM4620- IE when discovered to be pregnant, the CM4620- IE should be 
immediately discontinued. If a pregnancy is confirmed, the Investigator must immediately report 
a pregnancy and record the event using a Pregnancy Report Form. Pregnancy is not considered 
an AE but the Investigator must follow a pregnant patient or partner. The Investigator must report follow -up information rega rding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal or 
neonatal outcome. Infants resulting from such pregnancies should be assessed for normality at birth . CalciMedica or its designee may contact the Investigator to request additional information 
throughout the course of the pregnancy. 
The following pregnancy outcomes must be considered SAEs and will require additional 
reporting in the eCRF and on an SAE form: 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Stillbirth  
• Spontaneous miscarriage

IRB/EC/ REB, and if applicable the regulatory authorities, will the protocol amendments become 
effective. In cases when the protocol is amended to enhance patient safety, the amendment may be implemented but must be immediately submitted to the IRB/EC/REB and regulatory 
authorities. 
The revision number and date of the amendment will be recorded on the title page of the 
protocol.

Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
55 The PI  is responsible for informing the IRB/EC/REB of all problems involving risks to patients. 
In case of urgent safety measures, CalciMedica  or its designee will immediately notify the PIs 
and relevant regulatory authorities. 
11.9 Informed Consent 
Because the study will be conducted under a United States Investigational New Drug 
Application, informed consent that is in compliance with Title 21 of the United States Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50 will be obtained from each patient or LAR before the patient 
enters the study or before any unusual or non-routine procedure is performed. For sites outside 
the United States, the signed informed consent form will be obtained in compliance with local 
regulations, ICH E6 (1R) and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
CalciMedica  or it designee may provide to the PI  or his/her study staff an informed consent form 
template. The informed consent form must be reviewed by CalciMedica or its designee before 
the PI  or his/her study staff submits it to the IRB/EC/REB. After CalciMedica or its designee 
review the informed co nsent form, the PI  or his/her study staff will submit it to the IRB/EC/REB 
for review and approval. If the informed consent form is revised during the course of the study, CalciMedica  or its designee must agree with revisions before the PI or his/her study staff submits 
it to the IRB/EC/REB. The study staff must provide CalciMedica or its designee a copy of the revised informed consent form after IRB/EC/REB approves it. All patients or LARs  affected by 
the revision must sign the revised informed consent for m after the IRB/EC/REB approves it.  
Before enrolling in the study, each prospective patient or LAR will receive a full explanation of 
the study and review the approved informed consent form. Once the PI or designee is assured 
that the patient or LAR understands the implications of participating in the study, he/she will ask 
the patient or LAR to give consent for the patient to participate in the study by signing the 
informed consent form. 
A patient may participate in the study only after providing consent using an IRB/EC/REB 
approved informed consent form. A LAR of the patient may provide informed consent on behalf of the patient under conditions authorized by local laws and regulations. The patient or LAR 
must provide informed consent before the patient undergoes any study- specific procedures 
described in the protocol. The PI  or designee will provide a copy of the informed consent form to 
the patient and/or LAR. The process of obtaining informed consent must also be documented in the patient source documents. 
11.10  Protocol Violations and Deviations  
The PI  or designee must document any protocol deviation or violation. Reporting of protocol 
deviations and violations to the appropriate IRB/EC/REB is the responsibility of the PI and must 
follow the applicable IRB/EC/R EB guidelines.  
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
56 If there is an immediate hazard to the patient, the PI may deviate from the protocol without prior 
approval from CalciMedica or its designee and the IRB/EC/REB but must notify CalciMedica or 
its designee and IRB/EC/REB of the deviation as soon as he/she is able to do so. 
11.11  Financial Disclosure  
PIs and sub-investigators are required to provide financial disclosure information prior to starting 
the study. In addition, the PIs  and sub-investigators must provide CalciMedica or its designee 
with updated information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for 
one year following the completion of the study. 
Any PIs , sub- Investigators or study staff with a vested financial interest in the success of the 
study may not participate in the study. 
11.12  Sponsor Obligations 
CalciMedica  or designee is not financially responsible for further testing/treatment of any 
medical condition that may be detected during Screening. In addition, CalciMedica is not 
financially responsible for the treatmen t of the patient’s underlying disease.

60 Appendix 1 Definition of Organ Failure 
The definition of organ failure encompasses three organ systems, respiratory  system, renal 
system and cardiovascular system.  
For the respiratory  system , organ failure will be defined as: 
• PaO2/FiO2 ≤300, or 
• SpO 2/FiO 2 ≤315, or 
• The use of noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation 
For the renal system , in patients without known chronic kidney disease, organ failure will be 
defined as:  
• An increase in serum creatinine ≥3 00% if the baseline creatinine is known from prior to 
the hospitalization for acute pancreatitis , or  
• A serum creatinine ≥1.9 mg/dL, or 
• Urine output of <0.3 mL/kg/hour for ≥24 hours or anuria for ≥12 hours, or 
• The initiation of renal replacement therapy  
For patients with pre -existing chronic kidney disease (baseline GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), 
organ failure will be defined as:  
• An increase in serum creatinine ≥300 % if the baseline creatinine is known from prior to 
the hospitalization for acute pancreatitis, or 
• An increase of serum creatinine to a level >4.0 mg/dl, or 
• Urine output of <0.3 mL/kg/hour for ≥24 hours or anuria for ≥12 hours, or 
• The initiation of renal replacement therapy  
For the cardiovascular system , organ failure will be defined as: 
• A systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg that is not fluid responsive, or  
• The use of either vasopressor or inotropic support 
The presence of organ failure will be assessed on Days 1 -10.

66 Appendix 7 IAP/APA Summary of Recommendations 
A. Diagnosis of Acute Pancreatitis and Etiology  
1. The definition of acute pancreatitis is based on the fulfillment of 2 out of 3 of the following 
criteria: clinical (upper abdominal pain), laboratory (serum amylase or lipase >3x upper limit of normal) and/or imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasonography) criteria. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement) 
2. On admission, the etiology of acute pancreatitis should be determined using detailed 
personal (i.e. previous acute pancreatitis, known gallstone disease, alcohol intake, medication and drug intake, known hyperlipidemia, trauma, recent invasive procedures such as ERCP) and family history of pancreatic disease, physical examination, laboratory serum tests (i.e. liver enzymes, calcium, triglycerides), and imaging (i.e. right upper quadrant ultrasonography). (GRADE 1B, strong agreement)  
3. In patients considered to have idiopathic acute pancreatitis, after negative routine work -up 
for biliary etiology, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is recommended as the first step to assess for occult microlithiasis, neoplasms and chronic pancreatitis. If EUS is negativ e, 
(secretin -stimulated) MRCP is advised as a second step to identify rare morphologic 
abnormalities. CT of the abdomen should be performed. If etiology remains unidentified, especially after a second attack of idiopathic pancreatitis, genetic counseling ( not necessarily 
genetic testing) should be considered. (GRADE 2C, weak agreement)  
B. Prognostication/Prediction of Severity  
4. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is advised to predict severe acute pancreatitis at admission and persistent SIRS at 48 hours. (GRADE 2B, weak agreement) 
5. During admission, a 3-dimension approach is advised to predict outcome of acute pancreatitis combining host risk factors (e.g. age, co-morbidity, body mass index), clinical risk stratification (e.g. persistent SIR S) and monitoring response to initial therapy (e.g. persistent 
SIRS, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine). (GRADE 2B, strong agreement)  
C. Imaging  
6. The indication for initial CT assessment in acute pancreatitis can be: 1) diagnostic uncertainty, 2) confirma tion of severity based on clinical predictors of severe acute pancreatitis, 
or 3) failure to respond to conservative treatment or in the setting of clinical deterioration. Optimal timing for initial CT assessment is at least 72 -96 hours after onset of symptoms. 
(GRADE 1C, strong agreement)  
7. Follow up CT or MR in acute pancreatitis is indicated when there is a lack of clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, or especially when invasive intervention is considered. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement)  
8. It is recommended to perform multi- detector CT with thin collimation and slice thickness 
(i.e. 5mm or less), 100-150 ml of non-ionic intra- venous contrast material at a rate of 3mL/s, 
during the pancreatic and/or portal venous phase (i.e. 50-70 seconds delay). During follow up 
only a portal venous phase (monophasic) is generally sufficient. For MR, the recommendation 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
67 is to perform axial FS -T2 and FS -T1 scanning before and after intravenous gadolinium contrast 
administration. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement)  
D. Fluid  Therapy  
9. Ringer’s lactate is recommended for initial fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis. (GRADE 
1B, strong agreement) 
10a. Goal directed intravenous fluid therapy with 5-10 ml/kg/h should be used initially until 
resuscitation goals (see Q10b) are  reached. (GRADE 1B, weak agreement) 
10b. The preferred approach to assessing the response to fluid resuscitation should be based on one or more of the following: 1) non- invasive clinical targets of heart rate <120/min, mean 
arterial pressure between 65 -85 mmHg (8.7-11.3 kPa), and urinary output > 0.5e1ml/kg/h, 2) 
invasive clinical targets of stroke volume variation, and intra -thoracic blood volume 
determination, and 3) biochemical targets of hematocrit 35- 44%. (GRADE 2B, weak 
agreement)  
E. Intensive Care Management  
11. Patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and one or more of the parameters identified at admission as defined by the guidelines of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). Furthermore, patients with severe acute pancreatitis as defined by the revised Atlanta Classification (i.e. persistent organ failure) should be treated in an intensive care setting. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement)  
12. Management in, or referral to, a specialist center is necessary for patients with severe acute pancreat itis and for those who may need interventional radiologic, endoscopic, or surgical 
intervention. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement) 
13. A specialist center in the management of acute pancreatitis is defined as a high - volume 
center with up -to-date intensive care facilities including options for organ replacement therapy, 
and with daily (i.e. 7 days per week) access to interventional radiology, interventional 
endoscopy with EUS and ERCP assistance as well as surgical expertise in managing 
necrotizing pancreatitis.  Patients should be enrolled in prospective audits for quality control 
issues and into clinical trials whenever possible. (GRADE 2C, weak agreement)  
14. Early fluid resuscitation within the first 24 hours of admission for acute pancreatitis is 
associated w ith decreased rates of persistent SIRS and organ failure. (GRADE 1C, strong 
agreement)  
15. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg that is associated with new onset organ failure. (GRADE 2B, strong agreement)  
16. Medical treatment of ACS should target 1) hollow- viscera volume, 2) intra/extra vascular 
fluid and 3) abdominal wall expansion. Invasive treatment should only be used after multidisciplinary discussion in patients with a sustained intra -abdominal pressure >25mmHg 
with new onset organ failure refractory to medical therapy and nasogastric/ rectal decompression. Invasive treatment options include percutaneous catheter drainage of ascites, 
midline laparostomy, bilateral subcostal laparostomy, or subcutaneous linea alba fasciotomy. In 
CM4620- 201 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 4.0 ( December 18,  2018) Confidential  
68 case of surgical decompression, the retroperitoneal cavity and the omental bursa should be left 
intact to reduce the risk of infecting peripancreatic and pancreatic necrosis. (GRADE 2C, 
strong agreement)  
F. Preventin g Infectious Complications  
17. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of infectious 
complications in acute pancreatitis. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement)  
18. Selective gut decontamination has shown some benefits in preventing infectious complications in acute pancreatitis, but further studies are needed. (GRADE 2B, weak agreement)  
19. Probiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of infectious complications in 
acute pancreatitis. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement)  
G. N utritional Support  
20. Oral feeding in predicted mild pancreatitis can be restarted once abdominal pain is decreasing and inflammatory markers are improving. (GRADE 2B, strong agreement) 
21. Enteral tube feeding should be the primary therapy in patients wi th predicted severe acute 
pancreatitis who require nutritional support. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement) 22. Either elemental or polymeric enteral nutrition formulations can be used in acute 
pancreatitis. (GRADE 2B, strong agreement)  
23. Enteral nutrition in acute pancreatitis can be administered via either the nasojejunal or 
nasogastric route. (GRADE 2A, strong agreement) 
24. Parenteral nutrition can be administered in acute pancreatitis as second- line therapy if 
nasojejunal tube feeding is not tolerated and nutritional support is required. (GRADE 2C, 
strong agreement)  
H. Biliary Tract Management  
25. ERCP is not indicated in predicted mild biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis. (GRADE 1A, strong agreement) ERCP is probably not indicated in predicted severe biliary pancreatitis 
without cholangitis. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement) ERCP is probably indicated in biliary 
pancreatitis with common bile duct obstruction. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement) ERCP is indicated in patients with biliary pancreatitis and cholangitis. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement) 
26. Urgent ERCP (<24 hrs) is required in patients with acute cholangitis. Currently, there is no 
evidence regarding the optimal timing of ERCP in patients with biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis.(GRADE 2C, strong agre ement)  
27. MRCP and EUS may prevent a proportion of ERCPs that would otherwise be performed for suspected common bile duct stones in patients with biliary pancreatitis who do not have cholangitis, without influencing the clinical course. EUS is superior to MRCP in excluding the presence of small (<5mm) gallstones. MRCP is less invasive, less operator -dependent and 
probably more widely available than EUS. Therefore, in clinical practice there is no clear 
superiority for either MRCP or EUS. (GRADE 2C,  strong agreement)

69 I. Indications for Intervention in Necrotizing Pancreatitis  
28. Common indications for intervention (either radiological, endoscopical or surgical) in 
necrotizing pancreatitis are: 1) Clinical suspicion of, or documented infected necrotizing pancreatitis with clinical deterioration, preferably when the necrosis has become walled -off, 2) 
In the absence of documented infected necrotizing pancreatitis, ongoing organ failure for several weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis, preferably when the necrosis has become walled -off. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement) 
29. Routine percutaneous fine needle aspiration of peripancreatic collections to detect bacteria is not indicated, because clinical signs (i.e. persistent fever, increasing inflammatory markers ) 
and imaging signs (i.e. gas in peripancreatic collections) are accurate predictors of infected necrosis in the majority of patients. Although the diagnosis of infection can be confirmed by fine needle aspiration (FNA), there is a risk of false -negative r esults. (GRADE 1C, strong 
agreement)  
30. Indications for intervention (either radiological, endoscopical or surgical) in sterile necrotizing pancreatitis are: 1) Ongoing gastric outlet, intestinal, or biliary obstruction due to mass effect of walled -off ne crosis (i.e. arbitrarily >4 -8 weeks after onset of acute pancreatitis), 
2) Persistent symptoms (e.g.  pain, ‘persistent unwellness’) in patients with walled -off necrosis 
without signs of infection (i.e. arbitrarily >8 weeks after onset of acute pancreatitis), 3) Disconnected duct syndrome (i.e. full transection of the pancreatic duct in the presence of pancreatic necrosis) with persisting symptomatic (e.g. pain, obstruction) collection(s) with necrosis without signs of infections (i.e. arbitrarily >8 weeks after onset of acute pancreatitis). 
(GRADE 2C, strong agreement)  
J. Timing of Intervention in Necrotizing Pancreatitis  
31. For patients with proven or suspected infected necrotizing pancreatitis, invasive intervention (i.e. percutaneous catheter drainage, endoscopic transluminal 
drainage/necrosectomy, minimally invasive or open necrosectomy) should be delayed where possible until at least 4 weeks after initial presentation to allow the collection to become ‘walled -off’. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement) 
32. The best available evidence suggests that surgical necrosectomy should ideally be delayed until collections have become walled -off, typically 4 weeks after the onset of pancreatitis, in all 
patients with complications of necrosis. No subgroups have been identi fied that might benefit 
from earlier or delayed intervention. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement)  
I. Intervention Strategies in Necrotizing Pancreatitis  
33. The optimal interventional strategy for patients with suspected or confirmed infected necrotizing pancrea titis is initial image -guided percutaneous (retroperitoneal) catheter drainage 
or endoscopic transluminal drainage, followed, if necessary, by endoscopic or surgical necrosectomy. (GRADE 1A, strong agreement) 
34. Percutaneous catheter or endoscopic transmu ral drainage should be the first step in the 
treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed (walled -off) infected necrotizing pancreatitis. 
(GRADE 1A, strong agreement)

70 35. There are insufficient data to define subgroups of patients with suspected or confirmed 
infected necrotizing pancreatitis who would benefit from a different treatment strategy. 
(GRADE 2C, strong agreement)  
J. Timing of Cholecystectomy (or Endoscopic S phincterotomy)  
36. Cholecystectomy during index admission for mild biliary pancreatitis appears safe and is recommended. Interval cholecystectomy after mild biliary pancreatitis is associated with a substantial risk of readmission for recurrent biliary events, especially recurrent biliary pancreatitis. (GRADE 1C, strong agreement)  
37. Cholecystectomy should be delayed in patients with peripancreatic collections until the collections either resolve or if they persist beyond 6 weeks, at which time cholecystectomy can be performed safely. (GRADE 2C, strong agreement) 
38. In patients with biliary pancreatitis who have undergone sphincterotomy and are fit for surgery, cholecystectomy is advised, because ERCP and sphincterotomy prevent recurrence of biliary pancre atitis but not gallstone related gallbladder disease, i.e. biliary colic and 
cholecystitis. (GRADE 2B, strong agreement)
